ADJUSTED MEASURES
Throughout this document we report in US Dollars as the majority of our  
transactions are currently carried out in this currency. Where reported they are 
translated at $1.53/£ (2014, $1.65) – the average exchange rate throughout the year.
The business uses the adjusted measures of underlying operating profit,  
profit before tax and earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide  
a more consistent measure of operating performance. We now have an excellent platform from 
which to develop our business and create 
long-term value for our shareholders.
BOARD CHANGES 
In my Chairman’s statement last year,            
I emphasised the importance of building 
a strong and collaborative Board that can 
provide the leadership and experience to 
help oversee Laird’s next phase of growth.
During 2015, there were four new 
appointments announced to the 
Laird Board:
• Mike Parker joined us as Senior 
Independent Director in March. Mike is a 
former CEO of Dow Chemical and British 
Nuclear Fuels and has wide experience as 
a Non-Executive Director on the boards 
of several substantial companies;
• Tony Quinlan joined us as CFO in July. 
He is a former CFO of Drax and has 
served at a senior level in Marks & Spencer;
• Kjersti Wiklund, a Norwegian national, 
joined us as Non-Executive Director 
in July. Kjersti is a senior executive at 
Vodafone and has lived and worked in 
both Eastern Europe and Asia. She adds 
significant technical and international 
expertise to our Board;
• Nathalie Rachou, a French national with 
extensive international financial and M&A 
experience, joined us on 1 January 2016. 
Nathalie is a Non-Executive Director of 
Société Générale where she chairs the 
Risk Committee, Veolia Environnement 
and Altran Technologies.
2015 has been another good year for Laird 
and one in which we have continued to 
deliver against our three core principles of 
innovation, reliable fulfilment and speed.
During the year we:
• widened our range of offerings. 
In particular, the acquisition of LS 
Research and post year-end acquisition 
of Novero mean that our fast-growing 
wireless internet and telematics 
businesses will now be of similar scale to  
our Performance Materials business;
• made further progress in diversifying  
our customer base. This has reduced our 
reliance on any one customer;
• developed a plan to streamline our 
business to become a more effective 
partner for our customers and deliver 
efficiency savings. The benefits from the 
plan we announced in October 2015 will 
be significant from 2017 onwards;
• continued strengthening the executive 
management and Board of the Company 
in line with our ambitions.

02 Laird’s cultural transformation over the 
past three years has delivered a ‘One Laird’ 
approach in all aspects of the business. 
The exchange of ideas and sharing of 
innovation are now a fundamental part 
of the way we operate. This has fostered 
collaboration between business units, 
functions and geographies, leading to new 
customer wins and improved business 
processes. I would like to thank all our 
employees for their efforts over the year.
OUTLOOK
The sustainable growth of our business 
remains a key focus. We continue to make 
strides in diversifying our customer base 
while also continuing to invest in new 
geographies and growth opportunities.
We continue to focus on delivering 
shareholder value by executing against 
this strategy. After another year of growth, 
we remain confident in the strength of 
our business.
DR MARTIN READ, CBE
CHAIRMAN
1 MARCH 2016
Given these extensive changes to the Board, 
we asked Sir Christopher Hum to stay on 
for an additional year to provide a degree of 
continuity to the Board. His many years of 
experience and insight into Laird will be of 
great benefit to us. This will mean that the 
Board will run with one extra Director until 
he retires in December 2016.
Finally, I would like to express our thanks 
to Professor Michael Kelly who retired on 
30 June 2015 and who made a valuable 
contribution to Laird over his nine years on 
the Board.
DIVIDENDS
We aim to deliver shareholder value 
through organic and inorganic growth 
and a sustainable dividend policy.
This year, the Board has proposed a 
2015 final dividend of 8.60 pence per share 
(2014, 8.23 pence), resulting in a 4% increase 
in the total full year dividend to 13.0 pence 
per share (2014, 12.5 pence). The Board’s 
expectation is to increase dividends ahead 
of inflation over time, while taking into 
account underlying profitability, the cash 
requirements of the business and potential 
investment opportunities to drive future 
growth. The final dividend will be payable 
on 6 July 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on 2 June 2016. Having assessed 
our distributable reserves we see no 
constraints in delivering our policy.
PEOPLE 
As always, our people are our most 
important asset. They are the ones who 
reflect our values, run our operations 
and ensure we maintain Laird’s good 
relationships with our stakeholders.

03 By aligning and consolidating our regional 
design, engineering, sales and distribution 
activities closer to our customers we can 
drive innovation and further improve time to 
market. This simplification of our operating 
model will allow us to focus on key activities 
that support our differentiation strategy, 
and leverage common process and 
operational scale that facilitate our growth.
We have drawn upon our extensive 
experience in setting up in new territories 
and expanding existing facilities to execute 
these changes. The programme is already 
underway which also underlines the progress 
we have made in our culture and leadership. 
As stated when we announced our plans 
in October 2015, we anticipate pre-tax 
cash costs to be up to $60m, to deliver 
this change, a significant investment in the 
Group, much of which will be treated as an 
exceptional cost. We will deliver pre-tax cash 
savings of at least $20m per annum, once 
fully implemented. We will self-fund this 
investment and there will be no impact on 
the dividend or any future acquisition plans.
DIVERSIFYING OUR CAPABILITIES AND 
CAPTURING NEW MARKETS
In November we acquired LSR, a wireless 
product design and development 
technology company based in North 
America, for £35.9m. This was successfully 
integrated into our existing M2M business 
within three months of the acquisition 
and is performing well. This acquisition 
delivers on our strategy of expanding our 
capabilities, products and services. It also 
provides us with new routes to market for 
our existing products meeting our objective 
for customer diversification.
In January 2016 we acquired Novero, 
a leading integrated vehicle connectivity 
systems provider based in Germany, for 
£47.1m. We are in the process of integrating 
Novero into our existing Telematics business. 
This acquisition enhances our offering of 
innovative wireless solutions in one of our 
DELIVERING AGAINST OUR 
GROWTH STRATEGY
When I joined Laird in 2012 we established 
clear strategic objectives in order to 
grow our business. These were focused 
on customer diversification, selective 
acquisitions and strategic differentiation 
through innovation, reliable fulfilment and 
speed. We have executed well against this 
strategy and as a result of this, 2015 has been 
another successful year with revenue up 
12% in sterling and up 5% in US Dollar  
on a constant currency basis. This represents 
an average of 7% organic revenue growth 
per annum for the last three years.
C ONNECTING STRA TEG Y AND  EXECUTION
Laird has made considerable progress in 
leadership development, culture, strategy 
and governance. We now have the clarity 
of strategy and organisational capabilities 
to tackle the last key foundation that 
underpins our business, which is why  
we announced in October that we were 
re-designing our operating model. The plan, 
to simplify our manufacturing capabilities in 
Europe and North America into our largest 
facilities, thus reducing our footprint of 
52 sites to 40 sites globally will reinforce 
our ability to deliver reliable fulfilment and 
speed, while leveraging our cost base.

04 OUTLOOK
We enter 2016 confident in our outlook 
for further growth and in our best position 
for several years. This confidence is 
underpinned by an increasingly well 
diversified mix of technologies, customers 
and end markets. Continued progress 
in Wireless Systems and better markets 
within Performance Materials is countering 
headwinds in other areas. This, coupled with 
full year contributions from the LSR and 
Novero acquisitions and the positive benefits 
of our operational improvements, supports 
our expectations for the year as a whole. 
We anticipate a progressive improvement 
in our performance during the year, with a 
steady first half performance and growth 
weighted towards the second half.

core and fastest-growing markets, the 
connected car. We are now one of the leading 
global providers of end-to-end connectivity 
services both into and within the vehicle.
Both LSR and Novero meet our strategy 
by expanding our capabilities in wireless 
connectivity, and most importantly, both 
extend our reach, presence and capabilities 
in the Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT) 
markets within the Connected Industrial  
and Connected Transport sectors.
As well as expanding our scope through 
acquisitions, we opened a new site in Brazil 
to support our expansion in South America – 
a site which is now operational and, under 
our new operating model, will serve a 
number of our businesses.
MARKETS
We have performed well across our five 
markets in 2015, capturing further market 
share in both Connected Transport and 
Mobile Devices and continuing to make 
progress with customers in Connected 
Medical. At the end of the year our business 
was well balanced with the majority of our 
revenue split across Connected Transport 
(28%), Telecom/Computing (28%) and 
Mobile Devices (21%). Connected Industry 
and Connected Medical are still relatively 
small in terms of revenue (14% in total) but 
these are newer markets for us and both 
have significant scope for growth.
CULTURE
Laird has undergone a cultural transformation 
over the past three years and ‘One Laird’  
is now a strongly embedded ethos within 
the entire organisation. This culture not only 
fosters the exchange of ideas and innovation 
that can lead to new product development 
and customer wins but it also fosters 
collaboration across functions and teams 
which means all employees have a sense of 
ownership. Our all employee share scheme 
saw take-up of more than double the 
expected levels on launch which is testament 
to their commitment to the business.

STRATEGIC DIFFERENTIATION
WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT?
CUSTOMER  
MINDSHARE
The differentiation we offer through innovation, reliable 
fulfilment and speed means that our customers know  
that they can rely on us. The confidence that customers  
have in us as innovative design partners and consultants, 
combined with our position as an essential supply chain 
supplier, sets us apart from the competition. It is this  
customer mindshare that underpins our business model.
Driving higher levels of 
customer engagement and 
fostering long-term strategic 
partnerships to define the  
future product and service  
needs help us to penetrate new 
product lines and platforms 
and thereby grow our business, 
creating long-term value for  
our shareholders.
SPEED
The speed with which we service customers, from design 
through to delivery, is highly valued by our customers.  
We ensure that our production capabilities match our 
customers’ needs so that our customers never wait for  
our components. We have the ability to create rapid 
prototypes which helps our customers accelerate their 
product development.
By delivering unparalleled 
speed and access throughout 
the customer design process 
we enable accelerated product 
launches for our customers. 
Building prototypes gives us 
valuable insight into future 
trends and design.
INNOVATION
By engaging with our customers at every stage of the 
design process, we create value by providing creative 
solutions and engineering innovation. Speed of design, 
innovation and reliable fulfilment throughout the design  
and production cycle is of primary importance for many  
of our customers. For others, it is our ability to create 
mission-critical connectivity solutions in the most 
demanding environments.
By creating innovative customer 
solutions that anticipate market 
changes we are able to provide 
our customers with a step jump 
in competitive advantage.
By ensuring high-quality 
engineering and manufacturing 
processes we are able to meet 
rapid changes in customer 
demand to keep production 
lines running.
RELIABLE  
FULFILMENT
High standards of quality engineering, precision  
manufacturing expertise and manufacturing facilities  
close to our key customers ensure that we are able  
to deliver consistent quality throughout the peaks  
of production demand, smoothly and efficiently.  
This is a capability that few of our competitors can  
match, and it underpins our well-deserved reputation  
for reliable fulfilment.

During the year we ramped up our 
new Telematics plant in Shanghai 
which has expanded our capacity 
to serve motor industry customers, 
while improving resilience, 
through designing state-of-the-art 
fire protection systems.
BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY 
RESPONSIBLE
All our manufacturing sites are deemed 
to have some form of environmental 
impact and are required to implement 
certified integrated Environmental, 
Health and Safety (EHS) risk 
management systems to ISO 14001  
and OHSAS 18001 standards.
Fourteen Laird facilities currently hold 
active Integrated Management Systems 
certification status to ISO 14001 and 
OHSAS 18001 standards; two facilities 
hold active ISO 14001 certification.  
All of these facilities successfully 
completed certification, re-certification 
or surveillance audits during the year, with 
our San Marcos facility newly certified 
to OHSAS 18001 standards in 2015.
We are always looking to reduce

PROTECTION OF OUR  
PEOPLE AND FACILITIES
We have partnered with our global 
sites insurer FM Global, world leaders 
in site risks prevention and control, 
to raise standards of protection for 
our people and sites against fire, 
natural catastrophe and other risks.
The Earth City USA facility was 
awarded ‘Highly Protected Risk’ 
(HPR) status by FM Global in 
March 2015. FM Global confers HPR 
status on a site when it has adopted 
all necessary recommendations 
and measures required to 
significantly reduce the risk of 
property loss. Our other sites with 
HPR status are: Cleveland; Holly; 
Schaumburg; Shanghai Telematics 
and San Marcos. 
TYPICAL EHS  
INITIATIVE
The Laird Shunde facility ran a 
‘2015 Year of Safety’ project aimed 
at innovation and improvement 
in all aspects of EHS, including 
machine guarding, safety 
prevention communication, 
development of a safety first 
culture and environmental 
improvements on raw materials 
and dust controls. As a result the 
site won two awards from the 
local government as a benchmark 
company for safety and 
fire prevention.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AS A PRIORITY
The safety of our people and visitors to our facilities is a paramount priority.  
In 2015 we enhanced our professional EHS skill base with the recruitment  
of a senior EHS specialist leader, based in China, to drive forward our global  
EHS strategy and performance, as the business grows and develops.
ETHICAL STANDARDS
Our Global Code of Conduct 
provides the guiding principles, 
forms the basis for how we do 
business and is underpinned by 
the common values of honesty, 
integrity and fairness. We also 
work with our customers and 
suppliers to ensure we run 
responsible and efficient 
operations end-to-end across the 
supply chain. Our suppliers are 
required to conform to ethical, 
social and environmental 
standards in line with the EICC 
Code of Conduct.

11 SUPPORTING EMPLOYEE 
DEVELOPMENT 
We place great importance on our 
company-wide performance management 
process which aligns individual objectives 
with the Company’s strategy. There is 
regular consultation between managers 
and employees to help support career 
development and reinforce the link between 
business goals, an employee’s contribution 
and his/her remuneration. 
We believe in investing in our employee 
development and offer various training 
schemes which are aligned to enhance the 
relevant skills required in each respective 
field. Our corporate training focuses on 
culture and compliance and leadership 
development, while other types of training 
fall under the specific operational areas. 
BUILDING STRONG LEADERSHIP
Strong leadership and managerial 
capabilities are central to achieving our 
business objectives and sustaining our 
success. We want to cultivate a talented 
management team which possesses the 
right leadership culture for our Company 
and proactively look to identify ambitious 
employees with the correct skills as 
future leaders. 
MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Our business principles, Global Code 
of Conduct and core company values 
have helped create a distinctive 
‘One Laird’ culture.
We recognise that we need to attract 
high-quality people while retaining the skill 
and knowledge already present to give 
us a competitive advantage in the market 
and continue to lead the way in product 
development. We do this in a number of 
ways set out in detail below.
RECOGNISING AND  
REWARDING PERFORMANCE 
We offer competitive remuneration 
packages in each of the markets within 
which we operate that are benchmarked 
against our peers. We have in place 
comprehensive performance-based 
reward systems with the aim of attracting 
and retaining the best people.

Potentially as significant as the industrial and digital  
revolutions, the Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT) is set 
to transform our lives at work, at home and on the move. 
As the world leaders in radio frequency (RF) engineering,  
we’re uniquely positioned to provide the products, solutions  
and support that will help our customers make it happen. WHAT’S THE  
OPPORTUNITY?
WE’RE WELL 
POSITIONED
The long-term growth 
potential of EIoT is huge. 
By 2025, its global worth 
could be £4tn.
Already, almost 5bn 
things are talking to each 
other. And that figure  
will rocket to 25bn in the 
next five years. We’re 
using our RF knowledge 
and technology to make 
EIoT happen, ensuring 
that our customers delight 
their customers across 
our five key markets.
Mobile devices are the hubs of the new, 
connected world. Today, there are 4.3bn 
smartphones in existence. That’s set to  
rise to 5.1bn in 2017 – equivalent to 80%  
of the world’s population. 
The functionality of phones and devices such 
as wearables increases with each generation. 
And the success of our customers depends 
on their ability to constantly innovate and 
design products that are smaller, lighter, more 
reliable and more desirable. At Laird, our 
opportunity is to use our RF knowledge and 
skills to enable our customers’ futures, helping  
them add value to their products – at speed, 
with complete confidence and backed by 
unrivalled support.

OUR MARKETS
Billions of people using billions of things, 
billions of times a day creates real 
challenges for networks and devices. 
Cell towers simply can’t deliver the 
ever-increasing bandwidth that so much 
internet activity requires, particularly 
in high-density areas such as airports 
and stadia. So our antennas expand 
bandwidth and coverage, ensuring 
uninterrupted communications in any 
conditions. In addition, the ‘always-on’ 
nature of devices creates thermal issues  
that impair connectivity. Our shielding 
solutions provide optimum temperatures, 
making sure that devices always perform  
at their best.
With a reputation for being first to prototype 
and first to manufacture, we help OEM’s  
be first to market in order to seize competitive 
advantage in a sector that will be worth 
$9bn by 2020.

4.3bn For industry, productivity is everything.  
Not only when measured by metrics such  
as volume and cost, but also in terms of 
wastage, safety and how assets are utilised. 
By 2018, there will be 7.1m machine-to-
machine connections in industry. And that 
figure is growing at a compound annual 
growth rate of 23%. Some analysts forecast 
that by 2025, companies that adopt EIoT 
will be at least 10% more profitable than 
those that don’t.
Working closely alongside customers in 
sectors such as aerospace, automotive  
and oil & gas, our technology is enabling 
industrial-strength connectivity in dense, 
complex signal and extreme environments 
– powering communications and data  
that accelerate critical workflows.
Rick Morse

Ageing populations, increasing hospital 
admissions and rising costs mean that 
healthcare services worldwide are seeking 
new approaches to efficiency. EIoT is an 
integral part of the solution, with estimates 
indicating that it will be worth $2.5tn in 
the medical sector by 2025. We’re helping 
medical OEMs realise their vision of the 
connected hospital – a world without wires 
where staff can monitor patients effectively 
across a secure network, even when those 
patients are mobile. Designed for the harshest 
of environments, our embedded Bluetooth 
modules and Wi-Fi enabled devices are 
already driving increases in productivity, 
efficiency and patient outcomes.

Imagine a world where accidents reduce 
because cars are communicating with each 
other and with road infrastructure... where 
manufacturers carry out diagnosis wirelessly 
while you’re on the move... and where truck 
and rail fleets are managed safely and 
efficiently by remote control. 
Increasingly, people expect cars to deliver the 
same connected experience as home and 
work. By 2020, we estimate that there will 
be 250m connected cars on the road, driving 
an automotive connectivity market valued 
at $38.7bn. The global leaders in shark fin 
antenna technology, we’re already helping 
many of the world’s manufacturers build 
connectivity into their vehicles. The transport 
sector is already connecting like never before 
– and the pace is only going to quicken.

Working closely with our systems integrator partners,  
we helped transform the bandwidth throughout Terminal 1  
of Taiwan’s Taoyuan International Airport. Our team’s  
extensive RF experience, core focus on telecoms and proven 
technology made us the natural partners in what is a very 
prestigious project for the airport and the country itself. 
Situated on 130 ceiling and 10 directional antennas, our 
advanced 3G/4G LTE technology is not only enabling  
travellers and airport workers to make the most of the EIoT –  
it is also at the heart of the airport authority’s ambitious 
expansion plans.
CNN business travellers ranked Taoyuan as their fourth favourite 
airport in 2015. Now the aim is to move further up the league 
tables, with telecoms performance a key factor in the drive 
to establish Taoyuan as Asia’s airport of choice.

Our LSR business is helping to bring new sensations to visually impaired people  
by helping them to ‘see’ their surroundings for the first time. Based on an  
intra-oral component that sits on the tongue, users report the sensation as pictures 
that are painted on the tongue with tiny bubbles.
The role of the design studio team at LSR was to work with Wicab Inc to create a look 
and feel that would deliver a positive user experience for the company’s BrainPort® 
device. Our input was critical to the ergonomics, industrial design and mechanical 
engineering of the headset as well as the intra-oral device. Drawing on our extensive 
experience with human factor design and new product development – everything 
from razors and baby strollers to treadmills – we have helped create a product that  
is both user friendly and discreet.

Car theft is a huge and growing problem in Brazil. In 2012, the nation had the  
highest car theft rate among 34 countries, with 140 of every 10,000 vehicles stolen*. 
Quanta is a leader in the development and manufacture of tracking devices –  
and our LT-100 tracker was the perfect choice because its high level of reliability  
enables finance companies to locate the vehicle at all times. Easy to install,  
unobtrusive and requiring no input from the driver, the LT-100 is a completely  
stand-alone product housed in a compact plastic enclosure. 
However, in this instance the customer requirements extended beyond a  
high-performance solution. Quanta prefers to partner only with local suppliers, so our 
strategic decision to bring our engineering and production closer to our telematics 
customers in Brazil was extremely timely. We have now built a brand new state-of-the-
art engineering, design and manufacturing facility outside São Paulo – and are looking 
forward to playing our part in helping to recover stolen cars across Brazil.

because they can’t afford computer technology.
Our Model Solution business is helping to transform lives 
by supporting Endless Computer in its mission to provide 
affordable personal computers to people in the developing 
world. The key challenge faced by Endless was how to 
persuade investors to buy into something that was just  
an idea. 
In only seven days, we built a working model based on a 
refined 3D CAD model and working printed circuit board 
assembly provided by Endless. This was used to showcase 
the company’s concept to potential investors – and led 
to Endless receiving more than $176,538 in funding in 
just one month. Backed by our skills and supported by 
new funding, Endless is now able to transform the lives of 
countless people, worldwide.

Our connected medical value proposition has gained  
support from a range of healthcare customers and we have 
played a key role in the development of wireless infusion 
pumps. Building on this track record, we worked with  
a leading healthcare supplier to incorporate our wireless 
platform in new areas including patient monitors and  
high-tech hospital beds. 
With our technology acting as a conduit, these devices send 
data on critically important functions direct to the hospital 
communications infrastructure – securely and with total 
reliability, even when patients roam around the hospital. 
Heartbeat, blood pressure and other critical functions from 
patient monitors... temperature, weight, moisture levels and 
other patient data from beds... all this information and more  
is instantly available to staff, without wires.
For hospitals, access to accurate and real-time data can 
lead to an improvement in decision making and lower costs, 
because our proven technology removes the need  
to overlay several different wireless networks to ensure 100% 
connectivity.
For patients, the outcome is greater safety, improved 
treatment and the knowledge that our secure network is 
protecting their data at all times.

Our Essentials of Leadership programme 
focuses on self-awareness, leading diversity, 
coaching others and driving a collaborative 
culture. Starting with the leadership team, 
including the Chief Executive, this course 
has now been cascaded down through our 
management team. 
RETAINING TALENT
The continued automation in our factories

work environment for our employees. 
CREATING A DIVERSE WORKPLACE 
Creating an equal, fair and diverse 
workplace has always been a priority 
for Laird. We believe that a balanced 
workforce will ultimately help us achieve 
our strategic goals.
For us diversity comprises differences 
in ethnicity, language, gender, age, 
religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, 
experience and education. We operate 
an Equal Opportunities and Human 
Rights policy and consider this to be our 
commitment to our employees feeling 
respected, valued and able to fulfil their 
potential. It is our policy to recruit the most 
capable person available for each position 
and applicants are selected solely on the 
basis of their qualifications and suitability 
for the role.
As detailed in the Nomination Committee 
section of the Corporate governance 
report, it is the Company’s aim to have 
the appropriate level of diversity to reflect 
the diverse nature of the Company’s 
operations. This includes gender diversity; 
the following outlines the gender profile of 
the organisation. There are three female 
Directors on the Board of Directors as 
shown on pages 36 and 37.

15 ETHICS
We have an unwavering commitment to high 
standards of business ethics. We apply these 
standards to all dealings with employees, 
customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. 
We place a high priority on compliance with 
all legislative and regulatory requirements 
and on the maintenance of high ethical 
standards, within each of the territories and 
jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. 
Our Global Code of Conduct (the Code) 
provides the guiding principles and forms 
the basis for how we do business and is 
underpinned by the common values of 
honesty, integrity and fairness. The Code, 
which is available on our website and reviewed 
annually, provides the framework for our 
policies, processes and procedures relating 
to human rights, equal opportunity, ethics, 
compliance, anti-harassment, conflicts of 
interest and regulatory compliance. 
Our global Ethics Hotline provides a 
confidential way for employees to raise 
concerns about inappropriate behaviour 
anonymously. The hotline utilises an 
independent telephone and internet 
provider, offering support in local 
languages and has an internal escalation 
and resolution process.
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) and 
recognises that behaving ethically, working 
safely, reducing our environmental impact, 
attracting, recognising and rewarding our 
people and contributing to our communities 
creates and sustains long-term value for our 
shareholders and our wider stakeholders.
We work with our customers, suppliers 
and employees to determine the issues 
that are material to our business by a 
continuous process of review, consultation 
and assessment. 
We look to mitigate risks and improve our 
operating efficiencies by being a responsible 
organisation. The outputs of embedding 
our corporate social responsibility ethos 
throughout our business are fourfold: 
sustained growth, lower environmental 
impact, stronger communities and, 
ultimately, robust stakeholder relationships. 
FTSE4GOOD
We have been a member of the FTSE4Good 
Index Series since 2004 with an overall 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
rating of 3 out of 5. This index has been 
designed to objectively measure the 
performance of companies that meet 
globally recognised corporate responsibility 
standards. Our stakeholders can use this 
index to make investment decisions, as a 
benchmarking tool or purely for research 
purposes. We can also use this as a reference 
by which we can assess the progress and 
achievement of our evolving corporate social 
responsibility programme. The FTSE4Good 
inclusion criteria are updated on a regular 
basis and continuous improvement is 
required to merit ongoing inclusion in the 
index which is reviewed semi-annually in 
March and September. The criteria are also 
regularly assessed by Ethical Investment 
Research Services (EIRIS), an independent 
research organisation.

which are detailed left and on page 19. 
SUPPLY CHAIN 
Management of CSR with suppliers 
Our aim is to procure the best value goods 
and services from suppliers that meet our 
standards and deliver the services that 
our customers demand. We expect our 
suppliers to comply with all appropriate 
legislation and conform to high ethical, 
social and environmental standards in line 
with the EICC Code of Conduct, including 
the highest standards for health and safety 
and compliance with ethical prohibitions 
including the use of conflict minerals, child 
labour and regarding anti-slavery.
We have a robust procedure for supplier 
selection and qualification which includes 
a requirement for suppliers to sign up to 
our Supply Chain Code of Conduct, which 
cascades our Code of Conduct values 
throughout our supply chain. We review 
our suppliers quarterly through our periodic 
supplier evaluation tool which uses a quality 
score together with an evaluation report to 
monitor performance.

Finance and Administration.
During the year we launched a new 
initiative in China to encourage women 
within Laird to consider more senior 
roles. Through “Sunshine Women”, 
senior women hold on-site sessions 
with female production and office 
workers,  sharing their experiences, their 
journeys into leadership, and passing 
on tips on how women can progress 
into leadership roles within male-
dominated industries. 
The first program was held at 
the Performance Materials site in 
Shanghai, Xinzhuang, with over 100 
female production and office workers 
attending a 90-minute session with 
three of our senior female leaders. 
As the program was met with great 
enthusiasm, we have since rolled out the 
initiative to other major sites in China 
and will expand the program to other 
countries and regions in 2016, spreading 
the word that women can access top 
leadership roles at Laird.

17 CARBON EMISSIONS – CARBON 
DISCLOSURE PROJECT
In order to continue building good 
relationships with our customers and 
suppliers, we strive to be as transparent 
as possible. We participate in the annual 
Information Request by the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) to demonstrate 
the steps we are taking to improve energy 
efficiency and resource use across our 
operations and through our supply chain. 
Our 2015 submission received the highest 
score we have received to date and it 
continues to improve year-on-year. In 2015 
Laird PLC achieved a disclosure score of ‘91’, 
performance band ‘C’; (‘87’, performance 
band ‘C’ in 2014). Average disclosure 
scoring for our industry is ‘83’, performance 
band ‘C’. 
Laird PLC had its Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
emissions tracking processes reviewed by 
an independent specialist provider for the 
first time in 2015, which contributed to the 
improvement in the CDP disclosure score. 
It is intended to seek independent review of 
these processes every two to three years.
CO 2 emissions
GHG emissions were derived using an 
emissions calculator within the EICC Carbon 
Reporting System tool that converts actual 
site-level energy usage data into tonnes 
CO 2 equivalent (CO 2e) direct and indirect 
emissions. The emissions calculator is 
consistent with GHG Protocol and the best 
available public emissions factors from 
sources that include the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Control (IPCC), the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) and 
the United States Department of Energy 
(US DOE).
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Specific CSR programmes:
• Conflict Minerals
• Anti-Slavery 
• Human Rights declarations etc
• Supply Chain Code of Conduct
• Anti-bribery and corruption
• Environmental compliance to ISO  
and OHSAS standards
All our manufacturing sites which are deemed 
to have some form of environmental impact 
are required to implement certified 
integrated management systems to ISO 14001 
and OHSAS 18001 standards.
CHARITIES AND COMMUNITIES
We believe that maintaining a good 
relationship between our business and 
the broader society in which we operate 
is fundamental to long-term business 
growth. To this end, our sites develop local 
community and schools support projects, 
with commitment of staff time to support 
the projects and donation of suitable 
redundant assets as well as drawing on a 
charities budget which is agreed each year 
by the Board of Laird PLC. During the year, 
cash charitable donations totalled  
£34,366 (2014, £26,925).
Measuring our progress

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
18 Throughout 2015 we monitored energy 
usage and carbon emissions in our largest 
seven sites which account for more than 
80% of our scope 1 and scope 2 CO 2 
emissions. Total GHG at these sites in 2015 
were 43948 tonnes CO 2, approximately 
5.6% above 2014 levels (41,582 tonnes CO 2). 
The majority of the increase is attributed to 
the opening and operation of the expanded 
new Telematics facility in Shanghai. 
Tonnes of CO 2 equivalent
Scope 1 4.8%
Scope 2 95.2%
Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions 
from sources that are owned or controlled  
by the entity such as fossil fuels burned  
on site and other direct sources. Scope 2 
emissions are indirect GHG emissions 
resulting from the generation of electricity, 
heating and cooling or steam generated  
off site but purchased by the entity.
WASTE MANAGEMENT
We have an ongoing programme to 
examine how we can further minimise  
the generation of waste in order to protect 
the environment and reduce costs. 
There was a reduction in waste to landfill 
(tonnes) generation in 2015 at 664 tonnes 
(2014, 668 tonnes). The overall activity  
ratio of waste to landfill per £1m of sales  
in 2015 1.05 tonnes (1.20 in 2014). 
WATER USAGE
In 2015 we continued to monitor and 
measure water usage at Laird locations, 
with total usage of 428.409 cubic metres 
(450.115 in 2014).

CASE STUDY
Encouraging a more 
inclusive approach
In 2015, we again helped fund a student 
placement at DEMAND: Design and 
Manufacture for Disability – a charity 
dedicated to solving the challenges 
that people with disability face every 
day. DEMAND’s student placement 
scheme aims to positively influence the 
design thinking of tomorrow, giving 
young designers hands-on experience 
of solving real problems for people with 
disability, and encouraging them to buy 
into a more inclusive design philosophy. 
These are the thoughts of Hollie, 
a work placement student from 
Brunel University:
“I’ve always been interested in inclusive 
design, so when I was looking for a work 
placement, the opportunity at DEMAND 
was too good pass up. At DEMAND 
I’ve worked on a garden tool holder 
to help a lady in an electric wheelchair 
enjoy her garden, a camera mount 
to help an individual in a wheelchair 
hold his camera steady, and a variety 
of modifications to walking frames. 
However, the most rewarding project 
was a hooded rocking chair intended 
to provide a calm space for autistic 
school students. I’ve been involved in 
the project from assessment to delivery 
– and being able to see the pupils 
enjoying it was the most fantastic part 
of all.”

25 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REPORT CONTINUED
STATUTORY LOSS/PROFIT
Profit before tax from continuing operations 
was £15.4m (2014, £48.1m). The decrease 
reflects an exceptional charge to the P&L of 
£45.0m, offset by the increase in underlying 
profit before tax of £9.9m. In 2015, there 
was a statutory loss after tax of £7.6m, 
compared to a profit after tax of £50.2m in 
2014 (a reduction of £57.8m). Along with the 
movement in PBT, the tax charge in 2015 is 
also £25.1m greater than in 2014 at £23.0m. 
It includes £8.3m in respect of exceptional 
items. The 2014 tax charge includes an 
exceptional deferred tax credit of £20.1m, as 
a result of the recognition of US tax losses.
UNDERLYING PROFIT AND TAXATION
Underlying profit before tax in the year was 
£73.1m (2014, £63.2m). Underlying profit is 
defined as profit before tax, exceptional items, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
goodwill and US capitalized development 
costs, the gain or loss on sale of businesses 
and the impact arising from the fair valuing 
of financial instruments. The deferred tax 
impact of short-term losses and current tax 
on the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets and goodwill are also included in 
the calculation of underlying tax.
The underlying tax charge on total underlying 
profit before tax is equivalent to an average tax 
rate of 18.2% (2014, 18.4%). Profits in the USA 
continue to be sheltered by amortised goodwill 
deductions resulting from acquisitions. Laird’s 
tax payable largely arises in China, Czech 
Republic, Germany, Korea and Malaysia. 
During the year, Laird announced a redesign 
of its operating model. The exceptional tax 
impact of these proposals has resulted in a 
current tax charge of £8.3m. An analysis of 
the total tax charge is given in note 11 of the 
financial statements.
TAX STRATEGY
Laird operates with integrity in all tax matters, 
taking into account the needs of all relevant 
stakeholders. We will operate an effective tax 
control framework to ensure compliance with all 
relevant legislative and regulatory requirements, 
while maximising shareholder value in line 
with our stated commercial strategy.
The commercial strategy of the business 
is supported by tax aware, commercial 
decisions that are made in a timely manner. 
They provide a sustainable operating 
platform to the Group’s commercial activities 
and are designed to ensure that the Group’s 
tax obligations are consistently met whilst 
maintaining Laird’s reputation for innovation.
UNCERTAINTIES RELATING 
TO TAX LIABILITIES
The global nature of the Group’s operations 
and the presence of cross-border transactions 
present a complex tax environment with less 
certainty over the tax treatment of certain 
items. Laird engages with the relevant tax 
authorities to achieve certainty over the tax 
treatment but where this is not possible, or 
when dialogue is ongoing, a tax provision 
for uncertainty is sometimes needed. As  
the items in question can be complex and 
highly judgmental when assessing the need 
for, and the quantum of these provisions, 
Laird considers the status of tax audits, the 
outcome of previous similar claims, changes 
in tax law and the tax environment. Refer to 
note 2 for further information. 
FUTURE TAX CHARGE
It is expected that the underlying tax charge 
in 2016 will be in the range of 18% to 20%, 
subject to any unexpected changes to tax 
rates in the countries in which we operate.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
There was an exceptional charge of £45.0m 
in 2015, of which £39.0m is related to 
redesigning the Laird Operating Model, as 
announced in October 2015. £30.8m is cash 
related and will be paid out in 2016, £8.2m 
relates to asset write downs.
In 2014, there was a net exceptional credit of 
£0.7m in the year. There was an exceptional 
credit of £5.4m in respect of the Nextreme 
development project. This arose largely from 
the reassessment of the potential earn out 
provision, which was no longer required due to 
business performance. This was offset in part 
by a £3.6m provision for patents litigation costs 
and in part by acquisition transaction costs.

27 NET BORROWINGS AND DEBT 
FACILITIES
Net borrowings were £200.0m 
(2014: £159.5m). A cornerstone of our 
financial planning is to ensure that it 
maintains committed loan finance which 
provides sufficient headroom above 
expected borrowing requirements and has 
a significant proportion with terms that 
exceed one year. Our committed bilateral 
revolving credit facilities total £255m, and 
will not expire until 2019. In addition, we 
have total US Private Placement notes of US 
Dollar $148m and Euro €15m outstanding:

BALANCE SHEET POLICY
Our policy is to manage a conservative 
Balance Sheet gearing position, with 
appropriate levels of debt for our business 
risk. This translates to a gearing target 
of 1.5-2.0x, although we are prepared 
to have a gearing of >2.0x, where we 
have a clear path to get to <2x within 
12 months. This would typically be to 
fund an acquisition.
DIVIDEND POLICY
We have a progressive dividend policy, 
where we seek to grow the dividend above 
the rate of inflation but below the rate of 
earnings (EPS) growth. Thus, over time, we 
aim to bring dividend cover to >2.0x in the 
medium term. 
TREASURY POLICIES
Laird has a centralised Treasury function, 
the objectives of which are to monitor and 
manage the financial risks of the Group 
and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is 
available to meet the requirements of the 
business. Group Treasury is not intended 
to be a profit centre and operates within 
a framework of policies and procedures.
Laird’s Treasury uses derivative financial 
instruments to assist in the management 
of foreign exchange and interest rate 
risk, principally forward foreign exchange 
contracts and interest rate swaps. All hedging 
is carried out centrally and speculative 
trading is specifically prohibited by Group 
Treasury policy.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Laird is exposed to interest rate risk as 
it holds borrowings on both a fixed and 
floating basis. Our policy for this risk is to 
optimise the mix of fixed and floating rate 
borrowings using interest rate swaps and 
forward rate agreements to manage  
Laird’s finance costs.
CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY RISK
Our policy on counterparty risk management 
is to place cash deposits and other financial 
instruments with its relationship banks, 
all of which also provide credit facilities to 
Laird. The level of exposure to each bank is 
continually monitored. As at 31 December 
2015, all cash and short-term deposits had a 
maturity of less than three months.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT
We aim to minimise its exposures to 
US Dollar transactional currency exposures 
by matching local currency income with 
local currency costs. Laird aims to forward 
cover at least 75% of the unmatched cash 
flows on a quarterly basis. Foreign currency 
borrowings are used partially to hedge the 
currencies of the Group’s principal assets 
and cash flows. Where foreign currency 
borrowings are in the same currency as 
investment in overseas assets they are 
treated as a hedge of the net investment.

LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
28 COVENANTS
A key consideration for financial planning is 
to maintain sufficient headroom between 
borrowings and the ceiling set by the 
covenants. Our bank facilities and US 
Private Placement loan notes contain two 
principal financial covenants; net debt/
EBITDA (earnings before exceptional items, 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), 
and interest cover. For the year ended 
31 December 2015, net borrowings were 1.7x 
EBITDA, 51% of the maximum permitted 
of 3.5x. Interest cover was 11.4x against 
the minimum requirement of 3.0x. Thus, 
there was considerable financial headroom. 
The expected headroom is routinely 
estimated against the covenants and 
the sensitivity to a number of alternative 
scenarios is tested to ensure ongoing 
compliance. The Group does not anticipate 
approaching its covenant limits in the 
foreseeable future.
CURRENCIES IN 2015
Local currency exposures are balanced 
where possible but the Group operates 
a global business and this creates 
currency imbalances where operating and 
procurement costs may not be able to be 
matched with revenues in local currencies.
In 2015, over 70% of revenues were 
negotiated in US Dollar. With under 50% of 
the cost base in US Dollar, there was a large 
US Dollar surplus. Over 10% of revenues 
were negotiated in Renminbi and just below 
10% in Euros. In most currencies (other 
than US Dollar and Euro), costs exceed 
revenues, the most significant being the 
Renminbi (RMB) which accounts for over 
30% of our cost base. This imbalance can 
lead to an adverse impact, in so far as the 
strengthening of the RMB may not be fully 
recovered in US Dollar selling prices.
In addition, there is a translation impact 
in converting profits into the Group’s 
reporting currency (Sterling); each US$0.01 
appreciation against Sterling approximates 
to an annual increase in operating profit of 
£0.44m. In 2015, on average through the 
year the US Dollar was stronger against 
Sterling than in 2014 and this increased 
underlying profit before tax on translation 
by £5.3m. However, the true economic 
impact of currency movements is much 
more complex than this, as currency 
considerations are factored into commercial 
negotiations by all supply chain participants 
on an on-going basis.
The majority of the Group’s assets are held 
overseas and these are hedged in part by 
foreign currency loans. 
PENSIONS
There are approximately 300 employees 
who are active members of defined benefit 
plans and approximately 1,400 deferred 
and current pensioners. There is an overall 
defined benefit pension scheme surplus 
under IAS 19 (Revised 2011) of £1.4m at 
31 December 2015 (2014, £1.7m deficit). 
The principal driver of the year-on-year 
reduction in the deficit was a decrease in 
the scheme liabilities predominantly due to 
a decrease in forecasted salary increases 
from 4.2%-5.2% in 2014 to 3.2%-4.2% 
in 2015.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
Equity attributable to owners of the 
parent company at the 2015 year end was 
£409.5m (2014, £441.4m). The reconciliation 
is set out in the Group statement of changes 
in equity.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED
Return on capital employed (underlying 
profit before interest and tax as a 
proportion of average shareholders’ funds 
plus net borrowings during the year) was 
12.4% in 2015, compared with 12.7% in 2014.

29 Oversight of the Laird risk governance 
process rests with Risk Governance Group 
(RGG), which is chaired by the CEO and 
comprises all ‘C Suite’ Executive Team 
members. The group meets at least four 
times annually and reviews a Risk Incident 
Dashboard as well as changes to the 
wider risk environment and movement 
in the assessment of Laird’s principal 
risks. The RGG, chaired by the CEO, 
oversees major risk programmes and 
management assurance on non-financial 
controls, review of management of major 
risk incidents, as well as conducting 
risk reviews for major events such as 
an acquisition. The RGG’s governance 
responsibilities for operational and strategic 
risk complements the well-established role 
of the Audit Committee with oversight of 
financial controls risk. Interaction between 
the responsibilities of the RGG and the 
Audit Committee is summarised in the 
diagram below. The risk management 
and governance process is reviewed 
annually as part of the External Audit.
Risk review processes and control 
mechanisms are embedded into the 
relevant ‘day-job’ management framework 
with the aim of managing rather than 
eliminating risk in accordance with the 
Board’s risk appetite in relation to strategy 
and delivery of objectives. The Chief 
Risk and Assurance Officer is a member 
of the Executive Team and supports 
his executive colleagues in managing the 
risk/opportunity balance in the day-to-day 
management of the business. The Board 
conducts a full annual review to confirm 
that the effectiveness of the risk and 
controls framework is satisfactory, that 
the arrangements for monitoring the risk 
environment and framework in the year 
are acceptable and that they agree the 
specific principal risks and are satisfied 
with their management through the 
related specific controls, monitors and 
assurance mechanisms. Changes to the 
risk environment and management of 
specific risk incidents are reported to 
every Board meeting.

30 VIABILITY STATEMENT – RISK TESTING
Scenario testing of principal risks as part 
of the process to underpin the Viability 
Statement in the Directors’ Report for 
2015, see page 81, has been conducted. 
The process uses the impairment principles 
(cash headroom and asset impairment 
sensitivity) used for the ‘Going Concern’ 
statement, but over the three year horizon 
of the Strategic Plan. 
A methodology which focused on the 
speed-to-impact and potential for cash 
impairment was used to assess all principal 
risks in order to identify relevant key risk 
scenarios which could impact viability. 
This methodology targeted our testing 
at six relevant key risk scenarios from four 
relevant risks from the current risk register. 
The key risk scenarios tested were:
COMPETITION AND 
MARKET CONDITIONS 
• Loss of a top five customer;
OPERATIONAL CONTINUITY 
• Business interruption scenarios resulting 
from the complete loss of a critical site, 
or from the loss of a sole-source supplier;
ACQUISITIONS 
• The impact from two separate acquisition 
risk scenarios; and
PRODUCT RISKS 
• A product risk scenario (critical 
product failure).
An additional situation, where two key risk 
incidents occur in the same year, was also 
tested. The scenario testing incorporated 
realistic assumptions based on our risk 
processes and experience of real incidents. 
Our risk assessment further took account of 
mitigating actions which are planned in our 
risk management processes to avoid or 
reduce the impact or occurrence of the 
underlying risks.
The key risk scenario testing conducted has 
endorsed management confidence in 
continuing viability from a risk perspective 
over the three year strategic plan horizon 
and underpins the Board viability 
assessment and statement in the Directors’ 
Report, page 81.
RISK MANAGEMENT CASE STUDY
Catastrophic explosion  
at Tianjin docks
Incident:
At 11.34pm on 12 August 2015 the 
leading China port of Tianjin suffered 
from a fire and two major explosions, 
the worst of which equated to the 
concurrent ignition of 24 tons of TNT. 
Laird was impacted directly. 
Action:
Our major Tianjin manufacturing 
facility is sited 2.9km from the blast 
which occurred during a night shift. 
On hearing the first explosion which 
only caused minor damage to the 
facility, the night shift team immediately 
followed their evacuation procedures 
and vacated the plant to their safety 
muster points within 29 seconds. 
Two seconds later the major blast 
occurred causing major damage to the 
site with widespread flying debris and 
internal fixture and ceiling collapses 
within the buildings. As a result of their 
benchmark evacuation procedures, 
none of our staff suffered injury, nor 
were any injured during the challenging 
process of recovering the damaged 
site over the next three or so weeks, 
which was achieved largely through 
the leadership of our teams as the 
widespread devastation in Tianjin  
made external contractors unavailable. 
Continuity plans transferred key 
production lines that could not be 
rapidly recovered to an alternative 
global location, with the site 
team recovering most operations 
within two weeks and full effective 
capacity in a number of days. 
Our people, local leadership and 
business interruption risk management 
processes ensured that no customer 
was materially impacted by this 
catastrophic full-site interruption event.

STRATEGIC AND 
MARKETS
Competition and  
market conditions
Laird operates in market sectors which are characterised by a high 
level of competition between suppliers and which are driven by rapid 
technological change. Changes in market dynamics could have a 
material adverse effect on Laird’s financial condition and prospects.
Laird’s competitive position may suffer were it unable to maintain 
customer mindshare in delivering technological innovation in a highly 
competitive environment. 
Laird’s products and solutions include technologies in which it holds 
intellectual property rights which may be subject to infringement, 
counterfeiting or misappropriation. Claims could be asserted against 
Laird that it has infringed intellectual property owned by others and 
such claims might require Laird to incur legal costs or face legal 
restrictions on selling certain products. 
The loss of a major contract or erosion of business with a key customer, 
whether through competitive action or any change in strategy or 
ordering requirements from customers, could have a material adverse 
effect on Laird’s financial condition and prospects.
Maturing products in large markets could lead to competitive erosion 
of margins and profits.
A highly competitive market environment and structure can drive 
pressures for imbalanced contractual terms which could lead to 
significant penalties and costs if breached.
• Protecting our position by 
maintaining and extending a broad 
customer base and monitoring the 
market to support a swift response 
to market changes
• Developing the business into new 
and attractive growth markets in line 
with strategic objectives
• Maintaining a competitive 
manufacturing base
• Differentiating Laird with customers 
through our focus on innovation, 
reliable fulfilment and speed to 
achieve customer mindshare, 
and where overall margin objectives 
can be maintained
• Contract review and negotiation 
through in-house legal team and 
external advisers
• Maintaining a robust intellectual 
property programme to reinforce 
defence against alleged breaches, 
proactively protect existing portfolio 
IP and growing development of 
products with a higher IP protected 
content
• Using a range of trade secrets, 
confidentiality policies, non-
disclosure and other contractual 
arrangements to protect intellectual 
property rights
• Developing the skills, experience and 
performance of employees and their 
relationships with customers
• Introducing innovative new 
products in a timely manner to meet 
customer needs 
Macro economic  
and political factors
During an economic downturn or delayed recovery, customers may 
cancel, reduce or postpone anticipated orders, or apply pressure to 
prices and margins, any of which may result in lasting changes in terms 
of trade pricing policies, delivery capabilities and market expectations.
Wider political factors including regional tensions and protectionist 
pressures may impact on operations or markets.
• Monitoring of economic and political 
indicators
• Close control and reduction of costs
• Operational contingency plans
Laird faces the normal business risks including the retention and protection 
of our people and continuity of our operations; however, the following 
summarises the principal risks which are more distinct because of our market, 
industry, strategy and global footprint.

STRATEGIC AND 
MARKETS
UK Political risk While the risk of UK exit from the European Union would have a 
limited and manageable impact in Laird’s business circumstances, 
a newly emergent risk is that developments in UK politics could lead 
to a government unfavourable to global free trade and enterprise, resulting 
in changes to regulation and taxation which destroy shareholder value.
• Monitoring of economic and  
political indicators
• If the likelihood of the risk 
crystallising rises, investigate viable 
options for re-locating the corporate 
tax domicile
Acquisitions Laird has made and is likely to make further strategic acquisitions of 
complementary businesses, assets and companies with the intention 
of accelerating growth and strengthening and developing its market. 
If such acquisitions cannot be successfully integrated and the risks 
managed, Laird’s business, financial condition and the results of its 
operations may be adversely affected.
Laird may also set up operations in new technologies, markets and/or 
geographies which could fail to meet business case expectations leading 
to lost investment or reduced profits.
• Reliance on a comprehensive, 
embedded strategic planning 
process that validates target growth 
markets and technologies
• Adherence to a robust M & A/
Integration process tailored to meet 
overall business and acquisition 
objectives
• Undertaking due diligence using 
specialist external partners
• Training and staff retention 
measures for qualified engineers 
or other technically qualified 
personnel and proactive relationship 
management with customers
• Obtaining warranties and 
indemnities from vendors 
where possible
Brand management While the Laird brand, differentiators and values are key to the delivery 
of strategic goals, there may be associated risks where new acquisitions, 
which may have strong customer recognition, are being transitioned. 
Planned revenue could be impacted if brand loyalty is not successfully 
transferred.
Poor articulation of the Laird brand and long-term value proposition 
to stakeholders including customers and investors.
• Proactive customer communication 
and relationship management
• Robust and consistent marketing
• Brand strategy prioritisation within

OPERATIONS
China operational 
concentration
Laird faces continued pressure on Chinese labour costs, particularly 
with reference to base pay and increasing social costs. The result of 
these pressures may lead to reduced profits or other adverse effects 
on the business.
Laird may encounter difficulty in managing operations due to 
unfavourable political or economic factors or unexpected legal 
or regulatory changes. If the effects of this instability disrupt 
Laird’s operations in this region, Laird’s operating results may be 
adversely affected.
• Process improvements to increase 
productivity
• Increased automation
• Developing options for relocation 
of certain manufacturing operation 
processes to Western China and 
other areas 
• Maintaining professional 
relationships with authorities 
Supply chain and raw 
materials
Laird’s ability to deliver according to market demands largely depends on 
obtaining timely and adequate supplies of components and raw materials. 
Failure in the supply chain could interrupt Laird’s product supply, limit 
sales and increase costs. 
The raw materials used include commodities such as copper, 
beryllium copper, steel, aluminium, silver and zinc – all of which may be 
subject to price volatility. This may impact Laird’s operating profits.
• Supplier quality control, vetting and 
review
• Developing multi-supplier options 
where possible
• Supply chain business contingency 
plans
• Processes for raw material stock 
management
• Relationship management with 
key suppliers
Product risks Laird’s reputation and brand value may be adversely affected due to 
real or alleged failures in its products and solutions.
• Product and operations quality 
control processes
• Contractual controls to limit liability 
where possible
• Proactive customer relationship 
management 
Operational continuity One or more of Laird’s main factories or sites may suffer major disruption 
such as fire, flooding, pandemic, regulatory action, loss of IT systems 
following a cyber incident or similar which may have an adverse effect 
on Laird’s activities. Any of the above may prevent Laird from fully 
performing its contractual obligations, potentially resulting in reputational 
damage and lost revenue and profits.
• Risk management and recovery

demands
• Active project governance 
frameworks and executive oversight 
of key projects and collective project

(the ‘Committees’). The written Terms 
of Reference of the Committees are

Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are held separately and there 
is a clear written division of responsibility 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive, which has been agreed by 
the Board.
The Chairman is responsible for the 
leadership of the Board and ensuring 
its effectiveness. The Chief Executive is 
responsible for the day-to-day management 
of the Company and implementation of 
the strategy and policies adopted by the 
Board. The Chairman’s other significant 
commitments are detailed in his biography 
on page 36.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors constructively 
challenge and scrutinise the performance 
of management and help develop proposals 
on strategy. The letters of appointment of 
the Non-Executive Directors are available 
from the Company on request and will be 
on display at the AGM.
Senior Independent Director
Mike Parker became the Senior Independent 
Director (the ‘SID’) of the Company with 
effect from his appointment to the Board 
on 3 March 2015. Mike replaced Paula 
Bell who was SID throughout 2014 up to 
2 March 2015. 
The Corporate governance report is 
designed to provide shareholders with 
an explanation of how the Company has 
applied the main principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) 
as relevant to the Company in 2015.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Directors considered that during 
the year ended 31 December 2015, the 
Company was in compliance with the 
provisions set out in the Code. 
The Code is available from the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm.
The Role of the Board
The Board is appointed by the shareholders 
who are the owners of the Company. 
The Board’s principal responsibility is to act 
in the best interests of the shareholders, 
as required by the Companies Act 2006. 
The Board establishes the aims and 
objectives for the Company, sets the 
strategic direction and plans, and the 
operating budgets which are proposed 
by the Chief Executive, and monitors 
performance against them.
The Board is also responsible for identifying, 
evaluating and monitoring the key risks 
faced by the Company, for exercising 
proper and appropriate corporate 
governance, for establishing and ensuring 
the effectiveness of the systems of internal 
control and for reviewing management 
performance. Through the Chief Executive, 
the Board has regard to the necessary 
financial and human resources required to 
meet the Company’s objectives. 
There is a schedule of key operational 
matters reserved for Board approval.

38 The Board reviewed the membership of its 
Committees with a view to having a more 
focused approach with more specialisation. 
This was considered important given the 
growth aspirations of the Company and its 
international nature and complexity. 
The Board’s Committee Memberships with 
effect from 1 July 2015 are as follows: 
Audit Committee
Paula Bell (Chairman) 
Sir Christopher Hum (up to 
31 December 2015) 
Mike Parker 
Kjersti Wiklund
Nathalie Rachou (from 1 January 2016)
Remuneration Committee
Jack Boyer (Chairman) 
Dr Martin Read 
Mike Parker 
Sir Christopher Hum
Nomination Committee
Dr Martin Read (Chairman) 
Mike Parker (SID) 
Sir Christopher Hum
As well as being available to shareholders, 
whose concerns have not been resolved 
through normal channels or when such 
channels would be inappropriate, the SID 
provides a sounding board for the Chairman 
and serves as an intermediary for the other 
Directors, where necessary. The SID also 
has responsibility for leading the annual 
appraisal of the Chairman’s performance.
Composition of the Board
The composition of the Board, as outlined 
on pages 36 and 37, includes an appropriate 
balance of the skills and experience 
appropriate for the requirements of the 
business. Further information relating to 
appointments to the Board and the Board’s 
policy on diversity, including gender, is 
included in the Nomination Committee 
section of this report.
During 2015, Tony Quinlan joined the Board 
as Chief Financial Officer, and Mike Parker 
and Kjersti Wiklund as Non-Executive 
Directors. Nathalie Rachou was also 
appointed to the Board as Non-Executive 
Director with effect from 1 January 2016. 
Their biographical details can be found 
on pages 36 and 37. In view of the fact 
that four new Directors were appointed 
in 2015, the Board asked Sir Christopher 
Hum, whose term of appointment came 
up for renewal on 1 December 2015, to 
remain on the Board for a further year 
to maintain a degree of continuity on 
the Board. Although Sir Christopher had 
served nine years as a Director, the Board 
was satisfied, after a rigorous review, that 
he remains of independent character 
and judgement. As a consequence the 
number of Directors on the Board has 
been expanded temporarily from 1 January 
2016 until 1 December 2016. The Board 
also agreed the extension of Paula Bell’s 
term of office for a further one year term 
commencing on 2 March 2015. Jack Boyer 
has announced that he will be retiring as 
a Non-Executive Director from the Board 
after the 2016 AGM. Steps are being taken 
to find a replacement.

39 Operation of the Board
The Board and Committees have 
regular scheduled meetings and hold 
additional meetings as and when required. 
The Board meets at least eight times a 
year. A schedule of meetings and principal 
matters to be discussed is normally set out 
at least 12 months in advance. The Board 
makes periodic visits to the Company’s 
operations. During the year under 
review, the Board as a whole visited the 
Company’s facility in South Korea and the 
majority of the Non-Executive Directors 
visited the Company’s facility in Vietnam. 
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director also visited the Company’s facilities 
in Michigan and Ohio. Additionally, the 
heads of the business units and other senior 
executives holding functional responsibilities 
periodically give presentations at 
Board meetings. 
The Board held nine meetings in 2015. 
There were five Audit Committee meetings, 
four Remuneration Committee meetings 
and four Nomination Committee meetings 
during the year. Details of attendance 
at Board and Committee meetings 
are given in the table above, and are 
discussed in more detail in the separate 
Committee sections of this report. 
Directors are expected, where possible, 
to attend all Board meetings, relevant 
Committee meetings and the AGM. 
Whenever a Director is unable to attend a 
meeting, the Director, if possible, consults 
with the Chairman prior to the meeting 
and is briefed by the Chairman after 
the meeting.
Attendance at Board meetings and 
Committee meetings of the Board
There was full attendance at all meetings 
in the year except where indicated below. 
Where a Director was unable to attend, he

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
40 Time commitment
A schedule of meetings and principal 
matters to be discussed is normally set 
out at least 12 months in advance, enabling 
the Board to assess the expected time 
commitment. Furthermore, the letters of 
appointment of each Director include an 
approximate estimate of time required 
per annum to cover meeting attendance, 
preparation for meetings and overseas 
visits. The Board is satisfied that each 
Director is able to devote sufficient time 
to fulfil their duties.
Information and support
It is important that the Board should 
be supplied with information in a timely 
manner, in a form and of a quality 
appropriate to enable it to discharge its 
duties. Minutes of meetings are circulated 
to the relevant Committee members prior 
to each Committee meeting. Prior to Board 
meetings, all Directors receive Board papers 
which include detailed financial information, 
strategic reports and operational overviews. 
Directors may also take independent 
professional advice where necessary at the 
Company’s expense and have access to the 
services of the Company Secretary.
Board evaluation
An internal Board evaluation was 
completed. The performance of individual 
Directors was considered by the Chairman 
in discussion with other Non-Executive 
Directors. The Non-Executive Directors 
considered the performance of the 
Chairman, taking into account the views 
of the Executive Directors. The Chairman 
considered the performance of the 
Executive Directors which was also 
discussed with the Non-Executive Directors.
Re-election of Directors
With the exception of Jack Boyer, who will 
retire at the 2016 AGM, all of the Directors 
will stand for annual re-election at the 
AGM. Biographical details of the Directors 
are included in the Notice of AGM and on 
pages 36 and 37. Further information on 
Board changes during the year is given 
in the Nomination Committee section of 
this report and in the Directors’ Report on 
page 79.
Independence
Currently the Board comprises a 
Non-Executive Chairman, six other 
Non-Executive Directors and two Executive 
Directors. The Code requires that at least 
half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
should be independent Non-Executive 
Directors. This requirement continues to 
be met. The Board considers all of the 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent 
of management and in character and 
judgement, and are therefore free from 
any business or other relationship that 
could interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. The Chairman, 
Dr Martin Read, was considered 
independent in accordance with the Code 
prior to his appointment as Chairman.
Normally the Chairman and the Non-
Executive Directors meet at least twice 
a year without the Executive Directors 
present and the Senior Independent 
Director meets at least annually with 
the Non-Executive Directors without 
the Chairman present.
Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Company’s share 
or bonus schemes and their service is 
non-pensionable.
Induction and training
New Directors are provided with an 
induction process when they take on the 
role and existing Directors are provided 
with training as necessary. This can take 
the form of reports and briefings from 
external advisers and senior employees, 
attendance at seminars and conferences 
and bespoke training. During the year 
the Board received updates on legislative 
developments that impact Corporate 
Governance in the UK. In addition, as part 
of the Annual Performance Review, each 
Director is asked about their individual 
training needs so that this can be factored 
into forthcoming programmes.
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
41 Business units and corporate functions 
participate in an annual strategic planning 
process to set out strategic objectives and 
identify the related key risk and control 
issues and mitigating actions. This process 
provides the baseline for them to submit 
their budgets annually to management 
and to Laird’s Executive Directors for 
approval. In addition, through a risk and 
controls assessment process embedded 
in business performance review process, 
emergent risk and control issues are 
managed transparently. A risk management 
update, reporting emergent risks and 
any changes to the risk environment, is 
presented at Board meetings. This process 
is supplemented by papers submitted 
to the Board by the Executive Directors 
throughout the year and by meetings from 
time to time between the Board and the 
management of the businesses, some of 
which take place at the premises of the 
operating companies. The Chief Executive 
presents the Group’s business objectives 
which are approved by the Board, and the 
Board also addresses those risks which 
affect the Group as a whole. The Board 
instigates further reports and investigations 
as it considers necessary.
Oversight of the management of risk and 
governance is effected through the Risk and 
Governance Group (the ‘RGG’). The RGG is 
chaired by the Chief Executive and includes 
the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk 
Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, 
the Chief Strategy & Technology Officer and 
the General Counsel & Company Secretary. 
Meetings are usually held at least quarterly 
with additional ad-hoc meetings for specific 
risk issues or projects as required. In 2015, 
the RGG met six times, including two ad-
hoc meetings to review risk management 
plans for two acquisitions, namely LSR 
Research LLC and the Novero business. 
Outcomes, actions and issues from all 
meetings are reported to the Board as 
part of the Chief Financial Officer’s report 
at each meeting. Minutes of the RGG are 
circulated to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
Information on the Remuneration 
Committee is included in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Internal control
Laird PLC is a holding company registered 
in the UK with businesses primarily 
located overseas. These businesses are 
organised as subsidiary companies where 
the management of these companies are 
appointed to manage within the framework 
established by the Laird Board, as well as to 
comply with local statutory and regulatory 
requirements. Overall responsibility for 
Laird’s systems of internal control including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls, and reviewing their effectiveness 
lies with the Laird Board, which ensures 
that a review is carried out at least annually 
to assess the adequacy of those systems. 
Primary responsibility for systems of 
internal control rests with the managers of 
the subsidiaries. Laird Executive Directors 
are responsible for implementing Group 
policy and for monitoring the business unit 
and divisional performance and reporting 
to the Board thereon. Financial information 
is reviewed at business unit level as well 
as by Laird’s Finance Department, which 
prepares the consolidation and financial 
statements to ensure that the financial 
position and results of the Group are 
appropriately reflected. 
An ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group is in place and 
complies with the Code and the guidance of 
the Turnbull Committee on internal control 
and is at least annually reviewed by the 
Board. This process has been in place for 
the full financial year and up to the date 
the accounts were approved by the Board. 
The systems of internal control are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives as 
well as safeguarding the Group’s assets. 
These systems can only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Authorities and delegations are issued 
periodically to the managers of subsidiaries 
setting out their responsibilities and 
delegated authorities. These rules require 
approval for specific transactions and 
call for accurate and relevant financial 
information to be delivered on a timely 
basis. The ability to identify risk is enhanced 
by the timely reporting of management 
information and the short lines of 
communication with operating managers.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
42 Throughout the year, the Company 
participated in shareholder and prospective 
shareholder meetings in the UK and 
Europe, with activity mainly centred around 
key reporting dates, the March Full Year 
Results announcement, July Half Year 
announcement and the May and October 
Trading Update dates. Whilst a programme 
of co-ordinated activity is followed 
throughout the year, where appropriate 
we also respond to ad-hoc requests for 
meetings. The majority of the meetings 
were attended by a combination of the 
Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer 
and/or the Head of Investor Relations. 
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are also available for meetings with 
shareholders in the event that there are 
any concerns which cannot be addressed 
through management, or in connection 
with any significant change to the 
Company’s strategy, remuneration policy or 
governance arrangements.
Wherever possible, the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors attend results 
presentations and they welcome the AGM 
as an opportunity to communicate with 
both private investors and institutional 
shareholders. Shareholders are invited to 
ask questions and are given the opportunity 
to meet the Directors informally after the 
meeting. The Chairman gives a formal 
report on the Company’s progress at the 
meeting and a copy of his statement is 
issued to a regulatory information service 
and published on the Company’s website. 
All of the Directors attended the AGM in 
2015 and the Chairmen of the Remuneration 
and Audit Committees were available to 
answer questions relating to their areas 
of responsibility. The number of proxy 
votes cast for, against and withheld on the 
resolutions are reported to the meeting and 
following the meeting are published on the 
Company’s website. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company is committed to increasing 
shareholder value and ensures it 
communicates its prospects and 
achievements to shareholders in a timely 
manner and within the limits imposed by 
the Listing Rules made by the Financial 
Conduct Authority. Regular communication 
with shareholders takes place through the 
Annual Report and Accounts, the Final and 
Interim Results presentation materials and 
other press releases of business significance 
throughout the year. Significant matters 
relating to the trading or development 
of the business are communicated to 
the market by way of announcements 
through a regulatory information service. 
These announcements also appear 
on the Company’s website, along with 
other press releases, presentations, 
webcasts, informative videos and business 
case studies.
The Head of Investor Relations, working 
closely with the Chief Executive and the 
Chief Financial Officer on a day-to-day 
basis, has full responsibility for devising 
and implementing the Company’s Investor 
Communications Plan to service its current 
and prospective shareholders and provide 
information to financial analysts.
Written and verbal reports are presented 
to the Board at each meeting on ongoing 
Investor Relations activity and reports from 
the investor community are fed back on a 
regular basis.
During 2015, there was continued focus 
on engaging with Laird’s institutional 
shareholders and private client brokers 
to ensure the Company’s prospects and 
developments were understood and to 
emphasise the strategic progress that has 
been achieved. 
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
43 CHAIRMAN’S OVERVIEW
The Committee’s main focus is on 
strengthening and balancing the 
range of skills, experience and diversity 
of the Board.
During the year, the Committee:
• led the process to appoint a new Chief 
Financial Officer following Jonathan 
Silver’s retirement at the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting (the ‘AGM’);
• made recommendations and confirmed 
the appointments of three new 
Non-Executive Directors;
• undertook the annual review of the 
Chief Executive’s performance; and
• carried out a review of its terms 
of reference.
Particular thought was given to the 
replacement of Sir Christopher Hum who 
completed nine years’ service as Director 
during the course of 2015. The Committee 
was mindful of the fact that four new 
Directors had been appointed in 2015 
and that it was important to maintain 
a degree of continuity on the Board. 
After rigorous review, the Committee 
concluded that Sir Christopher remains 
of independent character and judgement 
and recommended his re-appointment 
for another year. The Committee also 
recommended to the Board the extension 
of Paula Bell’s appointment as a Non-
Executive Director for a further year.
Looking ahead, the Committee is taking 
steps to replace Jack Boyer, who will 
retire as a Non-Executive Director and 
the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee following the Company’s 2016 
AGM. In keeping with our stated course, 
the Committee will focus on finding a 
replacement that further strengthens and 
balances the skills, experience and diversity 
of the Board.
OBJECTIVE
The Committee leads the process 
for Board appointments, and makes 
recommendations to the Board. 
The Committee also considers the Chief 
Executive’s reports from time to time 
on succession planning and reviews the 
performance of the Chief Executive.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee are documented and agreed 
by the Board. The key terms are outlined 
below and the full terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website, 
www.laird-plc.com:
• responsibility for identifying and 
nominating, for the approval of the Board, 
candidates to fill Board vacancies as and 
when they arise;
• leading the process for Board 
appointments and making 
recommendations to the Board;
• in consultation with the Chief Executive, 
regularly reviewing the structure, size 
and composition (including the balance 
of skills, knowledge, independence, 
experience and diversity) required of the 
Board and making recommendations to 
the Board with regard to any changes; 
• assessing the independence of the 
Non-Executive Directors; and
• at least annually, reviewing the 
performance of the Chief Executive.
MEMBERSHIP
Since 1 July 2015, the Committee consists 
of the Chairman of the Board and at least 
two independent Non-Executive Directors. 
During 2015, the Committee was chaired 
by Dr Martin Read. Up to 30 June 2015, 
it comprised all the Non-Executive 
Directors. Since 1 July 2015, the Committee

44 MEETINGS
The Nomination Committee met four times 
during the year. Details of attendance at 
these meetings can be found on page 40.
At the invitation of the Committee, and 
as appropriate to the matters under 
discussion, meetings may be attended 
by members of the Board and external 
advisers. Minutes are kept by the Company 
Secretary of the matters considered 
and decisions taken by the Committee. 
Minutes are circulated to the Board, unless 
it is inappropriate to do so. The Committee 
has authority to seek any information it 
requires from any officer or employee 
of the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings. The Committee can take 
such independent professional advice, 
at the expense of the Company, as it 
considers necessary. 
Egon Zehnder was appointed to assist 
with the process for selecting a new 
Chief Financial Officer and also with the 
recruitment of Kjersti Wiklund and Nathalie 
Rachou. Egon Zehnder will also assist with 
the process to select a replacement for 
Jack Boyer. Apart from Egon Zehnder’s 
work on these matters and assisting with 
the recruitment of other senior executives 
within the Group, Egon Zehnder has no 
other connection with the Company. 
The selection for the new Chief Financial 
Officer was led by the Chief Executive and 
the Chairman, working closely with the 
previous Chief Financial Officer to ensure 
a smooth transition. 
DIVERSITY
The Committee believes that diversity 
of thought and business experience is 
paramount when considering the make-up 
of the Board. It is the Company’s aim to 
have the appropriate level of diversity in 
the boardroom to reflect the diverse nature 
of the Company’s operations and provide 
a broader perspective to decision making 
whilst remaining committed to ensuring 
that appointments are ultimately made 
on merit against agreed selection criteria. 
Following the appointment of Kjersti 
Wiklund on 1 July 2015 and Nathalie Rachou 
on 1 January 2016, women represent 33% of 
Board membership. 
It is the Committee’s policy to consider 
diversity generally when making 
appointments to the Board, taking 
into account relevant skills, experience, 
knowledge, gender and ethnicity. 
More information on the Company’s gender 
profile is included in the Corporate Social 
Responsibility report.

45 As a result, there have been a number of 
changes to the Committee membership 
during the year, with Jack Boyer and 
Sir Christopher Hum stepping down 
on 30 June 2015 and 31 December 
2015 respectively, and Mike Parker and 
Kjersti Wiklund joining the Committee. 
Michael Kelly retired as a Director and 
Committee member on 30 June 2015. 
Nathalie Rachou recently joined the 
Committee on 1 January 2016.
As mentioned last year, following the 
introduction of the audit tendering 
provisions in the Code, the recent 
findings of the Competition Commission, 
the EU regulations and the Guidance for 
Audit Committees issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council, a competitive audit 
tender took place in 2015 to coincide 
with the five-year rotation of the audit 
partner with a view to the change being 
implemented in 2016. 
Following a thorough tender process 
(details of which can be found on page 50 
of this Report), the Board is proposing the 
appointment of Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) 
as the Group’s external auditor, subject to 
the approval of the shareholders at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting (the 
‘AGM’) on 29 April 2016. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank Ernst & Young 
for the provision of the external audit 
services during its tenure. We look forward 
to working with Deloitte going forward.
The Committee also oversaw the tender 
process for the appointment of KPMG LLP 
as the new internal audit services provider.
The Committee advises the Board 
as to whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
At the beginning of each financial year, 
the Committee agrees the annual agenda 
of activities identifying key areas of focus 
and emerging topics.
As a Committee we are keen to constantly 
evolve our focus on financial risks that 
face the business as operations continue 
to grow globally, whilst ensuring robust 
reporting is underpinned by appropriate 
and effective processes, controls and 
assurance. The Committee recognises 
the requirement to keep primary areas 
of judgement under review and report 
accordingly and is committed to fulfilling 
its responsibilities in this regard.
The Committee engages with the business 
effectively and assesses the adequacy of 
the internal financial control environment. 
During the year, the business has continued 
its review of the financial shared services 
centres in Europe, North America and 
Asia, which continues to bring strength 
to the already robust financial processes 
within the organisation. The Committee 
receives regular updates throughout 
the year on any changes in the financial 
controls environment and also receives 
assurances from external professional 
advisers. The Committee continues to 
challenge and develop the scope of Laird’s 
internal audit programme to match the 
evolving growth of the business in terms 
of regional expansion into new territories 
and as the organisational structure adapts 
and changes. The Committee also reviews 
and discusses with the external auditor the 
scope of the audit to ensure it appropriately 
responds to risk.
The Committee monitors and reviews 
annually the whistleblowing policy and any 
incidents of whistleblowing are brought to 
the Committee’s attention. During the year 
an independent telephone and internet 
provider review was undertaken and it 
was concluded that the incumbent be 
re-appointed.
As mentioned previously, during the year, 
the Board reviewed the membership of the 
Committees of the Board, including the 
Audit Committee, with a view to having a 
more focussed approach to the Committees 
of the Board with more specialisation.

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
47 MAIN ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR
The Committee has assisted the Board in 
carrying out its responsibilities in relation 
to financial reporting requirements and the 
assessment of internal financial control. 
It has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function and their work 
and oversaw the relationship with the 
external auditor. 
The Committee normally meets prior to 
Board meetings and before Half Year and 
Full Year announcements and the two 
Trading Updates. At least twice a year the 
Committee receives and reviews reports 
from the Chief Risk Officer on internal 
financial control. 
In accordance with the Code, the Board 
requested that the Committee advise them 
on whether they believe that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
During 2015, there was a tender process 
for the external and internal auditor service 
providers, which was overseen by the 
Committee. After conducting a thorough 
tender process, Deloitte was selected 
to provide the external audit services – 
information on the external audit tender 
process can be found further on in this 
Report. KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) was selected 
to provide the internal audit services, as well 
as the tax consultancy services. KPMG was 
selected as the internal audit services 
provider on the basis of the strength of the 
audit services team, its understanding of 
Laird’s business and its forward-thinking 
risk prioritisation ethos for targeted 
assurance provision.
During the year, the Committee has 
continued to monitor and review the 
effectiveness of the shared services model 
to ensure that high levels of assurance are 
being maintained. The Committee oversees 
the assurance process to target priorities 
in a new control model for the shared 
services environment.
The Committee has continued to challenge 
and develop the scope of Laird’s internal 
audit programme to match the evolving 
growth of the business in terms of regional 
expansion into new territories and as the 
organisation structure adapts and changes. 
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee met five times 
during the year. Details of attendance 
at these meetings can be found on page 
40. The Chairman of the Board, the Chief 
Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Chief Risk Officer, and the external auditor 
are given notice of all meetings and may be 
invited to attend and speak at any meeting. 
The external auditor has the opportunity 
to meet with the Audit Committee without 
any Executive Directors present whenever 
necessary and the Audit Committee 
ensures that this happens at least once 
a year in order to discuss any issues or 
concerns from either party. Additionally, 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee has 
regular contact with the external audit 
partner outside of Committee meetings. 
During the year, the Audit Committee held 
two meetings with EY without management 
being present, in order to receive feedback 
from them on matters such as the quality 
of interaction with management. 
Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’), which provide 
global internal audit services under the 
direction of the Chief Risk Officer, attended 
three Audit Committee meetings during 
the year. The Chief Risk Officer briefed the 
Audit Committee three times on key internal 
audit matters and findings of internal audit 
investigations and had the opportunity 
at each meeting to meet with the Audit 
Committee without any Executive Directors 
present and he met or had phone calls 
separately with the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee on six further occasions during 
the year.
The Audit Committee has authority to 
seek any information it requires from any 
officer or employee of the Company or any 
of its subsidiary undertakings. It believes 
that it has received sufficient, reliable and 
timely information from management to 
enable it to fulfil its responsibilities during 
the year. The Audit Committee can take 
such independent professional advice, 
at the expense of the Company, as it 
considers necessary. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
48 Viability
Following the changes to UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board has assessed 
the prospects of the Company over a 
longer period than the 12 months required 
by the going concern requirements of the 
Code. The Committee considered and 
approved the approach that was adopted 
to provide additional information about the 
Group’s longer term viability. This longer-
term assessment process supports the 
Board’s statements on viability, as set out 
on page 81. 
Taxation
Provisioning for potential current tax 
liabilities and the level of deferred tax asset 
recognition in relation to accumulated tax 
losses require judgements. The Committee 
addresses these issues through a range 
of reports from the taxation department 
and senior management and a process 
of challenging the appropriateness 
of management’s views including the 
degree to which these are supported by 
professional advice from external legal and 
other advisory firms. In 2015 an amount 
of £25.4m (2014, £23.6m) was recognised 
in relation to potential non-current tax 
liabilities, including an amount of £8.6m 
recognised in the current year in relation 
to the redesign of Laird’s operating 
model. The recognition of these liabilities, 
and any movement in the current year, 
is discussed in detail and challenged 
with both the taxation department and 
senior management. 
In 2014 an exceptional £20.1m deferred 
tax asset was recognised in relation to US 
losses. The continued recognition of this 
deferred tax asset, and the movement in the 
current year, has also been discussed and 
verified with both the taxation department 
and senior management. The provisioning 
for current tax liabilities and levels of 
deferred tax asset recognition is an area 
of higher audit risk and accordingly the 
Committee received detailed verbal 
and written reporting from EY on all 
these matters.
The Committee has also reviewed and 
discussed with the external auditor the 
scope of the audit to ensure it appropriately 
responds to risk.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The primary role of the Committee 
in relation to financial reporting is to 
review the half-year and annual financial 
statements. The review is carried out with 
both management and the external auditor, 
and focus areas include evaluating whether:
• the Annual Report and Accounts 
represent a fair, balanced and 
understandable view of information 
for shareholders;
• material areas of significant judgement 
have been given due consideration by 
management and reviewed with the 
external auditor;
• the quality and acceptability of 
accounting policies and practices;
• clarity of disclosures and compliance to 
financial reporting standards and relevant 
financial and governance reporting 
requirements; and
• any correspondence from regulators in 
relation to financial reporting.
The primary areas of judgement considered 
by the Committee in relation to the 2015 
accounts, and how these were addressed, 
were:
Goodwill impairment testing
The review for impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets is based on cash flow 
projections to calculate a value in use for 
each division. These projections are based 
on forecasts which have been prepared 
by each division. The achievability of 
the forecasts is a risk, given the inherent 
uncertainty within any financial projection. 
The Committee addresses this risk by 
challenging the assumptions used for 
each division and the financial models 
used to assess value in use are reviewed as 
part of the audit. See note 16 on pages 117 
and 118.
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
49 The Committee has reviewed EY’s key 
policies for maintaining objectivity and 
independence, including the policy for the 
rotation of audit partners which requires 
a new lead audit partner to be appointed 
every five years. In accordance with this 
policy, there was a change in lead audit 
partner in 2011. The Committee also 
reviewed the policy on employment of 
former employees of the external auditor 
and confirmed it remained effective.
EY will stand down as the Group’s external 
auditor after the 2015 audit has been 
completed. As previously mentioned, 
subject to approval of the shareholders 
at the Company’s AGM on 29 April 2016, 
Deloitte has been selected to provide the 
external audit services from 2016.
EXTERNAL AUDIT TENDER PROCESS
• An informal pre-proposal market 
assessment was undertaken to identify 
firms to be invited to tender. The tender 
included both external and internal 
audit services (as well as the tax 
consultancy services).
• The Audit Committee oversaw the 
tender process, and established a 
Tender Steering Committee to drive 
the process. The Steering Committee 
consisted of the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Chief Risk Officer, the Group Financial 
Controller and the Director of Internal 
Controls Governance.
• The shortlist of firms invited to tender for 
the external audit services comprised four 
firms, including one Tier 2 audit firm.
• The detailed process included visits to 
selected sites in the US, Europe and Asia 
as well as meetings with key Board and 
senior management members.
• Whilst the some of the firms that were 
shortlisted put forward strong bids, a key 
deciding factor was the extremely high 
team capability offered by Deloitte, as 
well as the global reach of the audit team.
Acquisition accounting
There is judgement involved in identifying 
the fair values of the assets of an acquired 
business. The accounting policies of 
acquired companies are examined and, 
where they differ from Group policies, 
an adjustment is made in the opening 
balance sheet to ensure consistency. 
Intangible assets and goodwill are 
separately identified as part of this process, 
with any need for impairment considered at 
December 2015 based on current factors. 
The Committee has reviewed the disclosure 
in the financial statements and has sought 
further explanation where necessary.
Exceptional costs
The Committee also reviewed the nature 
and classification of some costs as 
exceptional in the year and its compliance 
with the Group’s accounting policy. 
There was an exceptional charge of £45.0m 
in 2015, of which £39.0m is related to 
redesigning the Laird Operating model. 
The Committee tested whether certain 
costs met the recognition criteria as an 
exceptional item in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy. The Committee 
also checked that the disclosure of these 
items was appropriate.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
Appointment and independence 
During the year, the Committee reviewed 
the appointment and terms of engagement 
of EY, the external auditor, including the 
proposed fee structure. 
The Committee has noted the changes 
to the Code, the recent findings of 
the Competition Commission, the 
EU regulations and the Guidance for 
Audit Committees issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council, in the context of 
tendering for the external audit contract 
every 10 years. EY were appointed 
as external auditor in 1989 and their 
appointment has been subject to annual 
reviews. In conjunction with the audit 
tendering provisions in the Code, the 
Committee decided that a competitive 
audit tender would take place in 2015 to 
coincide with the five-year rotation of the 
audit partner, with a view to the change 
being implemented in 2016, following 
the 2015 audit. There are no contractual 
obligations which restrict the Committee’s 
recommendation to the Board of 
statutory auditor.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
50 INTERNAL AUDIT
The Audit Committee oversees the internal 
audit function. The Audit Committee 
considers the scope and planning of 
internal financial audits and reviews the 
internal audit process for identifying and 
managing financial risk and the findings of 
those audits. 
INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROL
As noted above, the Audit Committee 
reviews the Group and Company’s financial 
statements. It also has responsibility for 
reviewing the process for identifying and 
managing financial risk, for reviewing the 
internal financial controls and considers 
the scope and planning of internal and 
external audits. It reviews reports on 
internal financial control including reports 
by the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer and the results from 
internal financial audits. As part of its 
audit, the external auditor, to the extent it 
considers necessary to support its audit 
opinion, reviews and tests the systems of 
internal control and the data contained in 
the accounts, including an independent 
and objective review of the approach 
of management to the reporting of the 
operating results and financial condition.
EFFECTIVENESS
The Audit Committee considers and reviews 
the effectiveness of the external audit on 
an annual basis, reporting its findings to 
the Board as part of its recommendation. 
This process is supported by the completion 
of questionnaires by the Committee 
which include consideration of the audit 
partner, the approach, communication and 
reporting. The results of the questionnaires 
are reported to and discussed by 
the Committee. The Committee also 
considered the scope and planning of the 
external financial audit and assessed the 
effectiveness of the audit process, including 
a report on the audit firm’s own internal 
quality control procedures. Additionally, 
the Committee received and reviewed the 
Financial Reporting Council’s Annual Audit 
Quality Inspections Report. After taking into 
account the above factors, the Committee 
concluded that the external auditor 
remains effective.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Audit Committee recommends for 
Board approval a policy for non-audit 
services to be performed by the auditor. 
This policy prohibits the use of the external 
audit firm for certain specified matters and 
the hiring of its former employees, without 
prior approval from the Audit Committee 
Chairman. The auditor will not be engaged 
to provide internal audit services, systems 
implementations or valuations as such 
services would be deemed to conflict 
with their independence.
There are sound commercial and practical 
reasons, including confidentiality, for using 
the auditor to provide non-audit services. 
During the year Laird used the services of 
EY (and other providers) for tax compliance 
advice and acquisition due diligence. 
The ratio of fees for non-audit work to audit 
services was 0.9 in 2015. As previously 
reported, tax compliance fees have been 
unusually high as EY has been advising 
Laird over a number of years on a Bilateral 
Advanced Pricing Agreement, a major tax 
compliance project involving the Chinese 
and US tax authorities. These fees, which 
amounted to £0.7m in 2015, represent 
closure of the outstanding issues with the 
Chinese authorities. Excluding these fees, 
the ratio of non-audit fees to audit was 0.3. 
Details of fees for non-audit work are set 
out in note 6 on page 108.
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
51 WHISTLEBLOWING
The Audit Committee reviews the 
Company’s procedure for handling 
allegations from whistleblowers as set out 
in the Company’s Global Code of Conduct 
(which is available on the Company’s 
website) and any whistleblowing events are 
brought to its attention. Following the 2015 
annual policy and process review, the Audit 
Committee agreed that the policy works 
well and no changes were recommended. 
A whistleblowing service, which offers a 
relevant language service in all countries 
in which Laird operates, is made available 
to all employees through an independent 
telephone and internet provider. Employees  
have the right to remain anonymous. 
A monthly report on any calls is sent to 
senior management. This service was 
re-tendered in 2015, with the incumbent 
provider re-appointed to provide an 
enhanced service which has been  
re-advertised internally to employees in 2015. 
Investigation of all whistleblower 
communications is overseen by the Chief 
Risk and Assurance Officer with findings 
reported to the Board. In order to continue 
to highlight the existence of the service, 
it was agreed that an organisation-wide 
awareness refresh would be appropriate.

53 DEAR SHAREHOLDER 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for 2015 which has 
been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee (‘Committee’) on behalf 
of the Board.
CONTEXT TO THE COMMITTEE’S 
DECISIONS
Under David Lockwood’s leadership 
2015 was another successful year for our 
business, being the third consecutive year 
of growth, with revenue up 11.6% in Sterling 
and up 3.5% in US Dollar on a constant 
currency basis. Operating cash flow was 
up 56.9% and underlying EPS up 14.1%. 
Performance against the Company’s key 
performance indicators are detailed on 
pages 14 to 29 and the financial highlights 
on page 1. 
The year also saw the business execute 
further on key strategic objectives to 
support growth including the acquisition of 
LS Research and the agreement to acquire 
Novero, the diversification of our customer 
base, the development of a plan to streamline 
our business to become a more effective 
partner to our customers and deliver 
efficiency savings and the strengthening 
of the senior management of the Company 
in line with its growth ambitions. 
2015 REMUNERATION DECISIONS
Key decisions made by the Committee 
during, and for, the financial year include:
• The increase in salary for David Lockwood 
of 14.6% to £550,000 p.a. When David 
Lockwood was appointed as Chief 
Executive in 2012, his salary was set at a 
level below the market rate as he was new 
to the role. As he is now established in the 
role and in light of the strong performance 
of the Company, the Committee 
concluded that it was appropriate for his 
salary increase to be higher than average 
in order to bring it more in line with the 
benchmark level. This increase was also 
in line with the Company’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (‘Policy’). 
This report has been prepared in compliance with Schedule 8  
of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, 
as well as the Companies Act 2006. This report is set out

to move for a similar resolution again at 
the 2016 AGM. The Policy is available to 
view in full on the Company’s website 
at www.laird-plc.com and is intended to 
apply for a period of three years from the 
2015 AGM.
The Annual Report on Remuneration 
together with this letter is subject to an 
advisory shareholder vote and will be put to 
this year’s AGM to be held on 29 April 2016.

JACK BOYER, OBE
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE
1 MARCH 2016
• The decision that David Lockwood and 
Tony Quinlan should receive an annual 
performance bonus in respect of 2015 
equal to 40.5% and 37.8% of base salary 
respectively reflects performance 
against the strategic measures for the 
year. David and Tony made a decision 
to utilise approximately £2.5m of PBT 
to pay management bonuses thereby 
forfeiting the PBT element of their 2015 
bonus which would otherwise have been 
triggered. Further details can be found on 
pages 65 to 67.
• That 75% of the 2003 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (‘2003 LTIP’) awards and 
25% of the 2003 Executive Share Option 
Plan (‘2003 ESOP’) awards granted in 
2012 to David Lockwood and Jonathan 
Silver had achieved the performance 
conditions reflecting the value created 
for shareholders.
• The increase in the Chairman’s fee for Dr 
Martin Read of 15.2% to £190,000. As with 
the Chief Executive, when Dr Read was 
appointed as Chairman in May 2014, his 
fee was set at a level below the market 
rate to reflect that he was new to the role. 
The Committee believed that it was now 
appropriate to bring his fee in line with the 
level of the previous Chairman of Laird 
PLC who retired in 2014.
• The approval of ‘MyShare’, an umbrella 
share purchase plan for all employees 
operated internationally under the Laird 
PLC 2015 Share Incentive Plan, the Laird 
PLC International Share Purchase Plan 
and the Laird PLC 2015 US Employee 
Stock Purchase Plan.
APPOINTMENT OF TONY QUINLAN 
Tony Quinlan joined Laird with effect 
from 1 July 2015 and was appointed as 
Chief Financial Officer on 28 July 2015. 
On appointment the Committee decided to 
provide Tony Quinlan with:
• A base salary of £350,000 per annum.
• A standard benefits package and 
20% of salary paid as cash in lieu of 
pension contribution. 
• The opportunity to participate in the Laird 
PLC 2015 Annual Performance Incentive 
Scheme and the Laird PLC 2015 Long-
Term Incentive Plan (‘2015 LTIP’) up to 
140% and 150% of salary respectively.

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
55 Ahead of the detail behind payments for 2015, the Remuneration Committee would like to take the opportunity to outline 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (‘Policy’), wider all-employee pay arrangements, key decisions and performance 
outcomes during the past year.
KEY PRINCIPLES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY
Laird’s Policy is based on a number of principles.
1.  Remuneration arrangements should be aligned with strategy for accelerated growth and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
2.  The Policy should ensure there is a clear link between reward and sustained performance and recognise exceptional performance 
appropriately when this occurs.
3.  The Policy should provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable performance-related components, with a significant element 
of long-term variable pay given the long-term nature of the business.
4.  Remuneration should be competitive with the market and facilitate retention of talent within sectors and geographies in which the 
Company operates and competes for talent.
SUMMARY OF THE POLICY
The Policy supports Laird’s strategic drivers, which are set out on pages 14 and 15. The Policy and its use of performance 
metrics appropriately support shareholder value creation by delivering sustainable performance consistent with the 
strategic drivers and appropriate risk management.

56 Executive incentives and link to KPIs
In line with the remuneration principles, the incentive arrangements are designed to support the Company’s KPIs. The following

The Committee believes that the remuneration structure in place will continue to support and motivate the Executive 
Directors, in furthering the Company’s long-term strategic objectives including the creation of sustainable shareholder 
returns. Furthermore, we are satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate and 
does not incentivise undue risk-taking or reward underperformance.
ALL EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS
Since 2013, the Board, led by the Chief Executive, has been transforming the remuneration strategy of the Company to 
ensure all employees share in its success through performance-related remuneration and share ownership. In 2015 the 
Medium Term Incentive Plan (‘MTIP’) was introduced for the senior leaders (excluding the Executive Directors), and a new 
all-employee share purchase plan was implemented. The remuneration arrangements operating across the Company 
for 2016 are set out below. In addition, the following table demonstrates how key objectives are reflected consistently in 
plans operating at all levels within the Company. More details on share schemes can be found in note 29 to the Financial

57 INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR 2015
2015 Annual Performance Incentive Scheme outcome
Bonus awards for 2015 reflect the good progress in respect of the key strategic objectives to support the growth of 
the Company. 
The Committee determined that a bonus payment equal to 40.5% of salary for David Lockwood (27% of 150% of 
salary maximum) and 37.8% of salary for Tony Quinlan (27% of 140% of salary maximum) should be awarded following 
an assessment of the 2015 corporate scorecard, as set out below, and taking into account Laird’s underlying financial 
performance and also individual performance. One third of the bonus payment will be deferred into shares and will vest 
after three years.
The measures that were applicable for the 2015 Annual Performance Incentive Scheme are summarised in the table below.

TONY QUINLAN DAVID LOCKWOOD
Minimum, On-Target and Maximum scenarios have been calculated in accordance with the Regulations, except to enable an accurate comparison Tony 
Quinlan’s fixed remuneration reflects the amounts he received for the year rather than the annualised figures. Tony Quinlan’s buy-out awards, that form 
part of the Single Figure for 2015, have also been excluded on the basis they do not form part of the Laird’s annual remuneration policy.
David Lockwood’s 2015 remuneration policy scenarios are as disclosed in the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report. His actual fixed remuneration for 2015 
was higher than the remuneration policy scenarios disclosed in the 2014 report following the mid-year increase to salary at the normal review date (i.e. the 
Committee’s policy is to review salaries 1 July each year).
No allowance has been made for share price appreciation for Minimum, On-Target and Maximum scenarios. Therefore, for comparison with the 2015 actual 
single figure ‘LTI’ number (which shows the value of an award at vesting), the value has been separated to show the intrinsic value of the LTI awards at grant 
and the value delivered via share price growth over the performance period.

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
60 The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, 
no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the 
senior management and for setting the remuneration packages for each Executive Director. The Committee also has 
oversight of the remuneration policy and packages for other senior members of staff. The written Terms of Reference of 
the Committee are available on the Company’s website and from the Company on request.
The Committee held four meetings during the year. Its activities during 2015 included approving the 2014 Annual 
Performance Incentive Scheme awards; approving the framework for the 2015 Annual Performance Incentive Scheme; 
determining if performance conditions for Laird’s long-term incentive arrangements had been met; reviewing the 
Committee’s Terms of Reference; approving the Directors’ remuneration report for approval by the Board, reviewing the 
base salaries of the Executive Directors and other senior executives, setting an appropriate remuneration package for Tony 
Quinlan, reviewing the fees paid to the Chairman and approving the 2015 LTIP and an umbrella share purchase plan for 
all employees.
Advisers to the Committee
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) are independent advisers to the Committee. PwC is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK. On this basis, the Committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent.
PwC also provided the Company with other advisory services during the year. The Committee reviewed the nature of 
the services provided and was satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or existed in the provision of these services. 
The Committee also sought the views of the Chief Executive, David Lockwood, during the year. The Chief Executive is 
given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends part of the meetings. The Chief 
Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings. In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive 
will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other Executive Director and employees. 
The total fees paid to PwC in respect of services to the Committee during the year were £127,250. Fees were determined 
based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2016
The Policy and its implementation for the forthcoming financial year is summarised below:
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Salary
During the summer of 2015, the Committee considered David Lockwood’s remuneration. The Committee awarded a 
one-off salary increase of 14.6% to David Lockwood (from £480,000 to £550,000) which was effective from 1 July 2015. 
The rationale for the increase is set out below: 
• When David Lockwood was appointed as Chief Executive, his salary was set at a level below the market rate and 
significantly below the previous CEO Peter Hill (£609,000), given that he was new to the role. In line with the Policy for 
individuals who become established in their role following appointment and in light of his strong personal performance 
as Chief Executive and Laird’s strong corporate performance, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate for his 
salary increase to be higher than the average increase applied to the wider employee population. 
• Since appointment, David Lockwood has transformed the business to position Laird as a leading global technology 
company. Under his leadership, Laird has delivered solid results, underpinned by an increasingly diversified business, 
exemplified by the strength and growing importance of our Wireless Systems division. The continuation of this 
transformation, redesign of Laird’s operating model, associated growth for shareholders and the execution of the 
long-term strategic plan is dependent on David Lockwood’s leadership and drive. 
• The increase recognises the shareholder value that has been created since David Lockwood’s appointment and his 
role in delivering that value. In context, since his appointment Laird’s Total Shareholder Return growth has been 88% 
compared to a FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts) return of 71% to 31 December 2015. 
• Laird’s strong performance has resulted in an increase to the size and complexity of the business – through both organic 
growth and acquisitions. The increase to David Lockwood’s salary is therefore also a recognition that the business is 
of significantly greater size, complexity and geographical footprint than at David Lockwood’s appointment. 
• An increase to David Lockwood’s salary better aligns his positioning against companies in the FTSE 250 – he is now 
positioned at the median level which is in line with our stated Policy. The package is in line with our Policy to provide 
an appropriate balance between fixed and variable performance-related components, with a significant element of 
long-term variable pay given the long term nature of the business.
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
61 Tony Quinlan joined the Company on 1 July 2015, and was appointed the new Chief Financial Officer on 28 July 2015 
with a base salary of £350,000. 
It is the Committee’s Policy to review Executive Directors’ salaries as at 1 July each year. Any changes to salaries in 2016 
will be in line with the Policy and disclosed in the 2016 Directors’ remuneration report.
Annual Performance Incentive Scheme 2016
Details of the maximum bonus potentials along with the performance measures and their respective weightings for the 
year ending 31 December 2016 are set out below:

T Quinlan 140% 70% 30%
The Committee considers that disclosing precise targets of profit and strategic objectives, which are commercially 
sensitive, for the Annual Performance Incentive Scheme in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Actual targets, 
performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end of the performance period where possible without 
compromising confidential matters so that shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Two-thirds of the bonus award will be paid out in cash with the further one-third deferred into shares subject to a further 
three-year vesting period. No further performance targets apply to the deferred shares.
LTIP Awards in 2016
Details of the maximum LTIP Awards (i.e. performance share awards) to be made under the 2015 LTIP in 2016 are set

or cash in lieu equal to 25% and 20% of base salary respectively.

62 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board determines the fee levels for the Non-Executive Directors and the Committee determines the fee levels for 
the Chairman.
In light of the revised Non-Executive composition of the Board, increased time spent by the Non-Executive Directors 
on Company business, experience and quality of the individuals and increased complexity and international profile of 
the business, it was decided that certain changes were necessary to the Non-Executive Director fee structure. In line 
with the approved Policy for Non-Executive Directors, the table below summarises the changes to the fees paid to the 
Non-Executive Directors effective 1 July 2015:
Role 1 January 2015 1 July 2015

Note
1. The £165,000 fee paid to Martin Read was effective from the date of the AGM.
The fee structure for the Non-Executive Directors was previously unchanged since 2012, except for the Chairman who was 
brought in on a lower fee of £165,000 compared to the previous Chairman (£190,000). 
The Board is satisfied that the new fee structure for the Non-Executive Directors will: 
• Ensure that Laird can retain and attract individuals with the appropriate knowledge and experience to guide Laird 
through its next stage of development as a leading global technology business. 
• Provide a fee structure which recognises the increased time commitment for our Non-Executive Directors on 
Company business. 
• Provide a competitive fee structure when compared to other FTSE 250 companies.

PART 3: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
64 OUTCOME OF THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE SCHEME FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
The performance targets, actual performance achievement and resulting bonus payments are summarised below.
Performance measures and Targets Actual performance outcome
Performance Measure
Underlying profit before tax (PBT)
Weighting: 70% of maximum
Targets
Up to 70% of maximum bonus is based on 
achievement of budget for underlying PBT 
(adjusted for any acquisitions and disposals 
during the year) of £77m.
Threshold: At 97% of budget being £74.69m, 
20% of maximum PBT element is payable.
Budget: At 100% of Budget being £77m, 
70% at maximum PBT element is payable.
Maximum: At 103% of Budget being £79.31m, 
100% of maximum PBT element is payable.
PBT of £73.1m achieved which was below the Threshold target of £74.69m
1
.
Performance Measure 
Strategic, Corporate and 
Operational objectives 
Weighting: 30% of maximum
Targets
Six objectives were set for the Chief Executive 
for the year (although some objectives are 
expected to take a few years to achieve and 
complete in full) and three for the new Chief 
Financial Officer. 
Up to 30% of maximum bonus is based on 
achievement of certain strategic, corporate 
and operational measures. If none of the 
performance metrics are achieved, 0% of 
this element would be paid. The Committee 
reviews performance against objectives 
in the round at the end of the year when 
determining payments under this element 
of the bonus scorecard.
90% of Strategic, Corporate and Operational objectives were met. 
 
 
 
The Board was satisfied that the Executive Directors had a good year and provided highly 
effective leadership to the Company. They had worked hard and made tangible and significant 
progress in the development of the business. Progress in strengthening the management team 
in 2015 had been particularly pleasing and the transition to the new operating model had gone 
well. The acquisition of LS Research and the agreement to acquire Novero have provided the 
opportunity for making significant progress with the development of our wireless/telematics 
businesses in the year ahead. Taken in the round, the Board was satisfied that both the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer should be awarded 90% of the bonus element 
attributed to Strategic, Corporate and Operational objectives. 
Further details against the individual goals are set out on the following page.
Note
1. The Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer decided to utilise approximately £2.5m of PBT for 2015 to pay management bonuses. This decision took 
the achieved PBT for 2015 (i.e. after the cost of the management bonuses) below the 2015 Annual Performance Incentive Scheme PBT threshold level (97% 
of budget). Therefore no bonus will be paid to either David Lockwood or Tony Quinlan in respect of the PBT element of the Annual Performance Incentive 
Scheme for 2015. 
LAIRD PLC

65 Performance measures and Targets Actual performance outcome
For the Chief Executive:
Increase customer diversification. • This was measured by the number of customers in the following bands (revenue), each of 
which increased with the exception of the > $25m band where the level of customers was 
maintained in line with expectation:
Customer Band 2015 Target 2015 Result
>$25m 6 6
>$10–$25m 9 9
>$1m–$10m 70 71
Progress on strengthening and diversifying 
the Management Team.
• Considerable progress has been made on strengthening and diversifying the management 
team. The first female Vice President of Technology was appointed during the year. Forty 
percent (40%) of new hires in the Leadership Team were female and seventy-six percent 
(76%) of new hires to the Management Team were non UK/US nationals.
Seamless transition to the new Operating 
Model and processes.
• This has been supported by a number of initiatives, including:
a)  the implementation of a new set of Delegated Authority Levels;
b)  the strengthening of the Finance and Legal functions;
c)  the institution of a new monthly reporting cycle; and
d)  improvements to senior customer engagement.
Significant progress with the strategic plans 
for the Wireless business.
• This is evident from major M2M wins within the Telematics Business Unit, double digit organic 
growth and two significant acquisitions, Novero (which completed in January 2016) and 
LS Research.
Further refinement of the forecasting in the 
business.
• Further refinements were made and a new reporting format was adopted during the course 
of the year which was well received by the Board.
Further development of strategic plan. • Two significant acquisitions were achieved; Novero and LS Research. The 2014 Model Solution 
acquisition is delivering according to plan. A strong funnel process has been developed and is 
well supported by the relevant executive and Board committees.
For the Chief Financial Officer
1,2
Deliver a seamless transition from previous 
Chief Financial Officer.
• The Chief Executive and the Board were impressed by the smooth transition from the 
previous Chief Financial Officer.
Deliver a functional plan. • Tony Quinlan has delivered an ambitious plan for the transformation of the Finance function 
to support Laird’s growth plans, which was well received by the Chief Executive and the 
Board.
Deliver a high-quality Capital Markets Day. • The Capital Markets Day was highly successful as reflected in the positive feedback received 
from the investor community.
Notes
1. As previously disclosed and in accordance with the terms of his leaving arrangements, Jonathan Silver was not entitled to an annual bonus in respect of the 
year ending 31 December 2015. 
2. The objectives set out above were for the new Chief Financial Officer, who joined the Company on 1 July 2015.

Notes to above tables
1. David Lockwood: On 13 August 2015, 146,081 LTIP awards and 48,694 ESOP awards (exercise price 218.2p) met their performance conditions (75% and 25% 
respectively of the original awards granted on 13 August 2012). The relevant share price was 395.4p giving a net value of £577,604 and £86,286 respectively. 
 Jonathan Silver: On 2 April 2015, 117,100 LTIP awards and 29,275 ESOP awards (exercise price 215.2p) met their performance conditions (75% and 25% 
respectively of the original awards granted on 2 April 2012). The relevant share price was 339.0p giving a net value of £396,969 and £36,242 respectively. 
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
67 Total Shareholder Return and continuing earnings per share were both used as performance measures for both the 
LTIP and ESOP Awards. The comparator group for TSR was a group of 20 companies as set out in the 2012 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, but excluding any companies that had delisted, merged or demerged since the awards had been 
made. The TSR measurement period was the three years ending 13 August 2015 and 2 April 2015 for awards made to 
David Lockwood and Jonathan Silver respectively. In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a 
sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance.
Earnings per share is calculated with reference to underlying earnings per share before exceptional items, the amortisation 
of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on disposal of 
businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments as stated in the 2014 Annual Report and 
Accounts of the Company. 
For the awards granted in 2012, and all outstanding awards, the EPS performance measure is assessed based on year-end 
results. However, the TSR performance measure is assessed a number of months post the financial year end and is subject 
to an underlying financial performance condition until the date of vesting. Therefore, vesting is unknown at the year end. 
The Committee believes it would be inconsistent to split the performance conditions for these awards and therefore to 
show true comparability between annual grants the figures are shown for the awards which vest in the financial year. 
This approach is consistent with the approach taken in prior years.
TOTAL PENSION ENTITLEMENTS
The Company provides either a contribution to a personal pension scheme, a contribution to the Laird defined 
contribution scheme or a cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits. All Directors have elected to receive cash in lieu 
of pension benefits. Jonathan Silver was a member of the Group contributory defined benefit scheme but ceased 
to accrue further pension benefits with effect from 6 April 2006. The following payments were made for 2015:

BUYOUT AWARD FOR TONY QUINLAN
A buyout package for incentives foregone in respect of Tony Quinlan’s role at Drax Group plc was provided to facilitate his 
recruitment as Chief Financial Officer. In line with the Company’s recruitment policy, when determining the package the 
Committee considered the structure of Drax’s incentive arrangements, the proportion of the relevant performance periods 
completed, the associated performance conditions and the likelihood of vesting.
The Committee determined that Tony Quinlan would be entitled to participate in Laird’s Annual Performance Incentive 
Scheme in respect of 2015. His maximum award for 2015 was set at 140% of salary and pay-out would be determined in 
accordance with the Director’s Remuneration Policy and the performance conditions for the year (pages 65 to 67 set 
out the bonus assessment for the Executive Directors for 2015). Tony Quinlan forfeited his bonus opportunity at Drax for 
the 2015 Financial Year. Therefore, as part of the terms agreed on recruitment, the Committee determined that his bonus 
opportunity at Laird for 2015 would not be pro-rated. It should be noted that Jonathan Silver did not receive a bonus for 
the period of the 2015 Financial Year he worked.
In addition, in line with Laird’s recruitment policy, the Committee determined that Tony Quinlan would be granted nil-
cost options over 147,804 Laird Shares as part of the buyout arrangements. The award was granted on 1 July 2015 and 
was made in six parts, as set out in the table below. The Committee determined the buyout share package on a fair value 
basis with new time vesting conditions (i.e. taking into account any performance measures and expected performance 
outcomes at the date of the buyout), or that buyout shares would be awarded with time-based vesting conditions where 
there were no performance conditions on the awards forfeited, or that buyout shares should be granted subject to new 
performance conditions.

Notes
1. At the time of recruitment the total value of buyout shares was limited to £525,000. This was converted into replacement share awards of 147,804 Laird PLC 
ordinary shares using a share price of 355.2 pence per share. The face value of the replacement shares was calculated using the closing mid-market share 
price of 372.2 pence per share on 1 July 2015, the date Tony Quinlan joined the Company and the date the awards were granted.
2. The normal vesting date for the award is shown in the table above, provided that the Company is not in a prohibited share dealing period. The vesting of 
Parts 1 and 2 of the award has been deferred to a date after 1 March 2016 as the current vesting dates are in a prohibited period.
All six parts of the award are made subject to Tony Quinlan remaining in relevant employment on the vesting date 
and not being under a notice of cessation of relevant employment. Parts 5 and 6 of the award are also subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions as set out in the table below:

The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide 
for a review after an initial three year term with the possibility of annual renewal.
All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at 
the AGM.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS AND FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
No payments to past directors were made during the year, other than regular pension payments under the unfunded 
retirement benefits scheme (UURB) to former directors (as previously disclosed). 
As previously announced, Jonathan Silver retired after 21 years of service as a Director of Laird PLC following the AGM 
that was held on 8 May 2015.
In line with the Policy, the Committee considered Jonathan Silver’s sustained performance and contribution to the 
Company. The leaving arrangements agreed by the Committee set out below are consistent with his contract of 
employment and the Committee’s normal policy for employees leaving the Company due to retirement.
In April 2015, it was announced that, following his retirement from the Board, Jonathan Silver had agreed to remain as an 
employee of the Company until 8 August 2015 (‘Leaving Date’) in order to maintain a smooth transition following Tony 
Quinlan’s appointment as the new Chief Financial Officer. There were no changes to the leaving arrangements that had 
been agreed and disclosed in the 2014 Directors remuneration report, except that any outstanding awards that he held 
under the Company’s share plans were time-apportioned up to 8 August 2015 and any options that had already vested 
remained exercisable for 12 months from 8 August 2015 (the revised date of cessation of employment). 
Under his employment contract, Jonathan Silver had a 12 months’ notice period which commenced on 1 January 2015. 
He worked four months and eight days of his notice period as a Director of the Company, until 8 May 2015. The Company 
made a leaving payment of £398,435.83 in order to honour the contractual entitlements under his terms and conditions of 
employment. This payment comprised:
• Salary element of £222,989.83;
• 40% of his pro-rated base salary, in lieu of pension contribution (£89,196); and
• 25% of base salary in lieu of bonus for the period of notice (£86,250) which was payable under Jonathan Silver’s service 
contract. It should be noted that the bonus payment provision on termination does not feature in the current Executive 
Directors’ services contracts. In addition Jonathan Silver did not receive a performance-related annual bonus in respect 
of the bonus year ending 31 December 2015.
He received a payment in lieu of any days accrued buy unused holiday entitlement.

LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
72 Prior to the Leaving Date, the Committee determined that awards held by Jonathan Silver that were outstanding under the 
Company’s share incentive plans would be treated in accordance with the rules of those plans as follows:
Plan Treatment
2003 Executive Share 
Option Scheme
To the extent that the performance conditions have been, or will be, met, Jonathan Silver’s outstanding 
options granted in April 2006 and April 2012 remain exercisable for 12 months after the Leaving Date, save to the 
extent that they lapse earlier under the normal operation of the scheme rules.
2003 Long Term  
Incentive Plan
To the extent that the performance conditions are met, Jonathan Silver’s outstanding nil-cost option granted 
in April 2012 will be exercisable for 12 months after the Leaving Date. 
2013 Long Term  
Incentive Plan
Jonathan Silver’s nil-cost option granted in June 2013 will be exercisable for 12 months after the Leaving Date 
and both his nil-cost option granted in March 2014 and his market-value options granted in June 2013 and 
March 2014 will vest in accordance with their original vesting schedule. All awards will be exercisable to the 
extent that the performance conditions are met and will be time-apportioned to the Leaving Date.
Jonathan Silver’s 2013 LTIP award (nil-cost options) was tested at his Leaving Date. The table below summarises the 
performance outcome and the number of nil-cost options which vested.

Notes
1. The comparator group for Total Shareholder Return was the FTSE 250 (excluding companies in the financial services sector and investment trusts), but 
excluding any companies that had delisted, merged or demerged since the awards had been made. The measurement period was from 3 June 2013 (the 
date of grant) to 8 August 2015 (Jonathan Silver’s last day of employment with the Company). In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has 
been a sustained improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance.
2. The Company’s Total Shareholder Return performance over the period was above the FTSE 250 upper quartile return. Therefore in line with the 
performance schedule the Committee determined that 100% of the award would vest. The award was pro-rated for time-served.
3. The value of awards vested is calculated using the closing mid-market share price of 404.9 pence per share on 10 August 2015, being the first business day 
after 8 August 2015. 
OUTSIDE APPOINTMENTS
The Board believes that there can be significant benefits, to both the Company and the individual, from Executive 
Directors accepting Non-Executive Directorships of companies outside the Group. The Board takes into account the likely 
time commitment for such appointments prior to approving them. During the year the fees which the Executive Directors 
received, which they are entitled to retain, were as follows:
Executive Director Company Fee
D Lockwood Knowledge Transfer Network Ltd. £30,000
T Quinlan

Port of London Authority £14,778
J Silver

DILUTION LIMITS
The Company operates its share schemes within the Investment Association’s guidelines on dilution. No share award may 
be granted if, as a result, the aggregate number of shares issued or transferred from treasury during the previous 10 years 
under all employee share schemes established by the Company would exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company on that date or, in the case of all discretionary employee share schemes, 5%. 
In accordance with the Regulations, the following information is not subject to audit.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REMUNERATION OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS
The graph below shows the Company’s performance, measured by Total Shareholder Return (TSR), compared with the 
performance of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) and the FTSE All Share Technology Hardware & Equipment 
Sector. The Company considers these the most relevant indices for TSR measurement since both are relevant to Laird’s 
stock market classification, investor base and business activities.

2. Nigel Keen was Executive Chairman between 26 November 2011 and 13 August 2012. His fee as Chairman was £175,000 p.a. which was increased to 
£609,000 p.a. for a temporary period while acting as Executive Chairman. With effect from 13 August 2012 it became £190,000 p.a.
3. Peter Hill ceased to be a Director with effect from 25 November 2011 but remained an employee on ill-health leave until 10 August 2012. The figure for 2011 
shows what he was paid for the full year.
4. Includes base salary, taxable benefits, bonus, long-term incentive awards that vested during the year and cash in lieu of pension.
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REMUNERATION
Laird is a global company with approximately 60 UK employees and four of its most senior executives are not UK 
employees. Due to the multinational nature of the Company’s workforce and the fact that 78% of employees are based 
in Asia, the pay structure operated in respect of the vast majority of its employees is significantly different from that 
applicable to the Chief Executive, who is UK-based. Therefore, the Committee’s view is that the most meaningful 
comparison of the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s remuneration is considered to be the 11 senior executives 
below Board level. Seven of these are US employees, two are British, one is Korean and one is Swedish. The table below 
compares the percentage increase in the Chief Executive’s pay (including salary and fees, taxable benefits and annual 
bonus) with that of the chosen comparator group.

LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
79 Laird is committed to providing equal 
opportunities in terms of recruitment, 
training and career development for all 
employees, including those with disabilities. 
A copy of Laird’s Equal Employment 
and Human Rights Policy Statement is 
available on the Company’s website at 
www.laird-plc.com.
EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION
The Board recognises that the success 
of the business relies on the skill and 
dedication of its workforce and therefore 
encourages two-way communication 
with its employees. Operating subsidiaries 
encourage consultation at local level and 
performance and development reviews 
reinforce the link between business 
goals, an employee’s contribution and his/
her remuneration. Laird communicates 
regularly with its employees, including 
through the provision of information on key 
events within Laird, charity and community 
involvement and employee achievements. 
In recognition that Laird’s business and 
its activities impact a wide community of 
stakeholders including investors, customers, 
employees, suppliers and local communities, 
the Board reviews the significance of social, 
environmental and ethical matters which 
may affect Laird. Further details on all these 
matters are available in the Corporate Social 
Responsibility report on pages 16 to 19.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Laird is committed to providing a safe 
working environment for its employees and 
continuous improvement is sought by the 
setting of objectives and targets based on 
relevant national and international health 
and safety standards and monitoring 
performance against these. In addition, 
Laird maintains a proactive communications 
strategy amongst all employees to promote 
and develop good health and safety 
practices. Further information is available 
in the Corporate Social Responsibility 
report on pages 16 to 19.
CHANGE OF CONTROL 
ARRANGEMENTS
One employee of the Company has a 
long-standing agreement, which provides 
for compensation, in addition to the 
contractual notice period, of up to a 
maximum of two years’ base salary for loss 
of employment, which occurs as a result of 
a takeover offer or scheme. This additional 
compensation reduces pro rata to zero over 
the two years following the date of change 
of control. Three other employees of the 
Group have agreements which provide 
compensation of up to a maximum of one 
year’s base salary for loss of employment 
which occurs as a result of a takeover offer 
or scheme, in addition to their contractual 
notice period.
This additional compensation is fixed at 
one year’s base salary during the first six 
months following the date of change of 
control and reduces pro rata to zero over 
the next 12 months. No Director benefits 
from these arrangements.
On a change of control, the Company’s 
bilateral revolving credit facilities may be 
cancelled by the lenders by giving not 
less than 30 days’ notice to the Company. 
Under the terms of the US Dollar Private 
Placement, concurrently with a change 
of control, the Company must notify 
all Noteholders and offer to repay all 
outstanding amounts within 60 days of the 
change of control. The Noteholders then 
have a period of 30 days to either accept 
the offer of repayment or continue with 
the notes.
EMPLOYMENT POLICY
Laird conducts business in multiple 
geographic locations and is committed 
to complying with the relevant legal 
requirements in each of those regions. 
Business unit management are responsible 
for implementing and communicating the 
Laird Equal Employment and Human Rights 
Policy Statements within their own business 
unit. Various methods are used throughout 
Laird as appropriate in each location for 
tracking morale, motivation, retention rates 
and training, which are reported regularly 
to local management teams. During the 
year Laird employed an average of 8,593 
employees (2014, 8,939).
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
80 The Board has assessed the potential 
financial and operational impacts, in severe 
but plausible scenarios, of the principal risks 
and uncertainties set out on pages 32 to 
35. Scenario testing has been undertaken 
to assess the resilience of the Group and 
its business model to the potential impact 
of six individual key risk scenarios and one 
combined scenario as set out on page 31. 
The scenario testing incorporates realistic 
assumptions based on our risk processes 
and experience of real incidents. Our risk 
assessment further takes account of 
the availability and effectiveness of the 
mitigating actions that could realistically 
be taken to avoid or reduce the impact 
or occurrence of the underlying risks. 
In considering the likely effectiveness of 
such actions, the conclusions of the Board’s 
regular monitoring and review of risk 
management and internal control systems, 
as described on pages 30 to 32, is taken 
into account.
On the basis of this robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, the 
Board’s review of the three-year business 
plan up to September 2018, the Group’s 
current financial and operational positions 
and contracted capital expenditure and 
other matters considered and reviewed 
during the year, the Board confirms that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue to operate and meet 
its liabilities, as they fall due, over the three 
year period to December 2018.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
An analysis of debt is given in note 21 to 
the financial statements. An analysis of 
financial instruments at carrying value 
and fair value is given in note 27 to the 
financial statements. Financial instruments 
and related disclosures together with a 
discussion of financial risk management 
objectives and exposures to credit and 
liquidity risk are in accordance with IFRS 7.
It is the Company’s objective to manage its 
financial risk so as to minimise the adverse 
fluctuations in the financial markets on the 
Group’s reported profitability and cash 
flows. The policies for managing each of the 
Group’s main financial risk areas are referred 
to in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on 
pages 24 to 29. Additionally, the principal 
risks and uncertainties on pages 32 to 35 
deals with currency exposure risk and the 
mitigating activities adopted.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Investing in research and development 
programmes delivers product innovation 
and manufacturing improvements 
within Laird. Expenditure in the year 
ended 31 December 2015 on research 
and development amounted to £54.5m 
(2014, £49.7m), of which £14.7m has been 
capitalised (2014, £12.9m). Laird continues 
to develop its technology capabilities, with 
research and development expenditure 
during the year running at 8.6% of 
sales (2014, 8.8%). This is in line with 
Laird’s strategic objective to increase 
R&D expenditure in the year and focus 
on innovation.
GOING CONCERN
As set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities on page 83, the Accounts 
have been prepared on a going concern 
basis. A statement on going concern 
relating to a business requires judgement 
at a point in time about future events which, 
by their nature, are inherently uncertain. 
The Directors have considered the ability 
of Laird to maintain committed loan 
finance, meet existing debt covenants and 
the impact of foreign currency exposures, 
as discussed in the Chief Financial Officer’s 
report on pages 24 to 29. The Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Accounts.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Board has assessed the prospects of 
the Company over a longer period than the 
12 months required by the going concern 
requirements of the Code. This longer-term 
assessment process supports the Board’s 
statements on both viability, as set out 
below, and going concern, as set out above. 
Whilst the Board has no reason to believe 
the Group will not be viable over a longer 
period, it has assessed the Group’s viability 
over a three-year period to the year 
ending December 2018. This period has 
been selected because the Group’s annual 
corporate planning processes include 
completion of a review during which a 
three-year strategic plan is prepared. 
This gives management and the Board 
sufficient, realistic visibility on the future 
in the context of the Group’s current and 
anticipated operating environment and 
markets conditions.

SHAREHOLDERS
At 31 December 2015 there were 
3,585 shareholders.
SUBSTANTIAL EQUITY INTERESTS
The Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules (‘DTRs’) issued by the Financial 
Conduct Authority require notifications 
relating to control over exercising voting 
rights attached to shares. Categories of 
notifiable interests include direct interests 
(holdings of shares with voting rights 
attached), indirect interests (those with 
access to voting rights) and financial 
instruments (which give the holder the 
formal entitlement to acquire shares with 
voting rights attached). Notification must 
be made of each category, and also the 
aggregate of combined holdings, which 
exceed or fall below the notifiable threshold. 
The requirements of the DTRs specify 
that, save in certain limited circumstances, 
notifications of holdings of 3% or over have 
to be made when a full percentage point 
increase or decrease occurs. The Company 
has only one class of shares, and does not 
hold treasury shares, so the total number of 
voting rights under the DTRs is equivalent 
to the number of shares in issue.
As at 29 February 2016 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the signing 
of this document), the Company had 
received the notifications of control of 3% 
or more over the Company’s total voting 
rights and capital in issue as set out in the 
table below.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
As at the date of this report, as far as each 
Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor 
is unaware. Each Director has taken all 
the steps that he ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
The Annual Report including the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 35 was approved by 
the Board of Directors and authorised for 
issue on 1 March 2016.

INDEPENDENT 
AUDITOR’S REPORT

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
84 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, 
we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, 
consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition across the Group’s 
diverse global operations, including the 
risk of management override (£630m, 
2014, £565m).
Refer to accounting policies (page 98); 
and note 4 of the consolidated financial 
statements (page 107).
There continues to be pressure on the 
Group to meet expectations and targets, 
especially given the softening of some of the 
Group’s key markets. Management reward 
and incentive schemes based on achieving 
profit targets may also place pressure to 
manipulate revenue recognition.
Sales arrangements are generally 
straightforward, requiring minimal judgement 
to be exercised. 
An area of particular focus is the cut-off risk 
that revenue may be inaccurately recorded 
and/or recorded in the incorrect period. This 
includes the potential that management may 
override controls to intentionally misstate the 
nature and timing of revenue transactions. 
The risk profile of revenue recognition has 
remained consistent with the prior year.
At each of the Group’s locations in scope for revenue, 
we performed the following audit procedures in respect 
of revenue recognition. 
We walked through and tested the operating 
effectiveness of the controls designed by the Group 
and operated by the location relating to the recognition 
of revenue as applicable.
We discussed any new, or changes in, customer 
relationships with management and obtained relevant 
documentation as necessary.
We tested a sample of revenue items recognised 
across the year obtaining source documentation to 
corroborate the nature and timing of the transaction.
We performed cut-off testing for a sample of revenue 
transactions around the year end date, to corroborate 
that they were recognised in the appropriate period.
Detailed analytical review procedures were performed 
to identify significant fluctuations and trends. Where 
items were noted which were not in line with our 
expectations, we obtained explanations and evidence 
from management and assessed whether, in our 
professional judgement, such items were appropriate. 
Other audit procedures specifically designed to 
address the risk of management override of controls 
included journal entry testing, applying particular focus 
to the timing of revenue transactions.
Based on our audit procedures 
we concluded that revenue is 
appropriately recognised in 
accordance with IAS 18, and 
that there was no evidence of 
management override.
We performed full and specific scope audit procedures 
over this risk area in 12 locations, which covered 80% of 
the risk amount. 
Other procedures are performed on the remaining 
balance as discussed in ‘The scope of our audit’ section 
of this report.
Tax transfer pricing exposure relating 
to the Group’s key operational locations 
(£25.5m, 2014, £23.6m).
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(page 49); accounting policies (page 100); 
and note 2 of the consolidated financial 
statements (page 100).
The global nature of the Group’s 
operations and the presence of cross-
border transactions present a complex 
tax environment and the potential for 
misstatement increases as a result. The 
Group continues to engage with relevant 
tax authorities to achieve certainty over 
tax treatments. However, when this is not 
possible, as a consequence, provisions for 
ongoing matters in respect of uncertain 
tax positions are required. Due to the high 
level of judgement and potential effect on 
the tax rate, we recognise a risk in this area.
We challenged management’s assumptions in relation 
to the Group’s material tax positions around the world, 
in particular the status of transfer pricing agreements 
between key locations and the accounting implications 
for the financial statements. 
This included corroborating movements in uncertain 
tax positions to underlying source documentation. 
In addition, we considered the tax implications of 
agreement with the relevant authorities.
We critically assessed through inquiry, corroboration 
and consultation with EY tax specialists the level of 
provision in relation to the likelihood of tax payable in 
each jurisdiction where material items remain unsettled. 
Our audit procedures also included an assessment of 
the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Based on our audit procedures we 
concluded that the tax provisions 
relating to transfer pricing exposures 
are recognised and disclosed 
appropriately.
As a Group team we have performed audit procedures 
over this area with support from our component teams 
in specific territories.
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
85 Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
The recognition of exceptional items 
relating to the Group’s major restructuring 
activities.
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(page 50); Accounting policies (page 102); 
and note 7 of the consolidated financial 
statements (page 109).
Exceptional items primarily relate to a Group-
wide restructuring project to rationalise the 
Group’s operations in the US and Europe.
Because of the nature and magnitude of 
the other exceptional items which have 
been recognised in 2015 we do not consider 
them to be part of this risk of misstatement.
We performed audit procedures over the restructuring 
provision to test that the requirements of IAS 37 (and 
IAS 19 for employee termination benefits) had been 
appropriately met in recognition of the provision. 
We reviewed the wording of the public announcement 
on 29 October 2015, as well as communications to 
employees, to check that the recognition criteria of 
IAS 37 had been met.
We obtained evidence for a sample of termination 
agreements, other employee-related costs and 
property exit costs.
We assessed the valuation of assets to check that no 
further impairment was required.
We examined the estimate of tax charges on closure 
of sites in each territory to check that estimated tax 
provisions were appropriate.
We checked that these items were excluded from 
underlying profit and disclosed appropriately in the 
annual accounts, and in accordance with the FRC 
disclosure requirements.
Based on our audit procedures we 
concluded that the exceptional 
charge and provision relating to 
the Group’s major restructuring 
activities are recognised and disclosed 
in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy for exceptional 
items. 
As a Group team we performed audit procedures over 
this risk area.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included risks of material misstatement in relation to the following matters which we 
do not consider to be subject to the same level of risk for 2015:
• Valuation of Model Solution put and call options – these were initially recognised and valued in 2014. For the current year 
the valuation calculation for these options is established and is not significantly sensitive to a change of assumptions. 
As such, we do not consider this a risk as defined above for the purposes of our audit report.
• Assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets – the market capitalisation of the Group as at the 
balance sheet date has significantly increased above the net asset value of the Group. Furthermore, based on our review 
of the Group’s value in use, we believe that the risk of impairment is not subject to the same level of risk as in previous 
years. As such, we do not consider this a risk as defined above for the purposes of our audit report.
THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our 
audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. 
We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes 
in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be 
performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 98 reporting components of the Group, 
we selected 14 components covering entities within the UK, the USA, the Czech Republic, Germany, China and South 
Korea, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the 14 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of six components 
(‘full scope components’) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining eight 
components (‘specific scope components’), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component 
that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either 
because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. The audit scope of these components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts 
tested for the Group.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED We consider revenue, profit before tax excluding non-recurring items, adjusted for loss-making entities and total assets to 
be key measures for the Group. 
We calculated profit before tax excluding non-recurring items, adjusted for loss-making entities. Included in full and 
specific scopes are three loss-making components.
2015 2014
Number of components subject to full audits 6 6
Number of components subject to specific scope audit procedures 8 10
Coverage of revenue from full scope components 53% 52%
Coverage of revenue from specific scope components 27% 26%
Coverage of revenue from full and specific scope components 80% 78%
Coverage of profit before tax excluding non-recurring items, adjusted  
for loss-making entities from full scope components
52% 57%
Coverage of profit before tax excluding non-recurring items, adjusted  
for loss-making entities from specific scope components

80% 76%
Coverage of total assets from full scope components 81% 70%
Coverage of total assets from specific scope components 9% 12%
Coverage of total assets from full and specific scope components 90% 82%
Of the remaining 84 components that together represent 20% of the Group’s profit before tax excluding non-recurring 
items, adjusted for loss-making entities, none are individually greater than 6% of the Group’s profit before tax excluding 
non-recurring items, adjusted for loss-making entities. For these components, to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group financial statements, we performed other procedures, including:
• Assigning a review scope to the next largest component representing 6% of profit before tax excluding non-recurring 
items, adjusted for loss-making entities, to identify any unusual transactions or indicators of misstatement.
• Performing specified procedures over the accounts receivable balance of the Group’s new acquisition, LS Research 
(‘LSR’).
• Centralised assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of entity-level controls.
• Testing of the Group consolidation, consolidation journals, intercompany eliminations and foreign currency 
recalculations centrally.
• A review of internal audit reports for any higher risk indicators.
• Testing procedures at the finance shared service centres which included those components not designated as full or 
specific scope.
• An analysis of significant variances in key financial statement line items year-on-year; and following up. For example, we 
obtained evidence of existence for a cash balance which had moved significantly.

87 The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.
  Full scope components    Specific scope components    Other procedures
The audit scope responded to the risks identified in the section above as described in the individual risk sections.
Changes from the prior year 
There are two fewer specific scope components than in the prior year. In the prior year one component was designated 
specific scope for a one-off transaction and the other component has decreased as a proportion of the total Group.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by us, as the Group audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY and big 4 
firms operating under our instruction. 
Of the six full scope components, audit procedures were performed on one of these directly by the Group audit team and 
the remainder by component audit teams. For the eight specific scope components the Group audit team performed 
the work for one component. For the remaining seven components the work was performed by component auditors. 
We determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor or his designate visits each full scope component at least once a year and mostly twice. We also visited 
the Group’s new acquisition, LSR.
During the current year’s audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the Group audit team to the component teams in the USA, 
the Czech Republic, China and South Korea. These visits involved:
• Discussing the audit approach and the relevant financial statement risks with the component team.
• Meeting with local management and attending planning and closing meetings.
• Reviewing key audit working papers on the relevant financial statement risk areas.
The Group team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, 
reviewed key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together 
with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements.
Last year the Group acquired Model Solution, a South Korean entity, of which EY is not the auditor. In 2015 the Group 
audit team instructed the local auditor (a member firm within the network of another Big 4 firm) to perform specific audit 
procedures designed to address the risks of material misstatement as outlined above and satisfied ourselves that their 
audit methodology was appropriate, along with their professional competency. The Group audit team performed the 
review procedures detailed above.

FOR LOSS‑ MAKING ENTITIES OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the 
nature and extent of our audit procedures.
The materiality we applied in the course of our audit was:
2015 2014
Materiality £3,000,000 £2,400,000
Performance materiality £2,250,000 £1,175,000
Audit differences reported £150,000 £120,000
We initially determined materiality for the Group as approximately 5% (2014, 5%) of profit before tax excluding 
non-recurring items. We used profit before tax excluding non-recurring items, to exclude non-recurring items, namely 
the total of those amounts as described in note 7 to the accounts. 
The increase in materiality year on year is due to the increase in the Group’s profit before tax excluding non-recurring items. 
Starting basis • Profit before tax – £15.4m
Adjustment • Non-recurring items, namely exceptional costs of £45.0m as per note 7
Materiality • Totals £60.4m
• Materiality of £3m (5% of materiality basis)
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and as the actual profit did not differ significantly we 
retained materiality at £3m.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2014, 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £2.25m 
(2014, £1.18m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that 
indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement 
accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for 
each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component and our view of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated to components where full and specific 
procedures were performed was £0.6m to £1.4m (2014, £0.5m to £1.1m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to it all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £150,000 
(2014, £120,000), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in 
light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
89 SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 83, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion:
• The part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
• The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
ISAs (UK and Ireland) reporting We are required to report to you if, in our opinion, financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report is: 
• Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements.
• Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit.
Otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired in the course of performing the audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business model and strategy; 
and whether the Annual Report appropriately addresses those matters that we 
communicated to the Audit Committee that we consider should have been disclosed.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.
Companies Act 2006 reporting We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us.
• The Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made.
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.
Listing Rules review requirements Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
The Directors’ statement in relation to going concern, set out on page 81, 
and longer-term viability, set out on page 81. 
The part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED STATEMENT ON THE DIRECTORS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT WOULD THREATEN 
THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY OF THE ENTITY
SAs (UK and Ireland) 
reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material 
to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• The Directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements.
• The Directors’ explanation in the Annual Report as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so 
and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to 
add or to draw 
attention to.

AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS
Explanatory note:
Simplifying the numbers... These notes provide additional detail and explanations on the disclosures within our Annual 
Report and Accounts. 
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 1 March 2016 and the statement of financial position was signed on the Board’s behalf by D C Lockwood and 
A J Quinlan. Laird PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted for use in the European Union (IFRS) and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in 
note 2. 
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
Explanatory note:
This section contains details of all the basic principles used to prepare the accounts.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial 
instruments and accounting for pensions, which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless 
otherwise indicated. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the 
directors to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods. 
Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors’ best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, 
actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill, the 
progress of the project to redesign the Company’s operating model in respect of which exceptional provisions were 
established in 2015, the measurement of defined benefit pension assets and obligations, the measurement of income 
and deferred taxes and the measurement of put and call options in respect of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. 
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in use 
of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. This involves estimation of future cash flows and 
choosing a suitable discount rate (see note 16). Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of 
future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates and the selection of a suitable discount rate (see note 34). 
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgements are applied in deciding the level of 
provisions for income taxes. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments 
will be made to provisions held in the period the determination is made (see note 2 Tax provisions below). Put and call 
options in respect of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries (see note 27) are stated at their fair value at each balance 
sheet date with changes being taken through the income statement.
The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2015 LAIRD PLC 
Annual Report & Accounts 2015

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings (‘the Group’). The financial statements of 
the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where 
appropriate. Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on 
which the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business combination is measured 
as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group. For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, costs directly attributable to the combination 
were capitalised. The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition 
date. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency. The functional 
currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. The presentation currency of 
the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted 
average rates of exchange for the period. Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from retranslating opening net investments and 
the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that 
provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity. All other exchange differences are dealt 
with in the income statement for the period.
Exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’ equity that relate to the 
disposed operation are transferred to the income statement.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra-group sales and value-added taxes and 
represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction 
will flow to the Group.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of 
financial position and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the income 
statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively. Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience 
of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected 
unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and 
to the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) and is based on actuarial 
advice. The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the 
liabilities are recognised at present value using a high-quality corporate bond rate.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a 
refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they 
become payable.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), Medium Term Incentive Plan (MTIP) and Restricted Share Plan (RSP) 
shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the LTIP, MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. Non-market company performance 
and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is 
recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of 
whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, 
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, 
be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is 
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not 
been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share 
based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of 
cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately. 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised 
separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives. 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful life of an intangible asset 
ranges between three and 20 years depending on its nature.
In 2015, software has been recognised separately within intangible assets. Previously it was included under Property, Plant 
and Equipment (note 15). Software in the prior year has not been reclassified, because it is impracticable to do.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which 
are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, and 
certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility have been met. Intangible assets arising in this manner 
are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically around four years. 
Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally acquired, 
are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment arise. 
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the income statement.
GOODWILL
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair value of 
the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are 
indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill set off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
INCOME TAXES
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 − where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction effects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
 − in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
 − deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. 
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
TAX PROVISIONS
Laird recognises certain provisions and accruals in respect of tax which involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty 
where the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until a resolution has been reached by the relevant tax authority. 
As a result of this approach Laird has recognised a provision of £25.4m as at 31 December 2015 (2014, £23.6m) 
which is included within Income tax payable under Non-current liabilities in the Group statement of financial position. 
The movement in the year is explained by the tax effect of the Operating Model redesign and the conclusion of overseas 
tax audit discussions (see note 11).
This amount is sensitive to the resolution of issues which are not always within the control of the Group and are often 
dependent on legal processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Issues can take many years 
to resolve and assumptions on the likely outcome have therefore been made by management.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The nature of the assumptions made by management when calculating the provision relate to the estimated tax which 
could be payable as a result of decisions by tax authorities in respect of transactions and events whose treatment for 
tax purposes is uncertain.
In making the estimates, management’s judgement was based on various factors, including:
 − the status of recent and current tax audits and enquiries;
 − the results of previous claims of a similar nature; 
 − any changes to the relevant tax legislation or its interpretation locally; and
 − any other relevant changes to the tax environment.
When making this assessment, we utilise our specialist in-house tax knowledge and experience of similar situations 
elsewhere to confirm these provisions. These judgements also take into consideration specialist tax advice provided 
by third party advisers on specific items as appropriate.

Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become 
a legal liability of the Company.
INTEREST
Interest is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and 
installation and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. For all other property, plant, and equipment 
depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives 
as follows:
Freehold buildings   50 years or less
Leasehold buildings   50 years or the lease term if less
Computer equipment   5 years or less
Motor vehicles    4 years
Other plant and machinery 13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less 
costs to sell and its value in use. This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are 
recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
LEASES
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated 
as a finance lease. All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to the income 
statement evenly over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value. Each asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. The obligations relating to finance leases, net 
of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non-current, trade and other 
payables. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
SEGMENT REPORTING
Segments are identified on the basis of management information which is presented to the Group’s Chief Operating 
Decision Maker to assess the performance of each segment.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
These items are presented within the relevant income statement category. The separate reporting of exceptional items 
helps provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. Events which are considered to 
be material and one off in nature and therefore may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include the 
restructuring of businesses (specifically in 2015 re-designing our operating model), the transaction costs of acquiring new 
businesses, gains or losses on the reassessment of estimated contingent consideration on acquired businesses, gains or 
losses on the reassessment of put and call options in respect of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, the integration of 
new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are 
recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at 
amortised cost less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence 
(such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to 
collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced 
through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable. 
Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Gains and 
losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments. 
These assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the 
income statement.
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised where:
 − the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
 − the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through profit or loss, 
directly attributable transaction costs. Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the 
carrying amount being taken through the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are 
recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
they occur.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with 
foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Any gains or 
losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the income 
statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts 
with similar maturity profiles. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, these are Level 2 derivative 
financial instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. This documentation 
identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how 
effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are 
expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
Net investment hedges
These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net assets of foreign operations. 
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in 
shareholders’ equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement. 
Fair value measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when 
an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. IFRS 13 
defines fair value as an exit price. As a result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group re-assessed its policies for measuring 
fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities. IFRS 13 
also requires additional disclosures.
Fair value hierarchy is provided in note 27 and derivative financial instruments are Level 1 under IFRS 13 unless 
otherwise disclosed.
TREASURY SHARES
The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust and the Laird PLC Employee Benefit Trust are 
classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘treasury shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of 
such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being 
taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of equity shares.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash in the statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents 
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes 
directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses (principally administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable 
value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution.
PROVISIONS
These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED 
The following amendments to existing standards were adopted for the financial year but with no impact on the 
financial statements:
IAS 19 Contributions from employees
IFRS 2 Definitions of performance and service conditions
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective for the financial period:
Effective date  
year starting
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards could have a material impact on the amounts reported and 
disclosures made on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application and plan to adopt these standards 
in line with their effective dates. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effects until a detailed review 
is completed.

TAXATION
Explanatory note:
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the amount payable on this year’s taxable profits 
(which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items which we are required 
to pay additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects 
where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Explanatory note:
Earnings per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that are attributable to each ordinary 
share we have in issue. The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year divided by 
the daily average of the number of shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the same profit 
but with the number of shares increased to reflect the daily average effect of relevant share options granted but not yet

UNDERLYING RESULTS
Explanatory note:
Underlying profit and earnings per share are shown as the Board considers them to be relevant guides to the performance 
of the Group.
Underlying tax is stated before exceptional items, deferred tax on the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, goodwill 
and US capitalised development costs, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses and the impact arising from the fair 
valuing of financial instruments. The deferred tax impact of short-term losses and current tax on the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets and goodwill are included in the calculation of underlying tax.
The underlying tax charge for the year is equivalent to 18.2% (2014, 18.4%) of underlying profit before tax.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Explanatory note:
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our 
business. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation is calculated by that cost, 
net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book 
value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.
Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are ready for use in the intended location.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Explanatory note:
This note shows the cost, amortisation and net book value of the non-physical assets controlled by us that we recognise 
in our business. The cost of an asset is the expense incurred to develop the asset internally (applies to capitalised 
development costs) or the cost incurred when the asset is purchased as part of a business combination (applies to all other 
intangible asset types). Amortisation is calculated differently, depending on the asset type. An asset’s net book value is its 
cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
CAPITALISED DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Internally generated assets arising from the capitalisation of qualifying development expenditure in 2015 typically have a 
finite expected useful life of around four years. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight line basis. 
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits. The total amount of research and 
development activity incurred during 2015 is £54.5m (2014, £49.7m) of which £14.7m (2014, £12.9m) was capitalised.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 36. No impairment 
to goodwill was identified.
Goodwill was tested for impairment for the following cash generating units (CGUs):
 − Performance Materials division
 − Wireless Systems division 
Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of £264.3m at the year end (2014, £256.5m). Wireless Systems had a 
goodwill balance of £232.2m at the year end (2014, £197.8m). All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use.
The key assumptions were:
 − A pre-tax discount rate of 9.6% (2014, 10.6%). 
 − Revenue growth rates for each CGU were based on relevant external market estimates and management knowledge. 
The discount rate has been applied to cash flow forecasts for 2015 to perpetuity. 
The forecast cash flows for 2016–2018 are based on what has been approved internally by the Board for the 2016 budget 
and for the medium term growth plans. Revenue estimates which underpin the forecasts for 2019–2020, have been 
based on external market estimates for PCs, Tablets, Smartphones, Transportation and Telecoms but after reflecting 
management’s views of average selling prices, product penetration trends and their impact on the size of the addressable 
market. Cash flows for 2020 onwards for both divisions have been increased by 3% per annum (2014, 3% per annum).
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash flow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the 
carrying value of the assets and provide further comfort that no impairment is required. Performance Materials has the 
greatest amount of headroom and Wireless Systems the least. There are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions 
that would give rise to an impairment.
OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits. 
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets:
Brand names – 5 years
Trade secrets – 8 to 15 years
Trade marks and names – 5 to 15 years
Patents – the remaining duration of the 16 year legal right
Licence – the remaining duration of the 19 year legal right
Customer relationships – 10 to 20 years
Software – 5 to 7 years
The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation on 
the customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period. Other than goodwill, the Group does not hold any 
intangible assets with an indefinite life.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Explanatory note:
This note provides both quantitative and descriptive information on acquisitions made by the Group in 2015 and 2014, 
including details of the acquisitions themselves, the net assets acquired and the consideration paid or payable.
ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES IN 2015
On 24 November 2015, the Group acquired 100% of LS Research (“LSR”), a US based leader in wireless product design 
and development for a total consideration of £36.5m ($55.0m). This acquisition adds new capabilities in embedded 
wireless solutions and services to Laird, provides us with new routes to market for our own products and most importantly, 
extends our reach, presence and capabilities in Enterprise Internet of Things. This purchase has been accounted for as 
an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The fair values are provisional. 
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements. 
Book and fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of LSR stated at rates of exchange at the date of acquisition, 
were as follows:

In the period following acquisition, revenue for LSR was £1.4m, there was a profit after tax of £nil and underlying profit 
before tax was £0.1m. If the acquisition had been held for the full year, Group revenues would have been £645.6m and 
the profit before tax would have been £1.4m higher at £16.8m. Included in the £24.3m of goodwill recognised above are 
certain assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. These items include the 
expected value of synergies. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED
ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES IN 2014 
On 17 April 2014, the Group acquired 51% of Model Solution Co.,Ltd (“Model Solution”), an unlisted South Korean company 
specialising in prototype design and manufacturing. The acquisition is in line with the strategy of diversifying both the 
Group geographic reach and customer base. An initial cash consideration of £20.5m was paid and a share of borrowings 
less cash and cash equivalents were acquired of £7.9m. This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition and 
all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill in the financial statements. 
The Group has elected to measure the non-controlling interest in Model Solution as the proportionate fair value of net 
assets acquired. 
Book and fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Model Solution stated at rates of exchange at the date of 
acquisition, were as follows:

In the period following acquisition, revenue for Model Solution was £17.6m, there was a profit after tax of £0.5m and 
underlying profit before tax was £1.8m. If the acquisition had been held for the full year, Group revenues would have been 
£571.3m and the profit before tax would have been £0.5m lower at £47.6m. Included in the £10.7m of goodwill recognised 
above are certain assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. These items 
include the expected value of synergies. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income 
tax purposes.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED
In accordance with the Shareholders’ agreement entered into between the Group and Skylake Consortium (“Skylake”) 
to acquire Model Solution the Group and Skylake are respectively granted call and put options which entitle the Group 
to purchase from Skylake and Skylake to sell to the Group Skylake’s 49% interest in Model Solution. The call options can 
be exercised by the Group on 17 April 2017, 2018 or 2019, and the put option can be exercised by Skylake on 17 April 2019 
and if none of these options are exercised then the Group is committed to acquire the 49% interest in Model Solution 
on 17 April 2020. The exercise price for the call and put options will be determined in accordance with the Shareholders’ 
agreement and will be between KRW 34.3bn (£20.1m) and KRW 92.7bn (£54.2m).
FINANCIAL LIABILITY – PUT OPTION
The financial liability that may become payable under the put option was initially recognised at a fair value of £33.3m 
within non-current liabilities with a corresponding charge directly to other reserves, as a put option written on 
non-controlling interest. The put option liability shall be re-measured at its fair value resulting from the change in the 
expected performance of Model Solution at each balance sheet date, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as an exceptional acquisition consideration related item. At 31 December 2015 the fair 
value was re-measured as £34.0m (2014, £32.6m) with a £1.4m charge (2014, £0.7m credit) recognised in the income 
statement. In the event that the put option lapses unexercised, the liability will be derecognised with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. 
FINANCIAL ASSET – CALL OPTION
There was a financial asset initially recognised of £1.0m within non-current assets in respect of the call option that the 
Group has over the non-controlling interests with a corresponding credit taken to goodwill. The call option asset will be 
re-measured at its fair value resulting from the change in the expected performance of Model Solution at each balance 
sheet date, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement as an exceptional acquisition 
consideration related item. At 31 December 2015 the fair value was re-measured as £0.7m (2014, £1.1m) with a £0.4m 
charge (2014, £0.1m credit) recognised in the income statement.

Group companies under these facilities were £150.4m (2014, £109.0m). Although these drawings are repayable within one year they are classified as long 
term as they can be refinanced under the terms of the facilities.
(c)  Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the facility, using the effective interest rate 
method.
(d)  The Group has finance leases due within one year of £nil (2014, £0.3m) for plant and machinery and due beyond one year of £7.0m (2014, £7.1m) for 
buildings. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where it is probable 
that there will be taxable profits against which these assets will be offset.
UNRECOGNISED TAX LOSSES
Deferred tax assets have not been established on trading losses of £37.7m (2014, £24.4m) where it is unlikely that future 
relief would be available at the balance sheet date. Of these losses, £1.8m (2014, £3.5m) have expiry dates between 
2015 and 2025 and £35.9m (2014, £20.9m) are available indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been established on 
capital losses of £3.7m (2014, £4.5m) where it is unlikely that future relief would be available at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on other deductible temporary differences of £16.8m (2014, £33.0m) where 
their use is restricted indefinitely.
TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH GROUP INVESTMENTS
Deferred tax of £1.7m (2014, £2.0m) has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where it is 
likely there will be income tax consequences attached to the payment of dividends. No deferred tax has been recognised 
in respect of temporary differences of £6.9m (2014, £6.9m) relating to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as 
the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable they will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 31 December 2015 represent only the unremitted earnings of those 
overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of 
dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE TAX CHARGES
The UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 19% effective 1 April 2017, and will then reduce further to 18% effective 1 April 
2020. Disclosure of deferred tax has been adjusted to reflect the enactment of the revised rates but with no significant 
impact on these financial statements.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures. The forward contracts 
have a principal value of £30.6m (2014, £120.8m) and are mainly denominated in US Dollar and Chinese Renminbi. 
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the decrease in fair value during 2015 of £0.5m (2014, 
£2.5m decrease) has been taken to the income statement. These are Level 2 derivative financial instruments and there has 
been no movement between levels during the year.

CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION

based on future revenue targets being met.

Exchange adjustment –
Non-current liability for contingent consideration as at 31 December 2014 –
Non-current liability for contingent consideration as at 31 December 2015 –
The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are revenue projections for Nextreme from 2014 to 2017 with a potential 
earnout payment based on a multiple of 0.4 times revenue and a discount rate applied as at 31 December being a 3 year 
UK Government bond yield. Revenues are estimated to be below the threshold requirement (£0.3m) in each of the years 
to December 2017 and accordingly there is expected to be no contingent consideration payable. In accordance with the 
fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, contingent consideration is classified as a Level 3 derivative financial instrument.
FINANCIAL LIABILITY – PUT OPTION
The financial liability that may become payable under a put option in respect of the non-controlling interest in Model 
Solution is recognised at a fair value of £34.0m (2014, £32.6m) within non-current liabilities. 
The exercise price for the put option will be calculated by dividing the EBITDA of Model Solution for the year to 31 March 
2019 by EBITDA for the year ended 31 March 2014 and applying this factor against a base price of KRW 34.3bn (£19.8m). 
The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are an EBITDA projection for Model Solution for the year to 31 March 2019 
and a discount rate of 2.6% applied at 31 December 2015 (2014, 2.86%).
The financial liability is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example a 10% increase in EBITDA for the year to 
31 March 2019 would result in an increase in the financial liability of £3.4m, while a 10% decrease would result in a decrease 
in the financial liability of £3.4m. An increase in the discount rate by 1% would result in a decrease in the financial liability of 
£1.1m, while a decrease in the discount rate by 1% would result in an increase in the financial liability of £1.1m. In accordance 
with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, the put option is classified as a Level 3 derivative financial instrument.
FINANCIAL ASSET – CALL OPTION
There is a financial asset recognised of £0.7m (2014, £1.1m) within non-current assets in respect of the call option that the 
Group has over the non-controlling interest in Model Solution.
The call option can be exercised by the Group on 17 April 2017, 2018 or 2019. The exercise price for the call option will 
be calculated by dividing the EBITDA of Model Solution for the year to 31 March prior to the date of exercise of the call 
option by EBITDA for the year ended 31 March 2014 and applying this factor against a base price of KRW 34.3bn (£19.8m). 
The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are a range of EBITDA projections for Model Solution for the years to the 
end of the financial month prior to the date of exercise of the call option and a discount rate being a Korean risk-free rate 
over the period to exercise, determined at 31 December 2015.
The financial asset is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example, a 10% increase in the base EBITDA scenario 
would result in a decrease in the financial asset of £0.2m, while a 10% decrease would result in an increase in the financial 
assets of £0.3m and a decrease in the discount rate by 1% would result in no material change to the financial asset, as 
would a 1% increase. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13, the call option is classified as a Level 3 
derivative financial instrument.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY PROFILE
The Group’s policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings. Interest rate 
swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs. At 31 December 2015 approximately 44% (2014, 49%) of 
debt is at fixed rate. This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s 
profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity. The interest 
rates considered are Sterling, Euro and US Dollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued debt and 
held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes 
those recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative floating rate financial instruments.

50 basis points increase in US Dollar interest rates 0.7
50 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 0.0

2014
50 basis points increase in US Dollar interest rates 0.5
50 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 0.0
50 basis points increase in Euro interest rates 0.1
A 50 basis point decrease in these interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect. 
CREDIT RISK
The Group’s customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal 
products with customers who themselves have significant market shares. Inevitably, this results in levels of business and 
trade receivables that are material in the overall Group context. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to 
the carrying amount of the financial assets.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than 
the functional currency of the subsidiary. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi. 
The Group policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then hedge out the 
residual exposures.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING
Included in borrowings are US $349.5m (£237.1m) and €35.0m (£25.8m) of debt which have been designated as a hedge 
of the net investments in the United States and Europe subsidiaries. This is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to 
foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity 
to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

borrowings are set out below:
Interest cover
The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation (“EBITA”) to be not less 
than 3.0 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio
Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”).
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2015.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The US Private Placement loans with a book value of £111.5m (2014, £106.8m) have an estimated fair value of £112.0m 
(2014, £110.2m) which has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2015.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

SPECIAL SHARE AWARDS
There were special share awards issued to Tony Quinlan in the year. Further detail is provided in the Directors’ 
remuneration report.
All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £2.7m was recognised in the year (2014, £1.8m) before 
employer’s national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded and 
the share options granted.

All options in the table above were recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as noted above. The weighted average share 
price at the date of exercise in 2015 was 357p (2014, 311p). For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2015, the 
weighted average remaining contractual life is 6.4 years (2014, 6.8 years). 
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including the market based 
performance conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non-market performance 
conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.

The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. 
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not 
necessarily prove to be the actual outcome. Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into 
account in calculating the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.

RESERVES
Explanatory note:
Reserves form part of shareholders’ equity. They are retained in the business and not distributed to shareholders.
TRANSLATION RESERVE
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries. It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
TREASURY SHARES
The investment in Laird shares are held by the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust and the Laird PLC Employee Benefit 
Trust, as described below, are treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes.
The Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust
The Trust purchases and holds shares in Laird PLC for the benefit of current and former employees. These shares may 
be used to satisfy options and awards. The Trust, which is financed by a loan of £5.5m from the Company, held 331,311 
ordinary shares at 31 December 2015 (2014, 754,916). Whilst shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in respect of 
those shares are exercisable by the trustee, in accordance with its fiduciary duties. The shares held by the Trust had a total 
market value at that date of £1.2m (2014, £2.3m).
The Laird PLC Employee Benefit Trust

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Explanatory note:
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our 
control; timing of the payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.
There are legal claims against the Company or its subsidiary undertakings but none where the Board takes the view 
that it is likely that damages will be awarded against the Group which would have a materially adverse effect on its 
financial position.

POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
Explanatory note:
The Group operates a number of schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types. Details of the 
schemes are included below.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the 
Group in respect of the current period.
PENSION AND SEVERANCE SCHEMES
Approximately 300 employees (2014, 250) are members of five different defined benefit schemes and these schemes 
have approximately 1,400 (2014, 1,400) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these 
schemes during the year were £0.6m (2014, £0.6m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2015, at their market value, is estimated at £106.0m 
(2014, £118.5m) and the liabilities estimated at £99.0m (2014, £115.4m). 
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise 
pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or benefit 
available in the form of reduced contributions. The resultant aggregate net pension asset under IAS 19 is £1.4m 
(2014, £1.7m liability).
DESCRIPTION OF THE SCHEMES 
UK 
In the UK, the Group supports the Laird Pension Scheme which is a funded arrangement providing defined benefits on a 
final salary basis. The Group also operates an unapproved arrangement which provides unfunded defined benefits on a 
final salary basis to certain members who were previously subject to the HMRC pension schemes earnings cap. Both of the 
UK arrangements are closed to new entrants. 
The Laird Pension Scheme makes up approximately 87% of the defined benefit liabilities of the Group. 
The Laird Pension Scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustee on behalf of the 
members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The scheme is subject to the 
scheme specific funding requirements as outlined in UK legislation. The most recent scheme specific funding valuation 
was at 1 January 2015. 
The Laird Pension Scheme’s investment strategy is to invest 25% in return-seeking assets and 75% in bonds and annuities. 
This strategy reflects the scheme’s liability profile whilst aiming to minimise long term costs by maximising return. 
The scheme’s assets are held separately from those of the Group.

POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED
Belgium 
In Belgium, the Group operates the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan which is a funded, insured lump sum defined 
benefit scheme and the Emerson and Cuming Pre-Pension Plan which is an unfunded plan where the employer pays a 
monthly indemnity until the retirement date on top of the unemployment allowances paid by the social security. 
Germany 
In Germany, the Group operates the Cattron-Theimeg Europe GmbH & Co. KG Pension Plan. This is a funded defined 
benefit scheme currently providing pension benefits to 7 pensioners (2014, 7).
Sweden
Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme included within a multi-employer plan for its employees which is insured 
with Alecta. This scheme is a defined benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide sufficient information 
to report the Group’s proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and 
expenses associated with the scheme. Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Group’s 
proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme. As a result, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined 
contribution scheme, although it is actually a defined benefit scheme.
Korea
Within Korea, the Group operates the Model Solution severance scheme under Korean Labour law. This provides a 
payment to an employee in the event their service is terminated, if they resign or if they retire. On any of these events, 
employees will receive a lump sum approximately equal to one month of salary for each year of service. The scheme is 
partially funded to a level of 70% (by law at least 60% of the accrued liabilities must be funded).
The benefits provided, the approach to funding and the legal basis of the non UK plans reflect their local environments. 
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate is set according to the level of market yields on either corporate or government 
bonds in the relevant markets.
The market value of the schemes’ assets, the present value of the schemes’ liabilities and the net pension assets and 
liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows:

90% multiplier for Executives and Directors and 110% for all other members, appropriate for each member’s year of 
birth. Allowance is made for improvements in line with CMI (2014) projections with a 1.5% pa long term trend from 2002. 
The expected lifetime of a participant at 31 December 2015 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who

For IAS 19 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial 
assumptions were inflation of 3.2% per annum (2014, 3.2%), salary increases of 3.2% – 4.2% per annum (2014, 4.2% – 5.2%) 
and a discount rate for liabilities of 3.7% per annum (2014, 3.6%).

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS 
Over the year to 31 December 2016 the Group is expected to contribute 34.4% of pensionable salaries in respect of 
Ordinary Section members and 62.8% of pensionable salaries in respect of Executive Section members of the Laird 
Pension Scheme. In addition, the Group will meet the cost of Pension Protection Levies, death in service premiums and 
other administration expenses associated with the Laird Pension Scheme. The Group is expected to make contributions of 
approximately £0.1m to the Emerson and Cuming Pension Plan and £0.1m to the Swedish scheme insured with Alecta. 
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to the defined benefit schemes will be £0.7m in 2016.
The average duration of the liabilities of the Laird Pension Scheme is approximately 16 years. 
KEY RISKS
The ultimate cost of the schemes to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. 
Many of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the schemes may be 
higher (or lower) than disclosed. In general, the risk to the Group is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the 
calculation of contribution requirements are not borne out in practice and the cost to the Group is higher than expected. 
More specifically, some of the significant risks are detailed below: 
 − Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields whereas the 
schemes hold a mixture of investments; if assets underperform the corporate bond yield, this may create a deficit. 
 − Inflation risk: The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. 
 − Changes in corporate bond yields: A fall in corporate bond yields will lead to an increase in liabilities. This will be only 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the corporate bonds held by the schemes.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The results in these disclosures are inherently volatile, particularly the figures shown on the balance sheet. The table below 
shows the approximate sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in assumptions to illustrate this volatility.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £6.5m 
Inflation Decrease by 0.5%
Increase by 0.5%
Decrease by £3.5m
Increase by £3.5m
Assumed life expectancy at age 65 0.25% reduction in the long term  
trend of 1.5% to 1.25%
Decrease by £1.0m
METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The sensitivity analysis shown above has been calculated based on approximate adjustments to the scheme liabilities using 
a consistent methodology with that used to calculate the liabilities. The impact on the liabilities has been rounded to the 
nearest £0.5m. 
The sensitivity analysis to price inflation includes the impact of a change in both Retail Price Inflation and Consumer 
Price Inflation, as well as those assumptions which are derived relative to these measures (salary increase, revaluation 
of deferred pensions and increases to pensions in payment). For this purpose it has been assumed that the differences 
between RPI/CPI and these related assumptions remains the same unless there are any caps or floors on the pension 
increases, in which case these have been applied. 
35 POST BALANCE SHEET
On 20 January 2016, the Group acquired Novero, a Germany based provider of integrated vehicles connectivity systems 
for a total consideration of €65m. The consideration was satisfied through a share issue valued at €15.5m with the balance 
paid in cash. Book and fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities of Novero have not been provided because the 
accounting is not yet complete in the time available post acquisition.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH FRS 101
The parent company financial statements of Laird PLC (the “Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2015 were 
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 1 March 2016 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by 
D C Lockwood and A J Quinlan. The Company is a public limited company, is incorporated and domiciled in England and 
Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. These financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention.
No profit and loss account has been presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred 
thousand unless otherwise indicated.
The results of the Company are included in the preceding Group financial statements.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company has transitioned to FRS 101 from previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) 
for all periods presented. Note 17 contains detail of all transition adjustments.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2015.
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
 − The requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements in respect of paragraph 79(a) (iv) of 
IAS 1; paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment; paragraph 118(e) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets; and the 
requirement of paragraph 134 in respect of capital disclosures;
 − The requirement of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows;
 − The requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18(a) of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures;
 − The requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two 
or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such 
a member; 
 − The requirements of IAS 8 Standards Issued But Not Effective; 
 − The requirements of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments; and
 − The requirements of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of Financial Reporting Standards paragraphs 6 to 21 to present an 
opening statement of financial position at transition.
JUDGEMENT AND KEY SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTIES
Share based payments
Estimating fair value for share based transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model which 
depends on the terms and condition of the grant. This estimation also requires determination of the most appropriate 
inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option or appreciation right, volatility and dividend 
yield and making assumptions about them.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises 
the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and installation and 
assembly costs.
For all other property, plant, and equipment depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual 
values of the assets over their useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment 5 years or less
Other plant and machinery 13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market.
PENSIONS
Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of 
financial position and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the income 
statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively. Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience 
of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected 
unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and 
to the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) and is based on actuarial 
advice. The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial position and the 
liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate. 
The Company applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Company to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right 
to a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they 
become payable.
INVESTMENTS
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they become a 
legal liability of the Company.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but which have not reversed at the 
balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or 
a right to pay less, or to receive more tax subject to the following:
(a)  Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding 
sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date. Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is 
not recognised.
(b)  Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as receivable 
or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
(c)  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as 
recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future 
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency assets 
and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the time 
value of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost. Provisions are made when there is objective evidence 
that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery 
is assessed as being remote. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the loans and receivables 
are derecognised or impaired.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, inclusive of any transaction costs. Measurement after initial 
recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss account.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are 
recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
PROVISIONS
These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.

TREASURY SHARES 
The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) are classified in shareholders’ equity as 
‘treasury shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, 
with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss 
is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird PLC Employee Benefit Trust (“the EBT Trust”) are classified in shareholders’ equity 
as ‘treasury shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in 
equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate 
fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value 
is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts 
with similar maturity profiles. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13 these are Level 2 derivative 
financial instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken 
to the profit and loss account.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), Medium Term Incentive Plan (MTIP) and Restricted Share Plan (RSP) 
shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the LTIP, MTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. Non-market company performance 
and service conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is 
recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of 
whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied. 
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions, 
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, 
be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is 
recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not 
been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share 
based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification. 
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of 
cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately.

(a) Company borrowings are unsecured. 
(b)  The Company had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of £255.0m (2014, £250.0m) which were underwritten in excess of four years. 
Drawings by Group companies under these facilities were £150.4m (2014, £109.0m). Although these drawings are repayable within one year they 
are classified as long term as they can be refinanced under the terms of the facilities. 
(c)  Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the facility, using the effective interest 
rate method.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Derivative financial instruments 
The Company holds forward foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures. The forward contracts 
have a principal value of £30.6m (2014, £120.8m) and are mainly denominated in US Dollar and Chinese Renminbi. 
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the decrease in fair value during 2015 of £0.5m 
(2014, £2.5m decrease) has been taken to the income statement. These are Level 2 derivative financial instruments and 
there has been no movement between levels during the year.
Interest rate and currency profile
The Company’s policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings. 
Interest rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs. At 31 December 2015 approximately 
44% (2014, 49%) of debt is at fixed rate. This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk
The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the 
Company’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the Company’s 
equity. The interest rates considered are Sterling, Euro and US Dollar, being the currencies in which the Company has 
historically issued debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes 
those recognised at fair value as well as all non-derivative floating rate financial instruments.

Credit risk
The Company’s customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its 
principal products with customers who themselves have significant market shares. Inevitably this results in levels of 
business and trade receivables that are material in the overall Company context. The Company’s maximum exposure 
to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Foreign currency risk
The Company is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other 
than the functional currency of the subsidiary. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollar, Euro and 
Renminbi. The Company policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then 
hedge out the residual exposures.
The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US Dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against 
sterling with all other variables held constant, of the Company’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of 
monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts) and the Company’s equity (due to changes in the fair value 
of forward currency hedges and net investment hedges).

Net investment hedging
Included in borrowings are US $349.5m (£237.1m) and €35.0m (£25.8m) of debt which have been designated as a hedge 
of the net investments in the United States and Europe subsidiaries. This is being used to hedge the Company’s exposure 
to foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to 
equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

The Company ensures that there are sufficient levels of committed facilities, cash and cash equivalents in place to meet its 
financial commitments as they fall due.
Undrawn committed borrowing facilities
The Company’s financial policy is to maintain committed borrowing facilities, which provide substantial headroom over 
and above its day-to-day borrowing requirements. 
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December were as follows:
2015  
£m
2014

Expiring between two and three years – –
Expiring between four and five years 103.5 139.6
Loan covenants
The principal covenants in the Company’s committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on net 
borrowings are set out below:
Interest cover
The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation (“EBITA”) to be not less 
than 3.0 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio
Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”).
The Company was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2015.
Fair value of financial instruments
The US Private Placement loans with a book value of £111.5m (2014, £106.8m) have an estimated fair value of £112.0m 
(2014, £110.2m) which has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 31 December 2015.
There are no material differences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

The amount of deferred tax that has not been provided on non-trading losses is £8.7m (2014, £9.2m) and other deductible 
temporary differences is £nil (2014, £1.0m) where it is unlikely that future relief would be available at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on capital losses of £3.7m (2014, £4.5m) where it is unlikely that future 
relief would be available at the balance sheet date.
12 POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Company operates two defined benefit schemes.
Five employees (2014, 5) are members of these defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,400 
(2014, 1,400) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year were 
£0.1m (2014, £0.1m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2015 at their market value is estimated at £102.4m  
(2014, £114.9m) and the liabilities estimated at £92.6m (2014, £108.1m).
The Company has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Company to 
recognise pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund 
or benefit available in the form of reduced contributions. The resultant aggregate net pension asset under IAS 19 is 
£4.3m (2014, £2.0m asset).

multiplier for Executives and Directors and 110% for all other members, appropriate for each member’s year of birth. 
Allowance is made for improvements in line with CMI (2014) projections with a 1.5% p.a. long term trend from 2002. 
The expected lifetime of a participant at 31 December 2015 who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant 
who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these mortality tables:

For IAS 19 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial 
assumptions were inflation of 3.2% per annum (2014, 3.2%), salary increases of 3.2% – 4.2% per annum (2014, 4.2% – 5.2%) 
and a discount rate for liabilities of 3.7% per annum (2014, 3.6%).

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS 
Over the year to 31 December 2016 the Company is expected to contribute 34.4% of pensionable salaries in respect 
of Ordinary Section members and 62.8% of pensionable salaries in respect of Executive Section members of the Laird 
Pension Scheme. In addition, the Company will meet the cost of Pension Protection Levies, death in service premiums and 
other administration expenses associated with the Laird Pension Scheme. 
The Company estimates that the total value of contributions to the defined benefit schemes will be £0.1m in 2016.
The average duration of the liabilities of the Laird Pension Scheme is approximately 16 years. 
KEY RISKS
The ultimate cost of the schemes to the Company will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions 
made. Many of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the schemes may 
be higher (or lower) than disclosed. In general, the risk to the Company is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, 
or the calculation of contribution requirements are not borne out in practice and the cost to the Company is higher 
than expected. 
More specifically, some of the significant risks are detailed below: 
 − Asset volatility: The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields whereas the 
schemes hold a mixture of investments; if assets underperform the corporate bond yield, this may create a deficit. 
 − Inflation risk: The majority of the benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. 
 − Changes in corporate bond yields: A fall in corporate bond yields will lead to an increase in liabilities. This will be only 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the corporate bonds held by the schemes. 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The results in these disclosures are inherently volatile, particularly the figures shown on the balance sheet. The table below 
shows the approximate sensitivity of the balance sheet position to changes in assumptions to illustrate this volatility.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by £6.5m
Inflation Decrease by 0.5% 
Increase by 0.5%
Decrease by £3.5m 
Increase by £3.5m
Assumed life expectancy at age 65 0.25% reduction in the long term trend of 
1.5% to 1.25%
Decrease by £1.0m
METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The sensitivity analysis shown above has been calculated based on approximate adjustments to the scheme liabilities using 
a consistent methodology with that used to calculate the liabilities. The impact on the liabilities has been rounded to the 
nearest £0.5m. 
The sensitivity analysis to price inflation includes the impact of a change in both Retail Price Inflation and Consumer 
Price Inflation, as well as those assumptions which are derived relative to these measures (salary increase, revaluation 
of deferred pensions and increases to pensions in payment). For this purpose it has been assumed that the differences 
between RPI/CPI and these related assumptions remains the same unless there are any caps or floors on the pension 
increases, in which case these have been applied.

17 TRANSITION TO FRS 101
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in 
accordance with previously extant UK GAAP. These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are the first 
the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual financial statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in 
the relevant notes.
In preparing these financials statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014, 
the Company’s date of transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements 
required for the first time adoption of FRS 101. As such, this note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company 
in restating its balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 prepared under previously extant UK GAAP and its previously published 
UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements of paragraphs 6-33 of IFRS 1 “First time adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards”, except for the requirement of paragraphs 6 and 21 to present an opening 
statement of financial position and the date of transition.

Recognition of pension scheme surplus
IFRIC 14 allows the Company to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to a refund or benefit 
available in the form of reduced contributions exists. The adjustment relates to the recognition of the allowable surplus, 
previously unrecognised under UK GAAP on the balance sheet, with the movement in disallowed assets recognised 
through the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.

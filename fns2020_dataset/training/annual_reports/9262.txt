Hamriyah
This portside facility of 335,000m² 
has direct quayside access, and 
primarily undertakes jackup rig 
upgrade and refurbishment 
projects together with new build 
projects and oilfield engineering 
related works.
The core workforce at this facility 
as with both the Sharjah and the 
Jebel Ali facilities workforce is 
supplemented from the local 
labour market when required  
to meet the demands of  
specific projects.
Hamriyah includes a deepwater 
berthing quay wall 1,439m in 
length and 9m deep which 
enables Lamprell to work on 
multiple rigs and simultaneously 
undertake new build 
construction projects.
l amprell at a g lance
Lamprell has three facilities located in 
the UAE in the Arabian Gulf, one of 
the most important oil and gas 
regions in the world. 
Jebel Ali
Lamprell’s Jebel Ali facility was 
purpose built in 2002 and is one 
of the most modern in the region. 
It is located in the Jebel Ali Free 
Zone and is 25km from the  
centre of Dubai.
The facility occupies an area of 
178,900m² that includes more 
than 16,000m² of covered work 
spaces with internal overhead 
cranes suitable for carrying out 
fabrication and assembly 
activities under cover. 
The covered areas also contain 
the latest welding and CNC 
cutting machinery. This protected 
work environment is cooler, safer 
and more productive than an 
outside location, and it allows the 
production of a higher quality 
product at less cost. The yard 
was designed to allow optimum 
production based on a clear and 
logical flow of material through 
the facility. In addition to the 
covered fabrication areas it has 
extensive open fabrication areas 
that are equipped with gantry and 
mobile crawler cranes Saudi Arabia

2010 was a year of significant 
progress for the Company, with 
Lamprell starting to feel the 
commercial benefits of the 
expansion both of its physical 
presence and its service offering. 
The Company reported revenues of 
USD 503.8 million for the year, an 
increase of 18.4 per cent on 2009, 
and net profit of USD 65.2 million, 
129.6 per cent higher than the prior 
year. At the close of the year the 
Company’s order book stood at a 
record high of USD 850 million.
The Company’s careful management 
of capital expenditure during the 
economic crisis, coupled with a 
carefully phased expansion of its 
Hamriyah facility, provided a strong 
foundation from which to meet the 
opportunities of an improving 
market.
It was particularly pleasing, in that 
context, to see a number of sizeable 
new build contracts awarded in 
2010 for both jackup rigs and 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessels. These included the award 
in July, of the USD 317 million 
contract by National Drilling 
Company, Abu Dhabi, for the 
construction and delivery of two 
jackup rigs. This contract supported 
our view that there were (and 
continue to be) a growing number of 
opportunities in the new build rig 
market. This view was reinforced by 
the award, in November, of a USD 
210 million contract by Eurasia 
Drilling Company Limited for a 
jackup rig (the largest contract in 
Lamprell’s history for the 
construction of a single unit), and by 
the award, in February of this year, 
by Greatship Global Energy 
Services Pte. Ltd. of a contract for 
the construction of a new build 
jackup rig.
These wins came on top of 
important awards earlier in the year 
in one of the Company’s newer 
markets. In February 2010, the 
Company won a significant contract

amounting to USD 320.4 million 
from Fred Olsen Windcarrier AS for 
the construction of two offshore 
wind turbine installation vessels. 
In June 2010, the Company was 
awarded a USD 129.0 million 
contract by Seajacks for the design, 
construction and delivery of an 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessel. Both these contracts 
reinforce Lamprell’s strong position 
in a market with significant medium 
to long-term potential.
The Company experienced a slow 
down in rig refurbishment in 2010, 
with jackup rig upgrade and 
refurbishment activity at a lower level 
of average expenditure than in 2009, 
however there are now signs of 
recovery in this segment, and the 
Company has continued to see 
evidence of improvements in most 
of its other operating markets. 
Lamprell’s bid activity is at a  
record high.
I am pleased to announce that, 
having considered the current 
market conditions, profit earned 
and cash generated during the 
year ended 31 December 2010, 
the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 9.50 cents per share. If 
approved, the final dividend will 
be paid on 17 June 2011 to 
shareholders who were on the 
register on 13 May 2011.
Having been appointed Chief 
Operating Officer in March 2010, 
I was delighted to welcome Chris 
Hand to the Board in January 2011.
I am confident that Lamprell’s 
reputation for quality, its technical 
capabilities and expertise and 
timely project execution and 
delivery, will enable the Company 
to continue to deliver value for all its 
stakeholders.
I am particularly grateful, once again, 
for the dedication and hard work of 
all Lamprell’s management and staff.

2010 proved to be a very positive 
year for the Company as we saw 
significant improvement in many of 
our operating markets after the 
turbulent period experienced 
during the economic crisis.
Strengthening oil prices have 
contributed to unprecedented levels 
of enquiries and bid activity. A 
positive development was the 
unforeseen turnaround in the new 
build jackup market in the second 
half of the year. This was in part 
triggered by a post Macondo effect 
but moreover by a continuing drive 
for more modern, cost effective and 
efficient drilling units designed to 
meet the ever increasing technical 
demands of the drilling industry.
Given the continuing emergence 
from the global financial crisis the 
results for the year were very 
pleasing with revenues for the year 
totalling USD 504 million, resulting 
in a net profit for the period of 
USD 66.6 million (USD 65.2 million 
after exceptional charges), 
reinforcing the strong commercial 
foundations of the business and 
the benefits of our tight 
management of operational and 
capital expenditure over the last 
two years.
The prevailing economic climate, 
whilst still uncertain in a number of 
ways, has provided a more stable 
backdrop in recent months, and 
the strengthening oil price has 
encouraged more operator activity, 
improving sentiment throughout 
the industry’s supply chain.
Our long-standing strategy of 
maintaining a strong balance sheet 
has continued to underpin our 
disciplined fiscal approach even as 
markets became more active, and 
this rigorous control remains central 
to our activities.
We also continue to focus on 
delivering best in class execution 
of projects, on time and on budget. 
This has long been our operating 
benchmark, and yet again in 2010 
we saw the benefits of this 
delivery-led strategy as repeat 
business contributed significantly to 
revenues. We believe that this close 
attention to providing our customers 
with exactly what they require is 
fundamental in ensuring the long 
term growth of our business.
Throughout 2010 the Company 
continued to place great emphasis 
on the development and application 
of practices designed to provide a 
workplace that is both safe and 
which minimises environmental 
impact. In 2011 the Company 
remains focused on these key 
aspects of the operation of 
its business.
Significant project milestones 
during the year included the 
Company delivering its first new 
build tender assist drilling barge, 
BassDrill Alpha, in January 2010 as 
well as resolving the outstanding 
payment issue relating to the 
barge. The Company received a 
cash payment of USD 55 million 
and 28,000,000 shares in BassDrill, 
representing 20% of BassDrill’s 
equity. The Company has recently 
exercised its put option in respect 
of these shares, receiving  
USD 2.6 million as consideration 
for its shareholding. 
In April 2010 we were very pleased 
to deliver our second new build 
LeTourneau Super 116E jackup 
drilling rig, the Offshore Mischief, to 
Scorpion Rigs LTD. Other notable

projects executed during the year 
included the fabrication of the 
Livorno FPSO process modules for 
Saipem S.p.A. with the final module 
being delivered in September 2010 
together with the construction of 
two offshore well-head platforms for 
a leading oil and gas operator in 
India, which were completed and 
delivered in Q1 2011.
2010 was our most successful year 
in terms of new orders amounting 
to USD 1.2 billion, with our order 
book standing at USD 850 million 
at the end of the period.
Particularly pleasing were a 
number of new build construction 
contracts for both self-propelled 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessels and jackup drilling rigs.
In February, the Company 
announced that it had received 
two significant new contract 
awards from Fred Olsen 
Windcarrier AS (“Windcarrier”), 
which in aggregate totalled 
USD 320.4 million. 
The Engineering, Procurement & 
Construction (“EPC”) contract 
awards from Windcarrier were for 
the design, construction and 
delivery of two Gusto MSC NG-
9000 design self elevating and 
self-propelled offshore wind turbine 
installation vessels. Both vessels will 
be constructed at Lamprell’s Jebel 
Ali facility and will be delivered in Q2 
and Q3 of 2012. 
In addition to these contracts for 
two units, Lamprell and Windcarrier 
executed an option agreement for 
two further vessels, the first of 
which has now lapsed, whereas the 
second may be exercised up until 
August 2011.

the construction and commissioning 
in a shipyard, which is yet to be 
determined, in the Caspian Sea. The 
project is planned to be completed 
24 months from the commencement 
of construction.
February 2011 saw the award of a 
further contract for the construction 
of a LeTourneau Super 116 E 
(Enhanced) Class design rig for a 
new client, Greatship Global 
Energy Services Pte. Ltd., based in 
Singapore. The unit is scheduled 
for delivery in Q4 2012.
Having phased the expenditure on 
the expansion of our facility in the 
Hamriyah Free Zone to reflect the 
prevailing economic conditions, we 
are now seeing the benefits of the 
increased capacity. The significantly 
enlarged quayside has enabled us 
to work on as many as 11 rigs at 
one time, thereby increasing the 
potential of both our rig 
refurbishment and new build 
construction businesses.
Due to the increasing level of 
fabrication activity the Company is 
in advanced negotiation to acquire 
an additional 40,000m
2 
of land 
immediately adjacent to our 
existing yard bringing the total 
area within the Hamriyah Free Zone 
to 335,000m

.
In rig refurbishment we have 
worked on a total of 43 jackup rigs 
in 2010 and these projects have 
included work scopes covering the 
full range of our upgrade and 
refurbishment services. Projects 
We believe that our early entry 
into this new and promising 
construction market, with the 
Company now regarded as one of 
the leading providers of liftboats for 
offshore wind turbine installation, 
positions the Company well as the 
offshore wind sector matures in the 
medium and longer term.
This early positioning and the 
revenue benefits of repeat business 
were reinforced by the receipt in July 
of a USD 129.0 million new contract 
award from Seajacks 3 LTD for the 
design, construction and delivery 
of a Gusto MSC NG-5500 design 
self-elevating and self-propelled 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessel. The vessel, named “Seajacks 
Zaratan”, will be constructed at 
Lamprell’s Hamriyah facility and is 
due to be delivered in 2012.
It was also pleasing to see more 
positive signs of a strengthening of 
the new build jackup rig market with 
the Company receiving a USD 317 
million contract award from National 
Drilling Company (“NDC”), Abu 
Dhabi in July. This contract with NDC 
is for the construction and delivery of 
two jackup rigs valued at USD 158.5 
million each. The rigs will be 
completely outfitted and equipped, 
LeTourneau designed, self-elevating 
Mobile Offshore Drilling Platforms of 
a Super 116E (Enhanced) Class 
design. Work on the first rig 
commenced in August with delivery 
scheduled for the middle of Q2 2012.
As part of the contract, NDC has 
options for Lamprell to build two 
further jackup rigs, valued at 
USD 158.5 million per rig, exercisable 
during the 12 month period 
commencing on 1 August 2010. 
The NDC contract award facilitated 
the resolution of the Riginvest 
contract issue. Lamprell and 
Riginvest agreed that the contract 
for the construction of a 
LeTourneau Super 116E jackup 
drilling rig terminated upon 
signature of the contract between 
NDC and Lamprell. The rig that 
was being built for Riginvest would 
now be built for NDC. Riginvest 
received a portion of the contract 
advance it initially paid to Lamprell 
as part of the termination 
agreement. From an accounting 
perspective, pursuant to 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards, the cancellation of the 
Riginvest contract created a 
material one-off accounting gain in 
the Company’s financial statements 
for 2010, totalling USD 20.4 million, 
reflecting the gain net of additional 
provisions arising as a result of the 
contract cancellation.
A further positive development for 
our EPC business saw the award in 
November of a USD 210 million 
contract from Eurasia Drilling 
Company Limited for the 
construction and delivery of a 
completely outfitted and equipped, 
LeTourneau designed, self-elevating 
Mobile Offshore Drilling Platform of a 
Super 116E (Enhanced) Class

have been shared between our 
UAE facilities, with Sharjah working 
on 21 rigs and the Hamriyah facility 
working on 22 jackups. As 
previously guided, the jackup rig 
upgrade and refurbishment activity 
in 2010 was at a lower level of 
average expenditure than in the 
prior year. It remains challenging to 
anticipate activity in this segment 
given the relatively short cycle 
between bidding and the award of 
work. There are, however, 
encouraging signs of renewed 
activity in this market, with the 
Company well placed to receive 
further awards in the near future.
Throughout 2010 we continued to 
construct FPSO process modules 
for Saipem S.p.A and Saipem 
Energy Services S.p.A at our  
Jebel Ali facility and believe that 
this segment of our business will 
benefit from the strengthening oil 
price in the medium term. 
Towards the end of 2010 the 
Company established a core 
Strategic Development Group 
comprising industry specialists 
who are currently working on a 
number of bespoke engineering 
solutions for the upstream 
petroleum sector.
We continue to review all our 
operations to ensure they are 
creating value for our shareholders. 
After a review by management, the 
Board has now agreed to terminate 
the Group’s operation in Thailand 
with effect from 31 December 
2010. The total cost of closing the 
facility was not material.
t he board
In March 2010 Chris Hand was 
appointed as Chief Operating 
Officer, and joined the Board in 
January 2011. Chris brings to the 
Board 15 years of experience with 
Lamprell and I am certain he will 
make a very valuable contribution 
in the coming years. In December, 
Scott Doak, our Chief Financial 
Officer, informed the Board that he 
wishes to leave the Company by 
the end of 2011 to pursue other 
interests. Scott will, by then, have 
spent almost five years with the 
Company and played a significant 
part in taking the Company on to 
The London Stock Exchange AIM 
market, on to the Main List and 
through one of the most difficult 
periods the industry has ever 
faced. We would like to thank Scott 
for his hard work and 
professionalism undertaken during 
this very demanding period in the 
Company's history. The Company 
is currently seeking a successor to 
Scott. Scott will facilitate the 
handover to the new person when 
he or she has been appointed.
market overview
The Company has a record bid 
pipeline at this time. In particular 
we have seen an increase in 
activity levels in the new build 
jackup market, reflecting the 
current buoyancy of that market 
segment. While the full impact of 
the deepwater Macondo oil spill in 
the US Gulf of Mexico on the wider 
rig market has yet to fully unwind, 
many sector analysts are predicting 
a continuation in the new build 
programmes as the market for 
higher specification rigs remains 
strong. As the search for oil and 
gas becomes increasingly more 
technically demanding rigs that can 
drill deeper, horizontal wells more 
cost effectively in deeper, harsh 
environment, waters will demand 
higher day-rates and hence will 
help drive the new build rig 
construction market.
As previously reported, we 
experienced a slowdown in the 
rig refurbishment market in the 
second half of 2010, however 
there are now encouraging signs 
of renewed activity in this market. 
We continue to see significant 
potential for Lamprell in the liftboat 
market in the medium and longer 
term and aim to build on our early 
leadership position in this part of 
our business.
The Company is actively pursuing a 
number of exciting prospects for its 
oilfield engineering business 
including new build land rigs, 
refurbishment projects and 
equipment overhaul and is 
confident that new business for this 
segment can be secured in the 
coming months.
Dividend
The Board of Directors is 
recommending a final dividend 
payment of 9.50 cents per ordinary 
share. This will be payable, when 
approved, on 17 June 2011 to 
eligible shareholders on the register 
at 13 May 2011.
o utlook
Building upon the success of 2010, 
2011 has started encouragingly. 
We maintain our focus on existing 
core business, together with 
complementary markets. The 
Company is confident in its 
prospects for future growth and 
success, both for the current year 
and in the longer term, based upon 
both its record order book position, 
and the strengthening which it sees 
in its key markets.
I would again like to take this 
opportunity to express my 
personal thanks, together with 
those of the Board of Directors, to 
all of our management, staff and 
employees for their hard work and 
dedication which they have given 
throughout the year. With over 
5,000 employees it is indeed a 
credit and achievement that 
everyone has played their part in 
the success of the Company. On a 
final note I would like to thank our 
founder and President, Steven 
Lamprell, for his continuing 
encouragement and support.

Lamprell’s Procurement and Supply Chain 
(“PSC”) business model revolves around 
three discrete but nonetheless linked 
activities of: Source, Buy, and Deliver.
Source involves the development and execution of 
global sourcing strategies for products and materials 
required for both our projects and our operations. 
It also involves the effective management of 
supplier relationships.
Buy involves the creation of purchase orders, the 
expediting of deliveries, the maintenance of data 
and support for the estimating process.
Deliver involves the management of all inbound 
freight, warehousing and inventory management 
processes plus the optimisation of all associated 
logistics processes.
As a means to deliver more value from procurement 
and supply chain work, Lamprell has established a 
Strategic Procurement initiative to deliver savings 
through the consolidation of spend to a smaller 
number of contracted suppliers where volume is 
exchanged for both price and other commercial 
benefits.
Having segmented our suppliers in terms of the value 
of spend and risk to the business, the PSC team have 
researched, tendered and negotiated Framework 
Agreements for commodities and services which are 
both critical and strategic to the business. 
Through the Framework Agreements we have 
delivered savings in two ways: 
1.  The delivery of direct and tangible measurable 
benefits to the business including: 
> unit price reduction;
> working capital reduction;
> product substitution; and
> demand reduction.
2.  The delivery of less tangible but valuable benefits 
to the business including:
> improving safety; 
> reducing risk;
> providing innovation;
> enhancing brand image;
> positively contributing to the environment; and
> enhancing Corporate Social Responsibility.
Although the strategic procurement initiative is at an 
early stage 16 Framework Agreements have been 
completed capturing direct savings and other benefits 
such as extended warranty terms and enhanced 
safety by eliminating all acetylene gases from 
our facilities. 
Our strategic procurement work continues for the 
benefit of the Company, its employees, its clients 
and the maximisation of shareholder value.

Lamprell continues to focus on 
maintaining high standards of 
project execution, with a particular 
emphasis on safety, high quality 
standards and delivering projects 
both on time and on budget. 
This focus on project execution, as 
well as client satisfaction, ensures 
that Lamprell maintains and 
strengthens relationships with 
existing customers, and enables 
Lamprell to secure new customers 
and expand its customer base. 
The strength of Lamprell’s 
operations is reflected in the order 
book, which was at a record high 
of USD 850 million at the year end 
and included USD 521 million from 
new customers and USD 329 
million from repeat customers.
During the year Lamprell has 
continued to focus on the execution 
of Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (“EPC”) new build 
projects, including the construction 
of jackup drilling rigs and liftboats, 
whilst continuing our traditional rig 
refurbishment and fabrication 
projects for the offshore oil and 
gas sector.
The principal markets in which 
Lamprell operates, and the 
principal services provided are:
EPC new build construction of 
 >
jackup drilling rigs, liftboats and 
tender assist drilling units;
upgrade and refurbishment of 
 >
offshore jackup rigs;
new build construction for the 
 >
offshore oil and gas sector; and 
oilfield engineering services, 
 >
including the upgrade and 
refurbishment of land rigs.
The operational aspects of these 
business activities are reviewed 
as follows:
engineering procurement 
and c onstruction
Lamprell secured four major EPC 
projects during 2010 and these 
projects are under construction at 
Lamprell’s Jebel Ali and Hamriyah 
facilities. 
f red o lsen liftboats
The first EPC award in 2010, from 
Fred Olsen Windcarrier, for two 
GustoMSC NG-9000 design 
self-elevating and self-propelled 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessels, was confirmed in February 
2010, for execution at the Jebel Ali 
facility. Subsequently the engineering 
and procurement phase of the 
project has proceeded according to 
schedule and construction activities 
relating to this USD 320.4 million 
contract commenced in Q3 2010 
for unit 1 and Q4 2010 for unit 2. 
Construction will continue 
throughout 2011 prior to load out 
and delivery in 2012.
seajacks liftboat
Following the successful delivery on 
time and on budget in 2009 of the 
wind turbine installation vessels, 
“Seajacks Kraken” and “Seajacks 
Leviathan”, Lamprell secured a USD 
129.0 million contract award in June 
2010 from Seajacks 3 LTD for the 
delivery of “Seajacks Zaratan”, a 
GustoMSC NG-5500C design 
self-elevating and self-propelled 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessel. The engineering and 
procurement activities associated 
with this project have proceeded 
according to schedule and 
construction activities commenced 
at Lamprell’s Hamriyah facility in Q4 
2010. Construction will continue 
throughout 2011 prior to load out 
and delivery in 2012.

market
Our strategy is centred on sustainable, 
profitable growth. In delivering this strategy 
our main aim is to secure value enhancement 
for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
We use financial and non-financial KPI’s 
to measure our success in the delivery 
of our strategy and the management of 
our business. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

Projects have been shared between 
our UAE facilities, with the Hamriyah 
facility working on 22 jackups and 
Sharjah working on 21 rigs.
Refurbishment and upgrade 
projects such as these vary greatly 
in scope from project to project and 
depend on the existing condition of 
each rig and the owner’s upgrade 
requirements. A minor project can 
have a work schedule lasting a few 
days, whereas a major upgrade 
project with a significant engineering 
requirement can last for 12 months 
or more. Throughout 2010 average 
work volumes on individual rigs was 
reduced, whilst the higher rig count 
compensated for this trend. Typical 
upgrade and refurbishment projects 
include some of the following 
work scopes:
leg extensions and/or 
 >
strengthening;
conversion of slot rigs to  >
cantilever mode;
living quarters extension, 
 >
upgrade and refurbishment;
engine replacement and 
 >

including structural steel and 
piping replacement and painting.

Throughout 2010 we continued to invest in 
the phased construction of our Hamriyah 
facility. At the year end the facility was fully 
operational with the key components of the 
yard completed. The construction process 
continues and completion of the facility 
including a new administration building, main 
stores and state-of-the-art structural

We aim to provide a safe and 
supportive work environment to 
our employees, who are from 
diverse cultural backgrounds, 
and to do so in an environment 
that provides a competitive 
compensation programme that is 
affordable to the Company. We 
believe this continues to be a 
market differentiator and will 
strengthen our position as an 
“employer of choice” into 2011 
and beyond. 
The HR department continues to 
work closely with senior business 
leaders on strategy execution, in 
particular designing HR systems 
and processes that address 
strategic business issues, 
organisational and people 
capability-building, as well as 
longer term resource and 
succession management planning.
o perating facilities
In accordance with our organic 
growth model, the structured 
capital investment programme at 
all facilities continued throughout 
2010. The primary aims of this 
investment include higher levels of 
safety and productivity, as well as 
improving the working environment 
for both operational and 
administrative personnel.
The main area of investment 
throughout 2010 remained the 
phased construction of the new 
Hamriyah facility. At the year end 
the facility was fully operational 
with the key components of the 
yard completed. The construction 
process continues and completion 
of the facility including a new 
administration building, main stores 
and state-of-the-art structural 
fabrication and piping workshops is 
scheduled for Q4 2011.
After a review by management, the 
Board agreed to terminate the 
Group’s operation in Thailand with 
effect from 31 December 2010. 
Chris Hand
Chief Operating Officer
In Q4 2010 Lamprell was awarded 
a USD 39 million contract from a 
leading integrated energy provider 
for the construction of an offshore 
topside structure comprising of a 
two level utility deck and five level 
accommodation module for 38 
personnel. The project will be 
constructed to North Sea 
standards and is scheduled for 
delivery alongside the Jebel Ali 
quay in Q1 2012. At the end of 
2010 fabrication had commenced 
following initial engineering and 
procurement activities.
Human resources
Attracting, developing and 
retaining talented staff is of 
paramount importance to the 
success of Lamprell as a business. 
At Lamprell we consider our 
employees to be our greatest 
asset and the continuous 
development and multi-skilling of 
our staff remains a focus for our 
success. The Human Resources 
(“HR”) Department has developed 
policies and best practices for 
effective employee management 
enabling managers to capitalise 
on the strengths of the employees 
and their ability to contribute to 
the accomplishment of work. 
It is recognised that successful 
employee management helps 
employee motivation, 
development, and retention.
Lamprell continues to provide 
purpose-built accommodation and 
transportation for the labour force 
and this enhances our ability to 
attract and retain our workforce, 
and dramatically improves the 
quality and work/life balance 
expectations of the employees.
This focus on delivery ensured 
that work on the Livorno process 
modules for Saipem S.p.A. was 
completed on time and on budget 
with final delivery taking place in 
September 2010. The Aquila process 
modules for Saipem Energy Services 
S.p.A. were similarly delivered on 
time and on budget with the final 
module delivered in Q1 2011.
Throughout 2010 two offshore well 
head platforms with associated 
jackets and piles were under 
construction for a leading oil and 
gas operator. These platforms will 
be delivered in Q1 2011.

As an oil, gas and renewable 
energy related business with 
current operations concentrated 
in the United Arab Emirates, the 
Company is, by virtue of the nature 
of its business and the regions in 
which it operates, subject to a 
variety of business risks. Outlined 
below is a description of the 
principal risk factors that may affect 
the Group’s business. Such risk 
factors are not intended to be 
presented in any assumed order 
of priority. 
Any of the risks and uncertainties 
discussed in this document, could 
have a material adverse effect on 
the Company’s business. In 
addition, the risks set out below 
may not be exhaustive and 
additional risks and uncertainties, 
not presently known to the 
Company, or which the Company 
currently deems immaterial, may 
arise or become material in the 
future. In particular, the Company’s 
performance might be affected by 
changes in market and/or 
economic conditions and in legal, 
regulatory and tax requirements
The management conducts an 
annual risk assessment and review 
and, where practicable, deploys 
strategies to mitigate or transfer 
risks. Such strategies may include, 
for example, the purchase of 
insurance, the development of 
contractual mechanisms to limit 
liabilities, and the employment of 
expertise either in-house or 
externally sourced, tasked with 
identifying and managing potential 
hazards, whether operational, 
financial or legal.
business risks
The Company is subject to 
counterparty credit risk. Before 
entering into major contracts, the 
Company may undertake credit 
checks with a view to determining 
the risk of counterparty default;
The Group’s growth in the longer 
term may be dependent on the 
availability of financing both for 
its own future projects and for 
its customers;
Demand for the Company’s 
services may be adversely impacted 
by a fall in the levels of expenditure 
by oil and gas companies;
On certain projects, the Company 
operates on the basis of lump sum 
contracts and is therefore subject 
to financial risk if it fails to operate 
within budget. The Company may 
also be subject to liquidated 
damages payments if it fails to 
complete its contracts on time or 
to specification;
The Company is dependent on a 
relatively small number of contracts 
at any given time, many of which 
are for the same customers;
The Company operates on a 
project-by-project basis for EPC 
contracts and it does not have 
long-term commitments with the 
majority of its customers, which 
may cause its visible order book to 
fluctuate significantly;
The Company’s visible order book 
for upgrade and refurbishment 
work is usually relatively short and 
can fluctuate significantly;
The Company may be adversely 
affected by inflation and rising 
labour costs; 
The Company operates in a highly 
competitive industry and its ability 
to compete successfully depends 
on its ability to provide and service 
high quality products and systems;
The Company is subject to a variety 
of local and federal regulations in 
the UAE, and operates in markets 
where legal systems are still 
developing and which do not offer 
the certainty or predictability of legal 
systems in mature markets; and
Certain countries in which the 
Company’s customers operate 
have experienced armed conflict, 
terrorism or civil disorder. 
Human resources risks
The Company faces significant 
challenges in attracting and 
retaining sufficient numbers of 
skilled personnel;
The Company depends on the 
performance of its President, 
Directors, Senior Managers and 
other essential employees and if it 
loses any of these key personnel, 
its business may be impaired; and
The Company’s ability to perform 
its contractual obligations may be 
adversely affected by work 
stoppages and other labour 
problems.
In each case highlighted above, the 
Company seeks to mitigate the 
applicable risk by developing 
appropriate remuneration

structures, and providing an 
appealing work environment 
conducive to development of 
individual skills and experience.
l iability risks
The Company could be subject to 
substantial liability claims due to 
the hazardous nature of its 
business, and liability to customers 
under warranties may materially 
and adversely affect the 
Company’s earnings. The 
Company seeks to mitigate these 
risks through the operation of 
working practices and processes 
designed to deliver high quality 
products and services, as well as 
seeking contractual limits to its 
liability, and maintaining an 
appropriate insurance programme;
The Company’s business is subject 
to risks resulting from product 
defects, faulty workmanship or 
errors in design as well as warranty 
claims and other liabilities; and
The Company conducts its 
business within an increasingly 
strict environmental and health and 
safety regime and may be exposed 
to potential liabilities and increased 
compliance costs. The Company 
employs professionals dedicated to 
ensuring that it maintains high 
standards in these important areas.
t axation risks
Changes in the fiscal regime of the 
UAE could adversely impact the 
financial condition of the Group.
r isks relating to the ordinary 
shares in the c ompany
The Company’s reporting currency 
is different to the currency in which 
dividends will be paid;
Lamprell Holdings Ltd, the principal 
shareholder, whose interests may 
conflict with the interests of other 
shareholders and investors, holds a 
significant shareholding in the 
Company;
The Group may, in the longer term, 
seek to raise further funds through 
the issue of additional shares or 
other securities. Any funds raised 
in this way may have a dilutive 
effect on existing shareholdings, 
particularly in circumstances in 
which a non pre-emptive issue is 
made, or where shareholders do 
not take up their rights to subscribe 
for shares as part of a pre-emptive 
issue; and
Pre-emptive rights may not be 
available to US holders.
Hazards
Hazards constitute perils such as 
fire and flood. Hazards are 
managed through prevention, 
mitigation, continuity planning and 
risk transfer through the purchase 
of insurance

Group revenue increased by 
18.4% to USD 503.8 million (2009: 
USD 425.5 million) reflecting an 
increase in activity from the prior 
year. The increase was largely driven 
by a higher level of revenues 
generated from the offshore new 
build activity, based in Jebel Ali, 
including construction of Floating 
Production, Storage and Offloading 
units, accommodation units and also 
two offshore wellhead platforms. 
Revenue generated from EPC 
projects was marginally lower 
than the prior year as three major 
projects were delivered in 2009, 
including one new build jackup and 
two new build liftboats. Revenue in 
2010 largely reflects the delivery of 
one new build jackup and the 
commencement of a number of 
new projects including three 
liftboats for the windfarm 
installation sector and two new 
build jackups, all with deliveries 
scheduled for 2012. The prior year 
also reflected an adjustment to 
revenue arising from a price 
discount given on the completion 
of a self erecting tender assist 
drilling unit for BassDrill Alpha Ltd 
amounting to USD 23 million. 
Revenue from jackup rig upgrade 
and refurbishment activity was 
largely in line with the prior year but 
reflected a higher number of rigs 
refurbished with a continued low 
level of average expenditure. 
Revenue from refurbishment activity 
generated in H2 2010 reflected a 
reduction in activity from H1 2010 
due to a reduction in the number of 
refurbishment projects. 
Revenue from Oilfield Engineering 
services, related to the refurbishment 
and construction of land rigs and 
land camps, reflected a decline from 
the prior year in line with the market 
conditions which existed during the 
year. Revenue from International 
Inspection Services Limited 
(“Inspec”) also declined, reflecting 
reduced demand in the year for 
inspection and non-destructive 
testing services.
Gross profit increased by 29.0% to 
USD 79.7 million (2009: USD 61.8 
million) resulting in a gross margin of 
15.8% (2009: 14.5%). The gross 
margin on EPC projects in 2010, 
which is generally lower as a result 
of a higher level of procurement 
both in respect of material 
purchases and sub-contractor 
work, reflected a positive 
contribution on the successful 
completion of the Scorpion Mischief 
project. However, the gross margin 
also reflected initial revenues on the 
commencement of three new EPC 
projects contracted with lower 
margins, with two of these contracts 
reflecting no margin, as the projects 
were less than 20% complete at the 
year end. The gross margin was 
also impacted positively by a 
number of other one-off projects 
including land rig refurbishment. 
The gross margin on rig 
refurbishment continues to be lower 
than in prior years as a result of the 
reduced scopes of work being 
undertaken and generally tighter 
market conditions.

USD 78.4 million (2009: USD 41.2

prior year reflecting an improved 
operating performance and also a 
gain related to the cancellation of 
the contract with Riginvest G.P. 
(“Riginvest”), amounting to 
USD 23.9 million, net of additional 
costs, arising as a result of the 
gain from the contract cancellation 
amounting to USD 3.5 million. The 
prior year results also reflected a 
price discount on an EPC project 
amounting to USD 23 million. 
Exceptional charges in 2010 
reflect the cost of closure of 
Lamprell Asia Limited amounting 
to USD 1.4 million. Adjusted 
EBITDA margin (before exceptional 
charges) for the year was 15.6% 
(2009: 9.7%) reflecting the 
increase in operating margin. 
Adjusted operating profit (before 
exceptional charges) for the 
year increased by 149.1% to 
USD 69.5 million (2009: USD 27.9 
million) largely comprising the 
increase in gross profit, the net 
gain related to the cancellation of 
the contract with Riginvest and the 
price discount reflected in the prior 
year results. The adjusted 
operating margin (before 
exceptional charges) of 13.8% 
reflects an increase from the 
operating margin in the prior year 
of 6.6%. 
The adjusted net profit (before 
exceptional charges) increased by 
134.5% to USD 66.6 million (2009: 
USD 28.4 million) in line with the 
operating profit and also reflects 
net interest costs in the current 
period of USD 2.9 million (2009: 
USD 0.5 million net income) largely 
arising as a result of facility and 
guarantee charges related to new 
contract awards in the year. The 
adjusted net margin (before 
exceptional charges) of 13.2% 
reflects an increase from the net 
margin in the prior year of 6.7%.
interest income
Interest income of USD 2.2 million 
(2009: USD 1.4 million) relates 
mainly to bank interest earned on 
surplus funds deposited on a short 
term basis. The increase reflects a 
lower level of average deposit rates 
but higher cash balances during 
the year when compared to 2009. 
t axation
The Company, which is 
incorporated in the Isle of Man, has 
no income tax liability for the year 
ended 31 December 2010 as it is 
taxable at 0% in line with local Isle 
of Man tax legislation. The Group is 
not currently subject to income tax 
in respect of its operations carried 
out in the United Arab Emirates, 
and does not anticipate any liability 
to income tax arising in the 
foreseeable future. In December 
2008, Lamprell Asia Limited, was 
granted Board of Investment 
privileges which allowed the 
Company’s wholly owned 
subsidiary in Thailand to operate 
with a tax exempt status for a

o perating cash flow and 
liquidity
The Group’s net cash flow from 
operating activities for the year 
reflected a net inflow of USD 232.8 
million (2009: USD 23.9 million net 
outflow). The net cash inflow from 
operations was significantly higher 
than the prior year and mainly 
reflects increased profit for the year 
and movements in working capital. 
Changes in working capital were 
largely comprised of a decrease in 
inventory, resulting from the issue 
of stock for new build jackups, and 
an increase in trade and other 
receivables, mainly related to 
amounts due from customers on 
contracts and contract work-in-
progress from predominantly EPC 
projects, as five major projects 
were commenced during the year. 
Trade and other payables reflect a 
significant increase largely arising 
from increased amounts due to 
customers on contracts at 
31 December 2010 amounting 
to USD 79.8 million (2009 
USD 20.2 million), and an increase 
in advances received for contract 
work of USD 43.6 million (2009 
USD nil) largely in respect of a cash 
advance on a contract which had 
not commenced at the year end. 
Other working capital movements 
reflect timing differences in respect 
to other receivables and also 
supplier commitments primarily on 
the larger EPC contracts. 
Investing activities for the year 
absorbed USD 99.4 million (2009: 
USD 20.1 million) as a result of the 
continued investment in property, 
plant and equipment amounting to 
USD 29.7 million (2009: USD 18.5 
million), largely comprising 
investment in the new Hamriyah 
facility and the purchase of 
operating equipment, and also 
increased deposits of USD 63.6 
million and a held-to-maturity 
investment of USD 6.9 million. This 
investment activity was offset by 
interest income of USD 2.2 million 
received from surplus funds. 
Net cash used in financing 
activities reflected an amount of 
USD 46.3 million (2009: USD 3.0 
million generated from financing 
activities). This represents dividend 
payments of USD 15.2 million 
(2009: USD 6.3 million), the 
purchase of treasury shares to 
meet the settlement of share 
awards to certain Directors and 
staff of USD 3.5 million (2009: 
USD 1.7 million) and the decrease 
in short-term borrowings of USD 
22.5 million (2009: USD 11.9 million 
increase) and increased finance 
costs of USD 5.1 million (2009: 
USD 0.9 million) largely arising as 
a result of facility and guarantee 
charges related to new contract 
awards in the year. 
c apital expenditure
Capital expenditure on property, 
plant and equipment during the 
year amounted to USD 29.7 million 
(2009: USD 18.5 million). The main 
area of expenditure was the 
investment on buildings and related

infrastructure at Group facilities 
amounting to USD 20.2 million 
(2009: USD 14.4 million), including 
capital work-in-progress, with 
additional committed expenditure 
amounting to USD 13.6 million, 
reflecting the development of the 
infrastructure of the Group at all 
facilities but primarily expenditure 
at the new Hamriyah facility. 
Further expenditure on operating 
equipment amounted to USD 8.6 
million to support the growth in 
activities experienced during the 
year and to replace hired 
equipment, where this was 
deemed cost effective, and to 
enhance the useful life of a barge.
shareholders’ equity
Shareholders’ equity increased from 
USD 234.8 million at 31 December 
2009 to USD 284.0 million at 31 
December 2010. The movement 
mainly reflects the profit for the year 
of USD 65.2 million net of dividends 
declared of USD 15.2 million and 
treasury shares purchased of 
USD 3.5 million. The movement also 
reflects a credit for the accounting 
for share based payments of USD 
2.1 million made to certain Directors 
and employees of the Group and 
charged to General and 
Administrative expenses. 
Dividends
For the year ended 31 December 
2010, the Board of Directors of the 
Group having duly considered the 
current market conditions, profit 
earned, cash generated during the 
year and taking note of the capital 
commitments for the year 2011, 
recommend a final dividend of 9.50 
cents per share. If approved this 
will be paid to shareholders on 17 
June 2011 provided they were on 
the register on 13 May 2011.

a commitment to the local 
community
At Lamprell, we recognise the value 
of fulfilling our responsibilities as a 
corporate citizen, believing that by 
doing so we will bring benefits to all 
our stakeholders. Having been 
based in Dubai since 1977, the 
Company is rooted in a community 
within which it has worked for over 
thirty years and it has both 
benefited from, and been a 
contributor to, that community’s 
development during that period. As 
a result of both this history and the 
international nature of our 
business, we believe we are 
fortunate to have a local business 
with a genuinely global perspective, 
and a rich variety of cultures and 
backgrounds from which to draw 
expertise and experience.
o ur principles
Our commitment to act as a 
responsible corporate player has 
long been reflected throughout the 
entire organisation, and the Group 
has a formalised set of policies that 
state the principles by which we 
seek to manage our operational 
activities, work with our staff and 
host communities, and minimise 
our impact on the environment.
Our business, the provision of 
construction services to the oil and 
gas and renewables industry, 
requires the highest standards of 
engineering skill and Health, Safety 
and Environment awareness. Our 
fundamental principle is to carry 
out these activities in a way that 
delivers the best possible product 
to our customers whilst minimising 
risks and maximising rewards to 
our wider stakeholders.
Accordingly, when we make all 
our investment and operational 
decisions, we take account of the 
social and environmental impacts 
that they may have, and minimising 
these is a central part of our 
decision-making process.
As a publicly listed company our 
aim is to ensure that our reporting 
meets all the requisite levels of 
scrutiny for a business of our size 
and areas of activity. Maintaining 
our reputation by aligning our 
commercial goals with our ethical 
standards is an essential part of 
achieving this aim. 
social initiatives
In 2010, we continued to work 
closely with local communities, 
business partners and regulatory 
authorities to make a positive 
difference within the localities where 
we operate. In particular we at 
Lamprell are aware of the cultural 
mix of our employees with some 
80% originating from India. 
Don Bosco Snehalaya is a project 
focused on the street children and 
youth, living in the city of Vadodara. 
With Lamprell’s support, the basic 
objective of Snehalaya is to provide 
shelter to the young living on the 
railway platforms and in the streets, 
and other vulnerable children who 
are in need of care and protection. 
Snehalaya provides food, clothes, 
medicines, recreational facilities,

counseling, job placement, contact 
with their families, and training in 
trades according to their capacities 
and individual circumstances. They 
are given opportunities to interact 
with the public, to express their 
potential and their talents. This 
helps them to develop their self 
confidence and the awareness that 
they too can contribute something 
to society. Ultimately, Snehalaya 
aims at enabling these street 
children to return to a decent life 
within mainstream society.
c harity
Each year we donate a cheque to 
a worthy local establishment, with 
the recipients this year being the 
Dubai Center for Special Needs. 
The Center caters for children and 
young people with special needs 
and is run entirely on donations. It 
offers a range of services to suit 
the needs of each child in all areas 
including education, social, speech 
and language, occupational 
therapy, physiotherapy and 
behavioural management. 
people
Attracting, developing and retaining 
talented staff is a major challenge 
for the oil and gas industry and at 
Lamprell we are fortunate to have 
high quality people across the 
whole range of our services. It is 
therefore vital for our continued 
success that we encourage our 
staff’s personal development and 
career progression, and treat our 
people with respect, maturity and 
openness. We also invest 
significantly in building their skill 
sets. We are confident that this 
approach is the one most likely to 
enable us to achieve our business 
objectives by providing quality, 
continuity and growth. Our policy is 
to ensure equal opportunity in 
career development, promotion, 
training and reward for all of our 
employees. We aim to ensure that 
all our employees understand our 
business goals and our business 
principles through ongoing 
communications programmes.
With a diverse range of nationalities 
working within the group, we also 
respect and recognise the value of 
different cultures.
t rade staff accommodation
Due to the rising cost and shortage 
of residential accommodation in 
the UAE, combined with a 
municipality directive forbidding 
trade labour employees from living 
in what are termed “family 
communities”, Lamprell decided to 
provide purpose built community 
accommodation for its core trade 
workforce. This accommodation 
provides a secure and clean 
environment for our employees. 
These facilities are capable of 
housing up to 400 people, 
complete with all amenities 
including an in-house laundry 
service, restaurants, cinema, 
recreational equipment, communal 
rooms with full access to internet, 
satellite TV and a medical centre. 
Lamprell provides transport 
between the accommodation 
facilities and its workplaces with 
additional scheduled transport 
provided for airport and shopping 
trips etc.
medical and life insurance
In addition to the in-house medical 
team, Lamprell provides private 
medical cover and life insurance for 
its workforce enabling them to take 
advantage of locally available high 
quality medical facilities, whilst giving 
peace of mind to family dependants. 
Health, safety, environment 
and security summary 
(“Hses ”) 
Given the nature and demands of 
our business, ensuring a high level 
of performance in health, safety, 
environment and security is 
absolutely essential, and Lamprell 
has a strong track record in these 
areas. We are very conscious 
though that there is no room for 
complacency in HSES and we 
seek to continually improve our 
performance.
 
Health and safety
Internal measures for health 
and safety performance are very 
important to ensure focus on this 
area of our business. Our objective 
for 2010 was to maintain and 
improve the developed “safety 
culture” within the organisation, 
with all staff encouraged to report 
any activities they perceive as 
not conforming to best practice 
through the incentive linked 
in-house Safety Observation 
Audit Programme so that any areas 
of oversight can be rectified and 
brought up to the highest possible 
standard as quickly as possible. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

corporate social r esponsibility
 
A contributory factor again this year 
was the encouraged use of the 
centralised reporting system for 
leading indicators under a Total 
Recordable Incident Ratio. This 
ratio facilitates the analysis of First 
Aid Cases, Medical Treatment 
Cases and Restricted Work Cases 
as well as Lost Time Incidents 
(“LTI”) and allows management to 
identify trends and take the 
appropriate action.
As a result of this approach, we 
have maintained a strong track 
record in the area of safety. 
Lamprell has established a safety 
record which is exceptional for the 
oil and gas construction industry.
In line with our standardise and 
centralise programme, the Lamprell 
Group of companies achieved an 
overall performance LTI Frequency 
Rate of 1.33.
However, whilst our own 
measurement of our safety 
performance is essential, we also 
recognise the importance of 
external analysis of our methods 
and have achieved relevant 
accreditation by third parties of our 
capabilities. 
In 2010 Lamprell maintained the 
accreditation with the management 
system certificate ISO 14001: 2004 
and the updated Occupational, 
Health and Safety Assessment 
Series, OHSAS 18001; 2007. 
environment
Across all our activities we seek to 
minimise the mark we leave on the 
sites at which we work. A good 
example is at Hamriyah where, as 
we expand our existing facility, we 
are seeking ways to minimise our 
impact on the local environment 
and increase our energy efficiency 
and recycling capability. 
By delivering the best possible 
product to our customers and 
utilising the most up to date 
technologies, we also have a direct 
impact on the environmental 
performance of the rigs we refurbish 
by improving their systems and 
ensuring they conform to all relevant 
international legislation. 
Our policy is to strive to achieve 
continual improvement in 
environmental performance. We 
are committed to preventing 
pollution and reducing the overall 
impact of our operations on the 
environment. In addition, we 
maintain an internal management 
structure for the management of 
environmental issues which 
includes clearly defined 
responsibilities for environmental 
management capable of delivering 
this policy commitment.
At all times Lamprell aims to 
comply with, and where possible 
exceed, applicable legal and other 
requirements relating to the 
organisation. We are also 
committed to monitoring and 
reporting of our environmental 
performance, setting objectives 
and targets for improvement and at 
all times provide appropriate 
training and awareness 
programmes for our staff. 
Feasibility plans are currently in 
progress to join the Carbon 
Disclosure Project.
waste management policy
All businesses affect the 
environment through the use of 
resources and discharge of waste 
products. Our Waste Management 
Policy is therefore consistent with 
our broader Environmental Policy, 
which includes a stated 
commitment to minimise the 
environmental impacts of our 
operations and prevent pollution. 
Our aim is to limit our discharge of 
waste material wherever we can 
and the policy lays out how we 
seek to achieve this goal.

security
During 2010, Lamprell maintained 
a high level of internal and external 
security controls of its assets on 
behalf of all stakeholders. These 
controls were in the form of 
security procedures, a corporate 
wide security access system 
and continued physical 
security presence. 
Quality
Lamprell aims to achieve maximum 
customer satisfaction and quality 
of product. In the pursuit of this 
objective the Company will comply 
with all national and international 
standards and requirements with 
respect to quality assurance. 
Lamprell will also strive to optimise 
resources and reduce wastage in 
the development of our facilities 
and training of personnel. Whilst 
aiming to meet these objectives the 
Company ensures cost effective 
jobs and services, and delivery 
on time.
Lamprell meets these objectives 
by understanding customer 
requirements, working together 
with our customers to meet those 
requirements, understanding our 
processes well and monitoring and 
measuring our activities. Ultimately 
the Company strives to continually 
improve the Quality Management 
Systems and operations. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

Pursuant to the Company’s share schemes, the Employee Benefit Trust as at the year-end, held a total of 1,277 ,138 
(2009: 1,336,259) ordinary shares of 5 pence, representing 0.64% (2009: 0.67%) of the issued share capital. The 
voting rights attaching to these shares cannot be exercised directly by the employees, but can be exercised by 
the Trustees. However, in line with good practice, the Trustees do not exercise these voting rights. In the event of 
another company taking control of the Company, the employee share schemes operated by the Company have set 
change of control provisions. In short, awards may, in certain circumstances and in approved proportions, be 
allowed to vest early or be allowed to be exchanged for awards of equivalent value in the acquiring company.
The Company was given authority at the 2010 AGM to make market purchases of up to 20,000,000 ordinary 
shares of 5 pence. This authority will expire at the 2011 AGM, where approval from shareholders will be sought to 
renew the authority. 
Approval from shareholders is also proposed to be sought to authorise the Directors to allot the Company’s 
unissued shares up to a maximum nominal amount of £3,000,000, representing approximately 30% of the 
Company’s current issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) and to issue equity securities of the 
Company for cash to persons other than existing shareholders, other than in connection with existing exemptions 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association or in connection with a rights, scrip dividend, or other similar 
issue, up to an aggregate nominal value of £500,000 representing approximately 5% of the current issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company. Similar authorities were given by the shareholders at the AGM in 2010 and 
the authorities now sought, if granted, will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the AGM of the Company next 
year and the date which is 15 months after the granting of the authorities. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

During the year the directors received notice from the 
Company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, of its 
intention to retire at the Company's forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLC, being eligible, has indicated its willingness to 
accept appointment as successor auditor in 
accordance with Section 12(1) of the Isle of Man 
Companies Act 1982, and a resolution to appoint  
it will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual  
General Meeting.
g oing concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors 
consider that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to remain in operation for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies 
have been used and applied consistently. They also 
confirm that reasonable and prudent judgments and 
estimates have been made in preparing the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 
and that applicable accounting standards have 
been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Isle of 
Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The financial statements have been prepared on 
the going concern basis since the Directors have 
reasonable expectation that, firstly, the Company’s and 
the Group’s activities are sustainable and, secondly, 
that adequate resources are available to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company website. Your attention is 
drawn to the fact that legislation in the Isle of Man 
governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from other jurisdictions 
and uncertainty regarding the legal requirements is 
compounded as information published on the internet 
is accessible in many countries with different legal 
requirements relating to the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements.

The Company is incorporated in the Isle of Man, 
where there is no formal Code covering Corporate 
Governance. However, as the shares of the Company 
are listed on the Official List of the London Stock 
Exchange and as the Board is strongly committed to 
the highest standards of corporate governance, the 
Board applies the provisions of the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance published in 2008 (the “Code”) 
as if the Company was incorporated in the United 
Kingdom. The Company is aware of the terms of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2010.
The Code seeks to ensure that the Company is run 
in a manner whereby the interests of shareholders are 
protected and as such the Code sets out principles 
of good corporate governance together with 
specific provisions. 
statement of compliance with the provisions 
of good governance
The Directors consider that throughout 2010 and up to 
the date hereof, the Company has applied the 
principles and complied with the provisions of the 
Code, subject to exceptions identified in this report.
t he Board
The Board plans to meet at least six times in a year. 
The role of the Board is to provide leadership of the 
Company, set values and standards, and to ensure that 
the Company’s obligations to its shareholders and other 
stakeholders are met. The Board has a formal schedule 
of matters reserved to itself for decision, including but 
not limited to, matters of a strategic nature, approval of 
the annual budget, approval of major acquisitions, 
investments and disposals, major changes to the 
Group’s capital structure, the preparation of financial 
statements, the recommendation or declaration of 
dividends, the entry into contracts which are deemed to 
be material strategically or by reason of size, succession 
planning and appointments to the Board, executive 
remuneration, ensuring the maintenance of a sound 
system of internal controls, reviewing its own and 
its Committees’ performance, and reviewing the 
Company’s overall corporate governance arrangements.
The current membership of the Board and the 
commitments of the Directors are stated on page 37, 
which record the names of the Chairman, the Senior 
Independent Director and the Chief Executive Officer. 
The names of the Chairmen and members of each of 
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
are detailed below under the respective Committee 
summaries. 
The Board met six times during the year and one 
of these meetings was conducted by telephone via a 
conference call. This meeting was required to deal with 
a specific business matter which arose as part of the 
normal business of the Group and which needed to be 
addressed between scheduled Board meetings. In 
addition, the Board executes a number of resolutions 
in writing to conduct Company business. The 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have met 
without the executives present when necessary and 
the Executive Directors maintain frequent verbal and 
written contact with the Non-Executive Directors to 
discuss various issues affecting the Company and its 
business. The agenda and appropriate supporting 
Board papers are distributed by the Secretary to the 
Board on a timely basis.

1 Peter Whitbread retired from the Board of Directors on 7 June 2010 and was eligible to attend three meetings of the Board.
The Group maintains Directors’ and Officers’ Liability insurance cover, the level of which is reviewed annually.
Chairman and Chief executive
Section 1 A.2.2 of the Code states that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive should not be exercised by the 
same individual and responsibilities between these roles should be clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. The Chairman on appointment should meet the independence criteria set out in Section 1 
A.3.1 of the Code.
Nigel McCue is the Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Silver is the Non-Executive Chairman. 
Jonathan Silver is a partner of a firm that represents the Company as one of its legal advisers. Jonathan Silver 
was therefore not deemed independent on appointment as the Chairman of the Company. However, the Board 
and the Nomination Committee, considering his performance, experience and his detailed knowledge of the 
Company and the Middle East, believe that, despite his lack of independence on appointment, Jonathan Silver’s 
appointment as the Chairman of the Company is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Board balance and independence
The Board currently has seven Directors, consisting of four Non-Executive Directors and three Executive 
Directors. The Board considers all the Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, Jonathan Silver, to be 
independent in accordance with the definition of the Code and their appointment to be in the best interests of 
the shareholders. To that end, half of the Board excluding the Chairman (as cited above), is comprised of Non-
Executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent. The Directors believe that the extensive 
knowledge and experience of the Non-Executive Directors combined with the focus and experience of the 
Executive Directors, enable the Board to lead and give direction to the Group without any imbalance that may 
allow any individual or Group of individuals to dominate its decision making. Any Director having a concern in this 
or any other regard may raise this with the Chairman or the Senior Independent Director.  Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
38
Colin Goodall has been appointed as the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director and is available to 
shareholders if they have any concerns for which 
contact through the normal channels of Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer 
cannot be resolved or for which such contact is 
inappropriate.
The Board considers that independence is a matter of 
judgment and therefore it believes that the Non-
Executive Directors should be free from any business 
or other relationships that could materially interfere in 
the exercise of their independent judgment. It is the 
Board’s policy to provide its Non-Executive Directors 
fair remuneration for the contribution they make with 
respect to the business and affairs of the Company 
and the responsibilities they undertake in performing 
their duties as Non-Executive Directors.
appointments to the Board
All appointments to the Board are based on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The 
composition and working of the Nomination 
Committee are explained under “Principal Board 
Committees” on page 39. The terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours and will be 
available at the AGM 15 minutes prior to the meeting 
and during the meeting.
induction and professional development 
A formal induction programme is provided to new 
Directors on their appointment. The programme is 
designed to cover Companies Act requirements, 
dealing restrictions as outlined in the Disclosure Rules 
and the Model Code on Directors’ dealings in securities 
contained in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority in the United Kingdom, Board and business 
related matters, meetings with senior management, 
site visits and the opportunity to meet with major 
shareholders. The Company encourages Directors 
to refresh their knowledge and skills and to keep up 
to date with the latest developments in corporate 
governance, financial reporting, the industry and market 
conditions. The Company reimburses any expenses 
incurred in this regard. 
Major shareholders have had discussions with the 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director Colin Goodall and the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee Brian Fredrick. All the 
Non-Executive Directors will be available at the AGM to 
meet with shareholders. 
The Directors are entitled to take independent 
professional advice, at the Company’s expense, if 
required. Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Secretary to the Board, who is 
responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures 
and applicable rules and regulations are observed, and 
for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on 
governance matters. The agenda for each Board and 
Committee meeting is considered by the relevant 
Chairman and papers for each scheduled formal 
Board and Committee meeting are provided 
beforehand. In addition, the Chairman maintains 
regular contact with the Executive Directors to discuss 
specific issues.
Directors are free to meet individual members of the 
senior management team and have done so during the 
year under review. The Board and its Committees 
receive briefings on legislative and regulatory 
developments and new accounting requirements as 
appropriate and believe that, given the experience and 
skills of its Directors, the identification of general 
training needs is best left to individual discretion.
No Director took independent professional advice 
during the year.
Performance evaluation
A performance evaluation of the Chairman, the Board, 
its members and the Committees was conducted 
through a questionnaire led interview with other 
members of the Board. The questionnaires included a 
review of the Directors’ attendance at Board meetings, 
the Board agenda, those areas on which the Board 
should focus during its meetings, the effectiveness of 
the roles of the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors, Board procedures and administration, and 
the operation of the Board’s Nominations, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. The results were 
considered satisfactory by the Board.
The performance evaluation of the Board, its members 
and its Committees takes place on an annual basis.
Retirement and re-election
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all Directors are subject to election at the 
first AGM after their appointment and one third, or the 
number nearest to one third of the Board, shall retire

from office at every AGM. Any Director in office for more 
than three years at the start of an AGM shall also retire. 
Accordingly, Nigel McCue and Colin Goodall will retire at 
the forthcoming AGM. Furthermore Christopher Hand, 
who was appointed to the Board on 26 January 2011, 
also stands for election. Nigel McCue and Colin 
Goodall, being eligible, both offer themselves for 
reappointment. The biographical details of Nigel McCue 
and Colin Goodall, the Directors proposed for re-
election, and Christopher Hand, can be found on pages 
30 and 31. The Chairman confirms that following formal 
performance evaluation, the performance of both Nigel 
McCue and Colin Goodall continues to be effective and 
that they demonstrate commitment to their roles. The 
Board supports the re-election of the retiring Directors, 
Nigel McCue and Colin Goodall, together with the 
election of the new Director Christopher Hand.
Directors’ remuneration
The principles and details of Directors’ remuneration 
are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 42 to 53. The composition and working of 
the Remuneration Committee are explained under 
“Principal Board Committees” on page 40. 
Principal Board Committees
The Board is assisted by the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees. A summary of the activities of 
each committee is set out below. The Committees are 
constituted with appropriate written terms of reference, 
which are reviewed annually and are available on the 
Company’s website. The Committee terms of 
references did not require any material changes further 
to the annual review. The minutes of meetings and/or 
reports from the Chairmen of the Committees are 
made available to the Board for its next scheduled 
meeting following the Committee meeting in question, 
or as soon as practicable thereafter.
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are Richard 
Raynaut, who acts as Chairman, Colin Goodall and 
Brian Fredrick. Others may be co-opted onto the 
Committee by the Committee members. The Board 
considers all the members of the Audit Committee 
who are Non-Executive Directors to be independent in 
character and judgment and free from any relationship 
or circumstance which may, or could or would be likely 
to, or which appears to, affect their judgment. Richard 
Raynaut, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, has 
relevant and recent financial experience having retired 
from his position as Chief Financial Officer in 2004. 
Other members of the Audit Committee also have 
relevant financial experience.
Meetings of the Audit Committee are held not less than 
three times a year. The Chief Financial Officer is invited 
to attend meetings, where appropriate, and the 
Company’s auditors are regularly invited to attend 
meetings, including once at the planning stage before 
the audit and once after the audit at the reporting stage. 
Other Board members may also be invited to attend, 
although at least once a year the Audit Committee 
meets the Company’s external auditors without 
management being present. The terms of reference of 
the Audit Committee include consideration of matters 
relating to the appointment of the Company’s auditors 
and the independence of the Company’s auditors, 
reviewing the integrity of the Company’s annual and 
interim reports, preliminary results’ announcements and 
any other formal announcement relating to its financial 
performance. The Audit Committee also reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal audit, 
internal control and compliance procedures. 
The Audit Committee has established and monitors 
the Group’s policy in relation to non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor, with a view to 
ensuring objectivity, independence and cost 
effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee also monitors the procedure to 
ensure that employees may raise ethical concerns in 
confidence. The Audit Committee has designated the 
Chief Financial Officer as the Compliance Officer; 
employees also have access to the Audit Committee 
if the Compliance Officer has not dealt with their 
concerns satisfactorily.
The Company has adopted a code of conduct 
covering all employees including senior executives; 
the compliance with this code of conduct is monitored 
by the Human Resource department. The code of 
conduct includes amongst others, the prohibition of 
bribery and political donations. 
The Audit Committee met (including meetings by 
conference call) three times during the year and the 
attendance at its meetings is reported on page 37.
Nomination Committee
The current members of the Nomination Committee 
are Colin Goodall, who acts as Chairman, Richard 
Raynaut and Brian Fredrick. The Nomination  Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
40
Corporate g overnance Report
Committee’s terms of reference are to periodically 
review the structure, size and composition, including 
the skills, knowledge and experience required of the 
Board compared to its current position and make its 
recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
changes. The Nomination Committee also considers 
the future composition of the Board, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing the 
Company, and skills and expertise needed on the 
Board. The Nomination Committee also makes 
recommendations to the Board about the membership 
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
On 26 January 2011, Christopher Hand was appointed 
to the Board, based on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee. 
The Nomination Committee met (including meetings by 
conference calls) twice during the year and the 
attendance at its meetings is reported on page 37.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are 
Brian Fredrick, who acts as Chairman, Colin Goodall 
and Richard Raynaut. Brian Fredrick took over the 
Chairmanship of the Committee from Richard Raynaut 
in June 2009. The terms of reference of the 
Remuneration Committee provide for it to determine 
and agree with the Board the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer, other Executive Directors, the 
Company Secretary and other such members of the 
executive management as it is designated to consider. 
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is a 
matter for the Executive Directors. No Director or 
manager may be involved in any decisions as to his 
own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee met (including meetings 
by conference call) five times during the year. The 
attendance at its meetings is reported on page 37.
accountability and audit
The Board plays a direct role in the development of the 
Group’s internal controls and risk management systems 
in addition to overseeing controls and risk management 
procedures via the Audit Committee. However, the 
primary responsibility for developing and implementing 
internal control and risk management procedures 
covering strategic, commercial, operational and financial 
aspects of the business, lies with the management. 
f inancial reporting
The statement on the responsibilities of the Directors in 
relation to the preparation of the accounts and the 
Directors’ evaluation of the business as a going 
concern is contained in the Directors’ Report on pages 
32 to 35.
internal audit
The Audit Committee evaluated the performance of 
the internal audit function from the quality of reports 
received from the Group’s internal auditors, feedback 
from management, and an assessment of work 
planned and undertaken. During the year the 
Company has undertaken Internal Control Self 
Assessment in the absence of internal audit. In March 
2010, as per the Company’s long-term plan, an 
independent internal audit function was established 
within the organisation, and Ravindra Dabir was 
appointed as the Vice President-Internal Audit. 
internal control
The control environment, risk management system 
and assurance processes, being the three key 
elements leading to a robust system of internal control 
in the Group, are described below.
There exists a clear organisational structure for the 
control and monitoring of the Group’s businesses, 
including defined lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority. The business follows policies and 
procedures which amongst other matters, include 
policies for the Company and its employees on health 
and safety, security, the environment, corporate social 
responsibility and areas of legal compliance.
The Group has an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by 
the Group. This has been in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of this annual report and is in 
accordance with the Revised Turnbull Guidance. The 
Directors are aware that the Group’s risk management 
systems cannot completely eliminate risks and thus 
there can never be an absolute assurance against the 
Group failing to achieve its objectives or a material loss 
arising. In the Board’s regular review of the Group’s 
strategic plans, consideration is given to those risks 
which have been identified as potential impediments  Business

to achieving the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The Board receives regular formal updates from 
management on the key risks and the related controls 
in relation to the Group’s existing business and, if 
appropriate, on potential new business. Management 
thoroughly considers risks associated with undertaking 
new business.
The Directors receive assurances from the following 
internal and external controls:
Annual self assessment of agreed internal controls 
 >
by process owners and review of such results by 
the internal auditors;
Regular executive reports from management in 
 >
areas covering key issues, performance, business 
outlook, human resources and health, safety and 
environment;
Financial performance reports including analyses of 
 >
significant variances regularly reported by the 
management; 
External audit reports, presentations and 
 >
management letters from the Group’s auditors;
Reports from the internal audit function;
 >
Reports from internal quality audits; >
Reports from the Audit Committee. >
The Board conducts an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal control 
including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. Where 
material weaknesses have been identified, safeguards 
are implemented and monitored.
audit Committee and auditor
The composition and working of the Audit Committee 
are explained under “Principal Board committees” on 
page 39.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the performance  
of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the external auditor,  
who retires at the end of the AGM. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, being eligible, 
has indicated its willingness to accept appointment 
as successor auditor and the Audit Committee 
recommends its appointment. The Board concurs 
with the recommendation of the Audit Committee.
During the year, the external auditor 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, was also engaged to provide 
tax advice in connection with the Group's activities in 
Oman. The Audit Committee, in accordance with the 
Policy on Auditor Independence and adopted by the 
Group, and having considered the nature of work to be 
carried out believes that, whilst being cost effective, the 
appointment of the external auditor to provide this 
advice did not affect the objectivity, or the 
independence, of the external auditor. 
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer have regular meetings with major 
shareholders and research analysts. The Board receives 
regular feedback from analysts and major shareholders, 
compiled by the Company’s brokers and financial 
public relations consultants, in particular, following 
presentations and meetings after the publication of 
financial results. The principal method of communicating 
with the majority of shareholders is via the annual report 
and accounts and the Company’s website, which 
contains details of financial presentations to analysts, 
press releases and other information about the Group. 
All shareholders have the opportunity to attend the 
AGM. All Directors were present at the 2010 AGM and 
all Directors intend to be present at the 2011 AGM to 
answer shareholders’ questions.
Constructive use of the agm
The Board uses the AGM as an occasion to 
communicate with all shareholders, including private 
investors, who are provided with the opportunity to 
question the Directors. At the AGM the total number 
of proxy votes lodged on each resolution categorised 
as for, against, and votes withheld will be made 
available both at the meeting and subsequently on 
the Company’s website. Each separate issue is 
presented as a separate resolution and the Chairmen 
of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees will be available to answer questions 
from shareholders.
The Notice of the AGM, and related papers containing 
the text of resolutions to be proposed at the AGM, and 
explanatory notes, where necessary, will be posted to 
the shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
AGM. The interim and preliminary results of the 
Company, along with all other press releases, are 
posted on the Company’s website, www.lamprell.com, 
as soon as they are announced and are available 
for download. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

Directors’ Remuneration Report
l etter to shareholders
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present to you, on behalf of the Board 
and the Remuneration Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee’s report on our Board Directors’ 
remuneration for the financial year 2010.
We believe it is important to continue to foster 
shareholder confidence in the integrity of our 
remuneration decisions and therefore we consulted 
major shareholders in the autumn of 2010 regarding 
the remuneration packages offered to Executive 
Directors. The purpose of the consultations was to 
discuss with investors the approach the Committee 
has established to setting executive remuneration and 
its individual components which:
is in the best interests of the Company;
 >
takes account of pay in the rest of the business; >

The Remuneration Committee has continued to work 
with and been advised by Mercer Ltd. on Executive 
Remuneration related matters and consulted them for 
advice on market trends, incentive design questions 
and other relevant matters.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”) determine the policy for 
the remuneration of Lamprell’s Executive Directors, 
the Company Secretary and such other members of 
senior management as it is designated to consider. 
There have been some amendments to the terms of 
reference since the last Remuneration Report to clarify 
the role of the Committee and to address requirements 
arising from changes to the management structure. 
These changes were supported by the Board. The full 
terms of reference of the Committee are available on 
the Company’s website – www.lamprell.com.
Members of the Remuneration Committee in 2010 
have been Brian Fredrick, Colin Goodall and Richard 
Raynaut. Members have attended all Remuneration 
Committee meetings. In addition, the Company 
Chairman, Jonathan Silver and the Chief Executive 
Officer, Nigel McCue attended meetings by invitation 
but were at no stage present when elements of their 
own remuneration were discussed.
The following pages provide a more detailed overview 
over current Lamprell Executive Remuneration including 
changes that have been agreed upon during 2010.

executive remuneration policy and pay principles
Our remuneration policy for Executive Directors gives consideration to remuneration policy and levels for the 
wider employee population and is designed to enable the recruitment, retention and motivation of Executive 
Directors and senior managers of the highest calibre. Our remuneration policy aims to drive business 
performance and maximise shareholder value through offering remuneration packages to our senior 
management that are appropriately balanced between base salary and variable compensation and taking 
into account policy and practice in the UAE.
Our key remuneration principles are:
base salaries should be competitive and bonus should reflect both collective financial performance and 
 >
personal performance. Personal performance will be determined based on stretching, quantitative and 
qualitative targets set individually at the beginning of each year;
the Individual Performance Targets for the Executive Directors are recommended by the Company Chairman 
 >
and approved by the Remuneration Committee. Individual Performance Targets for the Vice Presidents are 
recommended by the Chief Executive Officer; 
maintaining the highest possible health and safety standards is of paramount importance to the Company 
 >
and its business and is the collective responsibility of all Executive Directors, Vice Presidents and Employees. 
Any fatality that takes place in a facility operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be taken into 
account when considering whether to pay the whole or part of the Personal Performance Bonus; and
performance shares are awarded in order to align the interests of senior staff and shareholders and to encourage 
 >
the recipients to remain with the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee has met five times during this financial year. Items covered in the meetings included:
Executive Director benchmarking; 
 >
investor consultation;  >
variable pay; >
consideration of the ABI Guidelines;  >
review of PSP awards; and >
review and agreement of financial targets for the annual bonus plan. > Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

Pay mix
In 2010, the remuneration mix for Lamprell Executive Directors, including long-term and short-term incentives  
(“LTI” and “STI” respectively), was as follows:

Benchmarking
The Committee aims to provide our Executive Directors with a remuneration package that is competitive to those 
offered to directors in similar positions in comparable companies and that takes into account internal company 
conditions. As such, in 2010, the Committee conducted a review of the pay and benefits of senior management. 
The findings of that review were taken into consideration and will be reflected, as appropriate, in the revised 
remuneration packages for 2011.
Mercer benchmarked Total Remuneration and all its components for our senior management against the 
remuneration levels offered to senior mangers in a peer group consisting of companies that were of an industry 
relevant to Lamprell’s operations:
Hargreaves Services Limited
 > Salamander Energy Plc >
Wellstream Holdings Plc > Melrose Resources Plc >
Hunting Plc > Energy XX1 (Bermuda) Limited >
Fortune Oil plc > JKX Oil & Gas Plc >
Gulfsands Petroleum Plc > Premier Oil Plc >
Emerald Energy Plc > Venture Production Plc >
Afren Plc >
elements of remuneration
Base salary
Provide a market competitive base salary that reflects the role, skills, experience and contribution of 
the individual 
In 2009, after a review of the overall package, especially in the light of a highly volatile market in that year, the 
Remuneration Committee decided to adjust the CEO and CFO basic salaries to be competitive at the upper 
quartile of the market and limit bonus opportunities (further detail below) to bring the remuneration packages 
more in line with the Company’s benchmarking peer group. For 2011, following the 2010 review of base salaries  Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
46
Directors’ Remuneration Report
against a new comparator group, the Committee has decided to continue to position base salaries at upper 
quartile, largely to recognise the following:
Lamprell being larger than the majority of peer group companies, positioning pay at upper quartile to reflect 
 >
the size and performance of the Company;
the results of the benchmarking exercises undertaken by Mercer in both 2009 and 2010 had indicated 
 >
anomalies between the base salaries and bonus amounts paid by the Company, and that of its comparator 
group, with base salaries significantly lower and variable pay through bonus significantly higher than the 
comparator group; and
the Committee considers that too high a level of variable pay (i.e. pay which is “at risk”) could lead to the loss 
 >
of key Executive Directors in difficult economic circumstances when continuity is most important.
The table below shows the base salaries of each current Executive Director effective as at 1 April 2010, and those 
that will apply from 1 January 2011.

Annual bonus
Focus and motivate Executive Directors to achieve annual performance targets
Performance measures
The Committee establishes performance measures and targets under the annual bonus plan for Executive 
Directors. Performance measures used are designed to reward the delivery of key strategic priorities for the year. In 
the 2010 plan year, payout of 60% of the bonus was based on financial targets, with the remaining 40% dependent 
on the achievement of personal objectives. In setting financial targets, the Board focuses on key annual strategic 
objectives. For 2010, financial metrics were based upon achievement of a net profit target, and the Committee 
determined that in order to achieve the maximum payout in respect of the portion of bonus dependent on the 
achievement of financial targets, such targets would be required to be exceeded by at least 20%.
In setting the personal objectives for the Executive Directors, the Board focuses on the Company’s strategic plan 
and taking into account the Company’s corporate values. Personal objectives cover a variety of financial and 
operational targets that contribute to the achievement of goals in the strategic plan and in 2010 included, 
amongst other matters, the introduction of a new management system, and effective risk control.
Bonus opportunities
In reviewing total remuneration arrangements, the Committee decided in 2009 to reduce the bonus opportunity 
for Executive Directors from a maximum of 200% of base salary to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
For 2010, there was no change to the annual maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors with bonus 
opportunities capped at a maximum of 100% of base salary. The annual bonus plan is discretionary and the 
Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to payouts if it believes exceptional circumstances warrant 
doing so. In particular, the Committee has an overriding discretion to consider, if deemed necessary, 
performance on environmental, social and governance issues when determining the annual bonus payments 
for the Executive Directors. Business

2010 performance
In view of the Company’s financial performance during 
2010 the Committee has determined that the following 
bonuses will be paid:
Name
Target 
bonus as a

Bonus

Changes to the 2011 annual bonus 
The Committee has reviewed the balance of 
performance measures under the plan and, for the 
2011 plan year, payout of two thirds of the bonus will 
be based on financial targets, with the remaining third 
dependent on the achievement of personal objectives.
Long-term incentives
Reward and motivate executives for achievement of 
longer-term value creation and align executives and 
shareholder interests
Long-term Incentives are provided to eligible employees 
under the provisions of three different share-based 
plans: The Lamprell plc Executive Share-Option Plan, 
the Lamprell plc Retention Share Plan and the Lamprell 
plc 2008 Performance Share Plan. The Performance 
Share Plan is intended to be the Company’s primary 
long-term incentive vehicle for Executive Directors and 
senior management. Executive Directors will not receive 
regular grants of Options under the Executive Share 
Option Plan or receive regular Awards under the 
Retention Share Plan. Awards under these two plans 
will only be used in exceptional circumstances. The 
Committee regularly reviews both the overall suitability 
of the Company’s share-based remuneration, the level 
of awards made under the plan operated and the 
performance conditions attached to those awards. 
Any value earned under the Company’s long-term 
incentive plans is not pensionable.
The Lamprell plc 2008 Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”)
In 2008, the PSP was agreed to be the primary 
long-term incentive vehicle for Executive Directors. 
Executive Directors and other key individuals may 
participate in this plan that offers awards over Lamprell 
shares on an annual basis. The awards will take the 
form of a promise to deliver free shares, but may be 
structured in an economically equivalent form subject 
to an assessment of local tax and regulatory issues. 
Annual awards are capped at 100% of salary (150% 
of salary in exceptional circumstances).
Performance shares will normally vest on the third 
anniversary of the date of grant of the award, subject 
to any applicable performance conditions having been 
satisfied. In addition the Committee will have an 
overriding discretion, in exceptional circumstances 
(relating to either the Company or a particular 
participant) to reduce the number of shares that vest 
(or to provide that no shares vest).
PSP performance measures
The Committee believes that the performance 
conditions for vesting of PSP awards should strike a 
balance between achieving alignment with shareholder 
returns and reward for delivery of strong underlying 
performance.
The Committee has determined that awards made in 
2010 will vest subject to achieving predefined Earnings 
Per Share (“EPS”) growth over a three-year period. 
The Committee considers EPS to be one of the key 
measures of the Company’s success, particularly 
because it incentivises strong earnings growth over a 
sustained period which is in line with the generation of 
future shareholder value.
For the PSP awards, EPS growth is calculated using 
the point-to-point method. This method compares 
the adjusted EPS in the Company’s accounts for the 
financial year ended prior to the date of grant with the 
adjusted EPS for the financial year ending three years 
later and calculates the total growth over the three 
year period.
The intended EPS targets for awards made in respect 
of 2010 and their associated vesting levels are illustrated 
in the table below (straight-line vesting applies between 
the hurdles). The EPS growth hurdles have been set 
taking into account the long-term strategic plans of the 
Company but also the cyclical nature of the business in 
which the Company operates. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

EPS growth over three-year period
Percentage 
of award

Less than 15% 0%
15% 25%

The Lamprell plc Executive Share Option Plan
The plan provides for Options over Lamprell shares to 
be granted at market value to eligible employees. The 
Options will normally vest after three years and be 
exercisable up to the 10th anniversary of the date of 
grant. No awards were made to Executive Directors 
under this plan in 2010. 
The Lamprell plc Retention Share Plan
The plan provides for the conditional allocation of shares 
to eligible employees selected by the Board. Awards 
will normally vest and the shares be released with any 
accumulated dividends, if determined by the Board, two 
years after the date of grant. No awards were made to 
Executive Directors under this plan in 2010. 
Retirement benefits
Provide retirement benefits in line with local 
market practice
Under employment law in the United Arab Emirates, 
the Executive Directors participate in a terminal gratuity 
scheme operated by the Company as a pension 
equivalent. This is operated as a cash payment based 
on the length of service and final salary of the Executive 
Director and the value of these cash provisions is c. 8% 
of base salary per annum.
Under the terms of the local UAE labour law the terminal 
gratuity accrues benefit to an employee as follows:
21 days per annum for the first five years 
 >
of employment
30 days per annum for the remainder of 
 >
their employment
The benefit accrues for incomplete years on a pro rata 
basis, is calculated using the current base salary and 
has a maximum benefit amounting to two years of the 
annual base salary. 
Other remuneration elements
In line with market practice in the U.A.E., the Executive 
Directors also receive other benefits including car 
allowances, housing allowances, utilities for housing, 
school fees for children up to the age of 18 years old, 
annual airline tickets, medical and life insurance, petrol 
costs and club memberships. The cash value of the 
benefits received by each Executive Director in 2010 
is shown in the summary annual remuneration table 
on page 50.
Directors’ contracts
The policy set out below provides the framework for 
contracts for the Executive Directors. It is the Company’s 
policy that Executive Directors should have contracts 
with a rolling term. Maximum notice period is one year.
Aspect of contract Policy
Notice period (both parties) 12 calendar months
Termination payment Up to one times annual 
basic salary, plus benefits 
but excluding bonus. 
The Company may elect 
to pay sums in lieu of 
notice in three separate 
tranches: 50% within 
seven working days of 
the Termination Date; 
25% three months after 
the Termination Date; and 
25% six months after the 
Termination Date 
Vesting of long-term 
incentive scheme awards
In line with the rules of the 
relevant equity incentive 
scheme – generally 
pro-rated for time and 
performance for good 
leavers
Pension Based on existing 
arrangements and terms 
of the UAE Labour Law 
with respect to terminal 
gratuity
The general policy on termination is that the Company 
does not make payments beyond its contractual 
obligations, i.e. no ex-gratia payments are made. The 
Committee will seek to ensure that there have been no 
unjustified payments for failure, and as such none of the 
Executive Directors’ contracts provides for liquidated 
damages, longer periods of notice on a change of  Business

non-executive Directors’ fees and contracts
The Company aims to provide Non-Executive Directors 
with fees that are competitive with other companies of 
a similar size and complexity. The Company reviewed 
the Non-Executive fee structure during 2008 and 
determined to operate a fee structure with basic fees 
and additional fees for chairing a committee of the 
Board. Non-Executive Director fees remained 
unchanged in 2010. The table below sets out the 
annual fees payable in respect of different roles and 
responsibilities:
Fee Category £
Non-Executive Chairman 100,000
Senior Independent Director 75,000
Basic Member Fee 37,750
Committee Chair Fee (Excluding 
Nominations Committee) 7,000
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate 
in any of the Company’s incentive schemes.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service 
contracts, but instead have specific letters of 
appointment which are available upon request. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial 
term of three years, terminable by either the Company 
or the Non-Executive Director at will. In normal 
circumstances, and subject to performance and 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting, the Non-
Executive Directors can be asked to serve additional 
three-year terms. Upon termination or resignation, 
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to 
compensation and no fee is payable in respect of the 
unexpired portion of the term of appointment.

These interests are set out separately below.
Lamprell Holdings Limited Share Option Plan
Prior to the Company’s listing on the Alternative Investment Market, a one-off grant of options was made 
to selected key employees of the Company, including the Executive Directors. These awards, in aggregate, 
accounted for approximately 5% of the Company’s share capital, and were satisfied with shares beneficially held 
by Steven Lamprell. The awards to the Executive Directors vested immediately on Admission, however, carried 
restrictions on how the shares could be disposed over the first two years following Admission. At the date of his 
retirement from the Board, on 7 June 2010, Peter Whitbread held an interest in 1,550,000 shares under the 
Lamprell Holdings Limited Share Option Plan, all of which were granted on 10 October 2006. There are no 
other outstanding awards to Executive Directors under this share plan.
Share awards 
On 20 May 2008 Nigel McCue and Scott Doak were granted conditional rights to receive shares at no cost. The 
earliest dates that the shares vest under the conditional rights are 20 May 2011 and 10 January 2010 respectively. 
Receipt of the shares is conditional upon them remaining in employment with the Company until that date.

Scott Doak 22,275 nil £4.36 10.01.2010 22,275 nil
The share award to Scott Doak vested on 10 January 2010. On vesting an amount of £2,688 was paid which is 
equal to the aggregate amount of dividends that would have been paid on the shares to which they are entitled 
between the grant date and vesting date. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

not exercised by those dates, the grants will lapse. 
Performance share plan awards
For the year ended 31 December 2009 Nigel McCue and Scott Doak were granted share awards under the PSP. 
The earliest date that they will be entitled to receive the shares under the conditional rights is 15 April 2013.

Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements 
of Lamprell plc and its subsidiaries ("the Group") which 
comprise the consolidated and parent company 
balance sheets as of 31 December 2010 and the 
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, consolidated and parent 
company statements of changes in equity and 
consolidated and parent company cash flow statements 
for the year then ended and a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial 
Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and 
fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with applicable Isle of Man law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union, and for such internal control 
as the directors determine necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated and parent company 
financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud and error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audit. This report, 
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 15 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982 
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this 
opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance whether the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain 
audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers 
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and 
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the 
directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the Combined Code (2008) specified for our 
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. Under the Listing 
Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement 
set out on page 35 in relation to going concern. We are 
not required to consider whether the board’s statements 
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s or group’s 
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control 
procedures. We also review whether the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report includes the six disclosures 
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and we report if it does not.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the consolidated financial statements give a true  >
and fair view of the financial position of the Group as 
of 31 December 2010, and of its financial 
performance and its cash flows for the year then 
ended in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting as adopted by the European Union; and
 the parent company financial statements give a true  >
and fair view of the financial position of the company 
as of 31 December 2010, and of its cash flows for 
the year then ended in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man 
Companies Act 1931-2004; and
 the financial statements have been properly  >
prepared in accordance with the Isle of Man 
Companies Acts 1931-2004.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931-
2004 require us to report to you if, in our opinion:
proper books of account have not been kept by the  >
parent company or, proper returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
the parent company's balance sheet is not in  >
agreement with the books of account and returns; or
we have not received all the information and  >
explanations necessary for the purposes of our 
audit; and
certain disclosure of directors' loans and remuneration  >
specified by law have not been complied with.

1 Legal status and activities
Lamprell plc (the “Company”) was incorporated and registered on 4 July 2006 in the Isle of Man as a public 
company limited by shares under the Isle of Man Companies Acts with the registered number 117101C. The 
Company acquired 100% of the legal and beneficial ownership in Lamprell Energy Limited (“LEL ”) from Lamprell 
Holdings Limited (“LHL ”), under a share for share exchange agreement dated 25 September 2006 and this 
transaction was accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the uniting of interests method 
(Note 29). The Company was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock 
Exchange with effect from 16 October 2006. From 6 November 2008, the Company moved from AIM and was 
admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) plc’s main market for listed securities. The address of 
the registered office of the Company is Fort Anne, Douglas, Isle of Man and the Company is managed from the 
United Arab Emirates (“UAE”). The address of the principal place of the business is PO Box 33455, Dubai, UAE.
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) are: the upgrade 
and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs; fabrication; assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil 
and gas and renewable sector, including jackup rigs and liftboats; Floating Production, Storage and Offloading 
(“FPSO”) and other offshore and onshore structures; and oilfield engineering services, including the upgrade and 
refurbishment of land rigs.
The Company has either directly or indirectly the following subsidiaries:

* The balance of 51% in each case is registered in the name of a UAE National who has assigned all the economic benefits attached to his shareholding to the 
Group entity. LEL has the power to exercise control over the financial and operating policies of the entities incorporated in the UAE through management 
agreements and accordingly, these entities are consolidated as wholly owned subsidiaries in these consolidated financial statements. The UAE National 
shareholders of these entities receive sponsorship fees from the Group (Note 24).
†
 The beneficiaries of the EBT are the employees of the Group. 
+
 A UAE free zone company (“FZCO”) is required to have a minimum of two shareholders and consequently, the balance of 10% is held by an employee of LEL 
in trust for the beneficial interest of the Group.
++
 A Thailand registered company is required to have a minimum of three shareholders and consequently, of the total 867,000 shares, 2 shares are held by 
employees of the Lamprell plc Group in trust for the beneficial interest of the Group and the balance of 866,998 shares are held by LE FZCO.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and parent company financial 
statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements of the parent Company have 
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (“IFRS”), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee interpretations (“IFRIC”) and the Isle of 
Man Companies Acts 1931-2004. In accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982, the 
Company has not presented its own income statement. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
notes to the financial statements for  
the year ended 31 December 2010 Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the 
accounting polices below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the consolidated and parent company financial statements are disclosed in 
Note 4. 
(a)  New and amended standards, and interpretations mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 January 2010 but not currently relevant to the Group
IFRS 2 (amendments), “Group Cash-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions”, effective from 1 January 2010. 
In addition to incorporating IFRIC 8, “Scope of IFRS 2”, and IFRIC 11, “IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share 
Transactions”, the amendments expand on the guidance in IFRIC 11 to address the classification of Group 
arrangements that were not covered by that interpretation. 
IFRS 3 (revised), “Business Combinations”, and Consequential Amendments to IAS 27, “Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements”, IAS 28, “Investments In Associates”, and IAS 31, “Interests in Joint Ventures”, 
are effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of 
the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The revised standard continues to apply the 
acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes compared with IFRS 3. For 
example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent 
payments classified as debt subsequently remeasured through the statement of comprehensive income. There is 
a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at 
fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-
related costs should be expensed. This revised IFRS is currently not applicable to the Group, as the Group has 
no such business combinations.
IFRS 5 (amendment), “Non-Current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations”. The amendment clarifies 
that IFRS 5 specifies the disclosures required in respect of non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified 
as held for sale or discontinued operations. It also clarifies that the general requirement of IAS 1 still apply, in 
particular paragraph 15 (to achieve a fair presentation) and paragraph 125 (sources of estimation uncertainty) 
of IAS 1.
IAS 1 (amendment), “Presentation of financial statements”. The amendment clarifies that the potential settlement 
of a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant to its classification as current or non-current. By amending the 
definition of current liability, the amendment permits a liability to be classified as non-current (provided that the 
entity has an unconditional right to defer settlement by transfer of cash or other assets for at least 12 months after 
the accounting period) notwithstanding the fact that the entity could be required by the counterparty to settle in 
shares at any time.
IAS 27 (revised), “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”, effective 1 July 2010. The revision requires 
the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control 
and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill on acquisitions from non-controlling interests or gains and 
losses on disposals to non-controlling interests. The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost. 
Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
The revision is currently not applicable to the Group, as there are no non-controlling interests.
IAS 36 (amendment), “Impairment of Assets”, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies that the largest 
cash-generating unit (or group of units) to which goodwill should be allocated for the purposes of impairment 
testing is an operating segment, as defined by paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, “Operating Segments” (that is, before the 
aggregation of segments with similar economic characteristics).

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
IAS 38 (amendment), “Intangible Assets”, effective 1 January 2010. The amendment clarifies guidance in 
measuring the fair value of an intangible assets acquired in a business combination and permits the grouping 
of intangible assets as a single asset if each asset has similar useful economic lives.
IFRIC 9, “Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement”, effective 1 July 2009. This amendment to IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an 
embedded derivative should be separated from a host contract when the entity reclassifies a hybrid financial 
asset out of the “Fair value through profit or loss” category. This assessment is to be made based on 
circumstances that existed on the later of the date the entity first became a party to the contract and the date of 
any contract amendments that significantly change the cash flows of the contract. If the entity is unable to make 
this assessment, the hybrid instrument must remain classified as at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety.
IFRIC 16, “Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation” effective 1 July 2009. This amendment states that, 
in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, qualifying hedging instruments may be held by any entity or 
entities within the Group, including the foreign operation itself, as long as the designation, documentation and 
effectiveness requirements of IAS 39 that relate to a net investment hedge are satisfied. In particular, the Group 
should clearly document its hedging strategy because of the possibility of different designations at different levels 
of the Group. 
IFRIC 17, “Distribution of Non-Cash Assets to Owners” (effective on or after 1 July 2009). The interpretation was 
published in November 2008. This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an 
entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has 
also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for 
distribution in their present condition and the distribution is highly probable.
IFRIC 18, “Transfers of Assets from Customers”, effective for transfer of assets received on or after 1 July 2009. 
This interpretation clarifies the requirements of IFRSs for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer 
an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a 
network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services (such as a supply 
of electricity, gas or water). In some cases, the entity receives cash from a customer that must be used only to 
acquire or construct the item of property, plant, and equipment in order to connect the customer to a network 
or provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services (or to do both).
(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 
1 January 2010 and not early adopted
The Group’s and parent entity’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set 
out below.
IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, issued in November 2009. This standard is the first step in the process to 
replace IAS 39, “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements 
for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Group’s accounting for its financial assets. 
The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption. However, the standard has 
not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 January 2013, subject to EU endorsement.
IAS 24 (revised), “Related Party Disclosures”, issued in November 2009. It supersedes IAS 24, “Related party 
disclosures”, issued in 2003. IAS 24 (revised) is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. 
Earlier application, in whole or in part, is permitted. However, the standard has not yet been endorsed by the 
EU. The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party and removes the requirement 
for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government and other 
government-related entities. The Group will apply the revised standard from 1 January 2011. When the revised 
standard is applied, the Group and the parent will need to disclose any transactions between its subsidiaries 
and its associates. The Group is currently putting systems in place to capture the necessary information. It is, 
therefore, not possible at this stage to disclose the impact, if any, of the revised standard on the related party 
disclosures. The Group will apply IAS 24 (revised) from 1 January 2011, subject to EU endorsement. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
66
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
“Classification of Rights Issues” (amendment to IAS 32), issued in October 2009. The amendment applies to 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010. Earlier application is permitted. The amendment addresses 
the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the 
issuer. Provided certain conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity regardless of the 
currency in which the exercise price is denominated. Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as 
derivative liabilities. The amendment applies retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”. The Group will apply the amended standard from 1 January 2011.
“Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement” (amendments to IFRIC 14). The amendments correct 
an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, “IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding 
requirements and their interaction”. Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an 
asset some voluntary prepayments for minimum funding contributions. This was not intended when IFRIC 14 
was issued, and the amendments correct this. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 
1 January 2011. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the 
earliest comparative period presented. The Group will apply these amendments for the financial reporting period 
commencing on 1 January 2011 but it is not expected that these amendments will have any impact on the Group 
or the parent entity’s financial statements. 
IFRIC 19, “Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments”, effective 1 July 2010. The interpretation 
clarifies the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity 
issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity 
swap). It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between 
the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued. If the fair value of 
the equity instruments issued cannot be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reflect 
the fair value of the financial liability extinguished. The Group will apply the interpretation from 1 January 2011, 
subject to endorsement by the EU. It is not expected to have any impact on the Group or the parent entity’s 
financial statements. The Group will apply IFRIC 19 subject to EU endorsement.
2.2 Revenue recognition
(a) Contract revenue
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method. When the outcome of the contract 
can be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated costs up to the 
year end bear to the estimated total costs of the contract. When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome 
cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred up to the year end which are 
considered recoverable.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation 
and the amount of revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage 
such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim and the amount can be measured reliably.
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the 
anticipated losses, including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is 
first foreseen.
The aggregate of the costs incurred and the profit/loss recognised on each contract is compared against 
progress billings at the year end. Where the sum of the costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss 
exceeds the progress billings, the balance is shown under trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable 
on contracts. Where the progress billings exceed the sum of costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised 
loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables as amounts due to customers on contracts.
In determining contract costs incurred up to the year end, any amounts incurred including advances paid to 
suppliers and advance billings received from sub-contractors relating to future activity on a contract are excluded 
and are presented as contract work-in-progress.

(b) Inspection services
Revenue from inspection services is recognised when the services have been rendered; the customer has 
accepted the service and the collectability of the related receivable are reasonably assured.
(c) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.
2.3 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration 
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and 
the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or 
liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as 
incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group 
recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's 
proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in 
consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes directly attributable costs 
of investment.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the 
acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group's share of 
the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations involving entities under common control do not fall within the scope of IFRS 3. Consequently, 
the Directors have a responsibility to determine a suitable accounting policy. The Directors have decided to follow 
the uniting of interests method for accounting for business combinations involving entities under common control.
Under the uniting of interests method, there is no requirement to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquired 
entities and hence no goodwill is created as balances remain at book value. Consolidated financial statements 
include the profit or loss and cash flows for the entire year (pre- and post-merger) as if the subsidiary had always 
been part of the Group. The aim is to show the combination as if it had always been combined.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed or adjustments have been made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
2.4 Investment in subsidiaries
In the Company’s separate financial statements, the investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. Cost is the amount of cash paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the investment. 
Income from such investments is recognised only to the extent that the Company receives distributions from 
accumulated profits of the investee company arising after the date of acquisition. Distributions received in excess 
of such profit i.e. from pre-acquisition reserves are regarded as a recovery of investment and are recognised as a 
reduction of the cost of the investment.
2.5 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The Group’s activities are 
primarily carried out from the UAE and its currency the UAE Dirham, which is pegged to the US Dollar, is the 
functional currency of all the entities in the Group (except LAL whose functional currency is the Thailand Baht and 
the EBT whose functional currency is the British Pound). The consolidated and parent company financial 
statements are presented in US Dollars. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
68
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when deferred into other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary 
economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:
 assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
 >
balance sheet;
 income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and
 >
 all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. >
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, 
are taken to other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange 
differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and 
equipment is the purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets as follows:
Years
Buildings and infrastructure 10–25
Operating equipment 3–10
Fixtures and office equipment 3–5
Motor vehicles 5
The assets’ residual values, if significant, and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each 
balance sheet date. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the 
consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, capital work-in-progress is transferred to 
property, plant and equipment and depreciated in accordance with Group policies.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount (Note 2.21).
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are 
recognised within “other (losses)/gains – net” in the income statement. 
2.7 Intangible assets
Intangible assets representing operating leasehold rights are carried at cost (being the fair value on the date of 
acquisition where intangibles are acquired in a business combination) less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment, if any. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the leasehold 
right over its estimated useful life (17 years).

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, work-in-progress is transferred to software and 
amortised in accordance with Group policies.
2.8 Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and consumables which are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net 
realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct purchase and other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
2.9 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts receivable from customers for billing in the ordinary course of business for 
construction contracts, rig refurbishment and inspection services performed. If collection is expected in one year 
or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators 
that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the 
loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within “general and administrative expenses”. When a 
trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against “general and administrative expenses” in the 
consolidated income statement.
2.10 Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of 
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or 
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
2.11 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past 
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 
2.12 Employee benefits
(a) Provision for staff benefits 
A provision is made for the estimated liability for employees’ entitlements to annual leave and related benefits as a 
result of services rendered by the employees up to the balance sheet date. Provision is also made, using actuarial 
techniques, for the end of service benefits due to employees in accordance with the UAE Labour Law for their 
periods of service up to the balance sheet date. The provision relating to annual leave and leave passage is 
disclosed as a current liability and included in trade and other payables, while that relating to end of service 
benefits is disclosed as a non-current liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in assumptions are charged or credited in the consolidated 
income statement in the period in which they arise.  Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
70
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the shares/options is recognised as an expense. The total amount 
to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares/options granted, 
excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). 
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares/options that are 
expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of shares/options that 
are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to Retained earnings.
The Company has granted rights to its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies conditional 
upon the completion of continuing service with the Group for a specified period. The total amount of the grant 
over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and is 
recognised in each period as an increase in the investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding credit to 
Retained earnings. In the separate financial statements of the subsidiary, the fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the equity instruments of the Company (i.e. parent) is recognised as an 
expense with a corresponding credit to Equity.
2.13 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the 
lessor) are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current accounts with banks less margin deposits, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank 
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 
2.15 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the repayment value 
is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings using 
the effective interest method. The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. The Group previously recognised 
all borrowing costs as an expense.
2.16 Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Group’s consolidated and parent company financial 
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.
2.17 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
accessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Directors that make 
strategic decisions. 
2.18 Taxation
The Company, which is incorporated in the Isle of Man is taxable at 0% in the Isle of Man. 
The Group is subject to income tax in respect of its operations through LAL in Thailand which was incorporated 
in May 2009. However, LAL has been granted the “Investment promotion certificate” (effective 25 November 
2009) which exempts LAL from Corporate Income Tax on net profit derived from the promoted activity for a 
period of eight years.
The Group is not currently subject to income tax in respect of its operations carried out in the UAE.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.19 Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
receivables and held-to-maturity. Currently, the Group does not have any available-for-sale financial assets. The 
classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is 
classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also 
categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as 
current assets.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss is initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are 
expensed in the consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash 
flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all 
risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” 
category are presented in the consolidated income statement within “other (losses)/gains – net” in the period in 
which they arise.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the 
balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise 
trade receivables (Note 2.9), other receivables (excluding prepayments) and cash and cash equivalents (Note 2.14) 
in the Group balance sheet and amounts due from related parties (Note 24) and cash at bank (Note 25) in the 
Company balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried 
at amortised cost less provision for impairment. The amortised cost is computed using the effective 
interest method.
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the counterparty have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of 
the ownership.
(c) Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed 
maturities that the Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group 
were to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity financial assets, the whole category would be 
tainted and reclassified as available for sale. Held-to-maturity financial assets are included in non-current assets, 
except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period, which are classified as 
current assets.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a 
group of financial assets is impaired.
2.20 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The 
Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability 
or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
72
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments 
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging 
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of 
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair 
values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 31. The full fair 
value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is 
more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less 
than 12 months. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement within “other (losses)/gains-net”.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement within “other (losses)/gains-net”. However, when the 
forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, contracts 
work-in-progress or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised 
in cost of goods sold in the case of contracts work in progress or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the consolidated income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the consolidated income statement within “other (losses)/gains-net”.
2.21 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for 
the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating 
units). Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at 
each reporting date. Any material impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement and 
separately disclosed.
2.22 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration 
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are 
subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs 
and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.

3 Financial risk management 
3.1 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange, cash flow 
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis 
to assess and manage critical exposures. The Group’s liquidity and market risks are managed as part of the 
Group’s treasury activities. Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of established policies 
and procedures. 
(a) Market risk – foreign exchange risk
The Group has foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to commitments in Euro with certain suppliers. To 
manage the foreign exchange risk exposure arising from future commercial transactions and recognised liabilities, 
the Group uses forward exchange contracts (Note 31). 
(b) Market risk – cash flow interest rate risk
The Group holds its surplus funds in short-term bank deposits. During the year ended 31 December 2010, if 
interest rates on deposits had been 0.5% higher/lower, the interest income would have been higher/lower by 
USD 527,000 (2009: USD 293,000).
The Group does not have any long-term borrowings and does not have significant interest rate risk exposure on 
bank overdrafts and revolving term facilities.
(c) Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is detailed in Notes 16, 20, 22, 23, 25 and 31. The Group has a policy for 
dealing with customers with an appropriate credit history. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit 
exposure to any financial institution.
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, 
held-to-maturity investment, investment carried at fair value through profit or loss and trade receivables. The 
Group has a formal procedure of monitoring and follow up of customers for outstanding receivables. For banks 
and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of “A” are accepted. The Group 
assesses internally the credit quality of each customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience 
and other factors.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had a significant concentration of credit risk with nine of its largest customer 
balances accounting for 72% (2009: 82%) of trade receivables outstanding at that date. Management believes 
that this concentration of credit risk is mitigated as the Group has long-standing relationships with 
these customers.
The table below shows the rating and balance of the 13 major counterparties at the balance sheet date.

  Refer to Note 16 for the description of internal ratings.
The counterparties in 2010 are not necessarily the same counterparties in 2009.
Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties, except for one 
customer with a balance of USD 2.8 million at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 which has been fully 
provided for.
(d) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an 
adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the nature of the underlying business and through 
progress billings, the Group maintains adequate bank balances to fund its operations.
Management monitors the forecast of the Group’s liquidity position on the basis of expected cash flow. 
The Group's liquidity risk on derivative financial instruments is disclosed in Note 31.
The Group is currently financed from Shareholders’ equity. The table below analyses the Group’s other financial 
liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the

3.2 Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an 
optimal capital structure. Total capital for the Group and the Company is calculated as “total equity” as shown 
in the consolidated balance sheet and in the Company balance sheet respectively.

3 Financial risk management (continued)
Presently, the Group has a dividend policy which takes into account the Group’s capital requirements, cash flows 
and earnings. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group has no net debt and was therefore un-geared.
3.3 Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have 
been defined as follows:
a. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
b. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
c. Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 
(Level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at  
31 December 2010.

Assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Note 23) – – 2,500 2,500
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation 
techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely 
as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are 
observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on 
observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
a. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments; and
b. Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining 
financial instruments.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010
76
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by 
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
as follows:
Revenue recognition 
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the 
percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to estimate the stage of completion of the contract to date 
as a proportion of the total contract work to be performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out in 
Note 2.2. As a result, the Group is required to estimate the total cost to completion of all outstanding projects at 
each period end. The application of a 10% sensitivity to management estimates of the total costs to completion 
of all outstanding projects at the year end would result in the revenue and profit increasing by USD 12.1 million 
(2009: USD 4.7 million) if the total costs to completion are decreased by 10% and the revenue and profit 
decreasing by USD 10.7 million (2009: USD 4.4 million) if the total costs to completion are increased by 10%.
Employees’ end of service benefits
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post employment defined benefit obligation should be based on 
market yields on high quality corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the 
market yields on government bonds should be used. In the UAE, there is no deep market either for corporate or 
government bonds and therefore, the discount rate has been estimated using the US AA-rated corporate bond 
market as a proxy. On this basis, the discount rate applied was 5.25% (2009: 5.75%). If the discount rate used 
was to differ by 0.5 points from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the employee’s end of the 
service benefits provision at the balance sheet date would be an estimated USD 0.6 million (2009: USD 0.5 
million) lower or USD 0.7 million (2009: USD 0.5 million) higher. 
5 Segment information 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Directors who 
make strategic decisions. The Executive Directors review the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess 
performance and allocate resources. Management has determined the operating segments based on 
these reports.
The Executive Directors consider the business mainly on the basis of the facilities from where the services are 
rendered. Management considers the performance of the business from Sharjah (“SHJ”), Hamriyah (“HAM”), 
Jebel Ali (“JBA”) and Thailand (“THL ”) in addition to the performance of Oil Field Engineering (“OFE”) and 
International Inspection Services Limited (“Inspec”). 
SHJ, HAM, JBA and OFE meet all the aggregation criteria required by IFRS 8 and are reported as a single 
segment (“Segment A”). Services provided from Inspec and THL do not meet the quantitative thresholds required 
by IFRS 8, and the results of these operations are included in the “all other segments” column. 
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue from the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup 
rigs, fabrication, assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas sector, including FPSO and 
other offshore and onshore structures, oilfield engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of 
land rigs. 
Inspec derives its revenue from various services such as non-destructive pipeline testing, ultrasonic testing and 
heat treatment. THL derives its revenue from the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, fabrication, 
assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas sector and other offshore structures.

Free share plan
The Company awarded shares to selected Directors, key management personnel and employees under the free 
share plan that provides an entitlement to receive these shares at no cost. These free shares are conditional on 
the Directors/key management personnel/employee completing a specified period of service (the vesting period). 
The award does not have any performance conditions and does not entitle participants to dividend equivalents 
during the vesting period (except for 92,725 shares awarded to two Directors during 2008 which entitles them to 
dividend equivalents during the vesting period). The fair value of the share awards made under this plan is based 
on the share price at the date of the grant less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period. The 
details of the shares granted under this scheme are as follows:

During 2009, 18,241 shares which vested immediately were issued to an employee following his resignation as he 
was considered a “good leaver”.
A charge of USD 1,592,000 (2009: USD 1,791,000) is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the 
year with a corresponding credit to the consolidated Retained earnings. This includes a charge recognised in the 
income statement of the Company with a corresponding credit to Retained earnings of USD 155,000 (2009: USD

Executive share option plan
Share options are granted by the Company to certain employees under the executive share option plan. This 
option plan does not entitle the employees to dividends. These options are conditional on the employee 
completing three years of service (the vesting period) and hence the options are exercisable starting three years 
from the grant date and have a contracted option term of 10 years. The Group has no legal or constructive 
obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
The movement in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise price is as follows:
Average 
exercise
price in 
£ per share Options Vesting date Expiry date
At 1 January 2009 3.22 105,369 16 May 2010 16 May 2017
Granted in 2009 0.57 550,000 31 March 2012 31 March 2019
Forfeited in 2009 3.22 (19,585)
At 31 December 2009 and 2010 0.93 635,784
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2009 determined using a binomial valuation model 
was £0.28 per option. The significant inputs into the model were an average share price for a period of one year 
immediately preceding the grant date of £2.91, an exercise price of £0.57, volatility of 50%, dividend yield of 
3.31%, an expected option term of 10 years, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.28% and a withdrawal rate of 
5% per annum. The risk free rate is derived from the yield on UK Government Bonds as detailed by the Bank of 
England, using a 10-year maturity in line with the life of the option. The volatility assumption is based on an 
analysis of the historic daily share price volatility of the Company since its listing date, capped at 50%. A charge 
of USD 92,000 (2009: USD 150,000) is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year with a 
corresponding credit to the consolidated Retained earnings. This includes a charge recognised in the income 
statement of the Company with a corresponding credit to Retained earnings of USD 73,000 (2009: USD 73,000).

Performance share plan
The Company granted share awards to Directors, key management personnel and selected employees that give 
them an entitlement to receive a certain number of shares subject to the satisfaction of a performance target and 
continued employment. The performance target related to the growth in the Group’s earnings per share. The 
award does not entitle participants to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The fair value of the share 
awards made under this plan is based on the share price at the date of the grant less the value of the dividends 
foregone during the vesting period. The details of the shares granted under this scheme are as follows:

14 earnings per share
(a) Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by 
the Company and held as treasury shares (Note 26).
(b) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the free share awards, options under executive 
share option plan and performance share plan, a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that 
could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s 
shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share awards/options. 
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued 
assuming the exercise of the share awards/options.

22 t rade and other receivables (continued)
Trade receivables that are less than three months past due are generally not considered impaired. As of 31 
December 2010, trade receivables of USD 25.1 million (2009: USD 23.5 million) were past due but not impaired. 
These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default. The ageing 
analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

2009 
USD’000
Up to 3 months 19,713 17,335
3 to 6 months 2,375 4,953

25,096 23,479
At 31 December 2010, trade receivables of USD 3 million (2009: USD 2.8 million) were impaired and provided for. 
The individually impaired receivables are over six months (2009: over six months) old and mainly relate to 
customers who are in an unexpectedly difficult economic situation. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables are primarily denominated in US Dollars or UAE 
Dirhams, which is pegged to the US Dollar. 
Movements on the provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:
2010 
USD’000
2009 
USD’000
At 1 January 2,795 2,788
Provision for receivables impairment (Note 15) 202 101
Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible – (93)
Unused amounts reversed (Note 15) – (1)
At 31 December 2,997 2,795
The creation and release of the provision for impaired receivables have been included in general and 
administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement (Note 10). Amounts charged to the allowance 
account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable 
mentioned above. During 2009, a receivable from one customer amounting to USD 60 million was secured by the 
lien on the new build unit under construction and the related procured materials.
The carrying value of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

23 Financial asset at fair value through profit or loss (continued)
During 2009, a fair value loss of USD 2.5 million was recorded in “other (losses)/gains – net” (Note 13) in the 
consolidated income statement based on management’s estimate of the carrying value. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented within “operating activities” as part of changes in 
working capital in the consolidated cash flow statement.
In January 2011, LEL exercised the put option and realised USD 2.6 million in respect of this investment.
24 Related party balances and transactions 
Related parties comprise LHL (which owns 33% of the issued share capital of the Company), certain legal

During the year, the Company entered into three forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure with 
respect to certain supplier commitments in Euros. The notional principal amount at the date of inception of these 
contracts was Euro 142.02 million. These contracts mature within 24 months from the date of inception.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of 
the hedged item is more than 12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item is 
less than 12 months.
An amount of USD 304,000 was recorded in equity and an amount of USD 170,000 was recycled from equity to 
profit or loss during the year. The net movement in the fair value reserve during the year was USD 134,000.
The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at 
various dates during the next 18 months. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 2010 are recognised in 
the consolidated income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects 
the consolidated income statement. 
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional 
amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market. To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group 
assesses counterparties, using the same techniques as for other counterparties.

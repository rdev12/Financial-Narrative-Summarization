WHy inte Gra ted 
rep ortin G?
An integrated report provides a concise overview 
of how value is generated for all stakeholders. In 
essence how we manage risk, strategy and ethics in 
a sustainable way.
The global drive for public companies to 
transparently report on sustainable competitive 
advantage with a view to the short, medium and long 
term impact on stakeholder value has informed our 
first integrated report.
Our primary focus in this report is on shareholder 
value generation but this report also demonstrates 
how we interact with other stakeholders.
WHat’s CHan Ged in t His r eport
  Strategic focus and future orientation - 
The business model has evolved to provide 
greater clarity of our ability to create value in 
the short, medium and long term, and to its 
use of and effects on the capitals.
  Connectivity of information - Signposting 
for interrelated factors has improved with 
more signposting from the business model 
(see page 6) and material issues (see  
page 8).
  Stakeholder relationships - The nature 
and quality of our relationships with our key 
stakeholders have been outlined, along 
with the material issues that relate to those 
groups and how we are engaging with them 
(see page 8).
  Materiality - Information has been 
disclosed about matters that substantively 
affect our ability to create value over the 
short, medium and long term (see page 64).
  Conciseness - Repetition has been 
removed where possible to provide a more 
intuitive and logical signposting throughout 
our integrated report.
  Reliability and completeness - Material 
matters both positive and negative have 
been approached in a fair, balanced and 
understandable way and without material 
error.
  Consistency and comparability - A 
commitment to provide performance KPIs 
with 5 year comparisons throughout the 
document has been achieved. Although 
some narrative content is provided in 
a language that is consistent with the 
Halfords brand, the framework and the use 
of plain English provides greater clarity of 
information and enables comparisons with 
other organisations.

WHa t next?
Integrated reporting is evolving and this, our first 
integrated annual report, is an important step in the 
journey. In future reports, we will seek to:
 ❱ Incorporate measurement of the broader value we 
deliver to the UK.
 ❱ Explore the connections and interdependencies 
between the resources and relationships that 
sustain our business and to which we contribute.
 ❱ Demonstrate how integrated reporting affects 
thinking in our business.
 ❱ Develop further our approach for identifying and 
prioritising material issues.

KEY PARTNERS
We work with a number of key partners both inside and outside our business. Our Apollo, 
Carrera and Boardman ranges are designed in-house and manufactured in factories in 
the Far East. Our Hong Kong office organises and manages the production lead times 
and arranges shipments to the UK. 
Our store colleagues are very important to us in delivering the customer service that we 
aspire to. Our 3-Gears training programme has been introduced to ensure that consistent 
product knowledge and service is delivered to our customers across all our stores. See 
pages 28 to 30 for more details.
IT systems are very important to us, both in store and in the Support Centre and parts 
are in need of upgrading. During the year we have begun the upgrade of our core SAP 
operating platform and improved the speed of the PEDs used in-store. See pages 37 to 
38 for details.
KEY RESOURCES
We have a number of key brands in both the Auto and Cycling categories, across car 
parts, in-car technology, child seats, cycling, roof boxes, outdoor leisure and camping 
equipment and these are sold across our 465 nationwide stores. Our 303 autocentres 
offer a full service, maintenance and repair service across all car marques. Within these 
establishments our c.12,000 colleagues are a major key resource as it is they that 
are face-to-face with our customers on a daily basis. See pages 28 and 34 for more 
information.
Halfords is a cash generative business having generated £39.5m of free cashflow in 
the year (see pages 53 and 63) and is well supported by its banking syndicate having 
renegotiated a new facility in September 2013 (see page 62).
KEY ACTIVITIES
Our key activities are all designed to help and inspire our customers with their life on 
the move through our Getting into Gear strategy (pages 26 to 39). As a retailer Halfords 
makes a profit from the combination of low cost sourcing and supply chain coupled 
with excellent marketing skills and a national store network, leveraging these skills in 
the car service sector by running an efficient service offer and profits from scale and 
efficiency. Halfords provides services cheaper than most franchised garages and more 
comprehensively than many independent garages.
Our operations are designed to be best in class so that we can leverage our market 
leading positions through our supply chain. We source direct from suppliers around the 
world who manufacture products to our designs and rigid specifications. Our distribution 
team use their specialist knowledge to group and ship products in line with the sales plan 
of our retail operation and the market demands. Our internal operations draw from the 
best industry practice.
VALUE PROPOSITIONS
Halfords is a great business – it’s the nation’s leading cycle retailer and the “go to” 
destination for motorists. Our products and services are as relevant to today’s customers 
as they were when we started out over 100 years ago. Customers’ needs aren’t 
changing but their expectations. We are setting out to grow our business by attracting 
more customers; encouraging them to buy more products and/or services; and 
persuading them to visit our stores and autocentres more often. To do this we make four 
promises; Halfords offers:
 Prices you can trust
 Quality you can trust
 Range you can rely on 
 Service that delights
PRICE
We want our customers to have confidence in our prices. We want them to feel they are 
getting value for money. We shall be introducing new impulse promotions and ‘bundled‘ 
prices - rather than selling a product then the fitting we want to introduce prices with no 
hidden costs. We have already introduced ‘rounded’ prices doing away with the 99p as 
we feel customers are cynical of this type of pricing. It is very important to our growth 
plans that we offer prices our customers trust.
QUALITY
Product quality is another important aspect of ‘value for money’. In listening to our 
customers we have made changes to our products. We want customers to have 
confidence that their purchases will last. During the year we have made our Quality 
Guarantee on all Halfords Advanced socket sets, a no quibble one. We used to exempt 
moving parts but having listened to the customer, it is really important to be able to offer a 
total lifetime guarantee. We want customers to trust our quality.
RANGE
Our range of products is very important to us. We have a strong range and category 
management, ensuring that Halfords remains a natural destination for our customers. 
These ranges and categories contribute to the brand that is Halfords and we must 
continue to bring products to our customers that they can rely on. See page 33 for our 
Apollo story.
SERVICE
In order to improve service to our customers we have focused on four clear objectives. 
To make Halfords a great place to work; to provide stores that we are proud of; to have 
services that make us the best and to delight every customer. See pages 28 to 30 for 
more details.
CHANNELS
We want to create a compelling shopping experience that excites customers, improves 
their knowledge of products and services and their emotional engagement with our 
brand.
We have 465 retail stores and 303 autocentres in which to engage with customers 
face-to-face and building our digital proposition is also a key route to driving future topline 
growth and maintaining our ongoing relevance.
Our ambition is to create a service-led digital proposition. Of all retailers, Halfords has 
the opportunity to be truly multichannel – combining the best of the web with friendly 
expertise in store.
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
Customers are our life-blood. Fundamental to a profitable and sustainable sales growth 
is our ability to offer a friendly-expertise based service, where customers have a better 
experience at Halfords than they would at other non-service based retailers and spend 
more with us and recommend us to their friends. Our Service Revolution will ensure 
customers are served by colleagues who are enthusiastic about their role at Halfords and 
the products and services we offer. 
OUR PILLARS
SUPPORTING DRIVERS OF EVERY CAR
Through our core categories of Car Maintenance, Car Enhancement and Car Servicing 
we provide services and expertise to take the hassle out of motoring. See page 22 for 
more information.
INSPIRING CYCLISTS OF EVERY AGE
Halfords is the largest player in the cycling market, reflecting its scale positioning and also 
the successful extension of its ranges into the premium segment of the cycle market in 
recent years. See page 23 for more information.
EQUIPPING FAMILIES FOR THEIR LEISURE TIME
This third category pillar occupies the smallest element of Halfords Retail sales. It is 
spread across several fragmented markets, which can be grouped under the umbrella of 
camping and outdoor leisure. See page 23 for more information.

In May 2013 we set out the Getting into Gear 
strategy for our Retail business that we would pursue 
and the growth plans for our Autocentre business. 
We are now a year into the journey and progress 
has been very encouraging across a broad front. 
The ride so far has been exciting, the pace high and 
the year has been very busy, touching all parts of 
Halfords. The response of our colleagues has been 
enthusiastic and heartening. Their engagement 
with the many initiatives that Matt Davies and his 
executive team have introduced has been infectious 
and this has begun to have the desired effect: 
increasingly engaged, well trained and committed 
colleagues serve our customers better. There is still 
a way to go but I would like to commence this letter 
by thanking all of our c.12,000 colleagues for a job 
well done. 
Our mission is to Help and Inspire our Customers 
with their Life on the Move. Each element of our 
strategy, which has the customer at the forefront, 
has been pursued with vigour in both our Retail 
and Autocentres businesses. In essence, the thrust 
of our strategy is: to bring about a step change in 
the quality of our service offer to our customers by 
investing in colleague training, staffing and capability; 
reasserting our authority in our key product and 
services categories; investing in our store and 
Autocentres standards and estates and in our 
systems; and creating a more contemporary and 
competitive omnichannel offer. The report that follows 
sets out the progress we are making and what still 
needs to be done. 
Transparent measurement of our progress is critical, 
as is linking this to our remuneration and incentive 
structures throughout the organisation. In the report 
we have also set out in detail our Shareholder, Retail 
and Autocentre KPIs and our performance this year 
at pages 52 to 63. Progress has been encouraging. 
However, most heartening has been the improvement 
in our service delivery with customer response, 
as measured by our Net Promoter Scores (NPS), 
showing a significant and sustained improvement 
across both businesses. Given where we were a year 
ago this is particularly pleasing. Once again, there is 
still some way to go.
The financial performance of Retail was better than 
we had expected at the commencement of the 
year. Retail sales of £803m were up 7.6% on a 
like-for-like (LFL) basis with a stellar performance in 
the Cycling category with LFL sales rising 19.4%. 
Car Maintenance was up 4.9% and online sales, 
primarily Click & Collect, rose a healthy 17.7%. Retail 
gross margin was down as we cleared inventory,

as planned, and due to the strong growth of the 
lower-margin Cycling category. Retail operating costs 
rose, commensurate with the significant investment 
we made, and are making, in the training and 
development of our colleagues, better colleague 
store and centre coverage, higher activity levels and 
increased incentives as most operational and strategic 
milestones were reached. This resulted in Retail 
operating profit of £75.2m for the year, up 2.2%.
Driving the progress and performance of the Retail 
business is largely a new management team that 
Matt brought together during the year. Andrew 
Findlay (Finance & IT) and Jonathan Crookall 
(People), who have been with the Company for 
over three years, were joined by Rob Swyer (Retail/ 
Stores), Emma Fox (Commercial/Marketing/Digital) 
and Jason Keegan (Supply Chain). The impact of the 
new team has been immediate and effective.
The financial performance of Autocentres was 
disappointing. Sales increased by 8.6%, boosted 
by an increase of 23 to 303 centres during the year, 
with LFL sales down 0.1%. Despite an increase in 
gross margin, operating profit decreased £2.0m to 
£4.3m. Midway through the year there was a change 
in leadership and Andrew Findlay temporarily took 
over the reins and successfully began a process 
of gradual improvement. He has now handed over 
the baton to Andy Randall who joined us in March 
2014. The business is now travelling better than this 
time last year and Andy will be given the time and 
resource to get ‘under the bonnet’ of the business. 
In November we will present a fresh view of the way 
forward for Autocentres.
Investment in our stores, infrastructure and 
colleagues of some £100m over the three years in 
our Getting into Gear plan remains on track. In the 
year, £30.4m of spend on stores, IT infrastructure 
and on new Autocentres was outlaid, some 
£12.0m more than the previous year. In addition, an 
incremental investment of £17.0m in Retail inventory 
to achieve the right levels and product ranges was 
made. Despite these outlays and a one-off tax 
payment of £21.0m, cash flow was once again 
robust and net debt decreased to £99.6m with 
gearing at a comfortable 1.0 times net debt:EBITDA.
Group underlying profit before tax of £72.8m 
is marginally up on last year but exceeded our 
expectations set out over a year ago. Earnings per 
share (before non-recurring items) of 28.8p were up 
4% and the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 9.1p, taking the total for the year to 14.3p. It is our 
intention to maintain a c.2x dividend cover over the 
medium term, growing full-year dividends broadly in 
line with earnings per share. 
One of the most truly inspiring aspects of the year 
has been the involvement by colleagues at all levels 
in a large number of community initiatives. For 
example, a partnership was forged with Re~Cycle, a 
charity that collects and ships second-hand bicycles 
to community networks in Africa. There the bicycles 
are repaired, thereby providing employment, and are 
then made available to disadvantaged communities. 
Through two events, customers responded 
generously by donating over 10,000 of their old 
bikes to this cause. Kids’ Holiday Bike Club events 
were held in-store where children were taught how 
to maintain their bikes and road safety; the response 
was fantastic and over 20,000 children and parents 
attended. Halfords has also been confirmed as the 
Official Mechanics Partner for the 2014 Sky Ride 
Big Bike series, spanning 14 events nationwide and 
supporting over 100,000 cyclists this summer. There 
were also many other local events and the buzz 
that these community activities produce throughout 
Halfords is tangible; it is no doubt that it was one of 
the key factors that saw our colleagues vote Halfords 
as one of the Top 25 Best Big UK Companies to 
Work For.

Enthusiasts increasingly

It is a joy and a privilege to chair the Halfords Board 
and to work with Matt and his team. It is therefore 
with sadness that we say goodbye to Bill Ronald 
and Keith Harris who leave the Board at the end 
of May 2014 after 10 years’ service. Both joined at 
the initial listing of Halfords in 2004 and have been 
a source of much sound advice and support to me 
and fellow Board members, for which I thank them. 
It gives me pleasure to welcome Helen Jones who 
joined the Board in March 2014. Helen is currently 
a senior executive at Caffé Nero and, prior to that, 
was CEO of the Zizzi Restaurants group and was 
also responsible for successfully launching the Ben & 
Jerry’s brand in the UK and Europe. She will provide 
valuable brand positioning and marketing and 
experience in managing multiple-outlet networks.
The new financial year has started positively and the 
progress being made with all aspects of our strategy 
continues apace. The ambitious targets we set at the 
outset of the Getting into Gear Retail strategy remain 
both valid and achievable.

halfords Retail delivered a strong 
performance in the year as the 
business repositions to offer a 
significantly-enhanced customer 
experience. t he work undertaken 
in areas such as stock availability, 
product ranges and marketing was 
accompanied by a material uplift in 
investment.
The Retail categories are in better shape and the 
Retail management team has been strengthened 
by several key appointments. Getting into Gear 
has got off to a busy start and the early signs are 
encouraging; there will be much work to do over 
the coming years. New leadership of Autocentres is 
aligned with the Group’s service-based priorities so 
that, in the fullness of time, Halfords will offer an even 
better end-to-end customer experience. 
suMMary of Group r esul ts  
Halfords Retail produced a strong sales performance 
with like-for-like (“LFL”) revenue growth of 7.6% and 
online growth of 17.7% reflecting a number of factors 
including improved stock availability, colleague 
engagement, stronger product ranges and a more-
effective marketing approach. Average weather 
conditions were also more favourable for Cycling 
during the year. Despite improvements in the second 
half that delivered 2.0% LFL sales growth, the 
Autocentres performance did not reflect its market-
share potential over the full year, with FY14 revenues 
increasing by 8.6%, accompanied by flat LFL sales; 
new leadership of Autocentres was appointed at the 
end of the year. 
Sales of £939.7m were up 7.9% year-on-year and 
up 6.5% on a LFL basis. Group gross margin fell by 
110 basis points to 53.7%. Total operating costs rose 
by 6.9% primarily as a result of the increase in store-
colleague investment and incentives. Investment in the 
expansion of our Autocentres business continued as 
the business added 20 centres (net). Group earnings 
before finance costs, tax and non-recurring items 
(“EBIT”) were £77.8m, which compares with £78.1m 
in the prior year. 
Earnings before non-recurring items, finance costs, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) were down 
2.3% to £101.1m. Profit before tax and non-recurring 
items was £72.8m and earnings per share before 
non-recurring items were 28.8p, up 1.1% and 4.0% 
respectively.  
Group inventory and capital expenditure continued 
to be managed tightly, although the planned levels of 
additional Retail stock to improve on-shelf availability 
led to a 12.8% increase in Group inventories on the 
prior period; Autocentres inventory was up £0.1m on 
the prior year. Against the backdrop of a significant 
uplift in investment and a one-off tax settlement of 
£21.0m, the cashflow performance was robust with 
free cashflow of £39.5m generated against £71.8m 
in the prior year. Net debt at the end of the year was 
down £11.0m at £99.6m, with a non-lease-adjusted 
12-month net debt: EBITDA ratio of 1.0:1 versus 
1.1:1 in the prior period.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 
9.1 pence per share (FY13: 9.1 pence), taking 
the full-year dividend to 14.3 pence per share. If 
approved, the final dividend will be paid on 1 August 
2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 4 July 2014. In the light of the guidance 
given twelve months ago, the Board will now look to 
maintain a c.2× dividend cover over the medium

term, growing full-year dividends broadly in line with 
earnings per share. Given the operating cash flow 
profile of the business the Board also now anticipates 
the ratio of future interim and final dividend payments 
to move toward 30:70.

Sales were £803.1m, up 7.7% on the previous year 
and 7.6% on an LFL basis. 
In FY14 Cycling was the largest Retail category by 
sales and was the standout performer throughout 
the year. LFL growth of 19.4% reflected improved 
execution, a successful Christmas for children’s bikes, 
more-conducive weather conditions and sustained 
interest in Cycling as a leisure activity. The cycle offer 
was enhanced during the year, with refreshes of the 
Apollo and Boardman ranges particularly engaging 
customers. Representing over one third of premium-
cycle sales, Cycle-To-Work revenues grew by 14.8%. 
Halfords also implemented a major acceleration of 
its presence in the Cycling Parts, Accessories and 
Clothing market (”PACs”). This activity was combined 
with the appointment of additional Cycling capability, 
including the creation of a Head of PACs role and, with 
a more-effective marketing approach, every Cycling 
sub-category grew, including 15.8% growth in PACs, 
28.6% growth in Cycle Repair and 29.9% growth in 
Premium Bike sales.
LFL sales of Car Maintenance products and services 
grew by 4.9%. Sales in the second half were 
hampered by mild winter conditions versus a cold 
and snowy prior year. However the sale and fitting of 
bulbs, blades and batteries (“3Bs”) again represented 
the largest single element of the category and 
growing demand emanated from the building of 
awareness of the wefit service, this year via the TV 
and radio ‘Cheaper than a Favour’ campaign. 
Car Enhancement LFL revenues decreased by 0.1%. 
Representing nearly a quarter of category sales, Car 
Cleaning revenues grew by 13.7%, boosted by the 
re-merchandising of the range to emphasise the 
strength of Halfords’ branded offer. Key price points 
were also targeted to improve value perception. Sat 
Nav sales, down 8.1% in the year, continued to be 
impacted by the effects of a structurally-declining 
market, whilst Audio sales grew 1.1%.
Travel Solutions LFL revenues increased by 2.1%, 
with additional clearance and more-compelling 
offers driving improved sales of camping and travel-
equipment products. 
Online Retail revenues grew by 17.7% and 
represented 11.3% of total Retail sales (FY13: 
10.3%). The growth was driven by the first phase of 
Halfords.com’s relaunch in November 2013, leading 
to substantially-increased conversion rates. Whilst 
over half of online Retail sales were represented by 
the Cycling category, a consistent 88% of online 
orders were collected in store during the period.  
In the year total in-store service income included 
within all of the above categories increased by 17.4% 
to £24.3m, with the majority of revenues flowing from 
3Bs fitting and Cycle Repair.
operational r eVieW: auto Cent res
Total Autocentres revenues were up 8.6% and, on a 
LFL basis, down 0.1%. Despite improvements in the 
second half, this performance reflected operational 
and market challenges the business faced. 23 new 
Autocentres were opened and three were closed 
in the year, taking the total number of Autocentre 
locations to 303. Halfords is committed to the 
continued investment in the Autocentres business to 
secure medium-term growth, though the business 
plans to refocus the centre-opening programme on 
fewer and larger new centres. Halfords will continue to 
close sub-optimal centres as a matter of course.
operational r eVieW suMMar y
The Halfords Retail performance was strong, 
driven by self-help actions and, although weather 
conditions were favourable for the Cycling category, 
they were adverse for Car Maintenance. The results 
illustrate how Halfords is beginning to build both 
its proposition and a significantly-enhanced Retail 
customer experience. With Autocentres focusing 
on the enhancement of its service proposition, 
underpinned by further investment, the business will 
deliver a more consistent and engaging experience 
for its Autocentre customers.
Halfords Business r eVieW
Halfords’ mission is to Help and Inspire our 
Customers with their Life on the Move within the 
following categories: Supporting Drivers of Every 
Car, Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age and Equipping 
Families for their Leisure Time.
Equipping Families for their Leisure Time gives the 
flexibility to extend the range, introduce innovative 
products and leverage space. However the vast 
majority of management’s focus is currently on Auto 
and Cycling as these markets are significant and, 
with strong execution, management anticipates 
sustainable opportunities for growth.  
The Retail strategy, Getting into Gear, is based on 
the following five elements designed to significantly 
enhance the customer experience:
1. Service Revolution — introducing a step change 
in customer service across Halfords stores
2. The ‘H’ Factor — reasserting our proposition 
authority to Support Drivers of Every Car, Inspire 
Cyclists of Every Age and Equip Families for Their 
Leisure Time
3. Stores Fit to Shop — investing to raise the 
Halfords store estate to a standard the business

Highlights include a new recruitment process that 
involves centralised online application, telephone 
screening, interviews in store with role play and an 
in-store audition before an appointment is made. 
Since launch nearly 55,000 applicants were screened 
for around 1,000 vacancies. This new approach 
significantly raised the quality of new colleagues. 
The 3-Gears training programme was launched with 
virtually all eligible colleagues having completed Gear 1 
by the end of the year. A number of colleagues began 
Gear 2 before the end of the year. 50% of colleagues 
are anticipated to complete Gear 2 by March 2015. 
Two colleagues per store will pass the Gear 3 guru 
level by the end of FY16. 
Colleague engagement is central to the Getting Into 
Gear strategy, so it was particularly encouraging to see 
an increase in the latest Group colleague engagement 
survey score to 80% (FY13 77%). The result was 
underpinned by the good news that Halfords was 
recently voted as one of the 25 Best Big Companies 
to Work For in the UK (see The Sunday Times Best 
Companies To Work For 2014). These scores were 
reflected in a rise in the Retail net promoter score to 
72% from a run rate of around 55% in the prior year.
tH e ‘H’ f aCto r
A revitalisation of the Retail product range was 
enhanced by the appointment of a new Commercial 
Director in September 2013. Examples of the refresh 
in the period included upgraded ranges of Boardman 
and Apollo cycles, trials of cycle finance in-store, 
extended ranges online, the introduction of wearable 
fitness technology and a revised private-label hierarchy 
that included the new Halfords Essentials brand. 
The business also focused on the balance between 
third-party and private-label brands. The third-party 
Tenn brand in Cycling clothing was introduced in 
the period, whilst the upweighted focus on Kärcher 
pressure washers compared against a reduced focus 
on the Halfords-branded offer in Car Cleaning. Global 
brands such as General Electric were also introduced 
within the Car Maintenance category. Attention has 
been paid to the execution of marketplace offers 
at the front of store, as well the introduction of 
interactive merchandising. 
stores f it to sHop
Three refreshed stores were opened at the end of July 
2013 wherein Halfords created a modern, engaging 
and friendlier store environment that encourages 
browsing and more interaction with colleagues. At the 
period end, 27 stores were trading in the new format, 
with a further c.50 stores planned for refresh in the new 
financial year. The stores refreshed so far are delivering 
results in line with management’s plans and investment 
criteria. Halfords will continue improving its portfolio 
of Cycling departments by the end of FY16 after 100 
were refreshed in the period.

 Century infr astru Ctur e
A key focus within the Getting Into Gear programme 
is infrastructure, particularly across IT systems and 
capability. Examples of the progress made include 
the upgrade to SAP , the core Retail operating system, 
completed in May 2014. New chip & PIN pads in 
store saved customers an average of 19 seconds 
per transaction, and to help colleagues, the business 
installed laptop computers in stores to make it easier 
to progress through the 3-Gears training programme. 
New VOIP technology across the store estate also 
enabled colleagues to serve customers more effectively 
and at reduced cost.

The appointment of a new Supply Chain Director was 
followed by a trial to deliver more frequently to store, 
benefitting stock availability and potentially saving a 
significant element of courier cost related to the Click 
& Collect proposition.

The goal of Click with the Digital Future is to create 
a much-improved online and omnichannel Retail 
experience. Phase One of the website relaunch went 
live in November 2013, with a different tone of voice 
to make the website more emotionally engaging and 
inspiring. A new home page included more-intuitive 
navigation to help all customers find what they are 
looking for more easily and with far fewer clicks. The 
system of checkout was reshaped to help customers 
complete their transaction more simply; this was 
designed to reduce the risk of abandoned baskets. 
Customers also now pay for their entire Click & 
Collect transactions in store. Further enhancements 
will be completed in due course, including social-
network interactions and upgraded ‘my account’ 
functionality.
auto Centres
The investment plan continued as new centres 
were opened and the business looks to improve the 
consistency of in-centre service. Expenditure was 
directed to improving the infrastructure, from new 
IT systems to more-efficient processing systems, 
enabling more effective centre management. As service 
is central to the Halfords strategy, colleague incentives 
were changed in the year to embed customer-service 
metrics, such as net promoter scores; colleague 
engagement continued to improve this year.
This customer-centric plan is vital as the business 
extends its differentiation from key competitors. 
Autocentres will also better leverage the relationship 
with the Retail stores. Andy Randall was appointed 
in March 2014 to lead the business and is focused 
on delivering a significantly-enhanced experience for 
Autocentre customers. 
CoMMunity enGaGeMent
This was the first year of a major step-up in activity 
designed to leverage Halfords’ specialist credentials in 
local areas through community engagement.  
In FY14 over 20,000 children and parents attended a 
Kids’ Bike Workshops in store to learn the basics of 
how to look after their bike, with 97% of parents likely 
to recommend the summer workshop to others. In 
FY15, together with the Easter holiday, stores will run 
the workshop in the summer and during the October 
half-term week, promoted through schools and links 
with children’s organisations such as UK Youth and 
Children’s University. Halfords now partners with the 
Scouts Association and supports the Cub Cyclist 
Activity badge. Building on this success, Halfords will 
also offer a tailored workshop in schools, focused on 
year-six pupils as they progress through Bikeability 
(formerly called cycling proficiency), as well as teachers 
seeking additional life skills to support their pupils’ 
transition to senior school. 
The partnership with Re~Cycle (the charity that sends 
unwanted bikes to Africa) went from strength to 
strength. In FY14 Halfords helped Re~Cycle double 
the number of containers sent to Africa through the 
world’s largest bike trade-in event, with over 10,000 
unwanted bikes donated at Halfords stores, diverting 
over 150 tonnes of waste to a sustainable alternative 
and generating £1.5m in new bike sales. In addition 
to more trade-in events in FY15, Halfords will also 
trial accepting bike donations at over 75 stores and 
will continue fundraising to support the £10 it costs 
to send a bike to Africa, with over £90,000 raised so 
far.  In FY15 stores will also receive ‘community’ hours 
to support additional local-community activity, helping 
them to build closer relationships with their local 
communities. 
Halfords has also been confirmed as the Official 
Mechanics Partner for the 2014 Sky Ride Big Bike 
series, spanning 14 events nationwide and supporting 
over 100,000 cyclists this summer. These free one-day 
events offer cyclists of all ages and abilities the chance 
to ride their bike on traffic-free streets or on cycle 
paths and parks in the heart of towns and cities across 
Britain. Halfords cycle mechanics will be a key part of 
the day, keeping cyclists on the move assisting with 
essential adjustments, cabling and tube replacements.
Halfords is also trialling a Cycle Repair Academy in 
Onley Prison, where a number of prisoners close to 
their release dates are being trained as bike mechanics 
with a view to being employed in Halfords stores, once 
released. This programme will provide Halfords with 
potentially very loyal, trained and motivated colleagues 
whilst at the same time supporting the broader goal of 
rehabilitation of offenders.
Current aCti Vity
As Halfords becomes more of a Cycling business in the 
first half of the year, a Summer Of Cycling lies ahead, 
with major launches imminent within the Halfords 
cycle range. The fastest growing and second-largest 
volume brand in the range, Carrera, will undergo a 
complete refresh in the summer. I am particularly 
pleased to see Kona and Mongoose, two formidable 
global Cycling brands, added to our growing list of 
superb cycle options. The Pinarello brand of cycles will 
soon be available at 43 stores  with around 50 models 
onlin today. These launches will coincide with a busy 
summer of Cycling events, with the recent Giro d’Italia 
Big Start in Belfast, the Tour de France’s Le Grande 
Départ in Yorkshire in July and the Commonwealth 
Games in Glasgow in July and August.
Halfords Retail’s auto business also has a busy period 
ahead, with the launch of Car Parts Direct by the end 
of summer 2014, wherein around 130,000 car-part 
SKUs will be available for prompt pick-up at Halfords 
stores or through home delivery. A number of smaller 
accretive opportunities will be progressed, including 
the sale of powersport and leisure batteries, the sale 
online of car registration plates as well as the ranging of 
scooter helmets.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all 
colleagues for their immense contribution and 
commitment to the progress of Halfords and the 
implementation of the plan to reposition the  
business. It has been a pleasure to work with you over 
the past year.

Markets
halfords has a unique role to 
play for uK and irish consumers. 
t hrough its Retail and autocentres 
businesses the Group can exploit 
a number of diverse growth 
opportunities. with a special place 
in the heart of consumers, halfords 
is a powerful brand with a great 
heritage and strong brand equity.
Halfords Retail differentiates itself in the markets of 
automotive, cycling and outdoor leisure across its 
three strategic pillars of Supporting Drivers of Every 
Car, Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age and Equipping 
Families for their Leisure Time.
With 465 locations, Halfords Retail has a significantly 
favourable market position with stores being located 
less than 20 minutes driving distance away from 90% 
of the UK population. Unique offers such as wefit 
create convenient local solutions. Halfords.com, in 
combination with the stores, their expert colleagues 
and specialist product ranges, creates a true 
omnichannel advantage for the business. 
Over the past year Halfords’ markets have been 
either relatively flat or, in categories such as cycling, 
in strong growth. It’s difficult to segregate how much 
of the market performance was down to changing 
consumer behaviour, an improving economy or even 
the weather; however, the sustained growth in the 
popularity of cycling and advantageous technological 
changes in the Auto Aftercare category have and will 
benefit Halfords in the future.
supportin G dri Ver s of eVer y Car
After a number of years of decline, UK car mileage 
rose in 2013, coinciding with the highest number 
of new-car registrations for five years. According to 
the SMMT, 2,264,737 cars were registered in 2013, 
up 10.8% on 2012. The UK is consistently Europe’s 
second-largest car market and was the only one to 
grow continually throughout 2013.
The number of cars on Britain’s roads also continued 
to grow whilst the average age of a UK car increases 
each year. Technology changes progressed with 
around 50% of new cars coming fitted with stop-
start batteries. Although the Sat Nav market remains 
in structural decline, technological and regulatory 
factors have favourably impacted the Auto Aftercare 
market. For instance, European Union directives 
regarding CO
2
 emissions and road safety mean that 
more and more cars will come fitted with daylight 
and automatic lights, along with flat wiper-blade 
functionality.
With bulbs, blades and batteries (“3Bs”) becoming 
increasingly complex to fit on new vehicles and the 
DIY approach to fixing cars shrinking with each 
generation of new drivers, the 3Bs fitting market 
presents Halfords with a unique opportunity to grow 
its current low market share. Fitting services were in 
significant demand throughout FY14, augmented by 
an enhanced marketing approach and expert service 
with Halfords uniquely placed to provide a value and 
hassle-free Do It For Me (“DIFM”) level of service that 
more and more drivers are set to need.
Since the acquisition of Autocentres, Halfords has 
also consolidated and strengthened its position in 
the c.£9bn servicing market. That market was made 
up of nearly 40,000 outlets in 2008, dropping to 
less than 37,000 in 2013 as the market continues 
to consolidate. Halfords can and does exploit this

opportunity using its scale-based business model, 
expanding its number of Autocentres each year.
In the Car Enhancement category the Sat Nav 
market shows no signs of slowing its sharp decline. 
However the Government remains committed to a 
digital future for radio with a potential switchover in 
the medium term. With Halfords occupying most 
of the in-car digital-radio market in 2013, this could 
have a material impact on the category for the 
business, though not in the short term. Halfords also 
made gains in audio equipment thanks to reduced 
competition on the high street and with the digital 
switchover on the horizon, this looks set to continue. 
In fact no other UK-wide business can match 
Halfords’ skillset and price on either Audio fitting or 
Sat Nav set-up and demonstration.

Halfords is the largest player in the UK cycling 
market, reflecting its scale positioning and also the 
successful extension of its ranges into the premium 
segment of the cycle market in recent years. This 
included the introduction of the Pinarello brand to 
the range alongside a successful complete refresh 
of the Boardman series. The business also materially 
expanded its offer in the fast-growing Cycling Parts, 
Accessories and Clothing (“PACs”) market during 
the year.
The summer of 2013 saw better weather conditions 
year on year, despite the fact that the October 2013 
to February 2014 period was one of the wettest 
on record. According to Mintel, road bikes saw the 
strongest growth in the past year, reflecting the 
success of British riders in the Tour de France and 
the growth of UK road-riding events, known as 
sportives. Before Sir Bradley Wiggins’ famous win 
in Paris in 2012, the British Cycling Association had 
around 42,500 members; by November 2013, it had 
grown to 84,250. 
The number of people cycling keeps growing against 
a continuing trend of declining participation for other 
major sports. As a result, Mintel expects up to 46% 
growth in the value of the Cycle market between 
2013 and 2018 (as a best-case scenario).
In 2013, a record number of certificates were issued 
by the Cycle To Work Alliance, a group of leading 
providers of the scheme, including Halfords. Around 
100,000 new users were recruited to the scheme  
in 2013.
Road safety remains the greatest concern for 
potential UK cyclists. However, public bodies are 
increasingly looking to invest in Cycling infrastructure, 
particularly given the benefits greater participation 
can bring in terms of not only public health but also 
reduced congestion and pollution.
It is clear that smartphones and wearable technology 
play an increasingly important role for cyclists; 
this trend will only accelerate. In the year Halfords 
introduced a compelling range of wearable-fitness 
products from brands such as Jawbone and Garmin. 
A new Halfords Bikes Miles app allows cyclists to 
earn points for offers online and in-store, join teams, 
log rides and reach milestones.
Within a rapidly growing cycle market Halfords has 
strengthened its core position whilst penetrating 
key opportunities across premium, PACs, female, 
junior and a host of others. With a strong brand, 
increasingly-skilled expert colleagues, a growing 
range of products and brands, an extensive national 
network of stores being refreshed and a true 
omnichannel offer, Halfords’ credibility as a place for 
Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age is beyond doubt.

This third category pillar occupies the smallest 
element of Halfords Retail sales. It is spread across 
several fragmented markets, which can be grouped 
under the umbrella of camping and outdoor 
leisure, while also encompassing a wide variety of 
strategically chosen impulse products. The range 
changes throughout the year build in a vital element 
of seasonality.

and inspire our customers with their life on the move. 
We do this by focusing on significantly enhancing the 
customer experience at our stores and centres while 
operating our business as a good corporate citizen.
Operating in fragmented markets, our core activities 
of retailing and car repair services leverage the 
Halfords brand to consolidate a range of products 
and services for motorists, cyclists and family leisure 
time. In Retail this means promoting our 465 stores, 
halfords.com and product categories in which we 
hold leading market positions and in our Autocentre 
business through our 303 Autocentres and 
halfordsautocentres.com.
With a focus on organic growth in retail we continue 
to position ourselves as the destination for products 
and services that enhance our customers’ use 
of their car, their bikes and their touring activities. 
We support drivers of every car by providing the 
products, services and expertise required to take 
the hassle out of motoring and making driving 
more enjoyable. We are able to both encourage 
our customers to do it for themselves as well as 
provide a fast cost effective way for us to do it for 
them in-store. We are dedicated to providing the 
right level of service to our customers, from stocking 
in-store and online a comprehensive assortment of 
car parts, through a price competitive, 7 days a week 
on-demand fitting service, to a full service and repair 
offer through the national coverage afforded by our 
Autocentres.
With over 100 years’ heritage in cycling, our 
service, expertise, brands and product range are 
unsurpassed and we will continue to offer these 
products and services whether it be to customers 
who are purchasing their first bike or a top-of-the-
range Boardman road bike. We aim to inspire cyclists 
of every age and to build on our service and brand 
credentials as well as providing a leading national 
range of parts, accessories and clothing, contributing 
to the growing popularity of cycling as a healthy and 
environmentally friendly form of transport.

of camping equipment and roof boxes, we equip 
families for their leisure time, making the most of 
their journeys and their time outdoors. With the

for the enjoyment of simple family pleasures, such 
as camping, Halfords offers a range of great range 
of leisure products from travel accessories, travel 
equipment and camping solutions.
In order to deliver our promise of supporting 
drivers of every car, inspiring cyclists of every age 
and equipping families for their leisure time, we 
will continue to offer a unique range of products, 
which are constantly innovated and extended. 
They are matched by an honest and trustworthy 
service delivered by our trained, enthusiastic 
and knowledgeable colleagues in-store, at the 
autocentres and online thereby helping our 
customers, from novices to enthusiasts, to work out 
exactly what they need. 
Our unique store fitting service and competitive 
autocentre repair service gives customers the choice 
of having us do it for them or doing it themselves. 
We deliver convenient and value solutions to our 
customers, where they can get what they need when

We will ensure that Halfords is the No.1 destination 
for the products that we offer. Our Auto offer, the 
largest part of our business, looks to support drivers 
with the servicing, maintenance and enhancement 
of their motor vehicles. In Cycling we are already the 
largest retailer of cycles in the UK, selling bicycles 
into all areas of the market, with Boardman at the 
heart of our premium range and the biggest UK 
cycling brand Apollo being used for the majority of 
our customers’ leisure and short commute rides.
In FY15 we shall be launching a new range of junior 
bikes within Boardman and relaunching our fast-
growing Carrera brand as well as adding more parts, 
accessories and clothing to our store range.
Camping and associated products have been a 
focus for Halfords over recent years and we will be 
looking to build on past successes of equipping 
families for their leisure time by introducing new 
ranges of camping accessories, wearable fitness 
products and offering ‘bundled’ products.
We plan to offer customers the ability to shop in 
a warm, inviting and engaging store environment. 
To do so we have commenced a refresh project 
within our store portfolio, with many undergoing 
redevelopment as part of our Stores Fit to Shop 
refresh programme. We are improving signage both 
externally and internally, giving customers clear 
information about store segregation and product 
usage. We have reallocated space in some stores to 
accentuate our specialist offer in Auto and Cycling, 
enabling stores to range more bikes and to provide 
a more relevant environment in which to shop. We 
are introducing digital technology into stores allowing 
customers to look up products for their vehicles 
and to order extended-range products online. Our 
colleagues are also very much part of the Halfords 
shopping experience and changes are being 
introduced to our stores to ensure that they become 
central to the services we offer and to the overall 
customer journey.
We will have a Supply Chain & IT infrastructure that 
supports our delivery and availability aspirations 
both in-store and direct to customers. Technical 
improvements must be considered to enable our 
business to fulfil its potential. Shopping online or 
in-store needs to be seamless and easy, improving 
availability and ensuring that our customers feel 
engaged. We’ll ensure our colleagues are supported 
to serve customers with access to product 
information that is accurate, timely and interactive.
Our supply chain needs will be flexible to meet the 
needs of our customers and our stores, helping 
stores maintain on-shelf availability with more regular 
out of hours deliveries and delivering web-based 
orders at a time and place convenient to the 
customer.
Our website will continue to evolve to both help and 
enhance our customers’ shopping experience. To 
ensure that we meet the challenges of a changing 
retail marketplace we are significantly improving 
the website, introducing How To Guides whilst 
launching a Halfords app and simplifying our Click 
& Collect process. We can now give our customers 
the opportunity to book services online in both the 
Retail and Autocentre businesses. We are now in the 
process of rolling out tablets to all stores to help our 
expert colleagues provide better information to our 
customers. All these improvements are essential as 
we move to a truly omnichannel model.

Quite simply a great place to work creates a great 
place to shop. Last year we recognised that in 
this part of our Service Revolution programme we 
had to improve our approach to recruiting the very 
best people and provide a structured development 
programme for all our colleagues. All of this is 
underpinned by the ambition to deliver a friendly, 
expert service for our customers.
During the year we introduced a new process to 
recruiting store colleagues. Now they apply online, 
their application is screened; candidates are then 
telephone interviewed and if successful they go 
to store for a rigorous three-stage process: an 
interview, a role play and a ‘road test’. We now have 
the opportunity to see candidates in action before 
offering them a job making sure they are right for 
Halfords and Halfords is right for them.
In May 2013 we launched the 3-Gears programme, 
focusing on practical training as well as e-Learning, 
whereby all elligible colleagues now undertake a 
structured three-month induction (Gear 1), followed 
by a programme lasting up to nine months (Gear 
2), which includes workshops, e-learning and 
demonstrable expertise on the shop floor. Gear 3 
focuses on high-skill training for a limited group of 
colleagues which will establish them as real technical 
experts in Auto or Cycling.
We now have our eligible colleagues through Gear 1  
and we are now focusing on Gear 2 with the aim 
to get 50% of colleagues through this part of the 
programme by the end of FY15. We have supported 
the completion of 3-Gears in stores by putting laptop 
computers into our stores which enable colleagues 
to work on the training in-store before or after their 
shifts.
The 3-Gears programme is just one part of our 
development activity. In addition, we have developed 
and built the Aspire, Accelerate and Engage 
programmes. Aspire is a structured programme 
to help colleagues develop into their first Assistant 
Manager role and for current Assistant Managers to 
develop into Store Managers. Accelerate is a three 
day leadership programme for store managers whilst

We continue to aim to be an employer of choice, 
where our colleagues enjoy equal opportunities 
to help our customers and prosper within a 
rewarding and inspiring team.
Engage is a programme for our Area Managers that 
also focuses on leadership skills.
All these activities show that we are fully committed 
to our colleagues, their well-being and development. 
Our colleagues are absolutely central to the growth 
plans we have, so the Board was delighted that our 
colleagues voted Halfords as one of the Sunday 
Times 25 Best Big Companies to Work For in the UK 
(February 2014). We are striving to become a truly 
great place to work.
2 stores t o Be pro ud of
Our stores need to be places that our colleagues 
are proud of and that our customers are happy to 
visit. There is a need to improve and strengthen our 
operational standards – the essential element of 
managing great stores. This year we have focused 
on our price mechanics, labelling, merchandising and 
basic availability standards. We have also worked 
hard on resource planning and holiday management 
to ensure we have the right colleagues in the right 
place at the right time. 
We have also introduced a balanced scorecard of 
measures that allows us to identify great and poor 
performance in our stores. This is key to our store 
operations as we will never be satisfied or complacent 
about the level of service our customers deserve. 
Some examples this year have been the introduction 
of trading feedback, changes to rotas to meet 
colleague and store needs, as well as simplifying our 
communications from the Support Centre.

Last year as well as recognising that we need the 
right people in store we also recognised that we 
need to create an environment in which colleagues 
had the time and expertise to delight our customers. 
We knew that we needed to reduce the amount of 
time our colleagues spent on non-value added tasks, 
increase customer contact time, and incentivise 
colleagues to deliver a great customer experience 
and thereby drive sales.
Reinforcing the ethos that the customer is the most 
important person in the store is key to our business 
and we continue to make sure our teams prioritise 
customers over other tasks they have to perform. 
We have prioritised net promoter score (“NPS”) as 
our key service metric and over the year we saw 
it rise to 72%. We are also making sure that we 
understand why, if things go wrong, what we have 
to do to stop that happening again. We have a real 
opportunity to solve customers’ problems using our 
wide range of products, colleague expertise and 
genuine concern for the customer. To illustrate this, 
the imminent roll-out of tablets in every store will give 
us a further opportunity to delight our customers with 
an extended range of products and online ordering 
in-store.

Halfords’ position as a natural destination for auto 
and cycling products makes it a natural place for 
us to offer associated services. Sophisticated car 
production is causing a long-term shift amongst 
customers from a Do it Yourself (“DIY”) to a Do it 
for Me (“DIFM”) attitude. As the UK’s No.1 Cycling 
retailer we are in a position to support our customers’ 
purchases with advice, bike builds, bike care plans 
and service and repair. As our 3-Gears programme 
bears fruit this service area gives our colleagues the 
opportunity to showcase their expertise.
Within our Car Maintenance category we supply 
our unique wefit service, especially with the fitting 
of bulbs, blades and batteries (“3Bs”). This offer 
allows our colleagues to build a close relationship 
with our customers, developing an understanding of 
our customers’ needs and offering further help and 
advice as appropriate. It offers convenience for the 
customer, with parts being professionally fitted at the 
point of purchase. At one point in 2013 our stores 
were fitting a bulb, blade or battery for our customers 
every six minutes! 
We also offer a wecheck service free of charge 
to customers to ensure that any automotive part 
or consumable required is not only needed, but is 
the correct part for their vehicle. All of our stores 
provided customer reference lists and we are rolling 
out digital vehicle registration look-up devices to 
enhance this offer.
In our Cycling category we build our customers’ 
bikes free of charge, but where this is not the case 
we provide a weassemble service. We provide 
weservice where, on purchase of a bicycle, we 
provide a free six-week check. Customers can also 
purchase a bike care plan (“BCP”) to have the labour 
element of any regular maintenance covered. A focus 
of the last year has been werepair as we seek to 
develop our colleagues’ expertise in repairing and 
servicing cycles and enhance Halfords’ credentials 
as a comprehensive Cycling destination. Details of 
the number of jobs performed in FY14 and of the 
associated revenues can be found on pages 54  
and 55.
We are an equal opportunities organisation with 
clear expectations about how we all behave 
both internally and with customers and other 
stakeholders, including in relation to diversity and 
gender. Historically there has been a tendency for 
more males than females to be attracted to working 
in our stores and autocentres; however, through our 
recruitment, talent and development programmes we 
seek to become more reflective of the customers and 
communities that we serve.

Our Auto offer comprises Car Maintenance and 
Car Enhancement. It’s the largest part of our Retail 
business, representing around 47% of Group 
revenues and the changing nature of the Auto 
market means we are well placed to exploit material 
opportunities.
The number of cars on British roads continues to 
grow and overall mileage is starting to increase 
for the first time since 2008. The age of the car 
parc continues to increase and newer cars on 
the road have added complexity, both of which 
lend themselves to our unique Car Maintenance 
proposition.
In FY15 our Car Maintenance category will continue 
to be driven by initiatives across our product ranges 
and service offering, including car parts. bulbs, 
blades and batteries (“3Bs”) represent a significant 
growth opportunity for us, with the parts and labour 
market estimated to be worth around £1bn. Halfords 
currently has a relatively low market share. In FY14 
we sold 5.3m bulbs and fitted 37% of them and we 
will continue to enhance the breadth of our car parts 
range by bringing innovative and specialist products 
to market. As the technology in wiper blades 
develops we will be extending our range to include 
flat blades and widening our range of rear-wiper 
blades as retail aftermarket demand increases. More 
and more new cars are being fitted with batteries that 
feature start-stop technology and with the knowledge 
and capability to fit these types of batteries we will be 
a cost-effective service to our customers.
In the Car Enhancement category we are well 
prepared for any forthcoming digital radio switchover. 
During the year we launched an exclusive range of 
Pure in-car digital radios. This is a strong partnership 
with the leading brand in in-home digital radio and 
has already delivered an award-winning product. We 
will continue to bring new products and innovations 
to our customers over the coming years.

Cycling has always been at the core of the Halfords 
offer, from the opening of the first shop in Charlotte 
Street, Birmingham in 1892 through the opening of 
the out-of-town retail stores in the 1990s to today’s 
interest in Cycling as a healthy and fun activity.
We cater for all cyclists, from young children to 
families to commuters to premium cyclists. Our range 
of products includes a large number of SKUs from 
the UK’s biggest bike brand Apollo, our fastest-
growing bike brand Carrera to our premium brand 
Boardman and our newest brand Pendleton.
We recently relaunched much of the Apollo range 
with 21 bikes redesigned to appeal to the very broad 
spectrum of customers, who range in age from 12 
to 72. This new range is all about making Cycling 
accessible to everyone, and making our bikes 
specific to their leisure needs. We undertook a lot of 
customer research to ensure we got this right and 
we’re really pleased with the results we hope our 
customers will be too. 
A new range of Carrera, our second-largest bike 
brand by volume will be launched in June 2014. 
We’re delighted with the performance of the 
brand, in part driven by a very successful spot-buy 
programme. 
halfords is an iconic British brand with a strong heritage, having over 
100 years’ presence on the uK high street in both the auto and cycling 
categories. however, we needed to do more, so in f y14 we began our 
journey to reassert our Retail proposition authority by ensuring our offer is 
more relevant for our customers.

We will also be taking advantage of our market 
position to attract more junior riders to Cycling and 
will be launching specifically designed junior bikes for 
every need across Apollo, Carrera and for the first 
time, Boardman. Now our aspiring, junior customers 
will be able to choose from hybrid, road and premium 
bikes. 
Halfords also implemented a major acceleration 
of its presence in the Cycling Parts, Accessories 
and Clothing market (”PACs”) during FY14. This 
represents an exciting opportunity for growth and 
during 2014 our stores will feature a larger range 
of PACs products with more space allocated to 
clothing, merchandised by gender and product type. 
We’re moving closer and closer to something for 
everyone in clothing and we have introduced a great 
value range starting at £10 for a jersey under the 
Tenn brand. 
Complementing this we have released space in some 
stores for our Cycle Repair offer and delivered Cycle 
Repair training as part of our 3-Gears programme as 
we seek to re-establish Halfords as a comprehensive 
Cycling destination.

As we leverage the heritage of Halfords into 
Equipping Families for their Leisure Time we have 
focused not only on products but also on customer 
convenience. We have refocused our camping offers 
on two specific markets, introduced new promotions 
on camping accessories, and will be trialling pop-up 
Click & Collect collection points. We are also focused 
on making life easier for our customers - where 
additional items and fitting are required to fulfil our 
customers’ needs, we will be introducing bundled 
‘complete’ prices that our customers can trust e.g 
roof boxes
We will look to take advantage of a new area for 
the business - the rapidly growing wearable fitness 
and well-being technology, driven by the success 
of technology within the Cycling category.  The 
expansion of the fitness and well-being market, along 
with a stream of innovations in wearable technology, 
will see Halfords also offering fitness solutions. A 
wide range of products and brands will be available, 
from Cycling GPS, running watches, health-tracker 
wristbands and action cams, such as the Go Pro 
brand. We will also offer an extended range online to 
include additional accessories.

All of our product-ranging activities are designed to 
leverage the heritage of over 100 years’ presence 
on the British retail scene. Our repositioning has only 
just begun as we recreate our ‘H’-factor!  — the 
confidence and trust with which customers can turn 
to Halfords as the natural destination for their Auto, 
Cycling and Leisure needs.

Case study
apol lo Bikes
Halfords have been selling Apollo bikes since 1930, and with over 
80 years of heritage, it is now the number one bike brand in the UK 
for bikes sold – over 170,000 bikes per year and the second most 
recognised bike brand in the UK, with 43% recognition amongst 
mainstream cyclists.
As a result, the brand is really important to Halfords, and is our 
second most profitable bike brand. Halfords have approximately 
80% consideration from the mainstream customer, and they form the 
heartland of our current customer base.
The current Apollo adult range is 3½ years old, and in real need of a 
refresh to match the expectations of the Halfords customer.
When beginning the redesign of the complete range back in summer 
2012, we had the following key objectives:
  Update the visual appearance and specification of the bikes
  Improve the positioning of the Apollo brand as the solution to 
mainstream cyclists needs
  Focus on improving female specific designs
  Target incremental markets, such as teen and older Mountain Bike 
customers
  Increase profitability of mainstream bikes
Customer focus groups had informed us that bike design was as 
important to them as specification when choosing a mainstream bike, so 
we invested in making the bikes look as contemporary as possible whilst 
maintaining good value specification to meet the needs of mainstream 
cyclists. Consequently design moved away from “literal” graphics 
towards cleaner designs.
Key learnings from customer focus groups both pre- and post-bike 
design was that the new range offers something for everyone, with very 
strong value for money. Most noticeably, the progress in female bike 
designs was highlighted as a success and a positive move. 
As part of the sourcing strategy for the new range, we widened the 
factory base that produces Apollo bikes. This involved developing 
existing factories so that they could produce higher-spec bikes, as well 
as building relationships with new suppliers and thus increasing our 
supplier base.
The new bike range spans 21 models in total, grown from 17 models 
in the previous range. we seek to maximise on incremental market 
opportunities, and to invest in hybrid as a fit-for-purpose option for the 
leisure cyclist.
Nine of these models were launched in September 2013 to provide a 
new offer and marketing message for the key Christmas trading period. 
These models were backed with a large stockholding to ensure a strong 
Christmas availability. The brand sold 24% more volume in Q3 FY14 vs. 
Q3 FY13.
The remaining models were launched between October 2013 and 
January 2014 to give a new range message in store for spring. This has 
been supported by new point-of-sale in store to highlight the newness of 
the bikes and the great deal for customers.

In July 2013 three refreshed stores were opened in 
Evesham, Coventry and York. They were designed 
for customers to feel the warmth and personality 
of the Halfords brand and to find the products and 
services they need more easily, bringing our wefit 
and our werepair offers to life.
These stores were also designed to support the 
digital customer, the smartphone user, and the online 
buyer. Around 90% of our online sales are collected 
in-store, so we make this process easy and obvious, 
with better collection points and communication to 
customers.
We also leveraged our store space better to 
maximize sales opportunities. For example, the 
Cycling category space was increased by 50% 
to more appropriately represent its store sales 
participation. 
Learning from this initial launch, additional stores 
were converted to the refreshed format, so that by 
the end of the year, 27 stores were trading in the 
refreshed design. We showcased the Evesham store 
to investors and sell-side analysts in March 2014. 
Along with progressing our modest refreshes of every 
single Cycling department by March 2016, we will 
continue to roll out a variety of refresh models in the 
coming years, from light touch to full scale, with the 
ambition of having around 150 stores refreshed by 
the end of financial year 2016. Whatever treatment 
a store gets, our vision is based on a ten-point plan 
that clearly demonstrates how we want to enhance 
the customer experience so that we can leverage 
sales:
1. Invite Me In — Installing new external signage 
that specifically tells our customers who we are 
and what we do.
2. Showcase wefit and Cycle Repair — In-store 
services help to differentiate Halfords from our 
competitors and this is central to our Getting into 
Gear strategy.
3. Customer Guidance — Introducing clear 
signage to direct and guide customers in their 
buying decisions.
4. Space Reallocation —Reallocating space in-
store in line with sales participation. This will allow 
us to range more bicycles and also to segment 
them better.
5. Enliven the Customer Journey — Making 
the store environment more fun and creating a 
pleasurable shopping experience.
6. Digital Relevance — Introducing digital 
technology to improve the shopping experience 
and making the whole process more convenient.
7. Showcase Colleagues — Colleagues are 
central to our service proposition and as their 
expertise grows we want them to be available 
to customers and for customers to see them in 
action.
8. Communicate Value — We want our customers 
to clearly understand our pricing messages, to 
know they are getting value for money.
9. Considerate Customer Experience — We 
have thought about the customer journey and are 
introducing small but helpful benefits, such as a 
bike park with free air for customers.
10. Category Stories — We want the way we 
display products to help customers understand 
what they do and whether they need them.
we acknowledged last year that we needed to improve our stores. with 
only low levels of investment in the past decade, the priority was to create 
a modern, engaging and friendlier store environment that encourages 
browsing and more interaction with colleagues.

  A trial to introduce free wi-fi into stores 
  Moving all store telephony onto a Voice-over-IP 
network, reducing costs and delivering a more

During the year we have acknowledged the need for 
our Supply Chain to deliver a consistent, convenient 
and reliable customer experience and to do this we 
will be enhancing the standards of our supply chain 
operations. We will focus on procurement and stock 
management, delivery scheduling and improving the 
working environment for our colleagues. We will work 
more closely with our suppliers, ensuring we have 
an efficient end-to-end supply chain, whilst adopting 
a continuous improvement methodology across all 
operations. We will also improve flexibility, lead times 
and standardise operating principles.  
We are committed to putting our customer at the 
heart of all supply chain activity. We will support sales 
by balancing stock across the UK and the Far East to 
stabilise lead times. We have already introduced out-
of-hours deliveries to 90 stores and are trialling more 
frequent deliveries to stores in the UK and Ireland.
We know that customers’ delivery expectations are 
continually evolving; no longer are the protracted 
timescales of the past acceptable. Customers want 
their purchases delivered when it’s convenient for

against these high expectations such as the 
capability to book the building of a bike or have a Sat

halfords Retail’s strategy is clear: we need a 21

it infrastructure to support our aspirations in delivering a significantly-
enhanced customer experience. our aim is ensure customers can purchase 
what they want whenever they visit stores, either because the product is on 
our shelves or because they have the opportunity to order goods for prompt 
delivery or collection.

Case study
In 2012, Halfords embarked on a review of their payments infrastructure with 
the aim of developing a long-term strategy across all payment systems and 
processes. Not only did we want to refresh our PIN Entry Device (PED) estate 
and future-proof our systems in relation to PCI DSS compliance but we also 
wanted to give customers a great shopping experience whilst minimising the 
cost of change. 
We identified that a managed payment service would best meet our 
requirements and following a comprehensive procurement exercise, selected 
FIS as our Payment Services Provider (PSP) partner. 
FIS provided PA-DSS certified EFT software (TRANSAXpay EFT) which meets 
the latest encryption guidelines as laid down by the PCI Security Standards 
Council. This software encrypts card data at the point of PIN entry to ensure 
no card data is held “in the clear” on the Point of Sale (PoS) system or 
Halfords network. Card data is routed through the FIS Payment Gateway, 
a PCI DSS Level 1-certified environment, for authorisation, settlement and 
financial reporting. When used in conjunction with certified processes, the 
scope and cost of PCI compliance for retailers can be drastically reduced.
Following integration with Halfords BT Expedite PoS, we commenced a pilot 
scheme in July 2013, in a single store with 3 PEDs. After an initial 2 week 
period, a further 8 PEDs were added in two stores to the pilot scheme for a 
1 week period. A further pilot to 43 stores and 217 PEDs quickly proved that 
the concept logic and the roll out strategy worked. We then initiated an 
aggressive roll out strategy which resulted in the successful roll out of 2,400 
PEDs over a 14 week period. At peak, 411 PED’s were rolled out in 1 week 
and the full roll out completed in October 2013.
Peter Lawrence, our Principal Business Analyst commented: “This was a 
text book project, roll out completed on time and to budget. We have never 
had so much positive feedback from store colleagues on how quick the new 
PEDs are.”
The FIS’ TRANSAXpay solution has enabled us to maintain PCI DSS 
compliance whilst improving the customer payment experience through 
reduced queue times and enhanced card data security. 
Internal surveys at our stores have shown that on average New CHIP & PIN 
pads in over 300 stores saved our customers 19 seconds per transaction, 
meaning we now have one of the fastest card transaction times in UK retail 
in these stores.
In support of the above, Halfords has provided FIS with a selection of 
‘Payment Card Performance Monitor’ data that we have collated from 
various stores during the pilot phase. The data shows the time difference in 
performing various stages of the card payment transaction process, before 
and after the implementation of the TRANSAXpay solution, and the overall 
time saving for comparison.

The extensive redesign 
of pages across the 
desktop and tablet site 
has eliminated clutter, 
making navigating around 
the site quicker and 
easier. The homepage has 
been split out across four 
pillars - Cycling, Motoring, 
Sat Nav & Car Audio, and 
Touring & Child Seats. 
Product list pages have 
also been redesigned 
to make key information 
clearer for each product. 
As a result of these 
changes conversion rate 
is now up by 19% across 
the site.

By removing duplicated 
content from the product 
detail page, space has 
been left for a ‘how can

allows the customer to 
clearly see the delivery

all products.

The previous checkout 
system was far too 
long and complex, and 
didn’t allow customers 
to purchase products 
reserved from stock in 
store in combination 
with goods from the 
distribution centre. As 
a result we’ve removed 
50% of the current steps 
for a more streamlined 
checkout process, and 
improved the shopping 
experience for our 
customers - leading to a 
9% increase in checkout 
completion.

over 200 product videos

Over 50 How To Guides 
and 45 Buyer’s Guides 
have also been filmed,

In November 2013 we completed the first phase of 
our Retail website redesign. We changed the look 
and feel of the site, segmenting the site into four 
distinct areas. We enhanced product and service 
communications by adding nearly 100 cycling 
videos and 50 How To Guides and we also reduced 
the number of steps to purchase by 50%. In April 
2014 we added new features to keep evolving and 
improving the cycling experience including a bike-
selection guide, downloadable cycling routes and a 
bespoke cycling app.
We also simplified our Click & Collect process 
allowing orders to be split, with part being delivered 
to store for immediate pick and part delivered direct 
to home – around 90% of orders are collected 
from store. Customers also now pay for their entire 
Click & Collect transactions in-store with further 
enhancements due for completion in due course, 
including social network interactions and upgraded 
‘my account’ functionality.
We also took a leaf from the Autocentres business 
and developed an online booking system for 
customers who wanted to use services that we 
provide in store such as webuild and wefit. 
As mobile and tablet browsing and shopping are 
forming a larger part of the customer journey, c.52% 
of our digital business is conducted using mobiles 
or tablets; we plan to continue enhancing the mobile 
journey. Importantly we also recently extended the 
current order cut-off time from 3pm to 6pm for next 
day delivery. 
As we move to a true omnichannel business we 
will also be reviewing how we bring the best of the 
website into stores. We will be rolling out colleague 
tablets to assist our store teams in selling the 
extended ranges available online, the ability to sell 
cycle credit and also access all the product videos 
and How To Guides in our stores. 
We will continue to invest in our online and digital 
solutions, leveraging our store portfolio so that each 
supports the other in delivering the ultimate customer 
shopping and service experience.

strate GiC r eport > aut oCentr e strate Gy
auto Centre str ate Gy  Scaling t He pro po Sit ion FY14 has been a challenging year for our 
Autocentres business. At the beginning of the year 
car servicing was still regarded by customers as 
discretionary spending and in the first half of the 
year our sales were -2.1%LfL recovering to flat for 
the full year. In the second half of the year a mild 
winter meant that the usual business associated with 
that time of the year did not come through in the 
expected volumes. 
The year also saw a change of leadership. In August, 
Bill Duffy left the business to be replaced on a 
temporary basis by Andrew Findlay, Chief Financial 
Officer and Autocentres Chairman. Andrew remained 
in charge until March 2014 when Andy Randall 
arrived as the new Managing Director for Halfords 
Autocentres. Andy will lead the business through the 
next phase of its development. 
The Autocentres business Supports Drivers Of Every 
Car and complements our retail offer in meeting the 
Do it for Me (“DIFM”) requests of our customers. Our 
ambition is to be the Best Garage in Town and to do 
so we are using elements of Halfords Retail’s Getting 
into Gear strategy to influence our services, centres 
and colleagues. 
tH e ‘H’ f aCto r
Just as in the Retail business, trust is an important 
part of our offer. During the year we acknowledged 
that 62% of car owners value trust above other 
factors, with location and price as the next two 
factors. We seek to earn our customers’ trust by 
giving them an enhanced customer experience, 
offering a strong brand, delivering a quality service at 
affordable prices and getting it right first time.
ser ViCe r eVol ution
In order to revolutionise our service and augment 
our customers’ experiences we have enhanced our 
online proposition and improved the online booking 
experience with an increased number of job slots. 
These initiatives are based on improving the expertise 
of our colleagues and delighting our customers. Over 
the year we have successfully improved customer 
feedback, with the number of respondents scoring 
us 10 out of 10 increasing from 49% to 60%.
tH e Best Gara Ge in t oWn
In February we opened our 300th centre in 
Accrington. We’ve increased the number of centres 
by a third since the business returned to the Halfords 
family in February 2010. Our centres are equipped 
with modern diagnostic tools and are able to perform 
work on any car without invalidating any warranties. 
Our colleagues are experienced, trained and 
passionate and we operate the largest independent 
apprentice scheme in the motor industry. We never 
fail to offer employment to our apprentices who 
complete the three-year training scheme. 
We continue to make investments in multiple training 
programmes underpinned by investing in a new 
Learning Management System. It is important that 
to offer the best customer service we recruit, train, 
develop, engage and support our colleagues creating 
an environment in which they want to work.
Cli Ck Wit H t He diGit al f ut ure
The new Autocentres website, launched in July, 
offers a much-improved service for online customers. 
There’s a new Quick Book facility and clearer search 
and menu functions. We have introduced an ‘Advice 
Centre’ which highlights general advice, guides and 
specific events. Customers can search for help on 
such topics as brakes or air conditioning. Current 
hot topics include the Plain English Guide to Garage 
Jargon, How to Shell out Less on Fuel, and How to 
Prepare for an MOT.

Our infrastructure continues to develop. Aware that 
our customers want flexibility as well as service we 
now have around 90 centres opening on Sundays.

and we continue to review our diagnostic solutions to 
ensure we have the capability to service and repair all 
marques of vehicle.

halfords has a clear Group strategy for how we operate our business to 
benefit our customers and colleagues, and of course, to generate value 
for our shareholders. we recognise that to be successful in achieving our 
Group strategy halfords must contribute positively to the world in which 
we operate. acting responsibly in all our operations, and towards our 
colleagues, customers and other stakeholders, supports the delivery of our 
Group strategy and thereby benefits our business and our brand. 
As part of this, in January 2013 we recognised that the development of a Community Strategy was a 
fundamental part of our Group strategy. Hence, a dedicated Community & CSR Manager was appointed to 
explore opportunities for developing and implementing community programmes. Since then, with the support 
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, she has focused on building the foundations for a long-term 
Community Strategy. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the alignment of our wider sustainability initiatives with our Group 
strategy. Executive Management monitor the achievement of related KPIs. 
We endeavour to monitor our exposure and response to sustainability issues, to preserve not only our 
business, but also the environment and the local communities in which we operate.
CoMMunities 
Our extensive store and autocentre network puts us in an ideal position to become the hub of our local 
communities. 
We have made significant progress, developing links with local communities by launching various initiatives to 
inspire cyclists of every age with a particular focus on primary school-age children. 
r e~CyCle 
In 2013, we agreed a long-term charity partnership with Re~Cycle, a UK charity that sends unwanted bikes, 
going to waste in sheds and garages across the country, to Africa. We are proud to support this initiative 
because in some areas of Africa, a bike can be the only means of transport. Owning a bike enables people 
to travel to work or school, and carry goods or passengers, whilst small scale farmers and traders can reach 
customers further afield.
The bikes can similarly be an invaluable resource for travelling health workers and provide access to training 
and employment, helping to improve lives in a sustainable way. However, bikes can be too expensive for the 
majority in Africa. Additionally, the skills to maintain the bikes might not exist. 
As part of our partnership, we have opened our stores to donations from the public through National Bike 
Trade-In Events, thereby diverting unwanted bikes from landfill/disuse to more constructive and sustainable 
use. To date over 10,000 bikes have been donated by the public, diverting 150 tonnes from landfill/waste. We 
are also pleased to be able to share our skills and knowledge to support the charity’s growth.

Since 1997, Re~Cycle has sent around 53,000 bikes to Africa, as well as parts and tools. We hope that 
through our partnership, Re~Cycle will be able to build on the fantastic work it has already achieved and 
inspire more and more cyclists of every age across Africa.
You can read more about Re~Cycle on their website - http://www.re-cycle.org/

An additional facet of our Re~Cycle partnership is that all our colleagues connect with their local communities, 
whilst having fun raising money to cover the cost of sending bikes to Africa. This also provides incidental 
team building opportunities for our colleagues. Highlights in the last year in our stores and Support Centre 
include cycle rides, fun days, Snowdon and Ben Nevis challenges, cake sales, raffles, continuous turbo trainer 
contests and car washes amongst other fun activities, some even in fancy dress!
Ben 
Our Autocentres have a long-term partnership with BEN,the dedicated charity for those who work, or have 
worked, in the automotive and related industries, as well as their dependants. BEN provides practical, 
emotional or financial support, as well as day, nursing and residential care across the country for older people 
in the automotive community.
sCouts asso Ciation
Building on the success of our Kids’ Holiday Bike Clubs (see page 35), it was a natural progression for us to 
team up with the Scouts Association to help 2,200 Cubs achieve their Cyclist Activity badge by attending an 
in-depth workshop at our stores. These give our store colleagues additional opportunities to inspire our future 
customers and foster closer links with our local communities.

As we recognise that our Retail colleagues are central to our progress on the Retail Getting into Gear journey 
as described on pages 26 to 39, we support them on our 3-Gears training and colleague qualification 
programme. 
Similarly, we invest in our Autocentres colleagues via our training academy apprenticeship programme. This 
comprises a three-year fully funded technician programme leading to the Institute of Motor Industry NVQ 3 and 
Diploma. In twenty years of operation, we offered employment to the majority of apprentices who completed 
the three-year scheme. In addition, we offer a range of technical and management qualification opportunities 
to our Autocentres colleagues via our IMI accredited Academy of Learning. 
We are proud this year to be on The Sunday Times 25 Best Big Companies to Work For list. We continue to 
aim to be an employer of choice, where our colleagues enjoy equal opportunities to help our customers and 
prosper within a rewarding and inspiring team.
We recognise that it is the continued trust of our colleagues, customers, suppliers, shareholders and other 
stakeholders that is central to the ongoing delivery of our strategy. Whether it be their trust in our commitment 
to our diverse workforce or in the way we do business; maintaining their trust is of paramount importance to us.

We are an equal opportunities organisa tion with clear expectations about how we all behave both internally 
and with customers and other stakeholders, including in relation to diversity and gender. Historically there 
has been a tendency for more males than females to be attracted to working in our stores and autocentres, 
however through our recruitment, talent and development programmes we seek to become more reflective 
of the customers and communities that we serve. Our approach to Diversity is further described on pages 80 
and 82.

customers, providing a comfortable and convenient environment in which to work and shop.
Healt H and safe ty Mana GeMent
We are committed to minimising the risk of injuries and ill health to our colleagues, contractors, customers, 
visitors and others who come into contact with our business. As such, we are committed to high standards of 
occupational health and safety. Our overall incident rate remains below the industry benchmarks.

We are committed to upholding human rights. The Halfords Code of Conduct on Ethical Trading states our 
policy on legislation, child labour, conditions of employment, wages and benefits, health and safety and 
environmental policy. 
We undertake all reasonable and practical steps, including factory, warehouse and tied accommodation 
inspections and audits, to ensure that our standards are being implemented throughout the businesses of our 
suppliers and that local legislation and regulations are complied with. We will assess any instances of non-
compliance on a case-by-case basis and will then tailor remedial action appropriately. We will only trade with 
those who fully comply with this policy or those who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance.
We oppose the exploitation of children and young people and, in addition to national employment laws, we 
require of our suppliers that children under the age of 14 years, or those below the age for completion of 
compulsory schooling, must not be employed full-time.
We oppose the exploitation of workers and we will not tolerate forced labour, or labour which involves 
physical, verbal or psychological harassment, or intimidation of any kind. We will not permit the exploitation 
of, or discrimination against, any vulnerable group. Workers must have the right to form and join organisations 
to facilitate freedom of association and collective bargaining and all workers must have written employment 
details, which must pay due regard to the welfare of individuals. We support fair and reasonable rewards 
for workers. Wages should reflect local norms and should meet or exceed any legal minimum wage levels. 
Wages must be paid in cash, or by cheque or bank transfers. Workers must receive full written details of their 
pay. While local and cultural differences will be observed, workers must not be expected to work in excess 
of 60 hours per week on a regular basis, including overtime. Any overtime must be voluntary. Workers will be 
entitled to at least one day off in seven. Individual workers have the right to choose not to take their days off 
should they so wish.

We require that appropriate health and safety training, including training in fire safety, be provided for all people 
in all working areas. All activities must be carried out under conditions that have proper and adequate regard 
for the health and safety of those involved. Management arrangements must be in place to detect, avoid and 
respond to potential threats to health and safety.
We promote our own business objectives with those in our supply chain to minimise the environmental impact 
of our operations and also encourage the consideration of social issues in business.

 During the year we have continued to rationalise our supplier base, reducing the number of suppliers that we engage with. As a result whilst the number of audits conducted has reduced we have 
maintained our audited coverage in line with our internal targets.
In addition, we have a company-wide Anti-Bribery & Corruption policy which prohibits payments to public 
officials. Support Centre colleagues have this year participated in a training programme which seeks to 
refresh the principles of the policy, and undertaken a compulsory test thereafter. It is planned to undertake this 
training/testing programme on a yearly basis.
Available here: http://www.halfordscompany.com/investors/governance/policies/anti-bribery-corruption-policy
A Whistleblowing policy also exists as described at page 89.

We recognise that in today’s marketplace consumers have an increasingly wide choice of retailers from which 
to make their purchase. This means that as well as reasonable price and the quality of the services they 
receive, the quality and provenance of the products become ever more relevant to our customers’ decision-
making process. 
Similarly, we seek to better understand the direct and indirect effects of our business activities. In so doing, we 
are better able to manage not only our impact on the environment but also our operations. 
standards
Our product specifications demand that they are consistent with or are stronger than relevant legislation, 
international conventions and codes of practice. The upholding of these high standards is scrutinised by 
our quality control procedures, as well as via our mystery shopper programme. This enables us to respond 
to any inadequacies identified. We are also monitored by external organisations such as VOSA and Trading 
Standards. 
Additionally, we are pleased to often work alongside trade associations, research institutes, standards 
authorities, universities and government organisations to improve standards and safety, and develop and 
influence best practice. For example, we continue to work closely with WHICH Magazine on Child Seat Fitting, 
and with the IMI for in-car electrical installation

2014 saw us achieve 15% year-on-year growth in our cycle2work business. We also passed the milestone 
of providing over 500,000 cycle2work bikes to organisations across the public and private sectors since the 
scheme launched. This success is reflected in the latest Cycle to Work Alliance data for 2014, which reflects 
our strong performance and increase in cycle2work market share. 
Conscious that the majority of our products are sourced overseas, we limit our use of air freight. Where 
possible we ship our products which, once landed in the UK, are brought by rail to our Coventry and Redditch 
Distribution Centres. 
This year we have seen an increase in tonnes airfreighted due to improved reporting and certain sales 
requirements but predominantly as a result of having to airfreight 61.6 tonnes of bikes from Cambodia due 
to shipment delays caused by strikes immediately before the Chinese New Year shutdowns. This was an 
exceptional requirement for air freight and we anticipate our levels of air freight returning to normalised levels 
in subsequent periods.

 which is designed to improve energy efficiency and cut emissions in large public and private sector 
organisations. Other examples of our commitment are a green recycling initiative which will commence in 
May 2014 and see 24 stores backhaul and recycle plastics, wiper blades and scrap metals at the Distribution 
Centres. In addition, the Distribution Centres will be establishing a Halfords Lift Share website to promote car 
sharing as part of their Green Travel Plan. All our Autocentres deliveries are made from local branches in small

Group revenue in FY14, at £939.7m, was up 7.9% 
and comprised Retail revenue of £803.1m and 
Autocentres revenue of £136.6m. This compared to 
FY13 Group revenue of £871.3m, which comprised 
Retail revenue of £745.5m and Autocentres revenue 
of £125.8m. Group gross profit at £504.2m (FY13: 
£477.1m) represented 53.7% of Group revenue 
(FY13: 54.8%), reflecting a decrease in the Retail 
gross margin of 144 basis points (“bps”) to 51.8% 
and an increase in the Autocentres gross margin of 
78 bps to 64.4%. 
Total Operating Costs before non-recurring items 
increased to £426.4m (FY13: £399.0m) of which 
Retail represented £341.0m (FY13: £323.4m), 
Autocentres £83.7m (FY13: £73.8m) and unallocated 
costs £1.7m (FY13: £1.8m). Unallocated costs 
represent amortisation charges in respect of 
intangible assets acquired through business 
combinations (the acquisition of Nationwide 
Autocentres Ltd in February 2010), which arise on 
consolidation of the Group. 
Group EBITDA fell 2.3% to £101.1m (FY13: 
£103.4m), whilst net finance costs were £5.0m 
(FY13: £6.1m). 
Group Profit Before Tax and non-recurring items for 
the year was up 1.1% at £72.8m (FY13: £72.0m).
Net non-recurring expenses of £0.2m (2013: £1.0m) 
during the year represented asset impairment costs 
of £0.4m to support the Stores Fit To Shop initiative 
and non-recurring income of £0.2m from the partial 
release of the Focus lease guarantee provision, 
recognised as a non-recurring cost in FY11, resulting 
from better than anticipated settlements. 
Group Profit Before Tax in the year after non-
recurring items was £72.6m (FY13: £71.0m). 
Revenue for the Retail business of £803.1m 
reflected, on a constant-currency basis, a like-for-
like (“LFL”) sales increase of 7.6%. Non-LFL stores 
contributed £3.5m revenue in the year, with total 
revenue increasing 7.7%. 
Cycling LFL revenues were up 19.4% reflecting 
improved execution, sustained interest in Cycling as 
a leisure activity, a successful Christmas for children’s 
bikes, cycle-range refreshes and the benefit of 
focused marketing, driving strong premium-bike 
and accessory sales; Cycle Repair LFL revenues 
increased by 28.6%.  The category also benefitted 
from favourable weather conditions compared to the 
prior year.
Car Maintenance LFL revenues sales increased by 
4.9% in the year supported by the strong momentum 
in the fitting and sale of bulbs, blades and batteries 
(”3Bs”). Mild-winter weather conditions impacted 
demand for winter maintenance products and 3Bs, 
although the number of 3B fits was up 11.5% in the 
year with 3B-fitting revenues making up 49.6% of 
total in-store service income.
Car Enhancement LFL revenues were down 0.1%. 
Car Cleaning sales were up 13.8% supported by 
better merchandising to emphasise the strength of 
the Halfords branded offer. Audio continued to grow, 
this time by 1.1%. Although the Sat Nav category 
remained challenged, with sales down 8.1%, 
Halfords’ value share in the 12 months to March was 
maintained.
Travel Solutions LFL revenues increased by 2.1%, 
with enhanced-clearance activity and more-
compelling offers driving improved sales of camping 
and travel equipment.

str a te gi c r e P o r t  > Performance
ch ief f inancial o f ficer’s r ePort continued
Gross profit for the Retail business at £416.2m 
(FY13: £397.0m) represented 51.8% of sales, 144 
bps down on the prior year (FY13: 53.3%), in line 
with guidance. Higher sales volumes in lower-
margin premium bikes, the launch of third-party 
branded Cycling parts, accessories and clothing 
(“PACs”), along with the impact of a mild winter on 
the higher-margin Car Maintenance category drove 
the reduction in margin, as did a more aggressive 
clearance and promotional approach across the 
categories.
Management anticipates a 25-75 bps decrease in 
Retail gross margin in FY15, primarily reflecting the 
mix effect emanating from the disproportionate
 strength of the lower-margin Cycling category. 
The decline is also a result of a switch of various 
cycle supplies to Halfords from duty-free Cambodia 
to Vietnam. This move has been designed to 
assure supply, given ongoing and increasing levels 
of significant industrial action in Cambodia. The 
demand for cash-accretive, margin-dilutive products 
such as PACs and flat wiper blades will continue 
whilst management will focus on the pricing of the 
Halfords wiper-blade offer as well as dozens of key-
value-indicator products.
Operating Costs before non-recurring items were 
£341.0m (FY13: £323.4m), up 5.4% on the prior  
year and in line with guidance. The breakdown is set 
out below: 
Strong trading volumes led to incremental investment 
in store hours and increased incentive payments. 
These, plus the uplift in national minimum wages 
contributed to the increase in Store Staffing costs by 
8.6%. The impact of the 3-Gears training programme 
on Store Staffing costs this year was immaterial. With 
an increase in minimum weekly-contracted hours, 
the number of Retail colleagues fell by around 1,000 
during the year to around 9,000, although there 
was a material increase in the number of full-time 
equivalent colleagues. 
Store Occupancy costs decreased by 0.3% year on 
year. Inflationary increases in utilities and investment 
in store repairs were offset by continued savings 
from rent negotiations and surrender payments, plus 
depreciation, given the profile of the store portfolio.
Warehouse & Distribution costs increased by 18.2% 
driven by the surge in store and, in particular, online 
volumes, as well as increases in transport and utility 
costs.  A number of service-focused trials were 
executed during the year, including out-of-hours 
deliveries and more-frequent store deliveries. The 
cut-off time in relation to the online Click & Collect 
proposition recently moved from 3pm the day before 
to 6pm.
Support Costs rose by 7.9%. This reflected 
increased activity associated with the change 
programmes Click with the Digital Future and 21st 
Century Infrastructure as well as the launch of both 
the extended PACs range and the enhanced Retail 
website. The increase also reflected the up-weighted 
marketing investment to support higher sales 
volumes. Increases in payroll costs, reflecting the 
annualisation of headcount increases in FY13 and 
the strengthening of the senior management team 
were offset by savings in recruitment costs following 
the move to bring recruitment of store colleagues in-
house. Given the performance of the business over 
the period, incremental colleague incentive payments 
were accrued for payment. 
Management anticipates a 4-5% increase in Retail 
operating costs in FY15. A significant proportion of 
this increase is dependent on volumes/performance. 
Major investments will include Store Labour costs 
associated with potential increased volumes as 
well the pay award as part of the 3-Gears training 
programme. Increased volumes have the potential 
to inflate Warehouse & Distribution costs and 
depreciation is set to increase, given the material 
uplift in capital expenditure versus prior periods. 
One-off operating cost investments in c.50 refreshed 
stores in FY15 will also be notable.

There were no non-recurring items related to the 
Autocentres business in either year presented.
Autocentres generated total revenues of £136.6m 
(FY13: £125.8m), an increase of 8.6% on the prior 
year with a LFL revenue decline of 0.1%. This 
performance reflected the operational and market 
challenges faced by the business. LFL tyre revenues 
increased by 4.7% and represented 16.0% of total 
LFL revenues. Online-booking revenues in the year 
grew 43.7% versus the prior period. 
Gross profit at £88.0m (FY13: £80.1m) represented 
a gross margin of 64.4% against a prior-year margin 
of 63.7% driven by reduced reliance on affiliate-
driven tyre sales and stronger core Service, MOT 
and Repair margins, underpinned by consistent 
improvements in parts buying.
Autocentres’ EBIT was down 31.7% at £4.3m (FY13 
£6.3m) as a result of revenue growth outweighed 
by operating costs and the investments made 
for future growth. Operating costs increased due 
to the centre-opening programme together with 
the ongoing expansion of the support structure.  
Halfords is committed to the continued investment 
in the Autocentres business to secure medium-term 
growth, though the business plans to slow down 
the centre-opening programme from the prevailing 
20–30 new centres per year to 10–15 in the medium 
term by opening fewer, larger centres. 
On the basis of an anticipated material uplift in LFL 
sales, management anticipates Autocentres’ EBITDA 
to increase in FY15. 
Portfolio m an agement  
The Retail store portfolio at the end of the year 
comprised 465 stores (end of FY13: 466).
The following table outlines the changes in the Retail 
store portfolio over the year:
Number Stores
Relocated 2 Newport , Weston-Super-Mare
Re-gears 13 South Shields, Telford, Wakefield, Trowbridge, Dewsbury, 
Doncaster, Oldham, Edinburgh (Leith),  
Waterlooville, Stoke (Fenton), Grantham, Torquay, Bangor 
Downsizes 4 Cardiff (Newport Road), Cannock, Chadwell Heath,  
Eastbourne
Openings 1 Sky headquarters (Osterley)
Closed 2 Felixstowe, Glasgow Shettlestone
A number of further rightsizes and relocations will be completed in due course, including Altrincham, Bedford, Perth, Workington 
and Thanet (Margate). 
23 new Autocentres were opened and three (Croydon, Preston and Ilford) were closed in the year, taking the 
total number of Autocentre locations to 303 as at 28 March 2014.
With the exception of nine long leasehold and two freehold properties within Autocentres, the Group’s 
operating sites are occupied under operating leases, the majority of which are on standard lease terms, 
typically with a 5 to 15-year term at inception and with an average lease length of c.8 years.

expenses (0.2) (1.0)
£0.4m of assets from certain stores were impaired in 
the year as a result of the investment in the Stores Fit 
To Shop initiative (FY13: £0.8m). 
In FY11, an exceptional charge of £7.5m was 
recognised in respect of a provision for property 
leases to which Halfords was a guarantor, triggered 
by the demise of the Focus DIY retail chain.  At 28 
March 2014 the provision was £0.2m, reflecting the 
settlement of a number of leases and utilisation for 
on-going rent, insurance and service charges.  Whilst 
there were on-going associated rental costs, there 
was a release of £0.2m of the provision in the year. 
£0.2m of this provision remained as at 28 March 
2014 and is anticipated to be utilised in FY15.
f inance ex Pense
The net finance expense for the year was £5.0m 
(FY13: £6.1m). The expense includes £0.2m of 
accelerated amortisation of issue costs in the 
current year following completion of debt facility 
refinancing in September 2013. The new, reduced 
revolving credit facility expires in November 2017.  
An element of the net finance expense also relates 
to the crystallisation of a number of prior-year tax 
computations in the year. 
Management anticipates a decline in the FY15 
finance expense versus FY14.
t axation
The taxation charge on profit for the financial year was 
£17.1m (FY13: £18.3m), including a £0.1m charge 
(FY13: £0.1m) in respect of tax on non-recurring 
items. The full-year effective tax rate of 23.5% (FY13: 
25.7%) was higher than the UK corporation tax rate 
(23.0%) principally due to the non-deductibility of 
depreciation charged on capital expenditure and other 
permanent differences arising in the year. 
A number of prior-year outstanding tax computations 
were settled during the year and accounted for a 
£21.0m cash outflow (being tax plus interest). The 
outstanding tax positions had been provided for in 
prior periods with the provisions being utilised against 
the tax payments. 
Management anticipates an effective tax rate of 
21–22% in FY15 and no one-off tax payments.
earnings Per s h are (“ ePs ”)
Basic EPS before non-recurring items was 28.8 
pence (FY13: 27.7 pence), a 4.0% increase on the 
comparable year. Basic EPS after non-recurring 
items was 28.6 pence (FY13: 27.2 pence). Basic 
weighted-average shares in issue during the year 
were 194.0m (FY13: 194.3m). 
dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 
9.1 pence per share (FY13: 9.1 pence), taking 
the full-year dividend to 14.3 pence per share. If 
approved, the final dividend will be paid on 1 August 
2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 4 July 2014. In the light of the guidance 
given twelve months ago, the Board will now look 
to maintain a c.2x dividend cover over the medium 
term, growing full-year dividends broadly in line with 
earnings per share. Given the operating cash flow 
profile of the business the Board also anticipates the 
ratio of future interim and final dividend payments to 
move toward 30:70.
c aPital ex Penditure
Capital investment in the year totalled £30.4m 
(FY13: £18.8m) comprising £24.4m in Retail 
and £6.0m in Autocentres. Consistent with prior 
years, management adopted a prudent approach 
with regard to capital investment and focused on 
investments generating material returns in line with 
the Getting Into Gear strategy. 
Within Retail, £13.9m (FY13: £5.8m) was invested in 
stores, including 23 store refreshes. The investment 
also reflected refresh-based relocations and right-
size activity as well as general capital spend relating 
to store roofing, flooring and security.  By the end of 
FY14, 27 stores were trading in the refreshed format 
in line with the Stores Fit To Shop initiative. Additional 
investments in Retail infrastructure included a £9.7m 
investment in IT systems, such as development of 
the online Retail proposition and an upgrade of the 
core SAP operating system. The Support Centre also 
attracted a small element of refresh investment. 
Within Autocentres a further £6.0m (FY13: £5.6m) 
was invested to drive the centre roll-out plan and 
upgrade centre equipment, especially in relation 
to the delivery of the tyre–fitting proposition. 
Expenditure was directed to improve other 
infrastructure elements, from a refreshed website to 
more-efficient IT processing systems, enabling more 
effective customer-focused centre management. 
Management continues to anticipate an investment 
of around £100m in Retail capital expenditure in 
the three-year period to the end of FY16. Timing of 
investments such as the SAP upgrade reflected the 
shortfall in the FY14 expenditure versus guidance. 
FY15 Retail capital expenditure is anticipated to 
amount to c.£35m. Autocentres’ capital expenditure 
in FY15 is anticipated to be c.£8m, the increase 
reflecting incremental investment in property and 
equipment, diagnostics and IT systems.
inventories Group inventory held at the year end was £150.2m 
(FY13: £133.2m), in line with guidance; the increase 
was primarily Cycling-related. Stock continued to be 
managed tightly and the planned levels of additional 
Retail stock increased on-shelf availability to 98.3%. 
Autocentres inventory was £1.4m (FY13: £1.3m). 
The Autocentres business model is such that only 
modest levels of inventory are held within the centres, 
with most parts being acquired on an as-needed 
basis.

c ashflow and b orrowings The Group continued its track record of robust 
cash generation. Cash generated from operating 
activities in the year was £67.5m (FY13: £93.5m).  
After taxation, capital expenditure and net finance 
costs, free cashflow of £39.5m (FY13: £71.8m) 
was generated. The reduced cashflow performance 
reflected the upweighted levels of capital and 
inventory investment in the year and also included 
the settlement of £21.0m of prior-year outstanding 
tax computations. 
Group net debt of £99.6m (FY13 £110.6m) 
represented a decline of 9.9% with a non-lease-
adjusted 12-month net debt: EBITDA ratio of 1.0:1 
versus 1.1:1 in the prior year. A new £200m revolving 
credit facility was secured in the year, expiring in 
November 2017.
Princi Pal r is ks and u nc ertainties The Board considers risk assessment, identification 
of mitigating actions and internal control to be 
fundamental to achieving Halfords’ strategic corporate 
objectives.  In the Annual Report & Accounts the 
Board sets out what it considers to be the principal 
commercial and financial risks to achieving the 
Group’s objectives. The main areas of potential 
risk and uncertainty in the balance of the financial 
year are described in note 19 to the Annual Report 
and Accounts. Other risks that might impact the 
achievement of Halfords strategic corporate objectives 
are detailed on pages 64 to 67 and include:
  Economic risks
  Business strategy risks
  Competitive risks
  Compliance
  Changing customer preferences
  Reliance on foreign manufacturers
  Product and service quality
  Information technology systems and infrastructure
  Dependence on key management personnel
Specific risks associated with performance include 
Christmas trading as well as weather-sensitive sales, 
particularly within the Car Maintenance and Cycling 
categories in the Retail business.

s trategic r ePor t > risk risks and u ncertainties Like all businesses, our Group faces risks and 
uncertainties that could impact the achievement of 
the Group’s strategy.
These risks are accepted as being a part of doing 
business. The Board recognises that the nature and 
scope of these risks can change and so regularly 
reviews them as well as the systems and processes 
to mitigate them.
The Corporate Governance report on pages 76 to 89 
describes the systems and internal control processes 
through which the directors identify, assess, manage 
and mitigate risks.
Senior Management colleagues assess risks on a 
department-by-department basis using a variety of 
techniques to identify risk. The likelihood and impact 
of these risks are considered and scored against a 
recognised framework dependent upon their effect 
on the achievement of our corporate strategies.
Responsibility for taking the necessary actions to 
manage risk is delegated to appropriate colleagues 
in the business, with executive manager sponsor 
involvement. The risk register is monitored and 
updated with current and ongoing mitigation on a 
regular basis.
Mindful of corporate strategy, executive management 
and the Board consider the risks reported within the 
risk register and review and monitor new risks and all 
mitigating actions to ensure that the Group’s appetite 
for risk is not exceeded. The Board recognises that 
each of its strategic pillars (i.e. Supporting Drivers 
of Every Car, Inspiring Cyclists of Every Age, and 
Equipping Families for their Leisure Time) could be 
compromised by any of the risks set out below. 
Individual Getting into Gear initiatives are reliant 
on some of the mitigations identified. For example 
Service Revolution delivery is reliant on full utilisation 
of our 3-Gears online training system and on our 
ability to attract and retain good colleagues. Stores 
Fit to Shop is reliant on our continuing investment in 
modernisation of our stores.
Specific financial risks are detailed in note 19 to the 
Annual Report and Accounts on pages 141 to 144.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation
Economic, Environmental and Political
The economy is a major influence on consumer spending. Trends in employment, 
inflation, taxation, consumer debt levels, weather and interest rates impact 
consumer expenditure in discretionary areas. Changes in Government policies 
(e.g. Cycle to Work, DAB switchover) may also affect our consumers’ ability to 
benefit from our products and services.
The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining a focus on the “defensive” 
characteristics of its “needs driven” product groups. A firm focus is maintained 
on cost control. Targeted promotions and excellent service are designed to 
attract and retain customers. It ensures that marketing and merchandising can 
be revised quickly to react to weather conditions.
We also ensure that we have representation with Governmental decision-makers 
in the areas supporting our core categories.
Business Strategy
The aim of the Group’s business strategy is to deliver long-term value to 
our shareholders. The Board understands that if the strategy and vision are 
inappropriately formulated, communicated, or executed then the business will 
suffer.
The Group has its established ‘three pillars’ strategy. Following a thorough 
review, a retail three-year plan (Getting into Gear) was announced during the 
year. Strategic issues, including the three-year plan, are regularly reviewed at 
Board meetings. Regular assessment is made to ensure that strategy remains 
appropriate, and that the business is making progress in meeting its strategic 
objectives. KPIs relating to strategy have been communicated clearly both within 
the business and to the market. These KPIs are regularly discussed by the 
Board. Our budget process recognises the importance of strategic initiatives.
Competition
The retail industry is highly competitive and dynamic. The Group competes with a 
wide variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces competition from UK retailers, 
in both stores and online, as well as international operators. The car servicing 
servicing market is a service-based market with a number of different-sized 
providers where trust is extremely important to customers. Failure to compete 
with competitors on areas including price, product range, quality, service and 
trustworthiness could have an adverse effect on the Group’s financial results.
The Board is aware of the risks faced from UK retailers, both in-store and online, 
and from the national car-servicing networks and smaller independents. 
We announced a significant investment programme at the start of the year to 
support Getting into Gear. The investment programme is allowing us to improve 
the service we provide to customers by improving the quality of our stores, IT 
infrastructure, training and website (including optimisation for mobile and tablet 
devices). Excellent service is fundamental to differentiating ourselves from our 
competitors.
The national geographical coverage of our stores underpins our Click & Collect 
offering. Our wefit service is a key differentiator. Our cycle repair and extended 
parts, accessories and clothing range offer confirm our credibility within the 
cycling market.
The Group seeks to continually strengthen its “own-brand” and “sub-brand” retail 
offer and develop opportunities to differentiate the Halfords brand including TV, 
radio, press and social media advertising.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation
Compliance
The Group operates in an environment governed by legislation, standards and 
codes in areas including, but not limited to, trading, advertising, product quality, 
health and safety, hazardous substances, bribery act and data protection.
Regulatory requirements are closely monitored by our Company Secretarial 
team. The Group has Quality Assurance and Compliance teams working in 
both the Retail and Autocentres businesses. Specialist Health and Safety teams 
ensure that the Group has adequate policies and risk assessments.
Colleagues and management are trained to identify and handle regulatory issues 
using the 3-Gears training modules on our online Learning Management System. 
We have a whistleblowing hotline that allows colleagues to raise concerns in 
confidence.
We operate a Code of Conduct that clearly sets out our expectations of 
suppliers. We have a corporate delegated authorities framework (‘How We 
Do Business’) setting out key authorisation levels. Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
training has been delivered through face-to-face and online training sessions.
Changing Customer Preferences
Some of the products that Halfords sells, particularly in the Car Enhancement 
category, are subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences. Products such 
as children’s cycles face competition from alternative products (such as games 
consoles) and some of the products that the Group sells are non-discretionary in 
their nature and predicting future trends is difficult.
Halfords has recruited experienced, knowledgeable trading colleagues who 
can identify and interpret trends and consequently respond in a timely manner 
to changes in consumer preferences. Colleagues also monitor developments 
in alternative products and our forecasts reflect the latest assumption in these 
areas. We are continually looking at ways of moving into new merchandising 
opportunities to mitigate technology changes and to improve forecasting and 
planning to ensure we meet our customers’ changing needs.
Reliance on Foreign Manufacturers
Halfords sources a significant proportion of the merchandise it sells in its stores 
from outside of the UK, either directly or via third-party suppliers. Consequently, 
the Group is subject to the risks associated with international trade (particularly 
those which are common in the import of goods from developing countries) 
including, but not limited to, inflation, currency fluctuation, the imposition of 
taxes or other charges on imports, the exposure to different legal standards, 
the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and changing foreign 
government policies and natural disasters.
Extensive research is conducted into quality and ethics before the Group 
procures products from any new country or supplier. The Group’s strong 
management team in the Far East has been recruited locally and understands 
the local culture, market regulations and risks and we maintain very close 
relationships with both our suppliers and shippers to ensure that disruption to 
production and supply are managed appropriately.
We work with suppliers in a number of territories to reduce the risks of disruption.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation
Product and Service Quality and Brand Reputation
The Board recognises that the quality and safety of both our products and 
services in our stores and Autocentres is of critical importance to us and that 
any major failure will affect consumer confidence and our reputation. Failure 
to protect the Group’s reputation and brand could lead to a loss of trust and 
confidence. This could result in a decline in the customer base and affect the 
ability to recruit and retain good people. There is also the risk that our service 
proposition fails due to inconsistent levels of service at individual stores and 
individual centres, or through unavailability of stock as a result of disruption to the 
supply chain (e.g. unavailability of distribution centre).
The Group constantly seeks to enhance its position as the store or centre of 
first choice in each of the markets that it serves. Halfords continues to invest in 
both its existing estate to ensure that it remains contemporary and in constant 
product innovation to meet customer needs. In addition, the Group’s market 
leading in-store wefit proposition provides a range of services at a lower cost to 
our customers than that provided by competitors.
Our ‘Gears’ training programme uses online modules to ensure that colleagues 
are consistently knowledgeable about our products and able to deliver quality 
services to customers. We have also implemented measures to ensure that 
we attract and retain the best colleagues: Engagement Surveys aim to identify 
opportunities to reduce colleague turnover; we have recently been recognised as 
one of the Sunday Times 25 Best Big Companies to Work For; our recruitment 
processes are now centralised to improve efficiency and consistency.
Our products are thoroughly tested for safety and quality. Complaints received in 
stores are closely monitored. Management in both retail stores and Autocentres 
are incentivised on quality of service targets. Our product recall procedures have 
been comprehensively reviewed and revised during the year. We clearly set out 
our expectations for retail disciplines in-store to ensure on-shelf availability.
Our Autocentres business continually seeks to provide innovative solutions 
for their customers, such as brakes4life. In our centres, the training of our 
technicians to provide high quality motor vehicle repairs is enhanced through an 
apprenticeship programme. The majority of our centres workshop colleagues 
hold a Motor Industry qualification. Repairs are subject to extensive quality 
assurance processes.
The business has developed and tested continuity plans.
Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Infrastructure
In common with most businesses, Halfords is dependent on the reliability and 
suitability of a number of important IT systems where any sustained performance 
problems (including those caused by cyber-attack), could potentially compromise 
our operational capability for a period of time impacting on stores, centres or 
warehouse, multi-channel and distribution systems. With ambitious growth plans 
for our multi-channel offer, our trading capacity could be affected by internal and 
external systems’ resilience and interdependencies.
Extensive controls are in place to maintain the integrity of our systems and 
to ensure that systems changes are implemented in a controlled manner. 
Halfords’ key trading systems are hosted within a secure data centre operated 
by a specialist company remote from our support centre. These systems are 
also supported by a number of disaster recovery arrangements including a 
comprehensive backup strategy, and a hotlink secure data centre hosted 
outside the UK. IT recovery processes are tested regularly. We have successfully 
completed an upgrade of our core SAP system.
We have thoroughly reviewed our IT security processes this year and recruited 
a number of specialists to the IT team, including dedicated IT security and 
continuity experts.
Dependence on Key Management Personnel
The success of the Group’s business depends upon its Senior Management 
closely supervising all aspects of its business, in particular, the operation of the 
stores and autocentres, including the appropriate training of in-store and centre 
colleagues, and the design, procurement and allocation of merchandise. 
Our Remuneration Policy outlined on pages 92 to 101 details the strategies 
in place to ensure that high calibre Executives are attracted and retained. The 
Group looks to improve its senior manager cadre through operating a talent 
management process to help individuals achieve their full potential within 
Halfords and to ensure that appropriate succession plans are in place to meet 
the future needs of the business. At a junior level the Group continues to invest in 
graduate programmes and store and centre colleague training and development.

profits and dividends
The Group’s results for the year are set out in the Consolidated Income Statement on page 117. The profit 
before tax on ordinary activities was £72.6m (2013: £71.0m) and the profit after tax amounted to £55.5m 
(2013: £52.7m). The Board proposes that a final dividend of 9.1 pence per ordinary share be paid on 1 August

This payment, together with the interim dividend of 5.2 pence per ordinary share paid on 21 January 2014, 
makes a total for the year of 14.3 pence per ordinary share. The total final dividend payable to shareholders 
for the year is estimated to be £18.1m. Computershare Nominees (Channel Islands) Limited, trustee of the 
Halfords Employee Share Trust, has waived its entitlement to dividends.

directors’ indeMnities
The Company maintains liability insurance for its Directors and officers. The Directors of the Company, and the 
Company’s subsidiaries, have the benefit of a third-party indemnity provision, as defined by section 236 of the 
Companies Act 2006, in the Company’s Articles of Association.
auditor s
At the 2013 AGM, KPMG LLP was appointed as the Company’s Auditors. A resolution proposing the 
reappointment of KPMG LLP is expected to be contained in the Notice of the AGM and will be put to the 
shareholders at the meeting.
disclosure of inf or Mati on to the audi tor s
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware 
and the Directors have taken all reasonable steps to ascertain any relevant audit information and ensure 
the auditors are aware of such information. The Directors are responsible for maintaining the integrity of 
financial information including this Annual Report, together with other financial statements, presentations and 
announcements on the Company’s corporate website. Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Goin G concern
With effect from 11 September 2013 the Group secured a four-year £200m revolving credit facility (extendable 
by a further year) and at 28 March 2014 the Group had undrawn borrowing facilities of £114m (29 March 
2013: £197m). The Group’s previous and current committed borrowing facilities contain certain financial 
covenants, which have been met throughout the period. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within 
the level of its borrowing facilities and covenants for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the uncertain economic 
outlook. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future, hence they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.
collea Gues
The Group has established a framework of colleague communications, including a monthly colleague 
magazine, to provide colleagues with information on matters of concern to them and business performance, 
as well as to encourage the engagement of every colleague in the Board’s commitment to high standards of 
customer care and service provision. This is reinforced via training initiatives across the business, details of 
which can be found on pages 28 and 30, and the facilitation of colleague share ownership via a Sharesave 
Scheme.
The Group is dedicated to the principle of equal opportunity in employment. No potential or current colleague 
receives less favourable treatment on grounds such as gender, marital status, race, ethnic origin, religion, 
disability, sexual orientation, or age, or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements which cannot be shown 
to be justified. Fair and equitable employment policies are applied which seek to promote entry into, and 
progression within, the Group. The basis for all appointments is personal ability and competency relevant to 
the specific job criteria.
Full and fair consideration is given to employment applications by disabled persons wherever suitable 
opportunities exist, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Training and career development 
support is provided where appropriate. Should a colleague become disabled, efforts are made to ensure their 
continued employment with the Group and retraining provided if necessary.
A whistleblowing policy and procedure enables colleagues to report concerns on matters affecting the Group 
or their employment, without fear of recrimination. In addition, the Group takes a zero-tolerance approach 
to matters of discrimination, harassment and bullying in all aspects of its business operations, including in 
relation to gender, race, national origin, disability, age, religion or sexual orientation. Appropriate policies and 
procedures are in place for reporting and dealing with such matters.
political dona tions
The Group’s policy is not to make any donations for political purposes. However, the Companies Act 2006 
defines the term “donations” very widely and, as a result, certain expenses legitimately incurred as part of the 
process of talking to Government at all levels and making the Group’s position known are now reportable. 
Although during the year no such expenditure or political donations were made, resolutions were passed at the 
2013 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) that provided for limited authority for such expenditure, such authority 
remaining valid until the earlier of 30 September 2014 or the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2014, and 
as such the Company will be asking for this limited authority to be renewed at the AGM to be held on 29 July 
2014. The Group did not make any political donations throughout the period (FY13: nil).
share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital, including changes during the year in the issued share capital and 
details of the rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, are set out in Note 20 on page 144. All 
ordinary shares, including those acquired through Company share schemes and plans, rank equally with 
no special rights. All shareholders are entitled to attend and speak at the general meetings of the Company,

appoint proxies, receive any dividends, exercise voting rights and transfer shares without restriction. There are 
no known arrangements which may restrict the transfer of shares or voting rights.
The Company has term and revolving credit facilities which require the Company in the event of a change of 
control to notify the facility agent and, if required by the majority lenders, these facilities may be cancelled. The 
Company does not have agreements with any Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss 
of office or employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions of the Company’s share schemes and 
plan may cause options and awards granted to Directors and employees under such schemes and plans to 
vest on a takeover.
Rules relating to the appointment or removal of the Directors, and their powers, are contained within the 
Company’s Articles of Association, which in accordance with legislation can only be changed with shareholder 
approval.
MaJor shareholders
At 12 May 2014, the Company’s register of substantial shareholdings showed the following interests of 3% or 
more of the Company’s issued ordinary shares:

2013, such authority expiring at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2014.

corporate Governance report
chair Man’s int roduction
The effectiveness of the Board is underpinned by clear corporate governance arrangements for the Group. 
The Board is collectively responsible for upholding high standards of corporate governance. This period, this 
has been reflected in the implementation of an updated delegated authorities framework as described in this 
report. This framework seeks to embed procedures and processes throughout the Group for the approval of 
financial commitments, contracts and other day-to-day and non-business-as-usual activities of the business. 
Additionally, the “tone from the top” has been set with regard, for example, anti-bribery and corruption and 
whistleblowing arrangements.
The Board works with the Executive Directors to provide advice and independent challenge to develop and 
deliver the long-term strategy of the Group. 
Each year the Board is evaluated to uncover any issues, and confirm that the Board maintains the right 
composition to undertake its duties. More information on this period’s internal evaluation exercise can be found 
on page 81. It concluded amongst other things that our Board continues to maintain the right balance of skills, 
experience and knowledge to be able to serve the Company and its shareholders effectively.

The UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 (the 
“Code”) applies to the Company and is available on the FRC website at www.frc.org.uk. The Listing Rules 
have yet to be updated by the Financial Conduct Authority and continue to require that certain compliance 
statements are made in relation to the predecessor edition of the Code, issued in June 2010. The Board 
confirms that for the period ended 28 March 2014 it complied fully with the requirements of both editions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, where relevant, except in relation to the ongoing service until 31 May 
2014 of Keith Harris and Bill Ronald as explained on page 80. 
This report outlines how we have complied with the five Main Principles of both editions of the Code,  
where relevant.

Details of the Group’s business model and strategy can be found on pages 6 to 7 and pages 16 to 49.
l eadership: r ol e of the b oa rd
The Board is collectively responsible for ensuring that the business acts in the best interests of the Company 
to generate sustainable value for shareholders, whilst preserving the interests of its customers, employees and 
other stakeholders. The main facets of this responsibility comprise: consideration of the long-term direction 
and strategy of the Company; the values and standards within the business; management performance; 
resources; and controls. To effectively discharge these responsibilities, the Board has implemented the system 
of delegated authorities set out below, which enables the day-to-day operation of the business, and ensures 
that significant matters are brought to the attention of management and the Board as appropriate.

Delegated Authorities
Matters Reserved for the Board include: Strategy and Management;

Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees as described 
further at pages 82 to 85. 
Available at: www.halfordscompany.com/i/g/oc
How We Do Business is the internal name of the formal delegated 
authorities document approved by the Board. It describes how 
day-to-day decisions are delegated to the Executive Directors, the 
Senior Management Team and others within the business. Each 
potential activity is set out by reference from whom approval must 
be sought and what paperwork is required as confirmation of 
that approval. Where an activity is not expressly described within 
How We Do Business, approval must be sought from the Senior 
Management Team who will apply the principles of How We Do 
Business to the decision. Training sessions were held for all relevant 
Support Centre colleagues on How We Do Business after it was 
launched with refresher courses planned yearly. The implementation 
of the document is constantly monitored, with an updated 
document to be circulated on a yearly basis.
It is through the above system of delegated authorities, that the Board is able to provide oversight and direction to the Executive Directors, Senior Management Team 
and the wider business.

Specifically this involves:
  evaluating and appraising the performance of Executive Directors and Senior Management against agreed 
targets;
  participating in developing the strategy of the Group;
  monitoring the financial information, risk management and controls processes of the Group to make sure 
they are sufficiently robust;
  meeting regularly with senior management;

concerns
The Chairman seeks to resolve any concerns raised within or outside meetings by the Board. However, any 
unresolved business can be recorded on behalf of a Director in the minutes of the relevant meeting. A resigning 
Non-Executive Director would also able to raise any concerns in a written letter to the Chairman who would 
bring such concerns to the attention of the Board. No such concerns have been raised throughout the period.

The Directors together act in the best interests of the Company via the Board and its Committees, and devote 
sufficient time and consideration as is necessary to fulfil their duties. Each Director brings different skills, 
experience, and knowledge to the Company, and the Non-Executive Directors additionally bring independent 
thought and judgement. This combination seeks to ensure that no individual or group restricts or controls 
decision-making unduly.

independence
As at the date of this report, both Keith Harris and Bill Ronald will have served for over nine years as Non-
Executive Directors of the Company. The Code requires the Board to determine whether independence 
is affected by service of more than nine years from the date of first election of each individual. The Board 
previously confirmed in the Annual Report 2013 that both Keith Harris and Bill Ronald were still considered to 
be independent in character and judgement and confirms this belief continues through to 31 May 2014 when 
both Keith Harris and Bill Ronald will retire as Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Therefore, neither Keith 
Harris nor Bill Ronald will offer themselves for re-election at the AGM.
In respect of the other Non-Executive Directors, the Board considers David Adams, Claudia Arney and Helen 
Jones to be independent in character and judgement in accordance with the requirements of the Code. The 
Chairman, Dennis Millard, was considered independent on his appointment.
In compliance with the requirements of the Code for at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, to be 
independent, the Company confirms that 62.5% of its Board are independent. From the 31 May 2014, when 
Keith Harris and Bill Ronald step down from the Board 50% of the Board will be independent.
diversity
The Board considers that it is the background and experience brought to the Board by each individual that 
best secures and demonstrates its diversity. The principle that candidates are considered “on merit and 
against objective criteria, and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender” is 
established in the Terms of Reference of the Nomination Committee
1
. No fixed quota is applied to decisions 
regarding any recruitment, rather the Nomination Committee considers capability and capacity to commit the 
necessary time to the role, in its recommendations to the Board. The intention is the appointment of the most 
suitably-qualified candidate to compliment and balance the current skills, knowledge and experience on the 
Board who will be best able to help lead the Company in its long-term strategy. 
1. Available here: www.halfordscompany.com/investors/governance/our-committees/nomination-committee.
The Board is well placed by the mixture of skills, experience and knowledge of its Directors to act in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders.

appoint Ments to the b oa rd
Helen Jones joined the Company as Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2014. Egon Zehnder International 
were engaged by the Company to conduct the search for suitable candidates and short-listed several 
candidates who met individually with members of the Board. Feedback from these one-to-one meetings was 
fed back to the Chairman. The Nomination Committee subsequently met to discuss the potential appointment 
and after considering the existing balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board, the merit and 
capabilities of the candidates and the time they were able to devote to the role in order to promote the success 
of the Company, recommended the appointment of Helen Jones to the Board.
induction and develop Ment
An induction programme is maintained for new Directors, which is tailored to include briefings on the activities 
of the Group and visits to operational sites. Helen Jones is currently undertaking a full induction programme as 
prepared by the Chairman, with the assistance of the Company Secretary. She was provided with background 
materials covering the operational and organisational structure of the business, as well as the strategic aims 
and key initiatives of the Company when she joined. Over the next few months, she will undertake extensive 
store, autocentres and distribution centre visits and on-site discussions with store, autocentre and distribution 
centre colleagues as well as one-to-one meetings with the Senior Management Team. All current Directors 
have various opportunities for ongoing development and support via:
  a programme of head office, distribution centre and store/autocentre visits;
  reviews with the Chairman to identify any training and development needs;
  advice on governance, relevant legislative changes affecting the business or their duties as directors from 
the Company Secretary; 
  membership of the Deloitte Academy, a training and guidance resource for boards and directors; and
  access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense

evaluation
Last year an external board evaluation exercise took place involving face-to-face interviews which was 
conducted using an external facilitator Egon Zehnder, who had previously worked with the Company on an 
executive recruitment project. 
This year, an internal survey was used where questions were devised by the Company Secretary and agreed 
with the Chairman. A web-based solution was used to deliver the survey to all Board members. The survey 
considered topics under the headings:
  Leading the Business — Strategy, Performance, and Talent;
  Board Dynamics & Behaviour;
  Board Composition; and
  Board Process.
Following this review, a summary of the results of the evaluation was prepared and shared with all members of 
the Board. The main outcomes of the evaluation this period were to acknowledge the Board’s understanding 
of the Group’s Getting into Gear strategy and any key business and strategy risks, and their management and 
mitigation. The survey also acknowledged that that that there is an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence, diversity (including gender) and knowledge of the Company to enable the Directors to 
discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. 
There has been a focus during the period on the ensuring the quality of information being sent and presented 
to the Board so as to optimise its time and effectiveness. In the coming period, technological improvements 
are being considered to optimise the interface between the Board and management and further improve the 
efficiency of the Board’s operation.
r e-election
In compliance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors on the Board as at  
28 March 2014, except for Keith Harris and Bill Ronald, will seek re-election at the Company’s AGM. Keith 
Harris and Bill Ronald will retire on 31 May 2014. Helen Jones who was appointed to the Board on 1 March 
2014 will offer herself for election at the AGM.

directors and their ot her int erests
Each Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational conflict). 
The Board considered and approved these interests in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association 
and each Director was informed of the authorisation and the terms on which it was given. 
All Directors are aware of the need to consult with the Company Secretary regarding any further possible 
situational conflict that may arise so that prior consideration can be given by the Board as to whether or not 
such conflict will be approved.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests of the Directors and their immediate 
families in the share capital of the Company and options to subscribe for shares in the Company are shown in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 90 to 110.
b oard coMMit tees
Some of the Board’s responsibilities are discharged via Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
The activities of these Committees are described on pages 82 to 84. The Company Secretary also acts as the 
secretary to each Committee. Whilst not entitled to attend, other Directors, professional advisors and senior 
management attend when invited to. The auditor attends certain Audit Committee meetings by invitation. No 
member is present at Nomination and Remuneration Committee discussions pertinent to them.
A Disclosure Committee, made up of a minimum of two Directors, approves the final wording of market 
announcements prior to release.
The day-to-day treasury needs of the Group are managed by the Treasury Committee chaired by the Finance 
Director and whose other members are senior members of the Finance and Treasury teams.
The Board may establish other ad hoc committes of the Board to consider specific issues.

The Group’s overall approach to diversity is that we aim to reflect the communities that we serve. In FY15, 
the Company has committed to put in place plans for improving gender diversity as an important step in 
achieveing this goal. The Company does not currently publish specific diversity targets, but is aiming to create 
a more balanced workforce over the next three years, in particular on a gender basis. In achieving this goal, 
the focus is on improving our ability to attract a more balanced candidate pool, ensuring our recruitment 
processes are also appropriate and building more confidence, capability and gender diversity awareness 
through our development and career programmes. The Nomination Committee and the Board will continue to 
review progress against this area on a regular basis.

internal con trol and r isk Mana GeMent
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control, reviewing its effectiveness and ensuring that there is a 
process to identify, evaluate and manage any significant risks that may affect the achievement of the Group’s 
strategic objectives lies with the Board.
The Board and the Audit Committee have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems in accordance with the Code for the period ended 28 March 2014, and up to the date 
of approving the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The risk management and internal control system 
is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The assessment and control of risk are considered by the Board to be fundamental to achieving corporate 
objectives. An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group and assessing the effectiveness of related controls has been established by the Board to ensure 
an acceptable risk/reward profile across the Group. The process has been in place throughout the period 
ended 28 March 2014, and up to the date of approving the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The key 
elements of this process which cover both the Retail and Autocentres businesses are:
  a comprehensive system of monthly reporting from key executives, identifying performance against budget, 
analysis of variances, major business issues, key performance indicators and regular forecasting; 
  well-defined policies governing appraisal and approval of capital expenditure and treasury operations;
  reviews of key business risks (e.g. ‘cyber threat’ which was the subject of an Audit Committee presentation 
by KPMG in January 2014, with a subsequent follow-up report by internal audit) and of management’s 
controls and plans to mitigate these risks;
  regular meetings to identify and discuss key risks and mitigations with a broad sample of the Senior 
Management Team and the Executive Directors;
  review of the corporate risk register in terms of completeness and accuracy with the Senior Management 
Team and the Executive Directors; and
  Audit Committee discussion of the corporate risk register and the risk management system with 
subsequent reports to the Board.

Our process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group and assessing 
the effectiveness of related controls routinely identifies areas for improvement, but the Board has neither 
identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be material or significant.
We are pleased to report that following a rigorous review process by HMRC, we have been categorised as a 
low risk tax business.
The Board considered its appetite for risk in relation to the top 30 risks determining that the risks and 
mitigating actions were appropriate to the level of risk that was both acceptable to, and incumbent within, a 
FTSE 250 business. More information on the Company’s key risks and uncertainties is shown on pages 64

r elations with shareholders
During the period and until 1 March 2014 Bill Ronald served as Senior Independent Director when he stood 
down and David Adams was appointed Senior Independent Director. The Senior Independent Director 
relationship with shareholders is described on page 79.
During the period under review the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman have met with 
analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them informed of significant developments and report to the 
Board accordingly on the views of these stakeholders. The Investor Relations officer also conducted a number 
of market meetings during the year, in and outside of the UK. A separate site visit in the year was well attended 
by analysts and shareholders. Each of the other Non-Executive Directors was also offered the opportunity to 
attend meetings with major shareholders and would do so if requested by any major shareholder.
The Company’s investor relations programme includes formal presentations of full year and interim results and 
meetings with individual investors as appropriate. Feedback from these meetings and events is provided to 
the Board. The Company Secretary also brings to the attention of the Board any material matters of concern 
raised by the Company’s shareholders, including private investors.

The Interim Report and the Annual Report and Financial Statements are the primary means of communication 
during the year with all of the Company’s shareholders. The Board recognises the importance of the web

The Board welcomes the opportunity to meet with shareholders and to hear their views and answer their 
questions about the Group and its business at the Company’s AGM which will be held on Tuesday, 29 July 
2014 at the Hilton Garden Inn, 1 Brunswick Squre, Brindley Place, Birmingham B1 2HW. The Chairs of the 
Remuneration, Nomination and Audit Committees will be present at the AGM and will be in a position to

chair Man’s int roduction
This year has seen the Audit Committee continue its work of reviewing the effectiveness of Halfords’ corporate 
governance framework with particular emphasis on the quality of financial reporting, internal control, and risk 
management systems.
I reported last year that we had appointed an in-house Head of Internal Audit and I am pleased to report that 
this year’s internal audit plan has been delivered by a well-resourced, experienced and independent in-house 
team, assisted by external specialists where necessary. As we report below, the internal audit function has 
strong and direct links into the Audit Committee.
This report explains how the Audit Committee has discharged its responsibilities, and takes into account the 
three specific areas highlighted in the revised Corporate Governance Code:
  Significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements
  External Audit effectiveness and appointment
  External Audit objectivity and independence and the impact of non-audit work
David Adams 
Chairman of the Audit Committee

MeMbership and r eMit o f the audit coMMit tee
MeMb ership
All the members of the Audit Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors. Having been the Deputy 
Chief Executive and Finance Director of the House of Fraser Plc, David Adams is considered by the Board to 
have recent and relevant financial experience and so the requisite experience to chair the Committee. Each 
of the other independent Non-Executive Directors has, through their other business activities, significant 
experience in financial matters. Dennis Millard, the Chairman, senior members of management and advisors 
are invited to attend meetings as appropriate. The Audit Committee meets according to the requirements of 
the Company’s financial calendar. The meetings of the Audit Committee also provide the opportunity for the 
independent Non-Executive Directors to meet without the Executive Directors present and to raise any issues 
of concern with the auditors. There have been three such meetings in the period ended 28 March 2014 and 
nothing of note was reported.
r eMit
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include:
  making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the External Auditors, including on 
effectiveness, independence, non-audit work undertaken (against a formal policy) and remuneration;
  reviewing the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted throughout the period;
  reviewing and approving external financial reporting for adoption by the Board;
  assisting the Board in achieving its obligations under the Code in areas of risk management and internal control, 
focusing particularly on compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and the Listing Rules;

  ensuring that an effective system of internal financial and non-financial controls is maintained; and
  approving a formal whistleblowing policy whereby staff may, in confidence, disclose issues of concern about 
possible malpractice or wrongdoings by any of the Group’s businesses or any of its employees without fear 
of reprisal, and includes arrangements to investigate and respond to any issues raised.

siGnificant iss ues in r el ation to the f inancial sta te Ments 
In order to discharge its responsibility to consider accounting integrity, the Committee carefully considers key 
judgments applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which are set out on pages 117 
to 122. The Committee’s review included consideration of the following key accounting judgements:
iMpair Ment of Goodwill and int an Gib les ( autocentres)
Following the acquisition of Nationwide in 2010, the Group holds significant goodwill in the Halfords 
Autocentres business. With pressure on its like-for-like revenues (-0.1% for the year ending 28 March 2014) 
combined with a subdued aftercare market where customers are still looking to defer vehicle maintenance, 
there is a risk that the business may not meet either the growth projections expected by the business or those 
necessary to support the carrying value of the intangible asset (see note 10 of the financial statements).
The Audit Committee has received detailed reports from Halfords’ finance team and External Auditors 
addressing this issue. Consideration has been given to ensuring that cash flow models, discount rates, 
customer retention rates, sensitivity models and centre profitability are all reasonable. The Committee 
concluded that it is satisfied with the accounting treatment of impairment of goodwill and intangibles.
valuation of inventory
With the continuing pressure to provide up-to-date products to customers and with the change in ranges 
observed at the end of FY13 and through FY14, there is a risk that inventory provisions made will be 
inappropriate or incomplete (see note 12 to the financial statements). Management have recently implemented 
a revised methodology for assessing inventory provision. Range reviews are regularly undertaken to ensure that 
all discontinued inventory is identified.
The Audit Committee has received detailed reports from Halfords’ finance team and External Auditors 
addressing this issue. After consideration of the accuracy of the new provisioning model, the completeness 
and accuracy of range reviews, and the reflection of these reviews within the provision, the Committee 
concluded that it is satisfied with the accounting treatment of the valuation of inventory.

external auditors
effectiveness of ext ernal audit
The effectiveness of the external audit is considered throughout the year through, amongst other factors, 
assessment of the degree of the audit firm’s challenge of key estimates and judgements made by the business, 
feedback from any external or internal quality reviews on the audit and the wider quality of communication with 
the Committee.
In addition at its meeting in January 2014, the Committee performed a specific evaluation of the performance 
of the external auditor considering the areas set out above and feedback from management. Following this, 
the Committee concluded that:
  The overall audit approach, materiality, threshold, and areas of audit focus were appropriate to the business; 
and
  The audit team possessed the necessary quality, expertise and experience to provide an independent and 
objective audit.
approach to appoint Ment or reappoint Ment
KPMG LLP were appointed as External Auditors to the Group in 2009 following a formal tender process. Since 
that time, KPMG LLP have complied with the partner rotation requirement set out in Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. A partner rotation is now due and KPMG’s Peter Meehan is expected to take up the responsibilities 
of Senior Statutory Auditor in the new financial year. Peter has been attending Audit Committee meetings 
throughout the year as part of his induction process and the Committee believe him to be a suitable 
appointment.
The Audit Committee has considered the new UK Corporate Governance Code guidance in relation to auditor 
rotation including the proposed transition rules which will be considered when recommending the appointment 
of the External Auditors in future years.
The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with the External Auditors is working well and is satisfied 
with their independence, objectivity and effectiveness and has not considered it necessary to require KPMG 
LLP to re-tender for external audit work. The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, for approval by 
shareholders at the AGM on 29 July 2014, the reappointment of KPMG LLP as External Auditors.
approach to safe Guard inG ob Jectivity and independence if non-audit services are 
provided 
The Audit Committee has established a policy to ensure that any non-audit services delivered by the External 
Auditors will not jeopardise objectivity and independence. The policy is consistent with Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
The policy specifies:
i. ‘The external auditors can be used to provide non-audit services subject to any non-audit engagement 
proposal provided by the External Auditors is formally approved by the Audit Committee before contractual 
arrangements are entered into, except for
ii. Half year review; and 
iii. Internal support services supplied by the External Auditors in order to execute management’s Internal Audit 
plan.
Other than for the above, for each separate service proposed to be provided by the External Auditors the 
Chief Financial Officer will prepare a note either to be tabled and minuted at an Audit Committee meeting or 
to be circulated via email to the Audit Committee members and the CEO giving a description of the work to 
be undertaken, the reasons why the External Auditors are involved in the proposal and how objectivity and 
independence has, and is seen to be, safeguarded.
Consent is required from the Audit Committee Chair on behalf of the Audit Committee before the External 
Auditors can be engaged for non-audit services.’
In addition, the External Auditors follows their own ethical guidelines and continually reviews its audit team to 
ensure that its independence is not compromised.
An analysis of the fees earned by the External Auditors is disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.
r ole and eff ectiveness of int ernal audit 
The internal audit function principally reviews the effectiveness of the controls operating within the business 
by undertaking an agreed schedule of independent audits each year. The Audit Committee determines the 
nature and scope of the annual audit programme at the beginning of each year and revises it from time to time 
according to changing business circumstances and requirements. The Audit Committee also confirms that 
internal audit has appropriate resources available to it. The annual audit programme is derived from an audit 
universe including financial and commercial processes, governance issues, and key corporate risks.

Our internal audit function has undergone significant change the last two years. During the period ended  
29 March 2013, the Company engaged KPMG to support the internal audit process in a non-managerial 
capacity. An experienced in-house Head of Internal Audit and Risk was appointed in October 2012 and 
following further recruitment, the internal audit programme for the year ended 28 March 2014 was planned and 
delivered by a well-resourced, experienced and independent in-house team, assisted by external specialists 
where necessary. We intend to continue with this resource model to deliver assurance.
Internal Audit reports on a day-to-day basis to Andrew Findlay, the Chief Financial Officer, but is independent 
in action and reporting of issues, with direct line of communication to the Audit Committee Chairman. The 
findings of the independent audits are reported initially to Executive management and any necessary corrective 
actions are agreed. Summaries of these reports are presented to, and discussed with, the Audit Committee 
along with details of progress against action plans as appropriate.
w histleblowin G 
A Whistleblowing policy and procedure enables colleagues to report concerns on matters affecting the Group 
or their employment, without fear of recrimination. Posters publicising whistleblowing channels are distributed 
to all stores, autocentres, distribution centres and support centres.
Whistleblowing policy and procedure was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and was subject to 
an internal audit review during the year. The Company Secretary provides the Audit Committee with a regular 
summary of whistleblowing contacts and resolutions.
anti- b r ibery and cor ruption pol icy 
The Group’s anti-bribery and corruption policy statement reinforces that the Halfords Board is committed to 
conducting its business affairs so as to ensure that it does not engage in or facilitate any form of corruption. 
It is Halfords’ policy to prohibit all forms of corruption amongst our employees, suppliers and any associated 
parties acting on our behalf. The Group has a detailed Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and maintains Gifts 
and Hospitality Registers. Anti-bribery expectations are set out in standard purchasing terms and conditions. 
Face-to-face and online training has been provided to colleagues to raise the awareness of anti-bribery and 
corruption legislation. 
The Audit Committee has requested that Anti-Bribery and Corruption safeguards are periodically reviewed by 
internal audit.

r eMuneration coMMit tee r eport
dear shareholder,
FY14 has been an encouraging year for Halfords. Matt Davies, our CEO appointed in 2012, announced the 
details of Group’s strategy to deliver on our vision to Help and Inspire our Customers with their Life on the 
Move in May 2013. The strategy is described elsewhere in this document but the key aim is to deliver a strong 
and sustainable business. For the Remuneration Committee this has therefore been a year of ensuring that we 
have the right talent, processes, structure and incentives in place to ensure we deliver the new strategy. 
perfor Mance Measures
As indicated in our last report, in the summer of 2013 the Committee undertook a review of performance 
measures for the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) to ensure that they aligned Executive Directors’ interests with 
the delivery of our strategy. As the strategic focus of the business is to put in place the foundations necessary to 
deliver a strong and sustainable business, the Committee determined that Total Shareholder Return and Earnings 
Per Share were no longer the most suitable measures. 
Following consultation with shareholders in the first half of the year, the Committee determined that PSP 
awards granted from 2013 onwards would be based on growth in the Group’s revenue (25%) and growth in 
the Group’s EBITDA (75%). The vesting of awards will also be subject to meeting a net debt underpin to ensure 
that debt remains at appropriate levels. 
For 2013/14, the annual bonus was based 75% on PBT, and 25% on the delivery of key strategic objectives 
which the Committee believed were crucial to the delivery of our strategy, and which it believes will lead to the 
creation of shareholder value. For 2014/15, the Committee determined that the strategic objectives should 
remain linked to the delivery of the Company’s vision but that the balance between financial and strategic 
targets should be amended as the strategy increasingly focuses on profitability. Consequently the Committee 
approved a FY15 bonus based 80% on PBT and 20% on strategic goals.
r eMuneration policy
Our focus on the appropriate remuneration policies for Halfords has also had to take account of the wide 
ranging market discussions over the last few years around Executive Director remuneration arrangements, 
and the new remuneration disclosure requirements which have been introduced from 1 October 2013. The 
legislation has introduced the concept of a binding vote for the Remuneration Policy Report and an advisory 
vote for the Annual Remuneration Report.
90
getting into gear integrated annual report for the year ended 28 march 2014 23157.04 Proof 7  10-06-2014
We have considered all the regulations carefully, and focused on our duty as a Committee to ensure that 
our remuneration policy for Executive Directors supports the strategic aims of the business, without taking 
unnecessary risks, and enables us to recruit, motivate and retain executives of a high calibre, whist at the 
same time being consistent with the remuneration policies for our c.12,000 colleagues. Our Remuneration 
Policy Report on pages 92 to 101 is broadly in line with previously reported policies.
The Annual Remuneration Report reports on how our policy has been applied during the financial year to 28 
March 2014 and also to the date of this report. 
new coMpany’s sha re opt ion sch eMe (“cs os ”) and sav e as you ear n 
sche Me (“say e”)
The Committee considers that encouraging colleagues to own shares in our business helps to motivate 
and retain colleagues, and encourages them to think like an owner in their dealings with customers and 
colleagues alike. Colleague share ownership is an important part of making Halfords a great place to work and 
creating stores that are a great place to shop. The current CSOS and SAYE expire in 2014, and therefore the 
Committee has considered and approved new rules for these schemes which will be placed before members 
for their approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 29 July 2014. Executive Directors will not be 
invited to participate in the CSOS.
r eMuneration received in respect of 2013/14
The Remuneration Committee approved an average 1.5% salary increase in October 2013 for all colleagues 
and Executive Directors. Executive Directors earned bonuses of 97.5% of their maximum opportunity. 
The Committee determined that this level of bonus was appropriate, reflecting the strong PBT result and 
compelling performance against key strategic objectives during the year, see page 104 for more details. PSP 
awards granted in 2011 will lapse in 2014 as the EPS and TSR targets were not met. 
priorities for 2014/15
The priorities for the Committee in the forthcoming year remain to ensure that the Company’s Remuneration 
Policy supports the delivery and ongoing development of the strategy, and the focus on the long-term success 
of the business.
In summary, the Committee has dealt with a number of changes over the last year both specific to the 
Company and in response to Government and shareholder consultations and is committed to ensuring that 
the Company’s remuneration arrangements are designed to drive sustained shareholder value, and that proper 
levels of transparency are maintained.
Yours faithfully,
Claudia Arney

Governance > re Muneraton coMMit tee report
re Muneration policy report
executive r eMuneration poli cy
The policy report set out on pages 92 to 101 sets out the remuneration policy (the “Policy”) that the Company 
intends to apply, subject to shareholder approval, with effect from 29 July 2014 (the date of the AGM). It is 
intended that this Policy will apply until the 2017 AGM, unless the Company seeks shareholder approval for a 
revised policy which comes into force before this date.
The Committee seeks to support the delivery of the Group’s strategy through establishing appropriate 
remuneration arrangements. Our goal is to build a strong long-term sustainable business by delivering ongoing 
sales growth and sustainable shareholder returns through the delivery of authoritative ranges of products, 
colleague and service excellence, digital participation and helpful store and Autocentre environments.
Consequently, the overall remuneration policy of the Committee, and of the Board, is to provide remuneration 
packages for Executive Directors and other senior managers in the Group which:
  Attract and retain — Enable the Group to attract and retain management of a high calibre with the 
necessary retail, customer service, financial, digital and service-industry skills and credentials required to 
deliver a sustainable business model and drive shareholder returns. Remuneration arrangements are set at 
levels appropriate to achieving this goal without paying more than is considered necessary. Benchmarking 
exercises are undertaken at appropriate intervals to inform the positioning of executives’ pay relative to 
the market and, without seeking to “match the median”, to identify and mitigate the risk of losing strong 
performers.
  Link variable pay to performance and the delivery of the agreed strategy — Provide management with the 
opportunity to earn competitive remuneration through annual and long-term variable pay arrangements 
that are designed to support delivery against key strategic objectives. Performance measures are aligned 
with strategic goals so that remuneration arrangements are transparent to executives, shareholders and 
other stakeholders. Different elements of executive pay are delivered over the short and longer term 
and are designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of the executives’ remuneration is variable and 
performance-related.
  Align executives as shareholders — Ensure management’s interests are aligned with those of shareholders 
by incentivising management to deliver the Group’s long-term strategy of a sustainable, growing business 
and thus enhance shareholder value. A significant portion of reward is delivered in shares to create 
alignment of interests. 
  Drive sustainable performance — Remuneration arrangements are designed to support the sustainable 
delivery of performance and to prevent excessive risk taking.

k ey ele Ment s of executive re Muner ation policy
Base Salary
Purpose and link to strategy
Base salary, which is payable in cash, is set at an appropriate level to attract and retain management of a high calibre with the necessary retail, customer service, 
financial, digital and service-industry skills and credentials required to deliver a sustainable business model and drive shareholder returns.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
Generally salaries are reviewed annually with increases effective from 1 October 
but may be reviewed at other times if the Committee considers this appropriate. 
In determining base salary levels consideration is given to the individual’s 
experience and the performance of the Group and the individual. Without seeking 
to “match the median” consideration is also given:
  To salary levels at other companies of a similar size and complexity;
  To salary levels at other UK listed retailers; and
  To pay increases for other employees in the Group.
While there is no maximum salary level, salary increases will generally be in line with 
increases awarded to other employees in the Group.
However, larger increases may be made at the discretion of the Committee to take 
into account circumstances such as:
Changes in an individual’s role or responsibility;
To reflect an individual’s progression and increase in experience in the role;
Where a salary is significantly behind market practice.
Performance Measures
The payment of salary is not subject to performance conditions. However, when 
determining salary levels the performance of Executive Directors is taken into 
account, in advance of any increases being awarded.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide Executive Directors with market competitive benefits consistent with the role.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
The Committee’s policy is to set benefits at an appropriate level taking into 
account the individual’s circumstances and market practice.
Currently, base salary for Executive Directors is supplemented with a car plus 
fuel or a cash allowance, private health insurance and life assurance as standard 
benefits.
However, the Committee may determine that additional benefits may be provided 
based on individual circumstances, such as the use of a chaffeur when it is 
considered appropriate.
In the event that an executive is required to re-locate to perform their role then 
additional benefits may be provided such as relocation expenses, a housing 
allowance and school fees.
Executives are also eligible to participate in any all-employee share plans operated 
by the Company on the same basis as other employees.
The overall level of benefits will depend on the cost of providing individual items 
and the individual’s circumstances and therefore there is no maximum level of 
benefit.
Performance Measures
None
Pensions
Purpose and link to strategy
To enable the Company to offer market competitive remuneration through the provision of additional retirement benefits.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
Defined employer contribution funding to the Halfords Pension Plan or payments 
into a personal fund up to the earnings cap as set by HMRC. Pension provisions 
above this level are made in the form of a cash allowance.
The Committee may determine that alternative arrangements should apply 
(including for new hires). When determining such arrangements the Committee 
will consider cost and market practice (subject to the overall limit set out in the 
maximum column).
The annual contribution for each individual will not exceed 20% of base salary. 
Currently the CEO receives 20% of base salary, whilst the Chief Financial Officer 
(“CFO”) receives 15% of base salary.
Performance Measures
None

Annual Bonus
Purpose and link to strategy
To incentivise executives to achieve annual financial targets and performance against key strategic objectives. The Committee may determine that an Executive Director 
may be required to defer some or all of their annual bonus into shares under the Company’s Deferred Bonus Plan to further incentivise them to manage risk and align 
their long-term interests with those of shareholders.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
The annual bonus is normally based on performance over a financial year.
The Committee determines after the year end the extent to which targets have 
been met. In certain circumstances the Committee may review the annual bonus 
payout in the context of the performance of the business during the year and the 
delivery against strategy and may amend the level of bonus payout (upwards or 
downwards) to reflect overall business and individual performance.
Generally the annual bonus is paid in cash, but in certain circumstances the 
bonus may be paid in shares or in a mixture of cash and shares as determined by 
the Committee.
Currently the CEO must defer 1/3 of any bonus earned into an award over shares 
under the Deferred Bonus Plan. However, the Committee may determine that a 
different portion of the bonus will be paid in shares or that the bonus may be paid 
in cash.
Deferred bonus awards are normally made in the form of nil cost options (but may 
be in other forms such as a conditional award). Deferred awards normally vest 
three years from award (or such other period as the Committee determines) and 
have no additional performance conditions.
Executives may, at the Committee’s discretion, receive an amount (in cash 
or shares) representing the dividends paid between the date of grant and the 
exercise of the award in respect of the number of deferred shares vesting. The 
Committee shall have the discretion to determine how the value of this dividend 
award shall be calculated, which may include the deemed reinvestment of 
dividends in shares on a cumulative basis.
Deferred awards vest three years after the date of the award. The Executive 
will also recieve an amount in cash or in shares representing the dividends paid 
between the date of the grant and the exercise of the award in respect of the 
number of shares vesting. This will include the deemed reinvestment of dividends 
in shares on a cumulative basis. 
For deferred shares granted from 2014 onwards the Committee may determine 
that the number of deferred bonus shares can be scaled back before exercise 
in the event of a material misstatement of the Company’s results, or where the 
Company has suffered serious loss or reputational damage in respect of the 
period for which the Executive had responsibilities for the running of the business.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 150% of base salary.
The current individual limits are outlined below:
  CEO: Maximum annual award 150% of base salary.
  CFO: Maximum annual award 100% of base salary.
Performance Measures
The annual bonus targets are based on a mix of financial and strategic measures. 
Measures are selected each year by the Committee to ensure continued focus 
on the Company’s strategy. At least 50% of the bonus will be based on financial 
measures.
Performance measures are set annually to ensure they are appropriately 
stretching for the delivery of threshold, target and maximum performance.
For 2014/15, the bonus will be based on performance against PBT and strategic 
objectives consistent with the Getting into Gear strategy. 
Further details are provided on page 109 of the Annual Remuneration Report.
No bonus will be paid for below threshold performance and 100% of bonus will 
be paid for achieving a stretching performance target set by the Remuneration 
Committee with reference to prior year performance and the Group’s business 
plan.

Performance Share Plan
Purpose and link to strategy
To attract and retain Executive Directors of a high calibre. To align Executive Directors’ interests with those of our shareholders by incentivising them to deliver the 
Company strategy and to create a sustainable business and maximise returns to shareholders.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
Annual awards of shares with vesting based on performance over a three-year 
period (or such other period as the Committee shall determine). The awards are 
normally made in the form of a nil-cost option award (but may be made in other 
forms such as conditional shares awards or jointly owned equity) and the vesting 
of awards to Executive Directors is subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions.
To the extent that awards granted from 2013 onwards vest in line with the 
Performance Multiplier (as defined in the next column) these share awards will 
normally only become exercisable following a retention period of two years (unless 
the Committee determines otherwise) from the point at which the Committee 
determined that the performance conditions have been met.
Executives may, at the Committee’s discretion, receive an amount (in cash 
or shares) representing the dividends paid between the date of grant and the 
exercise of the award in respect of the number of shares which have vested. The 
Committee shall have the discretion to determine how the value of this dividend 
award shall be calculated, which may include the deemed reinvestment of 
dividends in shares on a cumulative basis.
The Committee may reduce, or impose further conditions on, an award which is 
subject to a holding period in circumstances where the Committee considers it 
appropriate such as the material misstatement of the Company’s results, serious 
reputational damage to the Company or where the company suffers serious 
losses.
Maximum core award 150% of base salary.
Participants have the opportunity to earn up to 1.5 × core award for exceptional 
performance (the “Performance Multiplier”).
The maximum annual face value of awards is therefore 225% of base salary.
Performance Measures
For 2014 awards will vest subject to the achievement of stretching Revenue and 
EBITDA targets.
The vesting of 25% of the awards will be determined by the growth in the Group’s 
revenue and the vesting of 75% of the award will be determined by the growth in 
the Group’s EBITDA over a three-year performance period.
In addition to achieving these targets, the vesting of awards will be subject to 
meeting a net debt underpin to ensure that debt remains at appropriate levels and 
that management are not incentivised to deliver revenue growth at the expense of 
profitability.
The portion of the award that can be earned in relation to the revenue portion will 
be limited by the extent to which EBITDA targets are met.
30% of the award vests for entry level performance.
For details of performance conditions for awards granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 
see notes to the table.
For future awards the Committee may determine that different financial, 
operational or share price related performance measures may apply to awards or 
that a different weighting between performance measures may apply to ensure 
continued alignment with our evolving strategy. The majority of the award will be 
subject to meeting a financial performance target.
CEO Co-Investment Award
Purpose and link to strategy
The award was implemented in October 2012 as a one-off incentive to recruit and retain a high-calibre CEO, to align his interests with those of our shareholders, and to 
reward growth in share price. No further awards will be made under this plan.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
A one-off award made on the appointment of the CEO. The CEO was required to 
invest £500,000 in Halfords shares (“investment shares”) to receive a matching 
share award. 
If the CEO disposes of these investment shares during the matching share 
performance period, then the matching shares shall lapse to the extent the 
investment shares have been disposed.
The CEO was granted an award of matching shares in the form of a nil cost 
option that may vest in tranches following the Committee’s assessment of 
performance (see performance measures column).
Prior to vesting the Committee will satisfy themselves that the achievement of the 
share price targets is a genuine reflection of the Company’s underlying financial 
performance and may adjust the level of vesting accordingly.
The Committee may determine that the number of matching shares can be 
scaled back before exercise in circumstances that the Committee determines are 
appropriate such as a material misstatement of the Company’s results, serious 
reputational damage to the Company, or where the Company suffers serious 
losses.
The CEO may, at the Committee’s discretion, receive an amount (in cash or 
shares) representing the dividends paid between the date of grant and the 
exercise of the award in respect of the number of shares which vest. The value 
of this dividend award shall be calculated based on the deemed reinvestment of 
dividends in shares on a cumulative basis.
The maximum number of matching shares which may be acquired under the 
award (excluding dividend equivalents) is 3.5 times the number of investment 
shares acquired. The CEO acquired 164,056 at a price of 302.22p.
Performance Measures
Share price performance targets for November 2015, November 2016 and 
November 2017.
Share price performance will be assessed using the average mid-market closing 
share price for the 30 days following the announcement of the Interim results for 
the relevant year (normally November).
At each relevant vesting date the CEO may decide to either exercise any portion of 
the award that has vested based on performance at that time (in which case any 
unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price target has not 
been met will lapse) or roll forward that tranche in full to be subject to performance 
testing at the next vesting date. In the latter case (“roll-forward”) the Participant will 
forfeit the right to exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at the 
earlier vesting date.
30% of the award vests for achieving threshold performance.
For further details of the operation and targets please see page 106 of the Annual 
Remuneration Report.

other infor Mati on
2011 and 2012 psp awa rds perfor Man ce condition
Awards made under the PSP in 2011 and 2012 vest subject to the achievement of stretching TSR and EPS 
targets. The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Group’s relative Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) performance when measured against a general retailers’ comparator group chosen from the FTSE 
350. The vesting of the other 50% will be determined by the Group’s absolute Earnings per Share (“EPS”) 
growth performance compared against RPI over the performance period.
shareholdin G Guid elines
The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors’ interests are aligned with those of our 
shareholders to incentivise them to deliver the corporate strategy, thus creating value for all shareholders. 
Executive Directors are encouraged to acquire and retain shares with a value equal to 100% of their annual 
base salary.  Executive Directors have a five-year period to build this shareholding following their appointment. 
However, the Committee retains its discretion to extend this period in instances it considers such extension 
appropriate. Current Executive Director shareholdings are disclosed on page 107.
l eGacy awards
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office 
(including the exercise of any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding 
that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before 
the Policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company 
and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a 
director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and an award over shares is “agreed” at the time the award is granted.
Minor a MendMents
The Committee may however make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange 
control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining 
shareholder approval for that amendment. 
plan r ules
Awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan, Performance Share Plan and Co-Investment Award will be operated 
in accordance with the rules of the plans. In the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital or a 
demerger, delisting, special dividend, rights issue or other event, which may, in the Committee’s opinion, 
impact the value of awards, the terms of awards may be adjusted. In addition, the Committee may amend an 
award’s performance conditions where an event occurs which causes the Committee to reasonably consider 
that an amended performance condition would be, in the case of the PSP , a fairer measure of performance 
and a more effective incentive and, in the case of the Co-Investment Award, more appropriate and not be 
materially less difficult to satisfy. The rules may be amended in accordance with their terms.
cash
Awards may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Committee.
r eMuneration arran GeMent s in different perfor Man ce scenarios
As outlined above, the remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration is variable and performance-related. By linking the remuneration of the individual 
Executive Director to the performance of the Company, the Committee seeks, as far as possible, to motivate 
that individual towards superior business performance and shareholder value creation, and to only pay 
rewards when these goals have been realised. Performance measures are aligned with strategic goals so that 
remuneration arrangements are transparent to Directors, shareholders and other stakeholders.
The charts below illustrate remuneration arrangements in different performance scenarios. The assumptions 
for each scenario are outlined below:
Fixed Pay  Fixed pay (base salary, benefits and pension) only
Expected  Fixed pay
  On target annual bonus opportunity
  50% of core PSP award (75% of salary) 
Maximum  Fixed pay
  100% of maximum annual bonus opportunity
  1.5× the core PSP award (225% of salary)
The one-off CEO Co-Investment award has not been included in the scenario chart as there is no intention to 
grant further awards.

Annual bonus: The bonus is subject to a mix of financial and strategic measures. These measures are selected 
to provide an appropriate balance between profitability and strategic objectives and to incentivise individual 
directors to meet corporate targets and drive individual performance. Targets are set on an annual basis taking 
into account internal and external expectations of performance.
Performance Share Plan: The performance measures for 2014 awards are Group Revenue and EBITDA 
growth. Revenue growth is a clear reaction to the Getting Into Gear 2016 programme and is easily identified by 
both management and shareholders. However, in order to add value for shareholders, revenue improvements 
need to lead through to improved profitability. The majority of the PSP award is therefore subject to improved 
profit performance. Growth in EBITDA is a measure of operational profit performance and operational cash 
management, with a clear line of sight for management. Given the evolution in strategy and the consequent 
focus on investment for long term shareholder value, EBITDA is a more appropriate measure of the effective 
delivery of the strategy. At the same time, to ensure a continued focus on cash management a target/underpin 
of net debt/EBITDA has been introduced. Targets are set taking into account internal and external expectations 
of performance.
The Committee may determine that different performance measures will apply to future PSP awards.
r ecruit Ment r eMuneration poli cy 
When hiring a new Executive Director, it would be expected that the structure and quantum of the variable pay 
elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above. However, at recruitment, the Committee would 
retain the discretion to flex the balance between annual and long-term incentives and the measures used to 
assess performance for these elements, with the intention that a significant proportion would be delivered in 
shares subject and that variable pay would be subject to performance conditions. In all cases the value of any 
variable pay that will be granted in respect of an executive’s recruitment (excluding any buyout compensation 
for the ‘loss’ of existing variable remuneration benefits) will be a maximum of 375% of annual salary.
The Committee may also make arrangements to compensate the new executive for ‘loss’ of existing 
remuneration when leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee may take account of the form in 
which they were granted; any relevant performance conditions; the length of time that any relevant performance 
periods have to run; and the organisation which previously employed the Executive. The Committee will seek to 
deliver buy-out arrangements on a broadly like for like basis to those forfeited.
When determining salary levels for a new Executive Director, the Committee may set the initial salary level 
towards the lower end of market practice and may award higher salary increases in the first few years as the 
individual gains in experience to move them towards a more market normal level.
To facilitate buy-out awards outlined above, in the event of recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to 
a new Executive Director under the Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the granting of awards to facilitate, in 
unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director without seeking prior shareholder approval or 
under other relevant Company incentive plans.
In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to the Board legacy terms and conditions would normally 
be honoured, including pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.

r eMuneration arran GeMent s elsewhere in the Group
Whilst our remuneration policy follows the same principles across the Group, remuneration packages for 
colleagues reflect their different roles and experiences, and market practice for similar roles. 
The remuneration policy for senior executives in the Group is similar to the policy for Executive Directors as set 
out in this report - a substantial proportion of remuneration is performance related in order to encourage and 
reward superior business performance and shareholder returns and remuneration is linked to both individual 
and Company performance. Basic salary is targeted at normal commercial rates for comparable roles and is 
benchmarked on a regular basis. Bonuses can be earned on the same basis as the Executive Directors. Senior 
Executives immediately below Board level also benefit from participation in the PSP .
Increases to executive managers’ base salaries are considered at the same time as all other colleagues across 
the Group and increases are generally in line with all colleagues. 
All of the Group’s c.12,000 colleagues are eligible to join the Halfords Sharesave Plan (SAYE) after they have 
served one complete month’s service. At the same time they are all eligible for some form of quarterly or full 
year bonus, although the type, limits and performance conditions vary according to job level. Senior managers 
and other key management individuals are invited to join the Company Share Option Scheme.
In 2013/14 all newly appointed colleagues and other existing colleagues who had experienced a ‘joining-
trigger’ event were eligible to join the Halfords Pension Plan 2009. All members of the Pension Plan are 
required to make a minimum contribution of 3% and the Company also contributes a minimum of 3%, 
dependent on length of service and seniority. During the year the Company has met its obligations under the 
pensions auto enrolment legislation, auto enrolling all other colleagues as appropriate.
executive dire ctors’ ser vice aGree Ment s 
t er M and not ice perio ds
The Company’s policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, is that they 
should be fair to the individual, the Company and shareholders. Failure should not be rewarded and the 
departing Executive’s duty to mitigate any loss he suffers should be recognised. The Committee periodically 
reviews the Group’s policy on the duration of Executive Directors’ service agreements, and the notice periods 
and termination provisions contained in those agreements. The Company is aware that companies are 
encouraged to consider notice periods of less than 12 months, and in contracting with the CEO it was agreed 
that a notice period of six months was appropriate. The notice periods of the other Executive Directors remains 
limited to 12 months. The Committee policy is that notice period for new Executive Directors will be no more 
than 12 months. The Committee will continue to review this policy, to ensure that it remains in line with the 
Company’s overall remuneration policy

1. Andrew Findlay was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2011 and his service agreement was effective from that date.
2. Paul McClenaghan resigned on 12 April 2013.
t er Mination of contract
No compensation would be payable if a service contract were to be terminated by notice from an Executive 
Director or for lawful termination by the Company (other than as set out below). The Company may terminate 
service agreements in accordance with the appropriate notice periods. In the event of early termination (other 
than for a reason justifying summary termination in accordance with the terms of the service agreement) 
the Company may (but is not obliged to) pay to the Executive Director, in lieu of notice, a sum equal to the 
Executive Director’s then salary, benefits and pension contributions, which he would have received during the 
contractual notice period (12 months for the CFO and six months for the CEO), the sum of which shall normally 
be payable in monthly instalments.
Executive Directors who are considered to be good leavers may, if the Committee determines, receive a bonus 
for the financial year in which they leave employment. Such bonus will normally be calculated on a pro rata 
basis by reference to their period of service in the financial period in which their employment is terminated and 
performance against targets. 
Miti Gation on t er Mination
Where a contract has been terminated early the Executive Director shall use their best endeavours to secure 
an alternative source of remuneration, thus mitigating any loss to the Company, and shall provide the Board 
with evidence of such endeavours upon their reasonable request. If the Executive Director fails to provide such 
evidence the Board may cease all further payments of compensation. To the extent that the Executive Director 
receives any sums as a result of alternative employment or provision of services while he is receiving such 
payments from the Company, the payments may be reduced by the amount of such sums. In good leaver 
circumstances the Executive Director might be offered a lump sum termination payment paid at the time they 
cease employment which would normally be less than he would receive if he were to be paid his annual salary 
and benefits over 12 months (six months for the CEO).

chan Ge of cont rol
The service agreements of Executive Directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The Executive Directors’ services contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
share plans – leaver treat Ment 
The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an Executive Director ceases to hold office or employment with the Group of the Company’s associated 
companies is governed by the relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises leaver provisions under the executive share plans. 
‘Good leavers’ as determined  
by the Committee
Leavers in other circumstances  
(other than gross misconduct)
Halfords Performance Share Plan
Under the PSP “Good Leavers” include: Death, injury, 
ill-health disability, redundancy, retirement, sale of the 
individual’s employing business or company out of 
the Group or to a company which is not associated 
with the Company or in any other circumstances the 
Committee determines.
Awards may vest at the end of the performance 
period or if a retention period applies at the end of 
the retention period. The Committee will determine 
the level of vesting having due regarding to the extent 
to which the performance conditions have been met 
and unless the Committee determines otherwise 
the proportion of the performance period that had 
elapsed at leaving. 
Alternatively the Committee may determine that 
awards should vest at the time of leaving on the basis 
set out above.
The Executive has 12 months from vesting (or if later, 
his date or leaving or the end of the relevant retention 
period) to exercise options if awards are structured as 
nil-cost options.
Unvested awards normally lapse on leaving.
Awards for which the performance condition has been 
met at the time of leaving but which were subject to a 
retention period will continue to vest at the end of the 
retention period.
The Executive has 12 months from leaving, or if later, 
the end of the retention period to exercise vested 
but unexercised options (if applicable) unless the 
Committee determines otherwise.
CEO Co-Investment Award
Under the Co-Investment Plan “Good Leavers” 
include: Death, ill-health, disability or in any other 
circumstances the Committee determines.
The Committee may determine the extent to which 
matching shares vest either at the normal vesting 
date or at the time of leaving taking into account the 
extent to which the performance condition has been 
met and unless the Committee determines otherwise 
the period of time between award and the participant 
leaving.
The Executive has 12 months from vesting (or the 
date of leaving if later) to exercise matching shares.
Unvested Matching Shares normally lapse on leaving.
The Executive has 12 months to exercise any 
Matching Shares that have vested at cessation of 
their employment.
Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”)
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan “Good Leavers” 
include: Death, injury, ill-health disability, redundancy, 
retirement, sale of the individual’s employing business 
or company out of the Group or to a company which 
is not associated with the Company or in any other 
circumstances the Committee determines.
Outstanding awards vest on leaving.
The Executive has  6 months from leaving to exercise 
options (12 months in the case of death).
Awards will normally lapse unless the Committee 
determines that awards may be exercised. The 
Committee has discretion to determine the proportion 
of the award that shall vest and the period of time 
during which it may be exercised.
The leavers’ treatment under the Halfords Sharesave Scheme is determined in accordance with HMRC provisions. 
In the event of an individual’s misconduct all outstanding share awards would generally be forfeited.
chan Ge of control
In the event of a change of control of the Company, PSP awards may vest (pro-rated for time elapsed in the performance period unless the Committee determines 
otherwise) to the extent that the Committee determines the performance condition should be deemed satisfied having regarding to the Company’s progress towards 
that condition. The Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis in the event of a voluntary winding up or reconstruction of the company or a demerger 
except that in the event of a demerger [or reconstruction] the Committee may determine the extent to which awards shall be time pro-rated. 
In the event of a change of control, the co-investment award may vest to the extent the Committee determines, taking into account the extent to which the performance 
conditions have been met and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of time between grant and the relevant event and such other relevant factors 
(such as the performance of the Company) as the Committee considers appropriate. The Committee may determine that awards should vest on the same basis in the 
event of a winding-up of the Company or if the Company is affected by a demerger, de-listing, special dividend or other event which may in the Committee’s opinion 
affect the value of awards.
DBP awards may vest on a change of control, winding up or demerger of the Company.
Alternatively awards may be rolled over into equivalent awards in a different company.

Measures
Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors
To attract and 
retain high-calibre 
individuals to serve 
as Non-Executive 
Directors.
Fee levels are set to reflect the time, commitment and experience of the 
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors and taking into account fee 
levels at other companies of a similar size and complexity and to other 
UK listed retailers.
The fees of Non-Executive Directors shall normally be reviewed every 
two years to ensure that they are in line with market conditions and 
any changes to said fees will be approved by the Board as a whole 
following a recommendation from the Chief Executive.
Fees for the Company Chairman shall normally be reviewed every two 
years to ensure that they are in line with market conditions and any 
changes to said fees will be approved by the Board as a whole.
The fees are normally paid in cash quarterly but may be paid in shares  
if this is considered appropriate.
The Chairman is paid a single fee which includes his chairmanship of 
the Nomination Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a base fee plus additional fees  
for their chairmanship of a Board Committee and for the role of the 
Senior Independent Director.
Further additional fees may be paid to reflect additional time,  
committee or board responsibilities if this is considered appropriate.
The Company reimburses reasonable travel and subsistence costs.
The Chairman and Non-Executive directors do not currently receive 
other benefits but reasonable benefits may be provided in the future if 
appropriate.
Overall fees paid  
to Directors will 
remain within the 
limit stated in the 
Company’s Articles  
of Association, 
currently £600,000.
Non-Executive 
Directors and the 
Chairman are not 
entitled to participate 
in any cash or share 
incentive schemes.
None
appoint Ment
None of the Non-Executive Directors has an employment contract with the Company. However, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company 
confirming their appointment for a period of three years, unless terminated by either party giving the other not less than three months’ notice or by the Company on 
payment of fees in lieu of notice.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the policy table for Non-Executive 
Directors above. 
The appointment period for each Non-Executive Director is set out below:

t er Mination of non- executive dire ctors’ letters of appoint Ment
No compensation would be payable to a Non-Executive Director if his or her engagement were terminated as 
a result of him or her retiring by rotation at an Annual General Meeting, not being elected or re-elected at an 
Annual General Meeting or otherwise ceasing to hold office under the provisions of the Articles of Association 
of the Company. There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early termination of the 
appointment of a Non-Executive Director. 
dialo Gue with shareholders
The views of our shareholders are very important to the Committee and it is our policy to consult with our 
largest shareholders in advance of making any material changes to the executive remuneration arrangements. 
In 2013 the Committee consulted with shareholders regarding changing the performance measures for 
the PSP from TSR and EPS to Revenue and EBITDA with a net debt underpin. The Committee found the 
consultation constructive and the feedback from shareholders resulted in a change in the ratio of Revenue and 
EBITDA and the introduction of a retention period of two years for shares that vest by virtue of employing the 
performance multiplier. 
dialo Gue with e Mplo yees
The Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when considering 
pay for Executive Directors and senior management. When considering base salary increases, the Committee 
reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to other employees in the Group.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees regarding Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
However, at regular intervals the Company conducts a survey of the views of employees in respect of their 
experience of working at Halfords including their own reward.

t he coMMittee
During the year and the period to the date of this report the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) 
consisted of Keith Harris; Dennis Millard; Bill Ronald; David Adams; and Claudia Arney. Claudia Arney took 
over the Chairmanship of the Committee from Keith Harris on 1 March 2014. In this time the Committee has:
  Discussed and approved both financial and strategic annual bonus metrics and targets;
  Reviewed and set the salaries of the CEO and FD with effect from 1 October 2013;
  Reviewed and commented on the salaries and incentive arrangements for the executive management;
  Reviewed and approved the salaries and incentives arrangements for the recruitment of senior executives;
  Held discussions with shareholders and approved changes to the performance conditions for awards made 
under the Performance Share Plan from 2013 onwards;
  Measured the performance conditions of the Company Share Option Scheme (which operates for Senior 
Executives below Board level) and the Performance Share Plan awards granted in 2010, confirming that 
neither of the Schemes’ performance condition targets had been met;
  Approved grants under the Performance Share Plan, Company Share Option Scheme (to Senior Executives 
below Board level) and Sharesave Scheme;
  Approved amendments to the rules of the Company Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme in 
respect of Finance Act 2013 changes;
  Approved new rules for the Company Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme to be put before 
shareholders at the 2014 Company’s Annual General Meeting (the old plans having expired this year); 
  Reviewed and approved the Company’s Remuneration Policy and Annual Remuneration Report for placing 
before shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 29 July 2014; 
  Undertaken a review of Committee effectiveness and agreed steps to enhance effectiveness; and
  Considered and approved the Committee’s terms of reference.
advisors
During the year the Committee has been supported by Jonathan Crookall, People Director and Alex 
Henderson, Company Secretary. The CEO and CFO may also on occasion attend Committee meetings on 
the request of the Committee but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed. The Committee 
also engaged with Deloitte LLP , who has advised on performance measures for the PSP , remuneration 
reporting and other remuneration matters. Fees paid to Deloitte for this advice were £5,900. Deloitte have also 
provided advice to management as part of their support to the Committee, primarily in relation to remuneration 
reporting. A separate team within Deloitte has also provided debt advisory advice.
Deloitte are founding members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adhere to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group Code of Conduct when dealing with the Committee. The Committee considers their advice 
to be independent and impartial. The Committee is also satisfied that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner 
and team, which provided remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Halfords that 
might impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that 
there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.  
Towers Watson also provided the Committee with executive salary benchmark data. Towers Watson are also 
signatories of the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct. Fees paid to Towers Watson for this advice 
were £3,500.  
Fees for both Deloitte and Towers Watson were charged on a time and materials basis.
shareholder dialo Gue
The Committee is committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and carefully reviews voting outcomes 
on remuneration matters. In the event of a substantial vote against a resolution in relation to Directors’ 
remuneration, Halfords would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote, determine appropriate 
actions and would detail any such actions in response to it in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

salary
In keeping with its usual cycle of reviewing Company-wide salaries in September/October the Committee 
considered an executive pay report compiled for them by Towers Watson. The Committee concluded that 
the salary for the CEO was competitive and decided to increase his salary by 1.5% to £507,500 in line with 
the average increase awarded to colleagues across the business. In reviewing the Executive Directors’ 
responsibilities the Committee determined that the Group’s CFO, Andrew Findlay, had assumed Board 
responsibility for a number of additional areas of the business, most importantly that of IT. This was considered 
by the Board to be a vital role in the delivery of the Company’s Getting Into Gear programme. 
The Committee considered that Andrew Findlay’s salary did not appropriately reflect the scope and 
responsibilities of his increased role and as such the Committee considered it appropriate that he receive an 
increased salary from 1 October 2013 of £325,000 (16% increase).
2013/14 annual b on us 
Annual Bonuses for 2013/14 for Executive Directors were based 75% on Group PBT and 25% on the delivery 
of key strategic initiatives crucial to the delivery of the Company’s strategy. These initiatives included improving 
the retention rate of colleagues who had been with the business for three months; increasing the ‘value-
added’ service sales; increasing the range of parts, accessories and clothing on offer in the Company’s Cycling 
category; improving both colleague and customer engagement with the Halfords brand; and the development 
of new 50:39 store formats.

The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine the extent to which these initiatives have been achieved. In determining the outcome in relation to each  
initiative the Committee considered the following achievements: 
— Retention of Store 
Colleagues;
Reducing the number of colleagues who leave the business, as a 
percentage, within three months of their start date.
Achieved 5%
— Value Added Sales; Increasing the total incremental sales in the financial year of 3Bs fitting, other 
auto fitting, cycle repair, Sat Nav attachment and cycle accessories.
The initiatives included in this 
project led to sales increasing 
in a range in the lower half 
of the target.

— 50:39 Store Delivery. 15 stores refurbished and a blueprint established for roll out. Achieved 5%
Total Bonus 97.5%
The Committee reviewed the annual bonus payout in the context of the performance of the underlying business during the year and the delivery against strategy and 
determined that the level of bonus paid was appropriate in this context.
Bonus targets are considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they could reveal information about Halfords’ business plan and budgeting process to 
competitors which could be damaging to Halfords’ business interests and therefore to shareholders.  The Committee will look to disclose targets when they are 
considered to no longer be commercially sensitive.

TSR and EPS performance are assessed on an independent basis. However, to ensure that the PSP continues to support sustainable performance, the multiplier for 
one measure is only applied if performance is at least at the threshold level for the other measure.  
The companies included in the TSR comparator group are based on the FTSE 350 general retail and food retail companies on the date of grant.  For awards granted in 
2011 these are as follows:  
Brown Group; Carpetright; Debenhams; Dignity; Dixons Retail plc (formerly DSG International); Dunelm Group; Greggs; Home Retail Group; JD Sports Fashion plc; 
Darty (formerly Kesa Electricals); Kingfisher International; Marks & Spencer Group;  Morrison (WM); Mothercare; Next; Sainsbury (J); Sports Direct; Tesco; WH Smith.
Based on TSR performance between 2 April 2011 and 28 March 2014, Halfords’ TSR was just below median against the comparator group and therefore 0% of the 
portion of the TSR element of the award will vest.  EPS growth between FY11 and FY14 was below RPI and therefore 0% of the EPS element of the award will vest.

In addition to achieving these targets, the vesting of awards will be subject to meeting an underpin of net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater than 1.5x throughout the 
three-year performance period. This will ensure that net debt remains at appropriate levels and management is not incentivised to invest in new activities that are not 
profitable thereby increasing net debt levels to meet targets; the focus is to maximise the return on cash investments. The Core Award shares that vest will become 
exercisable in August 2016. To the extent that awards vest in line with the performance multiplier outlined above, these shares will only become exercisable in August 
2018, following a retention period of two years.

1. This award represents 3.5 times Matt Davies’ initial investment of 164,056 shares purchased at a price of £3.02 on 4 October 2012.
2. Interim and final dividends have been reinvested in shares at prices between £3.7100 and £4.6974. 
On appointment, the Company made the CEO a one-off Co-Investment Award. This Award was designed to allow the Company to recruit and retain an executive of the 
calibre required to run the business and to incentivise the CEO to deliver exceptional shareholder value creation through the achievement of share price performance 
targets. This plan was adopted for the sole purpose of making a one-off award to the Group’s new CEO. It is not anticipated that any further awards will be made under 
this Plan to either the Group’s CEO or other executives. 
perfor Mance cond itions
Under the Plan the CEO invested £500,000 into Halfords shares, acquiring 164,056 shares at 302.22p per share. The CEO was then awarded a maximum matching 
award of 3.5x the number of invested shares (574,196 shares). Subject to continued employment these shares may vest up to a third in November 2015, up to two 
thirds in November 2016 and in full in November 2017, depending on the following Threshold (30% vesting) and Maximum (100% vesting) share price performance 
targets of Halfords: 
November Threshold Maximum
2015 350p 400p
2016 385p 440p
2017 425p 485p
Share price performance will be assessed using the average mid-market closing share price for the 30 days following the announcement of the Interim results for the 
relevant year (normally November). At each relevant vesting date the CEO may decide to either exercise any portion of the award that has vested at that time (in which 
case any unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price target has not been met will lapse) or roll forward that tranche in full to be subject to 
performance testing at the next vesting date. In the latter case (“roll-forward”) the CEO will forfeit the right to exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at 
the earlier vesting date.
Matching shares were granted in the form of nil cost options. Vested options can be exercised until the 10th anniversary of the date of grant. Matching shares accrue 
additional shares related to dividends.  
Prior to vesting the Committee will satisfy themselves that the achievement of the Share Price Target is a genuine reflection of the Company’s underlying financial 
performance and may adjust the level of vesting accordingly. The Committee may determine that Matching Shares can be scaled back before exercise for 
circumstances such as material misstatement, the individual being responsible for serious reputational damage to the Company, or in circumstances where the 
Company suffers serious losses.

The Committee reviews the goals included in the strategic objectives portion of the bonus to ensure that they remain appropriate. For 2014/15 the Committee 
determined that the strategic objectives would be linked to the delivery of the Company’s goal of delivering growth in top line revenues. The Remuneration Committee 
have identified measures that it considers will measure the successful delivery of each objective and these also represent the non-financial strategic measures that will 
form part of the Executive Director’s 2014/15 annual bonus plan.
These are detailed below:
Measure Definition
Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) Improved NPS as measured by the Empathica mechanism in store. Average score over the final 3 months of the year.
Engagement Scores Improved colleague engagement scores as measured by the index achieved in the survey planned to take place in 2015.
Value Added Sales Increasing the total incremental sales in the financial year of 3Bs fitting, other auto fitting, cycle repair, Sat Nav attachment 
and cycle accessories. 
Delivering an effective economic model 
for retail stores through the 50:39 project
If the increase in the incremental sales for at least 50% of the refreshed stores collectively is in excess of 1.5% the threshold 
has been met, whilst ensuring that the balance of the portfolio also maintains postitive growth in sales. If the incremental 
sales for at least 50% of the refreshed stores collectively is in excess of 3% the maximum has been met.
Colleague Retention Reducing the number of colleagues who leave the business as a percentage within 3 months of their start date.
In determining whether any bonuses are payable the Committee retains the discretionary authority to increase or decrease the bonus to ensure that the level of bonus 
paid is appropriate in the context of performance.
The details of bonus targets is considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they could reveal information about Halfords’ business plan and budgeting 
process to competitors which could be damaging to Halfords’ business interests and therefore to shareholders.
share plans 
The Company has adopted four share plans: The Halfords Sharesave Scheme; the Halfords Company Share Option Scheme (“CSOS”), a market value share option 
plan; the Halfords Performance Share Plan (“PSP”); and the Halfords Co-Investment Plan (it is intended that no further awards will be made under this plan). Executive 
Directors do not particiapte in the CSOS.
For the Executive Directors’ the Committee intends to continue granting awards under the Performance share plan of 150% of base salary.  If exceptional performance 
is achieved up to 1.5x the core award can be earned (‘performance multiplier’).  The vesting of awards will be subject to meeting the following performance conditions:
Group Revenue Growth — 
CAGR (25% of the award)
Group EBTIDA Growth 
(75% of the award) 
Award “Multiplier” 
(up to 1.5 x initial award  
i.e. 225% of salary.)
1.5 x initial award vesting 7.5% 9.0%
Straight-line vesting Between 6.5% and 7.5% Between 7.5% and 9.0%
Core Award
(150% of salary)
100% Vesting 6.5% 7.5%
Straight-line vesting Between 5.0% and 6.5% Between 5.0% and 7.5%
30% Vesting 5.0% 5.0%%
0% Vesting Below 5.0% Below 5.0%
In addition to achieving these targets, the vesting of awards will be subject to meeting an underpin of net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater than 1.5x throughout the 
three-year performance period. This will ensure that net debt remains at appropriate levels and management is not incentivised to increase net debt levels to meet 
targets; the focus is to maximise the return on cash investments. The Core Award shares that vest will become exercisable in August 2017. To the extent that awards 
vest in line with the performance multiplier outlined above, these shares will only become exercisable in August 2019, following a retention period of two years.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders, 
the Committee is aware of shareholders’ concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards. Therefore, when reviewing remuneration 
arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution. Halfords intends to comply with the ABI guidelines relating to the 
issue of new shares for equity incentive plans. 
b enefits
The Company will continue to provide a car plus fuel or cash allowance, private health insurance and life assurance as standard benefits.  
pensions
The Company will continue to makes contributions to the Halfords Pension Plan 2009 or make payments into a personal fund, the purpose of which is to provide 
additional benefits. Contribution rates will remain at 20% for the CFO and 15% for the Finance Director.

state Ment of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the ann ual r eport and the financial state Ments
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.  Under that law they are required to prepare the 
group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group 
and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:  
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;  
  for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006.  They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s website.  Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
  the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy; and
  the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the Group taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

opinio ns and conclusions arisin G Fro m our audit
1. our opinion on the Financial statements is unmodi Fied
We have audited the financial statements of Halfords Group plc (“the 
Group”) for the year ended 28 March 2014 set out on pages 117 to 
155. In our opinion: 
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 28 March 2014 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting standards; and
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. our a ssessment o F r isks o F material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the 
risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit 
were as follows. 
Valuation of inventory within the r etail division (£150.2m)
Refer to pages 86 to 89 (Audit Committee Report), page 126 to 127 
(accounting policy) and page 138 (financial disclosures).
  t he risk – The Group holds a significant amount of inventory across 
a broad and diverse product range. Changes in consumer tastes 
and demands may mean that they cannot be sold or sales prices 
are discounted to less than the current carrying value. Estimating 
the future demand for, and hence the recoverable amount of, these 
products is inherently subjective.
  our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, amongst 
others, testing the design and effectiveness of controls over 
identifying slow moving or discontinued products and obtaining an 
understanding of the Group’s process for measuring the amount of 
provision required. These controls are designed to identify product 
lines where current sales prices do not exceed cost. The Group 
also makes provision for product lines where future sales prices 
are expected to be below current carrying value due to changes in 
customer tastes and demand. We critically assessed the Group’s 
provision for those product lines identified as slow moving, or 
potentially slow moving, by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group’s sales and purchasing plans for 2014/5 and the new product 
launches therein as well as the level of expected discounting. This 
included considering the historical accuracy of these plans and 
the level of discounting activity in previous years compared to the 
current inventory levels and committed purchases. We compared 
post year-end sales data to items within the Group’s provision and 
to information provided by Category Managers responsible for each 
product category.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures (see page 
127 and Note 12) about the degree of estimation involved in arriving at 
the provision. 
Valuation of Goodwill associated with the nationwide autocentres 
acquisition (£69.7 m)
Refer to pages 86 to 89 (Audit Committee Report), page 127 to 128 
(accounting policy) and page 136 (financial disclosures).
  t he risk – Following the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres 
in 2010, the Group has held significant goodwill in the business. 
The business operates in a competitive market and difficulties 
commercially; such as loss of a significant customer, may lead 
to a risk that the business does not meet the growth projections 
necessary to support the carrying value of the intangible asset. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting these 
cashflows, this is one of the key judgemental areas that our audit is 
concentrated on.
  our response – Our audit procedures included, amongst others, 
critically assessing the assumptions used around prospective 
trading levels through discussion with the Group, in light of market 
information around the size and age of the UK car market and 
comparison of the historical forecasting accuracy for newly opened 
Autocentres, given the proportion which have recently been opened. 
We also assessed the Group’s performance against budget in 
the current and prior periods to evaluate the historical accuracy 
of forecasts. We used break even analysis to determine the key 
sensitivities within the budgeting model, which we considered to 
be the discount rate and the growth rate. Our internal valuation 
specialists assessed the discount rate, which included an adjustment 
for forecasting risk, by benchmarking the rate against external 
market data and the Group’s financial position. We have assessed 
the continuing improvement in customer retention, a key factor in the 
growth rate, through the externally generated Net Promoter Score 
(NPS) and the operational focus on customer service within the 
business.
We considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures (see Note 10) 
about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions. 
3. our a pplication o F materiality and an o Ver View o F t he scope o F 
our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £5.0m. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before taxation (of which it represents 6.9%) which we 
consider to be one of the principal considerations for members of the  
Company in assessing the financial performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected and 
uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value 
in excess of £0.3m in addition to other audit misstatements below that 
threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group audit team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a 
single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was performed 
using the materiality levels set out above and covered 100% of total 
Group revenue, Group profit before taxation, and total Group assets.

4. our opinion on other matters prescribed by the companies act 
2006 is unmodi Fied
In our opinion: 
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and 
  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
5. we ha Ve no thin G t o report in respect o F t he matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a 
material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
  we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken 
as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy; or
  the Audit Committee report, as set out on pages 86 to 89 does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion: 
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
  the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or 
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
  the Directors’ statement, set out on page 74, in relation to going 
concern; 
  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 76 to 85 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the ten provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
scope o F report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set 
out on page 111, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.
uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members as a body and is subject to important explanations and 
disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2013a, which are incorporated 
into this report as if set out in full and should be read to provide 
an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have 
undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

General inForm ation
Halfords Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the period 
ended 28 March 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
statement oF compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(“adopted IFRSs”).
basis o F pre paration
The consolidated financial statements of Halfords Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) are prepared on a going 
concern basis for the reasons set out in the Directors’ Report on page 74, and under the historical cost convention, except where adopted 
IFRSs require an alternative treatment. The principal variations relate to financial instruments (IAS 39 “Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement”) and share based payments (IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”). 
The financial statements are presented in millions of UK pounds, rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
The accounts of the Group are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements for 
the current period cover the 52 weeks to 28 March 2014, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013. 
basis o F cons olidation
subsidiary unde rtakin Gs 
Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be consolidated from the 
date that the Group no longer has control. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company. All subsidiary undertakings have 
been consolidated.
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company at 28 March 2014 are detailed in note 4 to the Company balance sheet on page 153.
busi ness combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the 
Group’s interest in the net fair value of these elements exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
r eVenue r eco Gnit ion
r etail 
Retail revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, promotions and 
returns. Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer 
and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue on goods delivered is recognised when the customer accepts delivery and on 
services when those services have been rendered.
car ser Vici nG
Car Servicing revenue comprises the provision of servicing to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates and promotions. Revenue is 
recognised at the point at which those services have been rendered. 
promot ions and r eturns
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods and services being sold at a discount to standard retail price. 
Revenue is adjusted to show sales net of all related discounts. A provision for estimated returns is made representing the profit on goods sold 
during the year which are expected to be returned and refunded after the year end based on past experience. Revenue is reduced by the value of 
sales returns provided for during the year.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Income is recognised, as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest rate 
method.
non-recurrin G it ems
Non-recurring items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence. The Group’s management consider that these 
items should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.

earnin Gs per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted 
for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share 
options granted to employees.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items. A reconciliation of 
this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 9.
Forei Gn currency t ra nslation
Functional and presen tation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency, and are rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound. Items included in the financial statements of 
the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
t ran sactions and balan ces
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to 
effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated at the exchange rate at the 
date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences 
arising on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to sterling at an average exchange rate. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
employee beneFit s
i) pensions
The Halfords Pension Plan is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor 
independently. The Group pays fixed contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The costs of contributions to 
the scheme are charged to the income statement in the period that they arise.
ii) share based pay ment t ra nsactions
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair values are 
determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and incorporate an assessment of relevant market performance conditions.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision 
of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
t axation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted, 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an entity 
when it recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying 
amount.
The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount, less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future periods. 
In the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the revenue that 
will not be taxable in future periods.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not 
accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred asset is realised or the deferred 
taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.

diVidends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim equity 
dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
intan Gible ass ets
i) Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. An impairment charge is recognised in profit or loss for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill 
exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
For acquisitions prior to 3 April 2010 costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration payable when calculating 
goodwill. Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and goodwill, are made at each reporting date until the 
consideration is finally determined.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of ‘Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2009)’. For these acquisitions transaction costs, 
other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable will be 
recognised in profit or loss.
ii) compu ter soFtw are
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits 
beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. These intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Software is amortised over three to five years depending on the estimated useful economic life.
iii) acq uired int an Gible ass ets
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, provided they are 
identifiable and capable of reliable measurement. 
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the 
date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied 
in the asset. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
  Brand names and trademarks 2 years;
  Customer relationships 5 to 15 years; and
  Favourable leases over the term of the lease.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.
property, pla nt and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives as follows:
  Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease to a maximum of 25 years;
  Motor vehicles are depreciated over 3 years;
  Fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 4 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
  Computer equipment is depreciated over 3 years; and
  Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is expensed to the income statement within operating expenses.
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. 
impairment o F asse ts
Tangible and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units). For goodwill, an annual impairment review is performed at each balance sheet date.

l eases
Finance l eases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element of the rental is charged 
to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for  
each period. 
operatin G l eases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The benefit of incentives 
from lessors is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
l an dlord surren der pay ments
Payments received from landlords in respect of the surrender of all or part of units previously occupied by the Group that do not represent 
an incentive for future rental commitments are recognised in the income statement on the exchange of contracts, where there are no further 
substantial acts to complete.
sublease inc ome
The Group leases properties from which it no longer trades. These properties are often sublet to third parties. Rents receivable are recognised by 
offsetting the income against rental costs accounted for within selling and distribution costs in the income statement.
inVentories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in inventories, adjusted for rebates, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location.
pro Visions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
Details of the provisions recognised and the significant estimates and judgements can be seen in note 17.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is certain.
A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost 
of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any 
impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. The main uncertainty is the timing of the amounts payable, and the time value of 
money has been incorporated in to the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
Provision is also made for loss-making stores and autocentres which management does not expect to become profitable.
A rent review provision is recognised when there is expected to be additional obligations as a result of the rent review, which forms part of the 
Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease contracts. The provision is based on managements’ best estimate of the rent 
payable after the review. Key uncertainties are the estimate of the rent payable after the review has occurred.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is future obligation relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties. The provision is based 
on managements’ best estimate of the obligation which forms part of the Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease 
contracts. Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due.
Financial instr uments
Financial ass ets
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. All financial assets are recognised when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
i) t rade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses. 
ii) cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts in 
addition to the definition above.

126 23157.04 Proof 6  21-05-2014
Financial l iabilities and equit y
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
i) bank borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Finance cost comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and the cost of forward foreign exchange 
contracts. 
ii) t rade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
iii) equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs. Own shares consist of shares 
held within an employee benefit trust and are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for 
the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue 
reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on transactions in own shares held.
iv) derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase of 
overseas sourced products. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group uses the derivatives 
to hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The effective 
element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and recognised in the Group Income 
Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. Any element of the 
remeasurement of the derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Group  
Income Statement within finance income or costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than  
12 months or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
estimates and Jud Gements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis 
of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from the estimates.
The judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are 
detailed below:
impairment o F asse ts
Goodwill and other assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their 
recoverable value may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which 
includes management assumptions and estimates of future performance. Details of the assumptions used in the impairment review of goodwill and 
other assets are explained in note 10.
all owances aGainst the car ryin G Value o F inVentories
The Group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value. In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the Group is required to make judgements as to future demand 
requirements and to compare these with the current or committed inventory levels. Assumptions have been made relating to the timing and 
success of product ranges, which would impact estimated demand and selling prices.
Sensitivities to the assumptions for specific product lines are not expected by management to result in a material change in the overall allowances.

intan Gible ass et Valuations
The measurement of fair values on a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities. The key judgements involved are the identification of which intangible assets meet the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38, 
the fair values attributable to those intangible assets, excluding any buyer-specific synergies, and the useful lives of individual intangible assets. The 
useful lives of intangibles assets relating to customer relationships involves judgement as to customer retention rates applicable. 
The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities can be seen in the notes to the financial statements on pages 129 to 155.
adoption o F new and re Vised standards
The following standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and have been adopted in the current period as they are mandatory for the 
year ended 28 March 2014 but either have no material impact on the result or net assets of the Group or are not applicable.
  IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ — provides a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure 
requirements for use across IFRSs.
  IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (Amendment) — the amendments introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive 
income. Items that could be reclassified (or recycled) to profit or loss at a future point in time now have to be presented separately from items 
that will never be reclassified. 
new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet been 
applied by the Group in these financial statements. The Group does not believe the adoption of these standards or interpretations would have a 
material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
  IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ replaces the guidance of control and consolidation in IAS 27 and SIC 32: Consolidation – special 
purpose entities. The core principle that a consolidated entity presents a parent and its subsidiaries as if they were a single entity remains 
unchanged, as do the mechanics of the consolidation.
  IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ requires joint arrangements to be accounted for as a joint operation or as a joint venture depending on the rights 
and obligation of each party to the arrangement. Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will be eliminated and equity accounting will be 
mandatory.
  IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ requires enhanced disclosures of the nature, risks and financial effects associated with the 
Group’s interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated structures entities.
  IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments – presentation’ (Amendment) — the amendment clarifies the offsetting criteria, specifically: when an entity currently 
has a legal right of set-off; and when gross settlement is equivalent to net settlement.
  IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ (Amendment) — the amendment clarifies the requirements of IAS 34 relating to segment information for total 
assets and liabilities for each reportable segment to enhance consistency with the requirements in IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’.
  IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ (Amendment) — the amendments reverse the unintended requirement in IFRS 13 to disclose the recoverable 
amount of every cash-generating unit to which significant goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets have been allocated. Under the 
amendments, recoverable amount is required to be disclosed only when an impairment loss has been recognised or reversed.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS have been endorsed by the EU 
but not yet adopted. None of these amendments are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

1.  operatin G seGments
The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Group’s strategic business units. Car Servicing became a 
reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010. The strategic business units 
offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing 
strategies. 
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores. The 
operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from autocentres. 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors. Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the 
Executive Directors on a monthly basis. Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit. Management believes 
that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions. 
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. Performance is measured based on segment 
operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors. These internal reports are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements. 
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK. The 
Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major 
customer or group of customers. All revenue is from external customers.

(a) A non-recurring expense of £7.5m was incurred in 2011. This expense related to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities 
arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989. The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased 
by Payless DIY (now part of Focus DIY) when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under ownership of the Ward White Group. Focus DIY 
entered into administration in May 2011. In the current year the continued settlement of the Group’s guarantor obligations has resulted in 
a release of £0.2m (2013: £1.0m) of the original amounts provided.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012) and to 23% (effective 1 April 2013) were substantively 
enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively. Further reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from  
1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred 
tax asset at 28 March 2014 has been calculated based on the rates of 20% and 21% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax standard rate was 23% (2013: 24%). 
The effective tax rate of 23.5% (2013: 25.7%) is higher than the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation 
charged on capital expenditure and other permanent differences arising in the period.
The tax charge of £17.1m (2013: £18.3m) includes a charge of £0.1m (2013: £0.1m charge) in respect of tax on non-recurring items, as 
detailed in note 5.
An Income tax credit of £0.8m (2013: £0.7m charge) on other comprehensive income relates to the movement in fair value of forward 
currency contracts outstanding at the year end. No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally, where it trades and sources products, and 
is considered low risk by HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”). The Group is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment reporting 
obligations thoughout the business.
In FY14 the contribution to the UK Exchequer from both taxes paid and collected exceeded £157.9m with the main taxes including 
corporation tax £35.3m, net VAT £49.8m, PAYE £17.1m, Employees National Insurance Contributions £8.8m, Employers National Insurance 
Contributions £11.2m and Business Rates £35.6m.

9. earnin Gs per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note 20) 
and has been adjusted for the issue/purchase of shares during the period. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price 
of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 28 March 2014. 
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items because it 
better reflects the Group’s underlying performance.

Included in computer software are internally generated assets of £0.3m (2013: £0.3m). Product rights of £0.2m, which are fully amortised, 
have been included within Brand names and trademarks.
Goodwill of £253.1m (2013: £253.1m) arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is 
allocated to the Retail segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a 
group of cash-generating units. Goodwill of £69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated 
to the car servicing segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a 
group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing. 
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to (a) future income to be generated from new retail, fleet 
customer contracts and related relationships, (b) the workforce, (c) the value of immaterial other intangible assets and (d) operating synergies. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, 
being Retail and Car Servicing. This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, 
which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments as reported in note 1. These calculations use cash flow projections based on 
financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration 
of all available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment. 
The key assumptions, to which the Group of cash-generating units recoverable amounts are most sensitive, used to determine value-in-use of 
goodwill held at 28 March 2014 and 29 March 2013 are as follows:
Retail Car Servicing
Note 2014 2013 2014 2013
Discount rate 1 7.9% 8.1% 10.3% 9.0%
Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 1.0% 1.0%
Notes:
1. Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
2. Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a +/- 1.0% change in the discount rate, 
would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.

The Group does not have any individually significant customers and so no significant concentration of credit risk.
Based on historic default rates and extensive analysis of the underlying customers’ credit ratings, the Group believes that no impairment 
allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Financial assets in the scope of 
IAS 39 include all trade receivables and £4.3m (2013: £6.2m) of other receivables.

The Group’s current debt facility came into effect from 11 September 2013 and is a four-year £200m revolving credit facility starting from that 
date (with an option to extend by a further year). The facility carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin which is variable based on gearing 
measures as set out in the facility covenant certificate and which is currently 150 basis points. Both utilisation and non-utilisation fees are also 
applicable being charged when utilisation of the facility rises above a set percentage with non-utilisation based on a set percentage of the 
applicable margin. These charges are based on market rates as are the commitment fees as mentioned below.

non-recurring costs (note 5) relating to liabilities in respect of previous assignments of leases where the lessee has entered into administration 
subsequent to the period end. In the current year a change in approach to settling the Group’s guarantor obligations has resulted in a release 
of £0.2m (2013: £1.0m) of the original amounts provided.
Other trading provisions comprise a sales returns provision, a provision for the costs associated with the cessation of the stand-alone cycle 
concept, including closure of stores where necessary, an employer/product liability provision and provision for unused gift vouchers.
Provisions have been transferred out of accruals in the year where the nature of the liability has changed due to less certainty over the timing 
and amount likely to be settled.

t reasury polic y
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
  Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
  Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
  Invest surplus cash; 
  Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group, and
  Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Chief Financial Officer (“FD”). The FD controls policy and performance through the line 
management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets regularly to 
monitor the performance of the Treasury function. 
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at 
a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group. Details of the Group’s current borrowing facilities are 
contained in note 15.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
mark et r isk
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk. These are discussed further below. 
Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation. The 
Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced 
by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
inter est r ate r isk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants. The 
Group’s borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market. 
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings (i.e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates) were to 
change by + or – 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease/increase of £0.6m (2013: £1.0m).
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do 
not present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet.
capi tal risk mana Gement
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. These ratios are net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and 
Amortisation (“EBITDA”) and fixed charge cover. Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple 
of interest and operating lease charges. The Group also uses a ratio of lease adjusted net debt to EBITDA; this is calculated as being net debt 
and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges. 
Fair Value disclosures
The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions:
Trade receivables, trade payables and finance 
lease obligations, short-term deposits and 
borrowings
The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these 
instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease obligations.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in 
the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates 
at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting date and the 
outright contract rate.

19.  Financial ins truments and r el ated disclosures continued Fair Value hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
  Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
 2014
£m
 2013
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 5.3 7.9
Loans and receivables 20.6 22.3

Finance leases (10.9) (11.2)
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging (liabilities) (2.1) (0.2)
Total financial liabilities (234.7) (237.0)
Trade and other payables within the scope of IAS 39 include all trade payables, all other payables and £41.3m (2013: £30.6m) of accruals and 
deferred income.
cr edit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
was £25.9m (2013: £32.1m) as detailed in the table above.
Forei Gn cu rrency risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US dollars. The Group’s policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual 
costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% (excluding increases in the base cost of the product). 
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 28 March 2014, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% 
and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis. Hedging is performed through the use of foreign 
currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows:

A strengthening/weakening of sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 28 March 2014 would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit 
or loss by the amounts shown above. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to 
be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain 
constant. 
There are no material movements in the income statement. The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Group’s 
forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases. 
pension l iability r isk
The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect 
of such a scheme. The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
l iquidity risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient 
cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. The minimum liquidity level is 
currently set at £30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be £170m of the £200m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers 
of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an ‘A-’ credit rating at the time of refinancing 
(September 2013). Ancillary business is currently being tendered with the five banks within the new club banking group. Following the 
completion of the refinancing, at the year-end the banks within this new group maintained a credit rating of A- or above, in line with Treasury 
policy. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews 
credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities 
to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would 
lead to an “Event of Default”. Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the club bank agent. There have been no breaches of covenants 
during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 11. All trade and other payables are due within one year.

21.  share based payments
The Group has four share award plans, all of which are equity-settled schemes:
1. hal For ds compa ny share opt ion sch eme
The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price 
equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three year performance 
condition. For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share (“EPS”) over the 
period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus 3.5% per year. In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, 
the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year. Exercise of an option is subject to continued 
employment. 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004. The expected life is the 
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. 
2. hal For ds shares aVe sch eme
The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service. Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder 
completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter. Special provisions allow early exercise 
in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is 
transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. 
3. per For mance share pla n
The introduction of a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive 
Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares. Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Company’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. The 
vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance and the vesting of the 
other 50% by the Company’s absolute EPS performance against RPI. The Company’s TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 
350 general retailers as a comparator group. No retesting will be permitted. 
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte. The Deloitte model uses 
the Group’s share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather 
than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte 
Carlo model. 
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest 
in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares. This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive 
remuneration. Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2010, 2011 and 2012 under the Performance Share Plan earned final 
dividends of 9.1p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £3.71 per share. Shares awarded in 2011, 2012 and 2013 under the 
PSP earned interim dividends of 5.2p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £4.70 per share.
Changes to the performance criteria of the PSP in relation to the awards granted during the 28 March 2014 year have been made by the 
Remuneration Committee. These changes have been made in order to create better alignment with the Company’s three-year strategic 
priorities following the Getting Into Gear programme. The awards are weighted 25% towards Group revenue growth targets and 75% towards 
Group EBITDA growth targets. The core award remains at 150% of base salary with a multiplier being introduced of 1.5x the core award if 
exceptional levels of performance are achieved. The shares vesting as part of this multiplier calculation will attract a retention period of two 
years. In order to focus management the awards will be underpinned by a minimum Group EBITDA, and a net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater 
than 1.5x throughout the three-year performance period. 
4. co-inVestment share pla n
In 2012 the Company adopted the Halfords Group plc 2012 Co-Investment Plan. This plan was adopted for the sole purpose of making a 
one-off award to the Group’s new CEO. No further awards either to the Group’s CEO or other executives will be made under this plan. 
On 4 October 2012 the new CEO purchased 164,056 Halfords Group plc shares at a price of 302.22 pence per share and will be entitled to

21.  share based payments continued Matching Shares have been granted in the form of nil cost options, with the participant having until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant 
to exercise the options, and will lapse on a pro rata basis if the required number of Investment Shares is not retained to the final vesting date.
At each relevant vesting date the participant may decide to exercise any portion of the award that has vested based on the performance 
at that time (in which case any unvested shares in that tranche in respect of which the share price target has not been met will lapse) or roll 
forward that tranche in full subject to performance testing at the next vesting date. In the latter case the participant will forfeit the right to 
exercise any awards that had become capable of vesting at the earlier vesting date. 
The Participant will be entitled to receive an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid either in cash or on a reinvested 
basis in shares during the period from grant to exercise in respect of the number of Matching Shares that vest.
The Barrier Black–Scholes Model is an adapted Black–Scholes Model and is used to calculate the estimated fair values of the Co-Investment 
Plan Options to include the impact of the share price based performance conditions. Using this method the fair value of the options at the 
time of grant was estimated to be £1.35 per share. 
The Group Income Statement charge recognised in respect of share-based payments for the current period is £1.0m (2013: £0.1m).
The following tables reconcile the number of share options outstanding and the weighted average exercise price (WAEP) for all share award 
plans except for the Co-Investment Plan, details of which are covered above.

23.  pensions
Employees are offered membership of the Halfords Pension, which is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual 
pension policy, which they monitor independently. The costs of contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement in the 
period that they arise. The contributions to the scheme for the period amounted to £3.6m (2013: £3.0m).
In accordance with Government initiatives Halfords has implemented an automatic enrolment process with regards to its pension 
arrangements. Employees who are aged between 22 and state pension age, earn more than £10,000 a year, and work in the UK will be 
automatically enrolled into the Group pension arrangement. Employees retain the right to withdraw from this pension arrangement; however, 
election of this choice must be made.
24.  contin Gent l iabilities 
The Group’s banking arrangements include the facility for the bank to provide a number of guarantees in respect of liabilities owed by the 
Group during the course of its trading. In the event of any amount being immediately payable under the guarantee, the bank has the right to 
recover the sum in full from the Group. The total amount of guarantees in place at 28 March 2014 amounted to £5.3m (2013: £4.1m).
The Group’s banking arrangements are subject to a netting facility whereby credit balances may be offset against the indebtedness of other 
Group companies.

basis o F pre paration
The accounts of the Company are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements 
for the current period cover the 52 weeks to 28 March 2014, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 29 March 2013. The 
accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except where Financial Reporting Standards require an alternative treatment in 
accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out below. The principal 
variation to the historical cost convention relates to share based payments 
A consolidated cash flow statement has been included in the Halfords Group plc consolidated accounts. The Company has therefore taken 
advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 (revised 1996) “Cash flow statements” not to produce a cash flow statement. 
EBTs are accounted for under UITF 32 and are consolidated on the basis that the parent has control, thus the assets and liabilities of the EBT are 
included on the Company balance sheet and shares held by the EBT in the Company are presented as a deduction from equity.
The Company has taken the available exemption not to provide disclosures required by FRS 29 “Financial instruments: disclosures”.
share based pay ments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans that are awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiary 
undertakings.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 44 ‘FRS 20 (IFRS 2) — Group and treasury share transactions’ the fair value of the employee services received 
under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the subsidiary undertaking’s financial statements, which benefit from the employee services. 
The Company has recognised the fair value of the share based payments as an increase to equity with a corresponding adjustment to investments.
Fair values are determined using appropriate option pricing models. The total fair value recognised is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for 
which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is 
based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised as an adjustment to equity, with a corresponding adjustment to investments, over the remaining 
vesting period. 
inVestments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the original cost of the investments. Provision is made against cost where, in the opinion of the 
directors, the value of the investments has been impaired.
diVidends
Final dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim 
equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.

Impairment in Jersey companies (a) (278.6)
At 28 March 2014 295.4
(a) The impairment in Jersey companies has occurred as a result of Group restructuring as explained below. This impairment relates to the 
distribution in specie of loans that had previously been issued by Halfords Finco (Jersey) Limited to Halfords Group plc. Halfords Group 
plc therefore now records the £278.6m as an intercompany receivable as shown in note 5.
During the year the Group began an exercise in order to restructure the underlying companies of the Group. This exercise led to a delisting of 
the Eurobonds issued by Halfords Finco (Jersey) Limited to Halfords Holdings (2006) Limited and Halfords Finance Limited and a distribution 
in specie of these loans up to Halfords Group plc, as well as the winding up of Halfords Finance UK LLP . Subsequent to the year end the 
intention of the Group is to wind up the two Ireco companies as well as the Jersey companies.
The investments represent shares in the following subsidiary undertakings as at 28 March 2014 and the fair value of share based 
compensation plans that are awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings. The Company has taken advantage of 
Section 410(2) of the Companies Act 2006 to list only its principal subsidiary and associated undertakings at 28 March 2014. All of these

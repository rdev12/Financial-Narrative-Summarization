Diploma PLC uses alternative performance 
measures as key financial indicators to assess the 
underlying performance of the Group. These 
include adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit 
before tax, adjusted earnings per share, free cash 
flow, trading capital employed and return on 
adjusted trading capital employed (“ROATCE”). 
The narrative in the Annual Report & Accounts  
is based on these alternative measures and  
an explanation is set out in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements included  
in the Annual Report & Accounts on page 68. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 02
Chairman’s Statement
Strong growth in  
shareholder value
benefited from a contribution of £2.4m 
from acquisitions completed in the year 
and £2.7m from currency effects on 
translation. Adjusted operating margins 
reduced to 17.2% (2015: 18.1%) reflecting 
a further impact on gross margins in 
the Canadian and Australian Healthcare 
businesses from transactional currency 
effects because of the weaker Canadian 
and Australian dollars. Adjusted profit 
before tax increased by 9% to £64.9m 
(2015: £59.6m) and adjusted earnings 
per share (“EPS”) increased by 10% to 
41.9p (2015: 38.2p), reflecting a slight 
decrease in the effective tax rate.
The Group again generated very strong 
free cash flow of £59.0m (2015: £40.3m) 
which included a cash inflow of £6.3m 
from reduced working capital and 
£4.6m of cash realised on the sale of 
assets. Capital expenditure reduced this 
year to £3.7m (2015: £4.3m) reflecting 
lower investment in Healthcare field 
equipment as Canadian hospitals sought 
to limit their expenditure this year. 
It was another good year for acquisition 
activity with investment of £32.7m 
(2015: £37.8m) in new businesses 
during the financial year, extending 
the Group’s activities into new 
products and geographies in line 
with our strategic objectives.
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong 
and after investing £32.7m in acquisitions 
and making distributions to shareholders 
of £21.0m (2015: £19.7m), the Group’s net 
cash funds increased by £7.6m to £10.6m 
at 30 September 2016 (2015: £3.0m). 
Dividends
The excellent free cash flow, helped 
by the cash received from the sale 
of assets this year, together with a 
positive acquisition environment, 
has led the Board to recommend an 
increase in the final dividend of 11% to 
13.8p per share (2015: 12.4p). Subject 
to shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, this dividend will be 
paid on 25 January 2017 to shareholders 
on the register at 2 December 2016.
The total dividend per share for the 
year will be 20.0p (2015: 18.2p) which 
represents a 10% increase on 2015. 
The dividend is well covered by 
adjusted EPS at 2.1 times, in line with 
the Board’s objective of targeting 
towards a two times level of cover.
The Group achieved a strong performance 
this year against a background of political 
volatility and challenging economic 
conditions in a number of our markets. 
Diploma has a long track record of 
consistent delivery and against this 
difficult market backdrop our aims and 
objectives remain unchanged. The 
Board remains focused on executing 
the Group’s established strategy which 
is designed to deliver strong, double-
digit growth in earnings and shareholder 
value over the economic cycle.
Faced with a low growth economic 
environment, the achievement of the 
Group’s objectives this year has been 
driven by its success in executing its 
acquisition strategy and bringing carefully 
selected businesses into the Group, 
financed by strong cash generation and 
supported by a robust balance sheet. 
Results
Group revenues increased in 2016 by 
15% to £382.6m (2015: £333.8m), with 
acquisitions completed during the 
year contributing £16.3m and currency 
movements boosting the revenues 
of the overseas businesses when 
translated into UK sterling by £13.8m, 
when compared with last year. After 
adjusting for the contribution from 
acquisitions completed both this year 
and last year and for currency effects on 
translation, Group revenues increased 
by 3% on an underlying basis. Steady 
underlying revenue growth of 4% in 
both the Life Sciences and Controls 
Sectors more than offset a weaker 
performance from the Seals Sector where 
underlying revenues increased by 1%.
Adjusted operating profit increased 
by 9% to £65.7m (2015: £60.3m) and 
Governance
Early in the year, we saw the retirement 
of Iain Henderson and Marie-Louise 
Clayton and the introduction of the 
Executive Management Group, which 
completed the process of developing 
and refreshing the Board. The Group is 
benefitting from the guidance and support 
of this strong and experienced team as it 
pursues the successful implementation 
of the Group’s growth strategy. 
 
Employees
The energy and commitment of our 
employees is a critical factor in the success 
of our Group. On behalf of the Board 
I wish to thank our employees for their 
commitment and hard work during this 
year. I remain confident of their ability to 
continue to respond to the new challenges 
which we will face in the coming year. 
Outlook
Diploma has a strong and resilient 
business model with a broad geographic 
spread of businesses, supported by a 
robust balance sheet and consistently 
high free cash flow. This model has 
delivered a strong result this year 
benefitting from a good contribution 
from acquisitions and boosted by a 
currency tailwind in the final quarter.
 
Despite the current macroeconomic 
uncertainty in the global environment, 
the Board remains confident that the 
Group will continue to make further 
progress in the coming year from 
a combination of steady GDP plus 
organic growth and a strong and 
successful acquisition programme.

Chief Executive’s Review
Building larger , broader 
based businesses
This year, underlying organic revenue 
growth has again been hard won against 
a background of challenging market 
conditions across all three Sectors and 
across all geographies served. Total 
revenue grew by 15%, of which 3% 
was underlying organic growth, with 
the balance coming from acquisitions 
and translational currency benefits. 
This continues a trend over five years 
of 11% compound annual revenue 
growth, with an average of 4% p.a. 
underlying organic revenue growth. 
Adjusted operating margins this year 
were 17.2% of revenue, compared with 
a five-year average of 18.6% and as 
always there were a number of factors 
impacting the Group’s margin. Margins 
were negatively impacted again this 
year by transactional currency effects 
in the Healthcare businesses, initial 
dilution from acquired businesses and 
reduced operating leverage in a lower 
growth environment. The Group’s 
medium term target for operating 
margin, in an improved economic 
environment, remains 18–19%.
Agility and responsiveness in the 
businesses ensure close management of 
operating costs and working capital and 
deliver strong free cash flow. This year, 
free cash flow was very strong at £59.0m, 
which represented 124% of adjusted 
earnings, compared with an average 
of 96% over the last five years. The 
principal driver of the strong cash flow 
this year, was the close management 
of working capital which was managed 
back down to 16.6% of revenues by the 
year end, compared with a five-year 
average of 16–17%. In addition, free 
cash flow benefited this year from the 
sale of the Medivators product line and 
the sale of certain legacy properties. 
Growth strategy
Overall growth is accelerated from 
the underlying GDP plus levels to the 
corporate target of strong, double-digit 
growth, through carefully selected, 
value enhancing acquisitions which 
fit the business model and offer 
entry into new strategic markets. 
Acquisitions are not made just to add 
revenue and profit, but rather to bring 
into the Group successful businesses 
which have growth potential, capable 
management and a good track record of 
profitable growth and cash generation. 
As part of our Acquire, Build, Grow 
strategy, we invest in the businesses 
post-acquisition to build a firm foundation 
to allow them to move to a new level of 
growth. These acquisitions form a critical 
part of our Sector growth strategies 
and are designed to generate a pre-tax 
return on investment of at least 20% 
and hence support our Group objectives 
for return on total investment. 
Group strategy and corporate objectives
The Group’s strategy is designed to 
generate strong growth in earnings and 
shareholder value over the business 
cycle, by building larger, broader-based 
businesses in the three Group Sectors 
of Life Sciences, Seals and Controls. 
The Group’s principal corporate 
objectives are to achieve double-digit 
growth in adjusted earnings per share 
(“EPS”) over the business cycle, to 
generate total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
growth in the upper quartile of the FTSE 
250 and to deliver progressive dividend 
growth with two times dividend cover. 
This year the Group delivered 10% 
growth in adjusted EPS, with modest 
underlying organic growth boosted by 
a good contribution from acquisitions 
completed over the last 18 months and 
from translational currency benefits. TSR 
growth this year has been 36%, which 
compares with a 4% increase in the 
median and a 23% increase in the upper 
quartile TSR performance of the FTSE 
250 index (excluding Investment Trusts). 
Dividends have increased progressively 
in each of the last 17 years and this year 
the dividend has increased by 10%, 
covered 2.1 times by adjusted EPS. 
Business model
Our businesses target GDP plus levels 
of organic revenue growth over the 
business cycle. Stable and resilient 
revenue growth is achieved through 
our focus on essential products and 
services funded by customers’ operating 
rather than capital budgets and supplied 
across a range of specialised industry 
segments. By supplying essential 
solutions, not just products, we build 
strong long term relationships with our 
customers and suppliers, which support 
sustainable and attractive margins. 
Finally, we encourage an entrepreneurial 
culture in our businesses through our 
decentralised management structure 
and these essential values ensure that 
decisions are made close to the customer 
and that the businesses are agile and 
responsive to changes in the market 
and the competitive environment.
The key performance indicators 
(“KPIs”) we use to measure the success 
of the business model relate to 
recurring income and stable revenue 
growth, sustainable and attractive 
margins and strong cash flow.
“The Group’s strategy, 
consistently applied, 
delivers strong growth 
in earnings and 
shareholder value.” Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 07
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
For more information, please visit:  
www.diplomaplc.com/investor-relations.aspx
Again we measure the success of the 
growth strategy with KPIs, the first of 
which is acquisition spend. To achieve 
the Group’s objective of strong double-
digit growth, acquisition spend at the 
level of ca.£30m p.a. is targeted. This 
year, the Group continued to benefit 
from a positive acquisition environment 
and invested ca.£33m in acquisitions, 
bringing the average over three years 
to ca.£30m p.a. The acquisitions 
completed over the last three years 
contributed 20% of 2016 revenues. 
The Group’s return on total investment 
measure is the pre-tax return on adjusted 
trading capital employed, excluding 
net cash, but including all goodwill and 
acquired intangible assets (“ROATCE”). 
This is used to measure the overall 
performance of the Group and very 
importantly, our success in creating value 
for shareholders through our acquisition 
programme. Over the last five years, 
ROATCE has comfortably exceeded the 
20% target and this year was 21.1%.
Management strength
The success of the Group is built upon 
strong, self-standing management teams 
in the operating businesses, making 
decisions close to the customer and 
agile and responsive to changes in the 
market and competitive environment. 
The Group places very high importance 
on planning the development, motivation 
and reward structures for the ca.90 
senior managers which make up 
the senior management cadre. This 
group has an average age of 47 and an 
average length of service of 11 years.
Although we place high importance on 
our decentralised organisation and the 
entrepreneurial culture this encourages, 
we also recognise that there are 
significant synergy benefits which can 
be achieved through managing clusters 
of similar businesses. Typically these 
synergies come in the form of cross-
selling and joint purchasing between 
the businesses and shared back-office 
functions in finance and administration. 
There are also best practices which can 
be shared within the clusters in areas 
such as IT and digital capabilities. 
At the beginning of this year, a formal 
Executive Management Group (“EMG”) 
was established to ensure that we 
have a strong and broad-based senior 
management team in place to support 
the next stage of the Group’s growth 
strategy. The members of the EMG 
are the senior managers responsible 
for the major business clusters and 
for certain key Group functions. The 
EMG combines individuals who have 
developed internally as well as selective 
external recruits. The EMG gives the 
senior management bench strength to 
manage a growing and broadly spread 
Group, while laying the groundwork for 
succession in key executive positions.

What we put in What we get out KPIs
Essential Products
Our businesses focus on supplying essential 
products and services funded by customers’ 
operating rather than capital budgets and supplied 
across a range of specialised industry segments.
The majority of the Group’s revenues are generated 
from consumable products. In many cases, the 
products will be used in repair and maintenance 
applications and refurbishment and upgrade 
programmes, rather than supplied to original 
equipment manufacturers.
Recurring income and stable revenue growth
Our focus on essential products and services 
contributes to the Group’s record of stable revenue 
growth over the business cycle.
Our businesses target GDP plus levels of organic 
revenue growth, over the economic cycle, with higher 
growth rates achieved at the Group level through 
carefully selected value enhancing acquisitions.
Essential Solutions
Our businesses design their individual business 
models to provide solutions which closely meet 
the requirements of their customers.
The solutions can be in the form of:
• Highly responsive customer service, such as the 
next day delivery from stock of essential, but low 
value items.
• Deep technical support, where we work closely 
with our customers in designing our products 
into their specific applications.
• Added value services which, if we did not provide 
these services, customers would have to pay 
others to provide them or would require them 
to invest in additional resources of their own.
Sustainable and attractive margins
By supplying solutions, not just products, we  
build strong long term relationships with our 
customers and suppliers, supporting sustainable  
and attractive margins.
Our businesses achieve sustainable and attractive 
gross margins by offering strongly differentiated 
products and customer focused solutions within 
specialised market segments. By running efficient 
operations, these gross margins are converted into 
healthy operating margins.
Essential Values
We encourage an entrepreneurial culture across our 
businesses, through a decentralised management 
structure. 
We want the managers to feel that they have the 
freedom to run their own businesses, while being 
able to draw upon the support and resources of a 
larger group where this is beneficial.
Within our businesses we have strong, self-standing 
management teams who are committed to and 
rewarded according to the success of their businesses.

Our decentralised organisational model ensures that 
decisions are made close to the customer and that

Acquire
Clear business criteria have been established to 
guide the Group’s acquisition programme:
• Fit with the Group’s business model
• Marketing led with strong customer relationships
• Secure supply of high quality, differentiated 
products
• Capable management
The principal financial criteria are:
• Track record of stable, profitable growth and  
cash generation
• Exceed post-tax IRR threshold of 13% to ensure 
20%+ pre-tax return on investment
The Group applies a consistent level of effort and 
resources to identifying and developing acquisition 
opportunities. However, the output in terms of 
acquisitions completed, ebbs and flows depending 
on the acquisition environment. 
To achieve the Group’s objective of strong double 
digit growth, acquisition spend of ca.£30m p.a.  
is targeted. 
Over the last three years, this target has been met, 
with a total of ca.£90m invested in acquisitions. 
These acquisitions have contributed 20% of 2016 
Group revenues.
Build
Acquisitions are intended to give entry into new  
but related markets and thereby extend the  
reach of the existing businesses and bring new 
growth opportunities.
The acquisitions we make are of businesses which 
are already successful and with a good track record. 
However, these businesses have typically reached 
the point where additional resources are needed to 
take them to the next level of growth.
Working with the management, we provide the 
investment required to build a solid foundation to 
allow the business to move to a new level of growth. 
The investment we make in new acquisitions  
will normally be in new facilities and IT systems, 
increased but better managed working capital  
and additional management resource.
Except in the case of smaller bolt-on acquisitions, 
the acquired companies maintain their distinct sales 
and marketing identity and strong independent 
management teams. 
Where there are opportunities for synergies with 
other Group businesses, these are managed in 
larger business clusters.
Typically synergies within the business clusters 
come in the following areas:
 Cross-selling between the businesses
 Joint purchasing between the businesses
  Shared operational infrastructure and shared 
back-office functions 
Grow
Once the acquisition is integrated into the Group, 
with a solid platform established, the focus is on 
delivering stable, profitable growth.
The results of the Acquire, Build, Grow strategy  
can be seen in the improving revenue growth  
and operating margins post acquisition.
By the third year post-acquisition, organic revenue 
growth for the acquired businesses is typically 
higher than the Group average and operating 
margins have improved by 200-300bps on average.
These improvements in financial performance 
ensure that the Group creates value through its 
acquisition programme and maintains ROATCE 
above the 20% threshold.

Our Y ear in Review
“The Group has delivered 
strong performance 
boosted by acquisitions 
and a currency tailwind.”
In 2016, the Group has delivered a strong 
performance with hard won underlying 
organic growth across generally 
challenging markets, boosted by a good 
contribution from acquisitions and a 
currency tailwind in the final quarter.
The Group’s revenues increased by 
15%, with acquisitions completed 
during this year and the incremental 
impact from those completed last year, 
contributing 8% to revenue growth. 
Currency movements, on translation of 
the results from overseas businesses 
to UK sterling, contributed a further 4% 
to revenue growth, driven principally by 
the weakening of UK sterling in the last 
quarter of the year following the UK’s 
Brexit vote on Europe. After adjusting 
for acquisitions and currency effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 3%. 
Adjusted operating margins remained 
broadly in line with the first half of the 
year at 17.2%, continuing to be impacted 
by transactional currency effects in the 
Healthcare businesses and initial dilution 
from acquired businesses. The low 
growth environment limited the potential 
for operational leverage, but tight 
management of working capital and 
capital expenditure contributed to a very 
strong free cash flow performance. 
In Controls, reported revenues increased 
by 16%, with the acquisitions of 
Cablecraft and Ascome contributing 
11% to revenue growth and currency 
movements contributing a further 1%. 
After adjusting for acquisitions and 
currency effects, underlying revenues 
increased by 4%, following strong 
underlying growth in the second half 
of the year, against less demanding 
comparatives. The Interconnect 
businesses delivered modest underlying 
growth with strong performances in 
Aerospace, Defence and Motorsport 
markets offsetting weaker Industrial 
markets. The Clarendon specialty 
fasteners business is now managed on 
a stand-alone basis and delivered strong 
double-digit growth in sales to aircraft 
seating and cabin interior manufacturers 
and to Motorsport teams. Fluid Controls 
delivered solid growth in revenues with 
an upturn in refrigeration equipment 
sales in the second half of the year.
Acquisitions and disposals 
The total acquisition expenditure over 
the last three years has been ca.£90m 
and these acquisitions contributed 
20% of the Group’s revenues in 2016.
During the year, the Group invested 
ca.£33m in acquiring new businesses, 
principally the acquisitions of Cablecraft 
in the Controls Sector and WCIS 
in the Seals Sector. Cablecraft is a 
leading UK based supplier of cable 
accessory products which broadens 
the Interconnect portfolio and extends 
the range of markets served. WCIS is a 
supplier of gaskets, seals and associated 
services which extends the Seals 
business into the Australasia region. 
At the end of the year, the Vantage 
Healthcare business in Canada 
completed the sale of its Medivators 
endoscope reprocessor product line 
for a gross consideration of £2.8m (net 
consideration of £2.2m after expenses 
of sale and integration costs). Vantage 
has retained its other principal product 
lines (ca.60% of Vantage revenues) and 
is now managed as a division of the AMT 
business. AMT and Vantage together 
now form a strong Surgical Products 
business in Canada, with integrated back 
office and operational functions. Free 
cash flow in the year also benefited from 
the sale of three small legacy properties 
for aggregate proceeds of £2.3m.
The Group’s strong balance sheet 
and free cash flow provide the 
resources to pursue further acquisition 
opportunities which will enhance the 
Group’s earnings growth in future 
years. The Group’s pipeline for further 
acquisitions remains encouraging.
Strong performance in 
challenging markets
Sector performance
In Life Sciences, reported revenues 
increased by 7%, with underlying 
revenues increasing by 4% on a 
constant currency basis. The Canadian 
Healthcare businesses faced significant 
budget pressures driven by the softer 
economy. The good growth achieved 
in the first half of the year against weak 
comparatives, reversed in the second 
half as comparatives became more 
challenging. The Healthcare businesses 
in Australia and Ireland also experienced 
similar economic and budgetary 
pressures but managed to deliver good 
levels of growth through their positioning 
in growing segments of the market. The 
Environmental businesses delivered solid 
GDP plus revenue growth and ended 
the year with an improved order book. 
In Seals, reported revenues increased 
by 19%, with recent acquisitions 
contributing 12% to revenue growth 
and currency movements contributing 
a further 6% to revenue growth. 
After adjusting for acquisitions and 
currency effects, underlying revenues 
increased by 1%. In North America, core 
Aftermarket seal and gasket revenues 
were broadly flat. Strengthening of senior 
management and new growth initiatives 
are gaining traction and will position 
the businesses to take advantage of 
any increased activity and in particular, 
potential Infrastructure investment 
following the US election. Industrial OEM 
revenues in North America reduced by 
1% against the background of generally 
slow industrial markets. The International 
Seals businesses outside of North 
America benefited from the acquisition 
of WCIS and a full year contribution from 
Kubo and delivered a 5% underlying 
increase in revenues, with a particularly 
strong performance from Kentek. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 13

Life Sciences
The Life Sciences Sector 
businesses supply a 
range of consumables, 
instrumentation and 
related services to  
the healthcare and 
environmental industries.
Healthcare
The Diploma Healthcare Group (“DHG”) 
in Canada comprises two principal 
operating businesses which supply to 
the ca.600 public hospitals across the 
country as well as to private clinics and 
laboratories. Somagen Diagnostics 
(“Somagen”) supplies a range of 
consumables and instruments used in 
the diagnostic testing of blood, tissue 
and other samples in hospital pathology 
laboratories. It is also a leading supplier 
to the growing assisted reproductive 
technology (“ART”) market. AMT 
Surgical (“AMT”) supplies specialised 
electrosurgery equipment and 
consumables for use in hospital operating 
rooms. AMT is also building a portfolio 
of specialised surgical instruments and 
devices used in minimally invasive (“MI”) 
Surgery. Vantage Endoscopy (“Vantage”), 
now managed as part of AMT, supplies 
endoscopes and related consumables 
and service, as well as therapeutic 
devices utilised in GI Endoscopy suites 
in hospitals and private clinics. 
DHG operates in Australia and New 
Zealand through Diagnostic Solutions 
(“DSL ”) and Big Green Surgical (“BGS”) 
which are both located in Melbourne. 
DSL and BGS focus on similar market 
segments respectively to the Somagen 
and AMT businesses in Canada, as well 
as having similar product portfolios 
with a number of common suppliers.
DHG extended its operations in October 
2014 into Europe with the acquisition 
of Technopath Distribution (“TPD”), an 
established supplier of products to the 
Biotechnology, Clinical Laboratory and 
Medical Device markets in Ireland and the 
UK. Similar to the other DHG businesses, 
TPD focuses on specialised laboratory 
diagnostics and specialty medical 
device segments, again leveraging 
a number of common suppliers.
Environmental
The a1-group is a supplier to 
Environmental testing laboratories 
and to Health & Safety engineers. The 
a1-envirosciences business, based in 
Germany, supplies a range of specialised 
environmental analysers and a range 
of containment enclosures for potent 
powder handling. The a1-CBISS business, 
based in the UK, supplies equipment and 
services for the monitoring and control 
of environmental emissions, as well 
as a range of gas detection devices.

Market drivers
The DHG businesses in Canada supply 
into areas of Healthcare which are 
predominantly public sector funded. 
Private sector funding in Canada, 
representing ca.30% of healthcare 
expenditure in Canada in 2015, is largely 
focused on areas where DHG do not 
participate, specifically dental, cosmetic 
and eye surgery and pharmaceuticals. 
The principal demand driver for 
DHG is therefore the sustainable 
level of Healthcare spending funded 
by the Canadian Government.
The Canadian Healthcare industry is a 
proven, long term growth environment 
for medical device distribution. A 
growing, ageing and well educated 
population demands high standards 
of service delivery, helping to ensure 
ongoing growing demand; per capita 
Healthcare spending in Canada is 
ca.C$6,000, placing Canada in the top 
20% of OECD countries. The Canadian 
Health Act (“the Act”) ensures universal 
coverage for all insured persons for all 
medically necessary services provided 
by hospitals, physicians and other 
Healthcare providers. The Provinces 
are responsible for the delivery of the 
Healthcare services, but the Federal 
Government controls delivery through 
Federal Provincial transfer payments, 
which represent the largest source 
of revenues for the Provinces.
The relative stability and consistency 
in funding by each of the Provinces, 
guaranteed through the Act, ensures 
that the market remains well funded 
through the economic cycle. Over 
many years, Healthcare expenditure 
has grown steadily with annual 
variations mostly dependent on the 
periodic additional tranches of funding 
provided by individual Provinces. In 
periods when the economy is slower, 
Healthcare funding has still shown 
positive growth, albeit at reduced levels.
The Healthcare market in Australia 
shares with Canada many of the 
same attractive characteristics 
for specialised distribution. While 
privately funded Healthcare is more 
prevalent in areas such as surgery 
and laboratory testing, public sector 
Healthcare funding is still large and 
supported by a stable, resource based 
economy. As with Canada, Australia 
has a large geography to be covered, 
low population density and purchasing 
processes that vary by State. These 
characteristics necessarily demand a 
significant investment by manufacturers 
in technical sales and service resource 
which makes the specialised distribution 
model more attractive as an efficient 
way to serve the local markets. 
Since 2014, the Canadian and 
Australian economies have come 
under significant pressure from the 
falling oil price and reduced demand 
for the countries’ natural resources. 
This tougher economic environment 
has resulted in greater pressure on 
budgets throughout the Healthcare 
systems in both countries. In such 
periods, Healthcare funding is tightly 
constrained through targeted controls 
imposed on the number of laboratory 
tests and operating procedures as well 
as more rigorous tendering processes 
for expenditure on capital equipment. 
Total Healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP
2011 2012 2013 2014 2015
Canada 11.3% 11.3% 11.2% 11.1% 10.9%
Australia 9.3% 9.5% 9.7% 9.8% 10.0%
Sources: As below.
Even with such pressures, however, 
Healthcare funding has shown positive 
growth, with growth in total Healthcare 
expenditure of ca.2% and ca.5% 
respectively in Canada and Australia.
The principal market driver for the TPD 
business is Healthcare funding in the 
UK and Ireland. The total Healthcare 
expenditure in the UK and Ireland is 
ca.£200bn (of which the UK is ca.90%) 
which represents ca.10% of combined 
GDP. Of the total Healthcare expenditure, 
ca.80% is provided by public funding 
and 20% by private funding. Following 
the 2009 recession, annual growth in 
UK Healthcare expenditure has slowed 
to low single-digit levels, compared 
with average growth of 8% p.a. over 
the previous decade. In Ireland, 
Healthcare expenditure saw reductions 
year-on-year between 2009 and 2013, 
since when growth has resumed, 
again at low single digit levels.
The a1-group supplies to customers 
in the Environmental industry in 
the UK, Germany and France. The 
market demand is largely driven by 
Environmental and Health & Safety 
regulations and growth in recent years 
has been driven by the need to be 
compliant with a range of EU regulations. 
Since market demand is driven by 
regulation, this ensures reasonably 
steady demand for essential consumable 
products and services, though customers 
may defer capital expenditure during 
significant downturns in the economy. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 16

2016 increased by £3.4m to £19.0m of 
which £2.2m related to the disposal

the balance arose from a reduction in 
working capital and capital expenditure. 
Healthcare
The DHG group of Healthcare businesses, 
which account for 83% of Life Sciences 
revenues, increased underlying 
revenues by 3% in constant currency 
terms; on translation to UK sterling, 
reported revenues increased by 6%.
In Canada, DHG revenues were 
broadly flat for the year as significant 
budget pressures continued to be felt 
throughout the Provincial Healthcare 
systems, driven by the tough economic 
environment. Revenue growth achieved 
in the first half of the year against weak 
comparatives was reversed in the 
second half as comparatives became 
more challenging. Reduced revenues 
in the Somagen clinical diagnostics 
business were broadly offset by growth 
in revenues in the surgical products 
businesses and in particular, strong 
Vantage results in the GI segment. 
Somagen’s consumable and service 
revenues were broadly flat, but capital 
revenues for the year reduced by 
ca.40%. The core clinical diagnostics 
business continued to be impacted by 
the freeze in capital spending in Quebec 
while the Province completes both the 
creation of integrated Health Centres 
under its “Bill 10” legislation and the 
Optilab reorganisation programme 
which is designed to achieve cost 
savings and efficiencies through 
consolidation of Quebec’s public medical 
laboratories. Growth was also impacted 
by the introduction of stricter patient 
testing criteria in Alberta’s colorectal 
screening programme, increasing the 
age threshold for eligibility and thus 
constraining the number of patient 
tests. To counter these headwinds, 
Somagen has generated good revenue 
growth from its successful a1c diabetes 
testing programme and has continued 
to invest in new product introductions 
designed to broaden Somagen’s product 
portfolio in new growth segments. 
AMT continued to face pricing pressures 
in its core electrosurgery business from 
the tender and evaluation processes 
introduced by Provincial shared services 
organisations and national group 
purchasing organisations. AMT has 
responded by introducing a broader 
product portfolio, providing customers 
with more options in major tender 
awards. AMT has also achieved strong 
double-digit growth in the supply of 
specialised surgical instruments and 
devices used in laparoscopic and other 
minimally invasive surgical procedures. 
In particular, strong growth in new 
surgical segments has been achieved 
with products sourced from new 
suppliers which have been added in 
recent years. These revenues have 
mitigated the revenue reductions 
from smoke evacuation products 
and electrosurgical accessories. 
Vantage delivered good growth across 
its consumable product lines including 
argon plasma probes, endoscope 
reprocessor chemicals and other 
GI Endoscopy accessories, including 
specialised instruments and devices. 
Results were also boosted by strong 
growth in revenues across all of 
Vantage’s core capital equipment product 
lines; this strong performance was 
against a weak prior year comparative 
which was constrained last year by 
delayed capital budget approvals.
In late September 2016, Vantage 
completed the sale of its Medivators 
endoscope reprocessor product line to 
Cantel Medical Corporation (“Cantel”) for 
a gross consideration of £2.8m. Cantel, 
through its subsidiary Medivators, had 
been the supplier of these products to 
Vantage and consistent with its global 
strategy, had decided to establish a 
direct operation in Canada to market 
and sell the Medivators products 
alongside other Cantel product lines. In 
addition to purchasing the assets and 
liabilities of the Medivators product 
line, Cantel also took on the Vantage 
facility lease and a large proportion of 
the Vantage operational employees. 
Reported revenues of the Life Sciences 
businesses increased by 7% to 
£109.9m (2015: £103.1m). Currency 
movements, on translation of the 
results from overseas businesses into 
UK sterling, contributed 3% to revenue 
growth; on a constant currency basis, 
underlying revenues increased by 4%.
Gross margins in the Healthcare 
businesses continued to be impacted on 
a transactional basis by the depreciation 
of the Canadian and Australian dollars 
relative to the US dollar. Realised 
exchange rates have stabilised in the 
second half of 2016, but at a level ca.10% 
below the average levels in 2015. Local 
management has continued to work 
closely with suppliers and customers 
to obtain pricing support but overall 
Healthcare gross margins reduced by 
350bps compared to the prior year. The 
opportunity to mitigate the transactional 
currency effects through operating 
cost management is now limited and 
though Environmental margins have 
improved modestly, Sector adjusted 
operating margins have reduced by 
260bps. Adjusted operating profits 
reduced by 7% to £19.6m (2015: £21.0m).

Highlights from 
the year
• Sector revenue growth of 7%; 
underlying growth of 4% after 
adjusting for currency
• In Canada, DHG revenues 
broadly flat with growth in 
Surgical Products offsetting 
reduced capital spend in 
Clinical Diagnostics; Vantage 
sold Medivators product line 
for £2.8m in September 2016
• In Australia, strong growth 
despite similar economic and 
budget pressures to Canada
• TPD in Ireland and the UK 
delivered a second year of 
good growth since acquisition; 
facility investment provides 
significant capacity to support 
DHG’s growth in Europe

showed steady growth and 
ended the year with an 
improved order book
Potential for growth
• Increase share of specialised 
segments of Healthcare 
markets in Canada and 
Australia

and geographic spread of 
Environmental businesses
Vantage has retained its other principal 
product lines (ca.60% of Vantage 
revenues) and the related key commercial 
and clinical staff. From the start of 
the new financial year, Vantage is now 
being managed as a division of AMT, 
with integrated warehousing, logistics 
and back office functions. AMT and 
Vantage together now form a single, 
strong Surgical and GI specialty medical 
device business in Canada with the 
opportunity to gain good operational 
leverage from its increased scale. 
In Australia, the Healthcare sector has 
experienced similar economic and 
budget pressures to Canada, but has 
the added capacity of private Healthcare 
spending to offset some of the economic 
constraints. Against this background, 
the BGS and DSL businesses have 
increased revenues by 15% in local 
currency terms. BGS continued to grow 
surgical product revenues strongly, 
with smoke evacuation programmes in 
existing and new accounts continuing to 
provide the main driver for growth. There 
was also a steady sales performance 
in electrosurgical grounding pads, 
laparoscopic electrodes and the 
enzymatic products acquired from 
Chemzyme as the product portfolio 
continues to grow. DSL has also achieved 
double-digit revenue growth in its clinical 
diagnostic products business, with the 
growth driven by capital equipment sales, 
in particular of capillary electrophoresis 
instruments used in testing for multiple 
myelomas and diabetes. Consumable 
product sales were broadly flat, reflecting 
softer prior year capital equipment 
sales, which is the key demand driver 
for consumable product revenues.
The TPD business is an established 
supplier to the Healthcare and 
Biotechnology markets in Ireland and the 
UK, acquired by DHG in October 2014. 
TPD delivered a second year of good 
revenue growth since acquisition, with 
growth in Healthcare driven by laboratory 
quality controls in the clinical diagnostic 
segment of the hospital laboratory 
market. There has also been significant 
growth in TPD’s sales of specialty medical 
devices used in the interventional 
cardiology and digestive health areas of 
the hospital market. The Biotechnology 
product portfolio delivered good 
revenue growth in both consumables 
and capital equipment, all associated 
with rapid microbial identification and 
used in industrial laboratories across the 
Pharmaceutical, Food and Water sectors.
The TPD performance was achieved in a 
year when it completed a major facility 
move, with the accompanying disruption 
to operations. In January 2016, TPD 
consolidated and relocated its operations 
into an adjacent leased building, which 
had been refurbished and fitted out to 
meet TPD’s requirements at a total cost 
of £0.8m. This new facility consolidated 
a number of fragmented, less efficient 
operations into a single facility and 
provides significant capacity to support 
DHG’s growth ambitions in Europe. 
Environmental
The a1-group of Environmental 
businesses in Europe, which account 
for 17% of Life Sciences Sector 
revenues, saw revenues increase by 
5% in constant currency terms.
The a1-envirosciences business based in 
Germany increased revenues by 13% in 
Euro terms and ended the year with an 
improved order book. The strong growth 
was driven by demand for containment 
enclosures for the safe weighing of 
hazardous materials, particularly from 
Petrochemical and Pharmaceutical 
industry customers in Germany. The 
sales of high end elemental and trace 
analysers also continued to grow, 
with the range of mercury analysers 
seeing increasing demand. 
The a1-CBISS business based in the 
UK saw revenues reduce by 1% with 
stable revenues from long term service 
contracts, but reductions in revenues 
from continuous emissions monitoring 
systems (“CEMS”). This sector remains 
buoyant with new Biomass and Energy 
from Waste (“EFW”) plants an important 
part of the UK’s energy portfolio, 
but competition is increasing in new 
sites built by major EPC contractors. 
a1-CBISS is responding by focusing 
on replacement systems and owner-
operator sites where its specialist 
knowledge and customised software 
solutions give competitive advantage. 
The gas detection sector had a weak 
first half, as the slowdown in sales to Oil 
& Gas customers continued to impact 
activity levels, but recovered strongly in 
the second half. Revenues from service 
contracts, across both Environmental 
businesses, continue to grow with each 
capital installation and now represent 
a third of the combined revenues. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 18

Seals
The Seals Sector 
businesses supply a 
range of seals, gaskets, 
filters, cylinders, 
components and kits 
used in heavy mobile 
machinery and 
specialised industrial 
equipment.
Aftermarket
The Aftermarket businesses supply 
sealing and associated products to 
support a broad range of mobile 
machinery in applications which include 
Heavy Construction, Mining, Logging, 
Agriculture, Material Handling (lift trucks, 
fork lifts and dump trucks) and Refuse 
Collection. The products are generally 
supplied on a next day delivery basis and 
are used in the repair and maintenance 
of equipment after it has completed its 
initial warranty period or lease term, or 
has been sold on in the pre-used market. 
The main customers are machinery 
and cylinder repair shops, engine and 
transmission rebuilders and other 
heavy equipment parts distributors. 
The Aftermarket businesses also supply 
products to end users operating process 
plants within the Mining, Oil & Gas, 
Pharmaceutical, Chemical, Food and 
Energy sectors, where products are 
required to support Maintenance, Repair 
and Overhaul (“MRO”) operations.
Industrial OEM
The Industrial OEM businesses supply 
seals, gaskets, O-rings and custom 
moulded and machined parts to a 
range of Industrial OEM customers. 
The businesses work closely with 
customers to select the most appropriate 
seal design, material and manufacturer 
for the application, provide technical 
support and guidance during the 
product development process and 
deliver the logistics capabilities to 
supply from inventory to support small 
to medium sized production runs.
Market drivers
In North America (where ca.60% of 
Sector revenues are generated), the 
principal market driver for both the 
Aftermarket and Industrial OEM Seals 
businesses is the growth rate in the 
general industrial economy. In 2016, the 
US economy is forecast to show annual 
GDP growth of 1.8% (2015: 2.4%), driven 
primarily by strong consumer spending. 
US industrial production contracted in 
2016 which was largely attributable to 
continued headwinds in the Oil & Gas, 
Mining, and Heavy Equipment sectors. 
 
In Canada, 2016 GDP growth is 
forecast to increase to 1.7% (2015: 
1.2%) as Oil & Gas and Mining sectors 
are expected to improve and non-
commodity, export-driven industries 
remain competitive. In general, the

economic conditions in the South and 
Central American economies served 
by the North American Aftermarket 
businesses have remained challenging.
 
In the Aftermarket businesses, 
activity and spending levels in the US 
Construction sector are important, since 
this market accounts for over 50% of 
Aftermarket Seals revenues. Statistics 
on total US Construction spend include 
non-residential and infrastructure 
spend, as well as residential housing 
activity. Overall US Construction 
spend has continued to rise through 
2016 as contractors completed the 
build-out phases of construction 
projects. Additionally, housing starts 
in the US are forecast to increase to 
1.2m from 1.1m in the prior year. 
Unit sales in the US of Construction 
Equipment (defined as heavy mobile 
equipment including excavators above 
14 tonnes, crawler dozers and wheeled 
loaders) is important as a medium term 
indicator for Hercules’ replacement 
hydraulic seals activities, as the new 
heavy equipment will move out of the 
dealer warranty period in the following 
years. It is also a good short term 
indicator for the HKX attachment kit 
business. During 2015 and the first half 
of 2016, the demand for new equipment 
has remained flat as the general 
machine population is relatively new 
and equipment, previously used in the 
Oil & Gas and Mining sectors, continues 
to be released back through auction 
houses into the Construction sector. 
Contractors are also opting more for the 
rental model for their equipment needs.
For the Industrial OEM Seals businesses, 
the most appropriate indicator is the 
Industrial Production Index, which is 
forecast to contract slightly in 2016 
after being essentially flat during 
2015, as the stronger dollar and a 
continued slowdown in the natural 
resources sector offset stronger 
domestic consumer demand.
The International Seals businesses 
operate in a range of countries and 
diverse market sectors and each has 
its own specific market drivers. The 
most relevant market drivers and 
indicators are therefore the general 
GDP growth and the Industrial sector 
performance for each territory in 
which the businesses operate.
In the UK, economic growth is forecast 
to remain flat in 2016 at ca.1.8% (2015: 
1.8%). The weakened UK sterling is 
giving short term benefits to exporters, 
but this is offset by uncertainty over 
the terms of any future EU trade deal 
which has led to investment decisions 
being postponed or deferred.
In Continental Europe, the individual 
economies have remained variable in 
2015 and 2016, driven by a number of 
contributing economic and geopolitical 
factors. Overall European GDP growth in 
2016 is forecast to remain flat at ca.1.9% 
(2015: 2.0%) but has slowed following 
the UK referendum on EU membership 
(“Brexit”). The European economies have 
also been affected by the EU and US 
sanctions against Russia and reductions 
in exports as a result of the continuing 
fragility in the global economy.
In Australia, the economy has been 
adversely affected by the downturn in 
the Mining sector, which contracted by 
7.4% during 2014 and has continued 
to decline in 2015. Despite this, overall 
Australia GDP grew by 2.5% in 2015 (2014: 
2.7%), predominantly due to growth in 
the service sector of the economy. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 20

and leased back to the business. A 
further £0.5m was invested in new

new seal cutting machines for the 
International Seals businesses and a new 
crane in WCIS. In addition, £0.4m was 
invested in IT infrastructure, including 
a substantial upgrade to the ERP 
information systems in Hercules Bulldog. 
The free cash flow generated in this 
Sector, which is after these investments, 
increased by over 40% to £24.9m 
reflecting both a full year contribution 
from the acquired businesses and a 
large reduction in working capital. 
North American Seals
The North American Seals businesses, 
which account for ca.60% of Seals 
Sector revenues, saw revenues decrease 
by 2% on a constant currency basis 
against strong prior year comparatives. 
On translation to UK sterling, reported 
revenues increased by 7% due to the 
strengthening of the US dollar. 
The HFPG Aftermarket businesses 
reported revenues 3% below last 
year in US dollar terms, with the core 
Hercules Bulldog seal and gasket 
revenues broadly flat against the prior 
year, but with a substantial reduction 
in HKX attachment kit revenues in an 
excavator market which continued to 
be depressed for most of the year. 
In the domestic US market, Hercules 
Bulldog revenues were constrained 
by sluggish activity in the Heavy 
Construction sector, in particular 
in the resource dependent States. 
However, positive trends have started 
to develop in the Repair and Distributor 
segments and the revenue declines 
earlier in the year were reversed by 
the year end. Sales and marketing 
resources have been strengthened 
and specific growth initiatives continue 
to gain traction, including the sale of 
seal kits to large national rental fleets 
and contractors through dedicated 
buying portals. Additional business 
development focus has also been given 
to government customers, national 
accounts and speciality distributors. 
Additional new product lines have been 
introduced, including lifting slings and 
aftermarket cylinders for skid-steer 
equipment. Online revenues through 
Webstore continue to increase and 
now account for ca.20% of domestic 
US Aftermarket seal revenues. 
In Canada, Hercules revenues increased 
by 3% in Canadian dollar terms despite 
unfavourable market conditions in the 
Mining, Quarrying and Oil & Gas sectors. 
The resulting economic conditions 
favour the repair market, which has 
helped drive revenue growth, along 
with sales of new products added to 
the 2016 catalogues in the first half of 
the year. Orders from hydraulic cylinder 
manufacturing customers have been 
relatively flat, mainly as a result of 
shifting customer demand, rather than 
significant gains or losses of business. 
In markets outside North America, 
Hercules Bulldog export revenues 
recovered in the second half and finished 
the year showing 3% growth. Strong 
growth in Mexico and Central America 
more than offset declines in resource 
dependent South American markets. 
 
The HKX attachment kit business 
experienced a continuing, significant 
reduction in revenues reflecting the 
depressed market for new excavators 
in the US and Canada and the surplus of 
heavy mobile equipment. The increased 
proportion of factory installed kits 
continues to impede HKX’s standard 
kit sales, but HKX is responding by 
marketing lower cost entry level kits 
which are upgradeable to provide a 
more complete range of capabilities. 
With equipment rentals and leases 
growing to 50% of new machine sales, 
HKX is also focusing its sales effort 
on kit programmes to support the 
dealer rental and lease operations. 
The HFPG Industrial OEM businesses 
in North America saw revenues reduce 
by 1% against a background of generally 
slow industrial markets. J Royal delivered 
another year of solid growth, with 
good demand from its water meter and 
swimming pool equipment customers 
offsetting reduced demand from gas 
boiler, fuel management and filtration 
customers. RT Dygert and All Seals, 
which now share sales management 
and product development resources, 
saw revenues reduce by 3% against 
the prior year. RT Dygert generated 
good GDP plus levels of growth with 
its core industrial OEM accounts and 
distribution customers. However, these 
gains were more than offset by reduced 
sales to cylinder manufacturers as their 
businesses lost share to lower priced 
offshore suppliers and with reduced 
sales to catalogue distributors reflecting 
the weaker industrial markets. All Seals 
generated growth from customers in 
the Water and Medical sectors, but this 
growth was offset by reduced revenues 
in Aerospace, Oil & Gas and general 
Industrial OEMs and distributors. 
Reported revenues of the Seals 
businesses increased by 19% to £166.6m 
(2015: £139.6m). The Seals acquisitions 
completed during last year (Kubo and 
Swan Seals), along with the first year 
contribution from the WCIS acquisition 
(completed in October 2015), added 
12% to Sector revenues. Currency 
movements, on translation of the 
results from overseas businesses to 
UK sterling, contributed a further 6% to 
Sector revenues. After adjusting for these 
acquisitions and for currency effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 1%. 
Continued progress was made 
during the year in building a more 
substantial presence outside North 
America through a combination of 
organic growth and acquisition. The 
International Seals businesses based 
in the EMEA and Australasia regions, 
contributed £68.2m to Seals revenues 
in the year (2015: £47.3m) and now 
account for ca.40% of Sector revenues. 
Across the Seals businesses, gross 
margins continued to be resilient, 
underpinned by the business model of 
superior product availability and added 
value technical services. The acquired 
businesses joined the Group with strong 
gross margins but with higher operating 
cost ratios and therefore lower initial 
operating margins. As a result, adjusted 
operating margins for the Sector reduced 
by 90bps to 16.9% (2015: 17.8%) and 
adjusted operating profits increased 
by 14% to £28.2m (2015: £24.8m).
During the year, £1.4m was invested in 
the Seals businesses, including an initial 
payment of £0.5m for the construction 
of a new facility for J Royal, close to their 
existing location in North Carolina; the 
total cost is expected to be ca.£2.5m. 
On completion of this project (scheduled 
for April 2017), the facility will be sold  Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 21

businesses in North America
• Build larger, broader-based 
Seals business in the EMEA 
and Asia Pacific regions
• Explore opportunities more 
broadly in industrial 
distribution in North America
The Industrial OEM businesses continue 
to respond to the overall low growth 
environment by maintaining strong 
relationships with core industrial 
equipment customers, ensuring 
high levels of customer service in 
support of existing projects, as well as 
offering more specialised material and 
product specifications to secure new 
projects. In particular, the businesses 
continue to look for opportunities 
to deploy higher specification, 
regulatory-compliant compounds for 
industries including Pharmaceutical, 
Water and Food equipment and 
for fuel dispensing applications. 
International Seals
The International Seals businesses in 
the EMEA and Australasia regions, now 
account for ca.40% of Sector revenues 
and increased revenues by 5% on an 
underlying basis, after adjusting for 
currency effects and acquisitions. 
The FPE Seals business increased 
revenues by 3% in UK sterling terms 
and continued to develop a more 
substantial, broader-based Aftermarket 
Seals business. At the beginning of the 
year, FPE Seals became fully operational 
from its new facility in Darlington in the 
UK, which is now the core operational 
hub for further expansion across the 
EMEA region. FPE Seals also has a small 
operation in the Netherlands which it 
has used as an initial pilot for the launch 
of the Webstore e-commerce solution. 
Following the relocation of the Bulldog 
operation to Tampa in September 2015, 
FPE experienced some product shipment 
delays in the first half of the year; the 
back orders were recovered in the second 
half to improve full year revenues. Swan 
Seals in Aberdeen has been impacted 
by the low oil price environment, 
but again showed some second half 
improvement in activity levels. 
Kentek increased revenues by 16% in Euro 
terms and continued to respond well to 
the challenging economic conditions 
in Russia and Finland, under pressure 
from lower global demand in the Oil & 
Gas and Mining sectors and from the 
negative impact of economic sanctions 
on Russia. Despite these challenges 
and further weakness of the Russian 
rouble, Kentek delivered strong revenue 
growth in Russia, with good revenue 
increases from its newer sales offices. 
Kentek also benefited from increased 
investment by the Russian government 
in the Agricultural and Manufacturing 
sectors and has won a number of 
tenders with key Mining customers. In 
Finland, new management has given 
additional structure and impetus to the 
sales efforts which have re-established 
revenue growth. During the period, 
Kentek introduced a new own-branded 
filter range which is now gaining traction.
M Seals increased revenues by 1% in 
local currency terms with strong revenue 
growth in the core markets of Denmark 
and Sweden, where M Seals has built 
on its strong customer relationships to 
develop a number of major new projects. 
This growth was offset by reduced 
revenues from the M Seals operations 
in the UK which have been impacted 
by cut-backs in the Oil & Gas sector, 
particularly in the first half of the year. 
In the second half, there has been some 
recovery in demand and M Seals has 
seen some initial benefit from increasing 
sales efforts to specialised Industrial 
OEMs in other sectors of the UK market. 
Kubo revenues decreased by 2% on a 
like-for-like basis (Swiss franc terms, 
including pre-acquisition revenues) as it 
faced challenging market conditions in 
its core industrial market in Switzerland. 
The strong Swiss franc (following its 
decoupling from the Euro in 2015) 
has made Swiss manufacturers less 
competitive in export markets and 
some have relocated production outside 
Switzerland. Against this background, 
Kubo has made progress in taking 
market share from competitors through 
sales initiatives, technical support and 
responsiveness. Kubo management has 
also focused on improving operational 
efficiency and expanding value adding 
activities. During the year, Kubo invested 
in a new seal machining centre to 
enable the business to respond quickly 
to urgent customer requirements for 
specialised seals, as well as replacing 
externally sourced products. 
In October 2015, the Group completed 
the acquisition of WCIS, a supplier of 
gaskets, seals and associated products 
and services located in Australia and New 
Caledonia. WCIS has core capabilities in 
gaskets and mechanical seals, used in 
complex and arduous applications. Since 
its acquisition, WCIS core customers in 
the Mining sector, as expected, have 
faced difficult market conditions and 
this has held back revenues. However, 
progress has been made in Australia 
in strengthening the team to broaden 
sales coverage across a wider range 
of market sectors. In New Caledonia, 
WCIS signed new three-year contracts 
with its major customer for the 
provision of products and services.  Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 22

Market drivers
Industrial economic background
The Controls businesses focus on 
specialised, technical applications in a 
range of industries, with over 90% of 
Sector revenues generated in the UK and 
Continental Europe (principally Germany). 
The background market drivers are 
therefore the growth of the industrial 
economies in the UK and Germany.
A good indicator of the health of the UK 
industrial economy is the UK Index of 
Production. Following the 2009 recession, 
gains in 2010 were reversed in 2011 and 
2012 and since then there has been slow, 
steady growth. However, the index is still 
some 10% below pre-recession levels

and economic growth is more driven 
by the Services and Retail sectors. 
In Germany, the Production Sector 
Output index tracks a strong period 
of recovery through 2010 and 2011, 
since when it has slowly increased and 
is now back to pre-recession levels. 
Specific industry drivers – Interconnect
Although influenced by the general 
industrial economic cycles, there 
are also more specific drivers within 
the main market segments served 
by the Interconnect businesses.
The Civil Aerospace market continued 
to grow steadily with growth in World 
Passenger Traffic averaging over 6% 
p.a. over the last five years and with 
continuing strong order books at 
Boeing, Airbus and the manufacturers 
of smaller, regional aircraft. There is a 
trend towards replacing ageing fleets 
with more fuel efficient wider bodied 
aircraft and there is increased activity 
in the cabin interiors market where the 
wide range of complex seating and 
entertainment systems is driving growth. 
The Defence market in the UK has shown 
some early signs of recovery, prompted 
by the military operations in Syria and 
Iraq, the emergence of new perceived 
threats and the UK commitment to 
maintain the NATO spend target of 2% 
of GDP through to 2020. In Germany, 
the government has also committed 
to increased defence spending in 
response to the same drivers.
In Motorsport, demand is impacted 
by the number of Formula 1 races and 
teams (both of which increased in the 
2016 season) and development work 
related to technology and rule changes, 
which were limited in 2016 but with 
additional changes expected in 2017. 
The Formula E series continues to gain 
momentum but the relative spend in this 
series is low compared to Formula 1. 
In the UK, investment in Rail 
infrastructure continues with more 
than £25bn committed in the five years 
to 2019 for major projects including 
Crossrail and the Thameslink and Great 
Western upgrades. More generally UK 
infrastructure investment is expected 
to increase with particular focus 
on utilities, transportation and IT/
communications. In Germany, electricity 
generation and distribution remains a 
positive sector as the responsibility for 
the local supply of electricity continues 
to be returned to cities and towns. 
Specific industry drivers – Fluid Controls
The Fluid Controls businesses generate 
over 60% of their revenues from the Food 
& Beverage sector in the UK. In Food 
Retailing, there continue to be significant 
structural changes which are impacting 
segment growth rates including the trend 
away from major out-of-town stores to 
convenience stores and the increase in 
home delivery. These trends are driving 
demand for smaller, more energy efficient 
components as supplied by Hawco. 
The Coffee market sector continues 
to grow and the UK retail coffee 
market has reached over £1bn p.a. 
Abbeychart supplies both the coffee 
machine manufacturers and the 
Aftermarket sector, predominately 
in the UK but also in Europe.  Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 24
Interconnect
The Interconnect businesses account 
for 76% of Sector revenues and 
reported a revenue increase of 21% 
in UK sterling terms. After adjusting 
for the Cablecraft and Ascome 
acquisitions and for currency effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 4%.
The IS-Group businesses in the UK and 
US saw revenues increase by 2%, with a 
strong performance in the second half 
of the year more than compensating for 
the revenue decline in the first half. In 
response to the generally low growth 
environment in its industrial markets, 
sales resources were realigned to focus 
on sectors and customer accounts with 
the highest growth potential. Further 
business development programmes were 
also introduced and contributed to the 
improving trend in the second half of the 
year. Investments have also been made 
in developing digital media capabilities 
and in positioning the IS-Group as the 
supplier of choice for the full range of 
specialist cable harnessing components. 
In Defence, general activity levels 
in electrical harnessing customers 
increased and the IS-Group benefited 
from specific programmes, including 
wiring and harness components 
supplied to the Scout/AJAX armoured 
fighting vehicle programmes and 
from communication cables used on 
submarines. In Aerospace, the IS-
Group again benefited from a generally 
buoyant market, boosted by specific 
projects, including braided assemblies 
installed on Airbus A350 fuel pipes.
In Motorsport, activity benefited from 
additional races in the Formula 1 race 
schedule and increased investment 
from Toro Rosso and Renault, as well 
as from the new entrant Haas and the 
rebranded Manor Racing team. The 
IS-Group has also been closely involved 
with the 2017 America’s Cup series, with 
products widely specified in the Test 
Boats and now also confirmed in the 
build programmes for the Race Boats. 
In the US, strong growth was achieved 
in its core Motorsport business, as 
well as related Industrial markets. 
Controls
Sector performance
Industrial markets in the UK continued 
to be challenging with Energy revenues 
in particular showing a significant 
reduction, driven by the cut-backs 
in the Oil & Gas industry which have 
impacted sales of harness components 
to sub-sea cable manufacturers and 
other Oil & Gas markets. In Continental 
Europe, a competitive market saw 
sales to other sub-distributors reduce 
significantly in the first half of the 
year, but stabilise at this lower level 
in the second half of the year.
In Germany, IS-Sommer and Filcon 
reported a 3% increase in revenues 
in local Euro terms. Strong revenue 
growth in the Energy and Motorsport 
markets compensated for a weaker 
performance in Aerospace & Defence, 
while Industrial markets showed 
modest growth in line with the general 
industrial economy in Germany. 
In the Energy sector, IS-Sommer has 
a strong and growing position in the 
supply of products used in the repair and 
maintenance of the low and medium-
voltage electricity network. Demand for 
these products has been strong as 2016 
has been an assessment year for the 
German power network which typically 
triggers a cyclical round of investments; 
weather conditions have also been 
favourable. IS-Sommer has increased its 
share of this growing market by offering 
good stock availability, experienced 
technical sales support and competitive 
pricing based on its purchasing power. 
In Motorsport, Filcon achieved strong 
growth in the supply of specialist 
connectors to leading teams in a range of 
racing series; Filcon has the distinction of 
being the preferred supplier to the World 
Champions in the Formula 1, Le Mans 
24 hour and World Rally Championship 
series. Increased activity is being seen 
in the Defence and Military Aerospace 
sector in Germany, where there is 
growing pressure on Germany to upgrade 
its military capabilities. The increased 
activity did not translate into firm orders 
until later in the year, but both Filcon 
and IS-Sommer will carry strong order 
books into the new financial year.

Sector Review continued
Reported revenues of the Controls 
businesses increased by 16% to £106.1m 
(2015: £91.1m). The acquisitions of 
Cablecraft and Ascome, acquired in the 
first half of the year, added 11% to Sector 
revenues and currency movements 
contributed a further 1% to Sector 
revenues on translation to UK sterling. 
On an underlying basis, after adjusting for 
these acquisitions and currency effects, 
underlying revenues increased by 4%, 
following strong underlying growth in 
the second half of the year (9% increase) 
against less demanding comparatives.
Adjusted operating margins increased 
by 100bps to 16.9% (2015: 15.9%). Gross 
margins strengthened in the IS-Group 
and Clarendon businesses, offsetting 
margin pressure in the Hawco Group, 
while operating costs as a percentage of 
revenue remained broadly stable across 
the Controls businesses. The stronger 
operating margins of the newly acquired 
Cablecraft business also contributed to 
the improvement in the Sector average. 
Adjusted operating profits increased 
by 23% to £17.9m (2015: £14.5m).
Capital expenditure in this Sector 
remained modest at £0.4m (2015: £0.3m). 
The focus on developing Clarendon 
as a stand-alone Specialty Fasteners 
business led to £0.2m being invested 
in establishing a separate warehouse 
and offices for this business within the 
existing IS-Group facility in Swindon. 
A further £0.1m was invested in new 
tooling in Sommer and Cablecraft 
and £0.1m was spent on the general 
IT infrastructure across the Controls 
businesses. Free cash flow increased 
strongly to £16.4m reflecting stronger 
trading, including the additional 
contribution from Cablecraft and a 
modest reduction in working capital.  Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 25

In February 2016, Filcon completed 
the acquisition of Ascome, a small 
distributor of specialist connectors into 
the Defence and Industrial markets 
in France. This acquisition provides 
greater presence for Filcon’s operations 
in France, provides credible access to 
the French Defence sector and gives 
access to new products and suppliers.
In March 2016, the Group completed 
the acquisition of Cablecraft, a leading 
supplier of cable accessory products 
which are used to identify, connect, 
secure and protect electrical cables; 
own-branded and manufactured 
products account for ca.80% of 
revenues. In addition to broadening 
the Interconnect product portfolio, the 
acquisition has also extended the range 
of markets served. Cablecraft supplies 
to wholesalers and distributors serving 
electrical contractors in the Construction 
market and end users in the Rail 
industry, including signalling equipment 
specialists. The company also supplies 
to end users in the Industrial sector, 
including electric panel builders and 
contractors providing installation services 
to the Energy and Utilities sectors. 
 
The Clarendon specialty fastener and 
component business increased revenues 
by 16% over the prior year. Last year, 
Clarendon’s deliveries to its key aircraft 
seating customer were held back by 
changes to aircraft seat designs and 
delays to build schedules. In addition, 
Clarendon’s deliveries to its largest 
customer were reduced during the 
implementation of a large new lineside 
supply project, using the “Clarendon 
Air” solution. This year, revenues 
have increased strongly as deliveries 
of inventory were resumed and the 
customer increased production as its 
new business class seating programmes 
ramped up. Clarendon also had 
significant success increasing sales to 
other aircraft seating and cabin interiors 
manufacturers and sub-contractors 
across Europe and introducing Clarendon 
Air to a number of new customers. 
Clarendon also delivered strong revenue 
growth in its sales to the Motorsport 
sector. As with the IS-Group, Clarendon 
benefited from the increased number 
of races in Formula 1 as well as the 
increased investment from new entrants. 
In addition, revenues were boosted 
in the fourth quarter by increased 
development expenditure by teams 
preparing for design and rule changes 
planned for the 2017 season. In the 
Industrial and Defence markets, the 
business continues to differentiate itself 
from competitors through its range of 
own-designed and engineered fastening 
solutions and added value services.
Fluid Controls
The Hawco Group of Fluid Controls 
businesses, which account for 24% of 
Controls sector revenues, reported a 4% 
growth in revenues against the prior year.
Hawco has seen an upturn in sales 
in the second half of the year across 
all its markets and, in particular, from 
Refrigeration Equipment customers in 
Continental Europe and Turkey. Hawco 
has also benefited from establishing 
relationships with major air conditioning 
and refrigeration contracting groups 
who value Hawco’s stock holding, next 
day delivery and exclusive supplier 
relationships; the partnering with 
independent trade counters has also 
proved successful. In the Industrial OEM 
market, Hawco has seen good success 
with its range of fire detection products, 
cartridge heaters and silicon heater lines. 
Abbeychart has seen revenue growth 
pause in its core coffee segment, as 
overstocking at certain customers is 
being worked through. However, this 
is seen as temporary and Abbeychart 
has continued to enhance its offering 
of essential parts to service the broad 
range of espresso type machines 
being installed in an increasing number 
of outlets. In the soft drinks market, 
Abbeychart has continued to increase 
revenues and take market share, but in 
the water segment, revenues reduced 
as plumbed water dispensers continue 
to lose share against individual bottled 
water. To offset this decline, Abbeychart 
has focused growth initiatives in the 
craft brewing and export markets.

Results in 2016
Diploma delivered a strong performance 
this year, with revenues increasing by 
15% to £382.6m and adjusted operating 
profit increasing by 9% to £65.7m. 
The Group’s financial results were 
characterised by two factors: a strong 
contribution from businesses acquired 
during the past three years and the 
substantial weakening in UK sterling 
in the last quarter of the financial year, 
following the UK’s Brexit vote on Europe. 
The contribution from acquisitions 
completed both this year and last year 
was £26.6m to revenue and £4.2m to 
adjusted operating profit. With ca.75% 
of the Group’s businesses based 
overseas, the impact on headline 
results from currency translation has 
led to an increase in revenues and 
adjusted operating profits of £13.8m 
and £2.7m respectively, when translated 
at last year’s exchange rates. 
Underlying organic growth in all of the 
Group’s markets remained challenging 
throughout the year, which led to 
underlying revenues increasing by 3% 
this year. However, in this lower growth 
environment the Group focused on 
maximising free cash flow, which was 
again very strong at £59.0m. This will 
provide the resources to continue to 
pursue acquisition opportunities which 
should provide a good base for further 
earnings growth in future years.
Underlying revenues are after adjusting 
for the contribution from businesses 
acquired during the year (and from 
the incremental impact from those 
acquired last year) and for the impact 
on the translation of the results of the 
overseas businesses from the significant 
weakening in the UK sterling exchange 
rate in the last quarter of the year.

Adjusted operating margin
The Group’s adjusted operating margin 
remained broadly in line with the first 
half of the year at 17.2% (compared 
with 18.1% last year), continuing to be 
impacted by weaker gross margins 
in the Healthcare businesses. 
Diploma’s Healthcare businesses 
represent ca.25% of Group revenues 
and their gross margins have again been 
impacted this year on a transactional 
basis by the substantial depreciation 
of the Canadian and Australian dollars, 
against the US dollar in particular, 
which is the currency in which most 
of their products are purchased. The 
depreciation of these two currencies 
began in late 2013 and has continued 
through the past two years, reaching 
a low point in mid-January 2016. 
In this financial year, currency 
depreciation led to a 390bps reduction 
in the gross margins of the Canadian 
and Australian Healthcare businesses 
compared with last year. This reduction 
was partly mitigated by a combination 
of forward currency hedges, supplier 
cost reductions and tight control over 
operating costs. However, the ability of 
the Healthcare businesses to continue 
to mitigate this transactional impact on 
gross margins is now quite limited.
The Canadian and Australian exchange 
rates have remained relatively stable 
since the early part of this year at more 
favourable levels and this provided 
the businesses with an opportunity 
to resume forward currency hedging 
during the second half of the year. These 
hedging contracts should provide some 
respite to the currency pressure on 
gross margins in the new financial year, 
although both currencies have begun 
to weaken again in November 2016. 
Transactional currency exposures in 
the rest of the Group’s businesses were 
not significant during the year, despite 
the impact on the UK businesses in 
the last quarter of the year from the 
substantial weakening in UK sterling. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 27

“The businesses 
acquired during the  
past three years 
contributed 20%  
of Group revenues 
in 2016.”
The Group’s adjusted operating 
margin was also impacted by acquired 
businesses which ordinarily join the 
Group with initial operating margins 
which are lower than the Group’s 
adjusted operating margin. With the 
increased acquisition spend over the 
last three years, this has impacted 
the adjusted operating margin 
negatively by 30bps this year. 
However, investment by the Group in 
these acquisitions to grow revenues, 
combined with synergy benefits, 
will generally improve margins in the 
2-3 years post-acquisition and move 
them towards the Group’s average. 
The Group’s adjusted operating margin 
this year was also impacted positively 
by the mix of Group revenues and by 
the absence of one-off costs from 
last year’s reorganisation in the Seals 
businesses. These together accounted 
for a 40bps improvement in the 
Group’s adjusted operating margin.
Adjusted profit before tax, earnings per 
share and dividends
Adjusted profit before tax, which 
excludes the gain on sale of assets, 
increased by 9% to £64.9m (2015: 
£59.6m). The finance expense this year 
was £0.8m (2015: £0.7m) which included 
£0.4m (2015: £0.3m) of interest costs on 
borrowings drawn down during the year 
to help finance acquisitions. The notional 
interest expense on the Group’s defined 
pension liabilities remained unchanged 
at £0.2m (2015: £0.2m) and £0.2m was 
paid as facility commitment fees. 
Statutory profit before tax was £54.0m 
(2015: £51.8m), after acquisition related 
charges of £10.3m (2015: £7.4m), fair 
value remeasurements of £1.3m (2015: 
£0.4m) and a gain of £0.7m (2015: £Nil) 
on disposal of assets. The acquisition 
related charges largely comprise the 
amortisation of acquisition intangible 
assets and the fair value remeasurements 
relate to the put options held over 
minority interests. The increase in the 
charge for remeasurements reflects 
the increase in the liability to acquire 
these minority interests, all of which 
are overseas interests, as a result of the 
significant depreciation in UK sterling.
The Group’s effective tax charge on 
adjusted profit in 2016 was 60bps below 
the previous year at 25.7% of adjusted 
profit before tax. The charge this year 
benefited from a further reduction in the 
UK corporation tax rate to 20% (2015: 
20.5%) and from lower tax rates applied 
to the businesses acquired during the 
past two years; however the effective 
tax rate in the US increased to 38% 
(2015: 36%) because of much lower 
manufacturing tax credits this year.
Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) 
increased by 10% to 41.9p, compared 
with 38.2p last year and the statutory 
basic EPS increased to 33.9p (2015: 32.5p).
The Board’s policy is to increase 
dividends to shareholders each year, 
while targeting towards two times 
dividend cover (defined as the ratio of 
adjusted EPS to total dividends paid and 
proposed for the year). A combination 
of a robust Group balance sheet and 
particularly strong free cash flow 
provides the Directors with confidence 
to recommend an increase in the final 
dividend of 11% to 13.8p per share (2015: 
12.4p). This gives a total dividend per 
share for the year of 20.0p per share 
which represents a 10% increase on 
the prior year dividend of 18.2p. The 
dividend remains 2.1 times covered by 
adjusted EPS, unchanged from last year. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 28

Disposal of assets
The Group made a gain of £0.7m after tax 
on the sale of assets during the year and 
this is disclosed separately on the face of 
the Consolidated Income Statement. The 
Vantage Healthcare business in Canada 
disposed of the Medivators product line 
for consideration of £2.2m, after both 
expenses of sale and providing for the 
costs of integrating the retained Vantage 
business with its affiliate business, AMT 
based in Kitchener. A gain after tax of 
£0.3m was realised on this disposal. The 
Medivators product line accounted for 
ca.8% of DHG’s total revenues in 2016, 
but only ca.3% of adjusted operating 
profit as a substantial part of the 
business’s infrastructure, including a 
large proportion of Vantage’s operational 
employees, were transferred to the 
purchaser as part of the transaction. 
During the year, the Group also sold 
three small legacy properties for 
aggregate proceeds of £2.3m which 
realised a gain of £0.4m after tax.
Free cash flow
The Group generated very strong free 
cash flow in 2016 which increased by 
£18.7m to £59.0m (2015: £40.3m). A 
reduction in working capital contributed 
£6.3m to cash resources (2015: outflow 
of £1.9m) and the proceeds from the 
sale of assets added a further £4.6m to 
free cash flow. Free cash flow represents 
cash available to invest in acquisitions 
or return to shareholders and this 
year represented a cash conversion of 
adjusted earnings of 124% (2015: 93%).
The Group’s businesses continued 
to work hard during the second half 
of the year to further reduce working 
capital, particularly in a low growth 
economic environment. These efforts 
to reduce working capital were again 
largely focused on improving inventory 
procurement processes designed to 
constrain the growth in inventories 
across the Group’s businesses. 
The Group’s KPI performance metric 
of working capital as a proportion 
of revenue reduced to 16.6% at 
30 September 2016, compared with 
17.0% last year; this metric reduces to 
15.3% on a constant currency basis.
Group tax payments increased by £2.2m 
to £17.6m (2015: £15.4m) and included 
£1.5m on pre-acquisition tax liabilities 
relating to Cablecraft and WCIS. On 
an underlying basis and before the 
currency effects of translation, cash 
tax payments represented ca.23% 
of adjusted profit before tax which 
was unchanged from last year. 
 
The Group’s capital expenditure this year 
was more modest at £3.7m, compared 
with £4.3m last year. Within this total 
expenditure, an initial £0.5m was 
invested by J Royal, a Seals business 
based in the US, on the construction 
of a new expanded facility, close by 
their existing facility in North Carolina. 
The total construction cost of this 
facility is expected to be ca.£2.5m on 
completion in April 2017 when it will be 
sold and leased back to the business. 
Operationally, a further £0.9m was 
invested by the Seals businesses during 
the year, including £0.5m on acquiring 
two new seal cutting machines, a new 
crane and other tooling equipment. 
A scheduled upgrade of the US Seals 
ERP system cost £0.2m and £0.2m 
was spent on general infrastructure 
improvements across the Sector.
In Life Sciences, Vantage saw its 
expenditure on funding equipment 
contracts on a cost per procedure (“CPP”) 
basis reduce to £0.3m (2015: £1.0m). 
The investment in field equipment 
acquired in support of customer 
contracts with hospitals also reduced 
to £0.6m from £0.9m last year as the 
Canadian hospitals cut back their 
expenditure. The completion of the 
refurbishment of TPD’s new leasehold 
facility in Ireland cost £0.6m and a 
further £0.4m was invested on general 
infrastructure improvements across 
the Sector, including IT upgrades.
Capital expenditure in the Controls 
businesses remained very modest 
at £0.4m and included £0.2m on 
establishing a separate stand-alone 
warehouse and offices for Clarendon’s 
developing specialty fasteners business 
in the existing IS-Group facility in 
Swindon. The remaining £0.2m was 
invested in new tooling and on upgrading 
IT infrastructure across the Sector. 
The Company paid the PAYE income 
tax liability of £0.3m (2015: £1.0m) on 
the exercise of LTIP share awards, in 
exchange for reduced share awards 
to participants. No further shares in 
the Company were acquired by the 
Employee Benefit Trust this year, 
following last year’s £0.7m expenditure 
on the acquisition of 100,000 shares. 
The Group spent £32.7m of the free 
cash flow on acquisitions, as described 
below and £21.4m (2015: £19.9m) on 
paying dividends to both Company 
and minority shareholders.
Acquisitions completed during the year
The Group invested a further £32.7m 
in acquiring new businesses this year 
(2015: £37.8m), including £1.9m on 
acquiring outstanding minority interests 
and £0.7m of deferred consideration. 
The largest investment this year of 
£21.3m was made in March 2016 to 
acquire Cablecraft, a leading supplier 
of cable accessory products, managed 
from its principal facility near Dunstable 
in the UK. A further £8.4m was invested 
in October 2015 to acquire the WCIS 
businesses in Australia and New 
Caledonia which supply gaskets, seals 
and associated products mainly to 
the Mining industry. In February 2016, 
a small connector business based 
in France was acquired for £0.4m by 
Filcon, to broaden its access to the 
European connector markets. 
These acquisitions added £18.4m to 
the Group’s acquired intangible assets, 
which represents the valuation of 
customer and supplier relationships

ranging from five to ten years. At 
30 September 2016, the carrying value 
of the Group’s acquired intangible assets 
was £54.6m. Goodwill increased by 
£25.9m to £115.2m at 30 September 2016; 
£11.8m related to businesses acquired 
during the year (including fair value 
adjustments to the assets acquired) 
and £14.1m reflected the impact on 
overseas goodwill from the depreciation 
in the UK sterling exchange rate.
Goodwill is not amortised but is assessed 
each year at a Sector level to determine 
whether there has been any impairment 
in the carrying value of goodwill acquired. 
The exercise to assess whether goodwill 
has been impaired is described in note 10 
to the consolidated financial statements 
and concluded that there was significant 
headroom on the valuation of this 
goodwill, compared with the carrying 
value of goodwill at the year end. 
 
Liabilities to minority shareholders
The Group’s liability to purchase 
outstanding minority shareholdings 
at 30 September 2016 decreased to 
£5.1m (2015: £5.7m), following the £1.9m 
purchase in July of an outstanding 10% 
minority shareholding in TPD. However, 
the liability at the year end was impacted 
by the substantial weakening in the UK 
sterling exchange rate which increased 
the UK sterling liability payable to these 
minorities which are all based overseas.
At 30 September 2016, there remain put 
options over the outstanding minority 
interests held in M Seals, Kentek and 
TPD which were valued at £5.1m, based 
on the Directors’ latest estimate of 
the Earnings before Interest and Tax of 
these businesses when these options 
crystallise. None of these options are 
exercisable within the next year.
In addition to the liability to minority 
shareholders, the Group also has 
a liability at 30 September 2016 for 
deferred consideration of up to £1.7m 
(2015: £0.9m) which comprises the 
amount likely to be paid to the vendors 
of businesses purchased during the year, 
based on the Group’s best estimate of 
the performance of these businesses 
next year. During the year, £0.7m 
was paid as deferred consideration 
relating to acquisitions completed in 
earlier years and £0.2m was released 
and was included as a deduction 
from acquisition related charges.
Return on adjusted trading capital 
employed and capital management
A key performance metric that the 
Group uses to measure the overall 
profitability of the Group and its success 
in creating value for shareholders is 
the Return on Adjusted Trading Capital 
Employed (“ROATCE”). At a Group 
level, this is a pre-tax measure which is 
applied against the fixed and working 
capital of the Group, together with all 
gross intangible assets and goodwill. At 
30 September 2016, the Group ROATCE 
had reduced to 21.1% (2015: 23.9%) 
which largely reflected the mismatch of 
a stronger average UK sterling exchange 
rate used to translate the operating 
profit of overseas businesses and the 
much weaker exchange rate used to 
translate the Adjusted TCE of these 
overseas businesses at the year end. 
Adjusted TCE is defined in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Group continues to maintain a 
strong balance sheet with net cash 
funds of £10.6m (2015: £3.0m) at 
30 September 2016, comprising cash 
funds of £20.6m, offset by £10.0m of 
bank borrowings. Surplus cash funds are 
generally repatriated to the UK, unless 
they are required locally to meet certain 
commitments, including acquisitions.
On 7 March 2016, the Group exercised 
the final part of the accordion option 
within its existing revolving multi-
currency credit facilities and increased 
its committed bank facility by £10.0m 
to the maximum available of £50.0m. 
These additional funds were provided 
at a cost of 30bps and were used to 
assist in financing the acquisition of 
Cablecraft. These bank facilities are 
committed until June 2017 and are 
used to meet any shortfall in cash 
to fund acquisitions. These facilities 
will be reviewed and extended or 
renewed at a similar amount during the 
first half of the next financial year.
Employee pension obligations
Pension benefits to existing employees, 
both in the UK and overseas, are 
provided through defined contribution 
schemes at an aggregate cost in 
2016 of £2.5m (2015: £2.3m). 
The Group maintains a legacy small 
closed defined benefit pension scheme 
in the UK which at 30 September 2013 
had a funding deficit of £2.7m. The 
next funding actuarial valuation is 
being carried out as at 30 September 
2016 and the results of this exercise 
will be reported in next year’s Annual 
Report. In Switzerland, local law requires 
Kubo to provide a contribution based 
pension for all employees, which are 
funded by employer and employee 
contributions. This pension plan is 
managed for Kubo through a separate 
multi-employer plan of non-associated 
Swiss companies which pools the funding 
risk between participating companies. 
The Group continues to make regular 
cash contributions to the UK scheme at 
an annual rate of £0.3m, as agreed with 
the scheme actuary, with the objective of 
closing the funding deficit over the next 
six years. However, given the substantial 
reduction in bond yields at 30 September 
2016, compared with those used to 
value the pension liabilities at the last 
valuation in 2013, it is very likely that 
these cash contributions will have to be 
increased in future years to eliminate 
the funding deficit. In Switzerland, 
Kubo’s annual cash contribution to the 
pension scheme is £0.3m (2015: £0.2m).
Both the UK defined benefit scheme 
and the Kubo contribution scheme 
are accounted for in accordance with 
IAS 19 (Revised). At 30 September, the 
aggregate accounting pension deficit 
in these two schemes increased by 
£7.4m to £17.2m because of a further 
significant reduction of bond yields 
compared to last year. The gross 
aggregate pension liability in respect of 
these two schemes at 30 September 
2016 increased by £11.6m to £56.1m 
which is funded by £38.9m of assets.
Potential impact of Brexit
The outcome of the UK’s Brexit vote to 
leave the European Union is unlikely to 
materially impact the Group’s businesses 
at an operational level as only ca.25% 
of the Group’s overall revenues are 
generated in the UK. In addition, these 
businesses, as well as those based in 
Continental Europe, are substantially “in 
country” industrial suppliers of goods 
with very little sales activity being 
carried out across country borders.
At a macroeconomic level however, the 
Group’s financial results have already 
been, and are likely to continue to be, 
impacted by the rapid and substantial 
depreciation in UK sterling that followed 
the Brexit vote. This has resulted in 
gains to the Group’s reported revenues, 
operating profits and net assets from 
translating the results of the Group’s 
overseas businesses into UK sterling. 
In addition, it is also likely that the 
Group’s UK based businesses may 
be impacted to a lesser degree from 
substantially weaker UK sterling; this 
may have an adverse effect on their 
operating margins because of an increase 
in the cost of their goods purchased 
from overseas for sale in the UK.
The Group’s UK businesses remain alert 
to these economic risks and are already 
taking action to mitigate the impact 
on their operating margins through a 
combination of seeking supplier cost 
reductions, price increases to customers 
and tight control over operating costs.  Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 30
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Board is committed to protecting and enhancing Diploma’s 
reputation and assets, while safeguarding the interests of 
shareholders. It has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of risk management and internal control. 
Diploma’s businesses are affected by a number of risks and 
uncertainties. These may be impacted by internal and external 
factors, some of which we cannot control. Many of the risks are 
similar to those found by comparable companies in terms of 
scale and operations. 
Our approach
Risk management and maintenance of appropriate systems 
of control to manage risk is the responsibility of the Board and 
is integral to the ability of the Group to deliver on its strategic 
priorities. The Board has developed a framework of risk 
management which is used to establish the culture of effective 
risk management throughout the business by identifying 
and monitoring the material risks, setting risk appetite and 
determining the overall risk tolerance of the Group. This 
framework of risk management has been further enhanced 
this year and additional processes have been developed which 
will assist the Board to monitor and assess the principal risks 
throughout the year. 
The Group’s risk management systems are monitored by 
the Audit Committee, under delegation from the Board. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the 
effectiveness of the internal control environment of the Group. 
An internal audit function has been established for many 
years to provide independent assurance that the Group’s risk 
management, governance and internal control processes 
are operating effectively.
Identifying and monitoring material risks
Material risks are identified through a detailed analysis of 
individual processes and procedures (bottom up approach) 
and a consideration of the strategy and operating environment 
of the Group (top down approach). 
The detailed risk evaluation process begins in the operating 
businesses with an annual exercise undertaken by management 
to identify and document the significant strategic, operational, 
financial and accounting risks facing the businesses. This 
process is both robust and challenging and ensures risks are 
identified and monitored and management controls are 
embedded in the business’ operations.
The Group uses a quantitative method to determine a Risk Score 
for each risk which is based on both the likelihood of each 
identified risk occurring and the consequence of an adverse 
outcome and its impact on the business. Each business will then 
identify processes established to control each risk and minimise 
its potential impact.
 
The risk assessments from each of the operating businesses  
are then considered by the Board who evaluate the principal 
risks of the Group with reference to the Group’s strategy and 
operating environment. 
Our principal risks and uncertainties
Set out in this section of the Strategic Report are the principal 
risks and uncertainties affecting the Group which have been 
determined by the Board, based on a robust risk evaluation 
process described above, to have the potential to have the 
greatest impact on the Group’s future viability. These risks are 
similar to those reported last year, although with some 
movement on the relative ranking of these risks. 
The risks are each classified as strategic, operational and 
financial or accounting. The Group’s decentralised operations 
with different Sectors and geographical spread reduces the 
impact of these principal risks. 
The Board has also considered the risks associated with the UK’s 
Brexit vote to leave the European Union and this is explained 
further on page 29 in the Finance Review.
The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet 
its liabilities, as they fall due, for the next three years to 
September 2019. The Directors’ assessment has been made 
with reference to the resilience of the Group and its strong 
financial position, the Group’s current strategy, the Board’s 
risk appetite and the Group’s principal risks and how these are 
managed, as described in the Strategic Report. 
The Group has a broad spread of customers and suppliers 
across different geographic areas and independent market 
sectors, often secured with longer term agreements. The 
Group is supported by a robust balance sheet and strong 
operational cash flows. 
The assessment period of three years has been chosen as it is 
consistent with the Board’s triennial review of the Group’s 
strategy at which the prospects of each business are discussed; 
assumptions are made regarding entering into new markets 
and geographies, about future growth rates of the existing 
businesses and about the acceptable performance of existing 
businesses. A robust financial model of the Group is built on a 
business-by-business basis and the metrics for the Group’s KPIs 
are reviewed for the assessment period. These metrics are also 
subject to sensitivity analysis which includes flexing a number 
of the main assumptions, namely, future revenue growth, gross 
margins, operating costs and working capital management. 
The results of flexing these assumptions, both individually and 
in aggregate, are used to determine whether additional bank 
facilities will be required during this period. 
The Directors confirm that this review and analysis also 
considers the principal risks facing the Group, as described on 
pages 31 to 33 and the potential impacts these risks would have 
on the Group’s business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity over the assessment period. The Board considers 
that the diverse nature of the Sectors and geographies in which 
the Group operates acts significantly to mitigate the impact any 
of these risks might have on the Group.

Strategic risk – Downturn in major markets
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
Adverse changes in the major markets in which the businesses 
operate can have a significant impact on performance. This year, 
a number of geopolitical and economic factors have caused 
uncertainty in our principal markets and caused volatility in the 
performance of key economies. The effects of these changes 
can be seen in terms of slowing revenue growth, due to reduced 
or delayed demand for products and services, or margin 
pressures due to increased competition.
A number of characteristics of the Group’s businesses moderate 
the impact of economic and business cycles on the Group as 
a whole:
• The Group’s businesses operate in three differing Sectors 
with different cyclical characteristics and across a number of 
geographic markets.
• The businesses offer specialised products and services, 
which are often specific to their application; this offers a 
degree of protection against customers quickly switching 
business to achieve a better price.
• A high proportion of the Group’s revenues comprises 
consumable products which are purchased as part of the 
customer’s operating expenditure, rather than through 
capital budgets.
• In many cases the products are used in repair, maintenance 
and refurbishment applications, rather than original 
equipment manufacture.
The businesses identify key market drivers and 
monitor the trends and forecasts, as well as 
maintaining close relationships with key customers 
who may give an early warning of slowing demand.
Changes to cost levels and inventories can then be 
made in a measured way to mitigate the effects.
Significant global events are closely monitored to 
determine any potential impact on key markets.
Strategic risk – Loss of key suppliers
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
For manufacturer-branded products, there are risks to the 
business if a major supplier decides to cancel a distribution 
agreement or if the supplier is acquired by a company which has 
its own distribution channels in the relevant market. There is 
also the risk of a supplier taking away exclusivity and either 
setting up direct operations or appointing another distributor.
Currently no single supplier represents more than 10% of Group 
revenue and only six single suppliers represent more than 2% 
each of Group revenue.
Relationships with suppliers have normally been built up over 
many years and a strong degree of interdependence has been 
established. The average length of the principal supplier 
relationships in each of the Sectors is over ten years.
The strength of the relationship with each supplier and the 
volume of activity generally ensures continuity of supply, 
when there is shortage of product.
Long term, multi-year exclusive contracts signed 
with suppliers with change of control clauses, 
where possible, included in contracts for protection 
or compensation in the event of acquisition.
Collaborative projects and relationships maintained 
with individuals at many levels of the supplier 
organisation, together with regular review meetings 
and adherence to contractual terms.
Regular review of inventory levels.
Bundling and kitting of products and provision of 
added value services.
Periodic research of alternative suppliers as part of 
contingency planning.
Strategic risk – Supplier strategy change
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
The success of the businesses depends significantly on 
representing suppliers whose products are recognised in the 
marketplace as the leading competitive brand. If suppliers 
fail to support these products with new development and 
technologies, then our businesses will suffer from reduced 
demand for their products and services. 
Each of the Group’s businesses supply established and leading 
products and related services to customers operating in 
specialised markets. 
The businesses work very closely with each of 
their suppliers and regularly attend industry 
exhibitions to keep abreast of the latest technology 
and market requirements/trends. The businesses 
also meet with key customers on a regular basis 
to gain insight into their product requirements 
and market developments.
Key

 Decrease Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 32
Strategic risk – Loss of key customer(s)
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
The loss of one or more major customers can be a material risk.
The nature of the Group’s businesses is such that there is not a 
high level of dependence on any individual customer and no 
single customer represents more than 5% of Sector revenue or 
more than 2% of Group revenue.
Specific large customers are important to individual 
operating businesses and a high level of effort is 
invested in ensuring that these customers are 
retained and encouraged not to switch to 
another supplier. 
In addition to providing high levels of customer 
service and value added activities, close integration 
is established where possible with customers’ 
systems and processes.
Operational risk – Product liability
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
There is a risk that products supplied by a Group business may 
fail in service, which could lead to a claim under product liability. 
The businesses, in their terms and conditions of sale with 
customers, will typically mirror the terms and conditions of 
purchase from the suppliers. In this way the liability can be 
limited and subrogated to the supplier.
However, if a legal claim is made it will typically draw in our 
business as a party to the claim and the business may be 
exposed to legal costs and potential damages if the claim 
succeeds and the supplier fails to meet its liabilities for whatever 
reason. Product liability insurance can be limited in terms of its 
scope of insurable events, such as product recall. 
Technically qualified personnel and control systems 
are in place to ensure products meet quality 
requirements. The Group’s businesses are required 
to undertake Product Risk assessments and 
comprehensive Supplier Quality Assurance 
assessments. The Group has also established 
Group-wide product liability insurance which 
provides worldwide umbrella insurance cover of 
£20m across all Sectors. 
The Group’s businesses may also elect not to 
supply products if they are not fully confident that 
the products will meet the demands of the 
operating environment.
The Group’s businesses have undergone further 
product liability training during the year and are 
continually reviewed to demonstrate compliance 
with Group policies and procedures relating to 
product liability.
Operational risk – Loss of key personnel
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
The success of the Group is built upon strong, self-standing 
management teams in the operating businesses, committed to 
the success of their respective businesses. As a result, the loss 
of key personnel can have an impact on performance, for a 
limited time period. 
The average length of service of the ca.90 senior managers in 
the Group is 11 years and for all personnel in the Group is 
consistently over six years.
Contractual terms such as notice periods and 
non-compete clauses can mitigate the risk in the 
short term. However, more successful initiatives 
focus on ensuring a challenging work environment 
with appropriate reward systems. The Group places 
very high importance on planning the development, 
motivation and reward for key managers in the 
operating businesses including:
• Ensuring a challenging working environment 
where managers feel they have control over, 
and responsibility for their businesses. 
• Establishing management development 
programmes to ensure a broad base of 
talented managers.
• Offering a balanced and competitive 
compensation package with a combination 
of salary, annual bonus and long term cash 
incentive plans targeted at the individual 
business level.
• Giving the freedom, encouragement, financial 
resources and strategic support for managers 
to pursue ambitious growth plans.

Financial risk – Foreign currency – Translational exposure
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in currency rates will 
affect the Group’s results. The Group operates internationally 
and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various 
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, the 
Canadian dollar and the Euro. The net assets of the Group’s 
operations outside the UK are also exposed to foreign currency 
translation risk.
During the year ended 30 September 2016, ca.75% of the 
Group’s revenue and adjusted operating profits were earned 
in currencies other than UK sterling. In comparison to the prior 
year, the net effect of currency translation was to increase 
revenue by £13.8m and increase adjusted operating profit by 
£2.7m. It is estimated that a strengthening of UK sterling by 10% 
against all the currencies in which the Group does business, 
would reduce adjusted operating profit before tax by 
approximately £4.5m (7%), due to currency translation.
Currency exposures also arise from the net assets of the 
Group’s foreign operations. At 30 September 2016, the Group’s 
non-UK sterling trading capital employed in overseas businesses 
was £199.0m (2015: £171.4m), which represented 77% of the 
Group’s trading capital employed. It is estimated that a 
strengthening of UK sterling of 10% against all the non-UK 
sterling capital employed would reduce shareholders’ funds 
by £18.1m.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of 
overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in 
the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal 
currencies used by the Group, are shown in note 29 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Group operates across a number of 
diverse geographies but does not hedge 
translational exposure.
Financial risk – Foreign currency – Transactional exposure
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
The Group’s UK businesses are exposed to foreign currency risk 
on those purchases that are denominated in a currency other 
than their local currency, principally US dollars, Euros and 
Japanese yen. The Group’s Canadian and Australian businesses 
are also exposed to a similar risk as the majority of their 
purchases are denominated in US dollars and Euros. The Group’s 
US businesses do not have any material foreign currency 
transactional risk.
The Group’s businesses may hedge up to 80% 
of forecast (being a maximum of 18 months) 
foreign currency exposures using forward foreign 
exchange contracts.
The Group finance department monitors rolling 
monthly forecasts of currency exposures.
The Group classifies its forward foreign exchange 
contracts, which hedge forecast transactions, as 
cash flow hedges and state them at fair value at 
each reporting period.
Accounting risk – Inventory obsolescence
Risk description & assessment Mitigation Change
Working capital management is critical to success in specialised 
industrial businesses as this has a major impact on cash flow. 
The principal risk to working capital is in inventory obsolescence 
and write-off.
The charge against operating profit in respect of old or surplus 
inventory in the year was £1.1m but inventories are generally not 
subject to technological obsolescence.
Inventory write-offs are controlled and minimised 
by active management of inventory levels based on 
sales forecasts and regular cycle counts.
Where necessary, a provision is made to cover both 
excess inventory and potential obsolescence.

Corporate Responsibility
Employees
Building and developing the skills, competencies, motivation 
and teamwork of employees is recognised by the Board as being 
essential to achieving the Group’s business objectives. The 
stability and commitment of the employees is demonstrated by 
the average length of service which continues to remain high. 
In addition, the number of working days lost to sickness is ca.1% 
a year. These measures remain consistent across each of the 
Group’s Sectors.

The Group values the commitment of its employees and 
recognises the importance of communication to good working 
relationships. The Group keeps employees informed on matters 
relating to their employment, on business developments and 
on the financial and economic factors affecting the Group. 
This is achieved through management briefings, internal 
announcements, the Group’s website and by the distribution 
of Preliminary and Interim Announcements and press releases.
Copies of the Annual Review and Annual Report & Accounts 
are also made available in the operating businesses. This 
communication programme enables employees to gain a better 
understanding of the Group’s business objectives and their roles 
in achieving them. Both employment policy and practice in the 
Group are based on non-discrimination and equal opportunities. 
Ability and aptitude are the determining factors in the selection, 
training, career development and promotion of all employees.
The Group remains supportive of the employment and 
advancement of disabled persons. Applications for employment 
by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in 
mind the respective aptitudes and abilities of the applicants 
concerned. If an employee is, or becomes disabled during their 
period of employment, the Group will, if necessary and to the 
extent possible, adapt the work environment to enable the 
employee to continue in their current position or retrain 
the employee for duties suited to their abilities following 
disablement. At 30 September 2016, the Group employed five 
disabled employees.
Employment policies throughout the Group have been 
established to comply with relevant local legislation and codes 
of practice relating to employment, Health & Safety and equal 
opportunities. The Group provides good quality working 
environments and facilities for employees and training and 
development appropriate to each of their roles.
Some of the Group’s operating companies have structured 
apprenticeship schemes for technical staff and the Group 
provides sponsorship for high potential employees for higher 
education courses where appropriate. Vocational training is also 
provided and some staff are enrolled on National Vocational 
Qualification (“NVQ”) or similar level courses. Employees are 
actively encouraged to undertake Continuing Professional 
Development (“CPD”) to maintain any relevant professional 
accreditations.
In accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation of the Financial 
Conduct Authority, employees are required to seek approval of 
the Group Company Secretary before dealing in its shares.
Health & safety
The Group is fully committed to ensuring clean, safe and healthy 
working conditions. The Group actively promotes a strong 
safety culture and ensures a collective responsibility for 
ensuring Health & Safety standards are continually improved.
The Chief Executive Officer has overall responsibility for Health 
& Safety policies and procedures across the Group. However, 
in line with the Group’s decentralised management approach, 
accountability for Health & Safety is with local management to 
ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements, culture 
and specific business needs. The Group requires that each 
operating business conducts Health & Safety reviews against its 
specific operational risk profile and local regulatory requirements.
The Group has this year introduced requirements for near miss 
reporting to ensure that Health & Safety hazards are proactively 
identified and appropriate mitigation put in place to ensure that 
they do not result in Health & Safety incidents.

reporting of Health and Safety related issues and it is likely 
that the increased number of minor incidents is in part due to 
improved awareness and reporting. The number of reportable 
lost time incidents has also increased; over half of these 
reported incidents were less than five days’ absence from the 
workplace. Owing to the nature of the Group’s operations, the 
most common types of injury relate to minor cuts, slips/trips or 
manual handling injuries.
All injuries are fully investigated and corrective actions and 
preventative measures put in place to ensure that the incident 
does not reoccur and future risks are mitigated.
Health & Safety forms part of the induction process for new 
employees and where relevant, more specialist training is 
provided for specific functions. The Group has good coverage 
of employees who have formal Health & Safety training and/or 
qualifications and this has continued to increase during 2016. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 35

Human rights
The Group’s activities are substantially carried out in developed 
countries that have strong legislation governing human rights. 
The Group complies fully with appropriate legislation in the 
countries in which it operates.
Environmental
The Group comprises sales and marketing focused businesses 
which essentially receive products from suppliers and despatch 
them to customers. The Group’s businesses do not operate 
delivery fleets; they use third-party carriers to deliver their 
products to customers and to provide much of their packaging 
requirements. The Group’s ability to control the environmental 
impact of its logistics partners is therefore limited. The primary 
impact on the environment, which is entirely in the Group’s 
control, is consumption of the normal business energy sources 
such as heating and power, which the Group aims to minimise 
through compliance with relevant environmental legislation. 
The Group is committed to identifying and assessing 
environmental risks, such as packaging waste, arising from its 
operations. Waste management initiatives are encouraged and 
supported by the Group and materials are recycled where practical. 
Local management are committed to good environmental 
management practices throughout our operations. The 
Managing Directors have responsibility for environmental 
performance of their operating businesses and each subsidiary 
is required to implement initiatives to meet their responsibilities. 
Each facility participates in recycling paper, plastic, cardboard, 
and wood from pallets and continues to focus on minimising 
energy consumption through the efficient use of heating and 
lighting. In addition, a number of the businesses now use fully 
recycled and biodegradable filler materials for packaging.
Greenhouse gas emissions
UK listed companies are required to report their global levels of 
Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions in their Annual Report & 
Accounts. This requirement is for disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 only 
(direct emissions, e.g. heating, cooling, transport fuel and indirect 
emissions, e.g. from purchased electricity) and only to the extent 
that such emissions are the responsibility of the Company.
The Group has considered the six main GHGs and report 
emissions in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent (CO
2
e) for Scope 1 (direct) 
and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions. These emissions are calculated 
following the GHG Protocol and UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines. The Group has used DEFRA UK GHG 
Conversion Factors, US Environmental Protection Agency 
Emission Factors and International Energy Agency Factors.
As a distributor with no owned logistics or freight, the Group’s 
primary direct energy usage and related CO
2
 emissions arise 
from the Group’s facilities. Where possible the Group has 
reported billed data which represents ca.80% of the Group’s 
global emissions. For the remaining entities the Group has used 
an estimation using sales data and local conversion factors.
An intensity ratio of CO
2
e per £1m revenue has been selected, 
which will allow a comparison of performance over time and 
with other similar types of business.

Business ethics
The Group recognises its obligations towards the parties with 
whom the Group has business dealings including customers, 
shareholders, employers, suppliers and advisors.
In general, the interactions with these parties are managed at a 
local level by senior management and the Group expects a high 
standard of expertise and business principles to be maintained 
in such dealings.
The Group’s policy towards suppliers is that each operating 
business is responsible for negotiating the terms and conditions 
under which they trade with their suppliers. The Group does not 
operate a formal code that it follows with regard to payments 
to suppliers. Group companies agree payment terms with their 
suppliers when they enter into binding purchasing contracts for 
the supply of goods or services. Suppliers are, in that way, made 
aware of these terms. Group companies seek to abide by these 
payment terms when they are satisfied that the supplier has 
provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed 
terms and conditions.
Community
The Group believes that good community relations are important 
to the long term development and sustainability of the operating 
businesses. The Group considers the environmental and social 
impacts of conducting business on the community and this 
forms part of the business decision making process.
A selection of community and charitable activities from the 
year include:
In North America
• Somagen Diagnostics supported the Canadian Blood 
Services in their Partners for Life programme and supports 
an academic award in Alberta, Canada for Biomedical 
Engineering Technology.
• Various charitable events at Hercules US including support 
to local charities such as United Way, Clothes To Kids, The 
Haven and Paul B. Stephens Exceptional School for Disabled 
Children.
• J Royal provided support for the National Pancreatic Cancer 
Foundation and the Save the Children Federation.
In Europe and Australia
• Kubo Group sponsored an athlete to enable them to compete 
in the Special Olympics.
• a1-CBISS took part in the Three Peaks Challenge and the 
Anglesey Half Marathon to support Claire’s House 
Children’s Hospice.
• WCIS in Australia took part in a sponsored walk to raise 
money for Breast Cancer Research.
• DSL in Australia built Billy Carts for the Children First 
Foundation which provides support and funding for children 
in developing countries for Healthcare services.
• Big Green Surgical supported the Bangla Smile Project by 
providing sterile disposable surgical instruments to help 
children in Bangladesh.
• FPE Seals supported Downs syndrome research by entering 
a team into the Great North Run and supported a breast 
cancer charity.
• Hawco Group supported a London to Paris cycle ride for 
Pancreatic Cancer UK and the Little Princess Trust which 
provides wigs for children with cancer.
The Group also contributes to local worthwhile causes and 
charities and in 2016 the Group made donations to charitable 
organisations of £44,958 (2015: £35,504). No political donations 
were made. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 36

Dear Shareholder
This year has been a much quieter and more stable year in terms 
of Governance activities after the past two years during which the 
Board was substantially refreshed and more formal Governance 
policies and processes developed and implemented.
 
This period of stability has provided an opportunity for me 
to focus on both the principal tasks and objectives that arose 
from the Board’s Strategic Review held in June last year and the 
recommendations that arose from the external evaluation of 
the Board carried out in September last year. Similarly, both 
Anne Thorburn and Andy Smith have this year settled into their 
new roles as Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committee 
respectively, following their appointments last year.
In June this year, the scheduled Board meeting was largely 
devoted to reviewing the progress achieved to date in 
addressing the key objectives and actions agreed at our Strategy 
Meeting held the previous year. One of these tasks related to 
the greater emphasis to be focused on finding high quality 
acquisitions and it was therefore very encouraging to have 
completed three new acquisitions this year which have both 
broadened the Group’s activities into new geographies and 
market sectors. Overall I am satisfied that we have made good 
progress this year with delivering a number of the objectives we 
identified at our Strategy Meeting and we hope to continue with 
this next year.
We have an ongoing objective to ensure that the Board has an 
opportunity to meet with management and employees of our 
businesses by holding at least one scheduled Board meeting 
each year at one of the Group’s operating companies. In March 
we visited the Clarendon facility in Leicester during which we 
received presentations from management of the Clarendon 
specialty fasteners businesses and had an opportunity to talk 
with employees who work at this facility. Further visits to our 
businesses have been planned for the next financial year.
Succession planning continues to be a principal focus of the 
Board. Following Iain Henderson’s retirement from the Board 
earlier this year, good progress has been made by the Chief 
Executive Officer in setting up a formal Executive Management 
Group comprising a small group of senior managers drawn from 
across the businesses. The Board is encouraged by the breadth 
of experience and challenge this team has brought to the 
Group’s operations and look forward to continuing this 
development in the future.
The coming financial year brings a busy work load to the Board 
with Anne Thorburn leading the Audit Committee’s audit tender 
process as we approach the tenth year with Deloitte LLP as 
Company auditor and with Andy Smith commencing the formal 
triennial review of the Board’s policies governing Directors’ 
remuneration. The result of the audit tender is likely to be 
announced later in 2017 and the proposed policies on Directors’ 
Remuneration will be put to shareholders for approval at the 
AGM in January 2018. 
Finally, as ever I do hope that as shareholders in the Company 
you will be able to find time to attend our AGM on Wednesday, 
18 January 2017. It provides an excellent opportunity to meet the 
Board of Directors and challenge them on any matters you feel 
are important to the development of the Company.

Compliance with the Code
Diploma PLC is required to state whether it has complied with 
the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the 
Code”). The previous Code published in September 2014 was 
revised with minor amendments and reissued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in April 2016. Set out on pages 39 to 61 is an 
explanation of how the Company has complied with the Main 
Principles of the Code. 
The Board confirms that throughout the financial year, the 
Company applied all of the Principles set out in sections A to E 
of the Code for the period under review. The Board also 
confirms that it complies with all of the Provisions of the Code 
as at the date of this Report. 
The Company’s auditor Deloitte LLP, is required to review 
whether the above statement reflects the Company’s 
compliance with the Provisions of the Code specified for their 
review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to 
report if it does not reflect such compliance. 
Framework of Corporate Governance
The Board
The Diploma PLC Board is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for standards of Governance across the 
Group’s businesses. Certain strategic decision-making 
powers and authorities of the Company are reserved as 
matters for the Board. The principal matters reserved 
for the Board are set out below. Day-to-day operational 
decisions are managed by the Chief Executive Officer.
• Setting the overall strategic direction and oversight of the 
management of Diploma PLC. 
• Recommending or declaring dividends. 
• Approval of the Group and Company financial statements. 
• All new bank facilities, or significant changes to 
existing facilities. 
• Assessment and approval of the principal risks facing 
the Group and how they are being managed. 
• Approval of the Viability Statement. 
• Maintaining sound internal control and risk 
management systems. 
• Approval of major corporate transactions and commitments. 
• Succession planning and appointments to the Board. 
• Review of the Group’s overall corporate governance 
arrangements and reviewing the performance of the Board 
and its Committees annually. 
• Approval of the delegation of authority between the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer and the terms of 
reference of all Committees of the Board.
Where appropriate, matters are delegated to a Committee 
which will consider them in accordance with its terms of 
reference. Details of each Committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Diploma PLC website at www.diplomaplc.com.
Audit Committee
Chaired by Anne Thorburn
Number of meetings in the year: six
Role of the Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing and 
monitoring the Company’s financial statements, accounting 
processes, audit (internal and external), internal control systems

relating to fraud, anti-bribery and corruption, sanctions 
and whistleblowing.
Nomination Committee

Number of meetings in the year: two
Role of the Committee
The Nomination Committee regularly reviews the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and its Committees. It identifies 
and nominates suitable candidates to be appointed to the Board 
(subject to Board approval) and considers succession generally.
Remuneration Committee
Chaired by Andy Smith
Number of meetings in the year: four
Role of the Committee
The Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, the 
framework and policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and 
the Executive Directors. The remuneration of the non-Executive 
Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors. The Committee takes into account the business 
strategy of the Group and how remuneration policy should 
reflect and support that strategy. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 40
Corporate Governance continued
Leadership
Board composition 
The Board currently comprises a Chairman, two Executive 
Directors and three independent non-Executive Directors. The 
non-Executive Directors are appointed for specified terms and 
the details of their respective appointments are set out in the 
Remuneration Committee Report on page 53. The biographical 
details of the Board members are set out on pages 36 and 37.
John Nicholas is Chairman of the Board and the Nomination 
Committee. Each of the three independent non-Executive 
Directors performs additional roles; Charles Packshaw serves 
as Senior Independent Director, Andy Smith is Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Anne Thorburn is Chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
Activities of the Board
The Company’s governance framework is set out on page 39 
together with a summary of the formal terms of reference. The 
core activities of the Board and its Committees are planned on 
an annual basis and this framework forms the basic structure 
within which the Board operates.
The Board’s terms of reference also set out the separate and 
distinct roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Chairman is responsible for the overall leadership and 
governance of the Board and ensures that the Directors have 
an understanding of the views of the Company’s major 
shareholders. The Chairman sets the Board’s agenda and 
ensures that there is a healthy culture of challenge and debate 
at Board and Committee meetings.
The Board appoints the Chief Executive Officer and monitors his 
performance in leading the Company and providing operational 
and performance management in delivering the agreed strategy. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for developing, for the 
Board’s approval, appropriate values, culture and standards 
to guide all activities undertaken by the Company and for 
maintaining good relationships and communications 
with investors.
The approval of acquisitions, for the most part, is a matter 
reserved for the Board, save that it delegates to the Chief 
Executive Officer the responsibility for such activities to a 
specified level of authority. Similarly, there are authority levels 
covering capital expenditure which can be exercised by the Chief 
Executive Officer. Beyond these levels of authority, projects are 
referred to the Board for approval.
Other matters reserved to the Board include treasury policies, 
internal control and risk management.
The Company has purchased insurance to cover its Directors 
and Officers against the costs of defending themselves in legal 
proceedings taken against them in that capacity and in respect 
of any damages resulting from those proceedings.
The Company also indemnifies its Directors and Officers to 
the extent permitted by law. Neither the insurance nor the 
indemnity provides cover where the Director or Officer has 
acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
To ensure that non-Executive Directors can constructively 
challenge and support proposals on strategy, the Board has 
adopted a process of reviewing and approving the agreed 
strategy for the Company on a three-yearly basis. The Board 
met for a formal review of the Company’s strategy at the end of 
June 2015 in Zurich, Switzerland. The Board received a number 
of presentations and had thorough and challenging reviews with 
Executive management. In 2016, the Board reviewed progress 
against the objectives set at the Group strategy session and will 
undertake the next formal review in late 2017 or early 2018. 
Meetings of the Board
The Board has this year increased its scheduled meetings in the 
financial year to seven, largely to provide more time to address 
the substantial additional regulatory matters that it is now 
required to consider on a more formal basis. The Board will meet 
more frequently if required. 
The Board ensures that at least one of the scheduled meetings 
is held on site at one of the Group’s facilities, where the Board 
has an opportunity to both receive presentations from local 
management and meet employees of that business. In June 
2016 the Board’s scheduled meeting reviewed the Group’s 
strategic objectives identified at the strategy session held in 
2015 and the Chief Executive Officer provided an update on the 
progress achieved in implementing these objectives. 
Each Director is expected to attend all meetings of the Board or 
Committees of which they are a member. In addition, senior 
management from across the Group and advisors attend certain 
meetings for the discussion of specific items in greater depth. 
This exposure to the members of senior management 
from across the businesses helps enhance the Board’s 
understanding of the businesses, the implementation of 
strategy and the changing dynamics of the markets in which 
the businesses operate. 
Effectiveness
Independent non‑ Executive Directors
The non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board to 
be independent in character and judgement and there are no 
relationships or circumstances which could affect, or appear to 
affect, a Director’s judgement. The Chairman, John Nicholas 
was considered independent by the Board both at the time of 
his appointment as Director on 1 June 2013 and as Chairman on 
21 January 2015. In accordance with the Code, the ongoing test 
of independence for the Chairman is not relevant. 
All non-Executive Directors are advised of the likely time 
commitments at appointment. The ability of individual 
Directors to allocate sufficient time to the discharge of their 
responsibilities is considered as part of the Directors’ annual 
evaluation process, overseen by the Chairman. Any issues 
concerning the Chairman’s time commitment are dealt with 
by the Nomination Committee, chaired for this purpose by the 
Senior Independent Director.
Each non-Executive Director is required to inform the Board of 
any changes to their other appointments.
During the year, the Chairman has also held meetings with the 
non-Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present.
The appointments of non-Executive Directors are subject to 
formal, rigorous and transparent procedures which are 
described more fully in the Nomination Committee Report 
which is set out on page 47. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 41

Diversity
The Board is committed to a culture that attracts and retains 
talented people to deliver outstanding performance and further 
enhance the success of the Group. In that culture, diversity 
across a range of criteria is valued, primarily in relation to skills, 
knowledge and experience and also in other criteria such 
as gender and ethnicity. The Board has considered setting 
objectives in relation to diversity, but does not believe that such 
objectives are appropriate at this juncture, given the relatively 
small Board. The Board will however keep this matter under 
review, particularly in light of Board succession and development.
Information and professional development
An induction programme is agreed for all new Directors aimed 
at ensuring that they are able to develop an understanding 
and awareness of the Group’s core processes, its people and 
businesses. The non-Executive Directors’ awareness of the 
businesses is further developed through periodic visits to the 
principal business locations and presentations to the Board 
by senior management of the businesses. In 2016, the Board 
received presentations from senior management of the 
Clarendon specialty fasteners business.
Following the new appointments to the Board last year, a 
managed induction programme was set up which included a 
visit by each of the new non-Executive Directors to the major 
business units in each of the Group’s Sectors where they have 
an opportunity to meet with senior management in these 
businesses. Meetings were also held individually between each 
of the non-Executive Directors and the Executive Directors and 
with some of the principal advisors to the Company.
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Group Company Secretary, is responsible for ensuring 
that Directors are supplied with information in a timely manner 
that is in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable them to 
discharge their duties. In the normal course of business, the 
Chief Executive Officer gives an oral report to the Board at each 
meeting and information is provided and reported through 
formal Board reports that include information on operational 
matters and strategic developments. There are also reports 
on the performance of the Group’s businesses, financial 
performance relative to the budget, risk management, business 
development and investor relations.
The training needs of the Directors are periodically discussed at 
Board meetings and where appropriate, briefings as necessary 
are provided on various elements of corporate governance and 
other regulatory issues.
The Group Company Secretary acts as an advisor to the Board 
on matters concerning governance and regulatory issues and 
ensures compliance with Board procedures. All Directors have 
access to his advice and a procedure also exists for Directors 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. No such advice was sought during the year. The 
appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary 
and his remuneration are matters for the Board as a whole.
Board evaluation
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of effectiveness 
using specially designed evaluation forms and under the 
direction of the Chairman. This exercise encompasses an 
evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole, as well 
as of each of the Committees and individuals. Feedback on 
Board performances is presented by the Chairman to the Board 
and actions and objectives are agreed for the following year. 
Following the externally led evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the Board carried out in 2015, the Board this year completed its 
annual evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness using internal 
resources. The exercise encompassed an evaluation of the Board 
as a whole, the Board Committees and of individual Directors. 
The externally led evaluation of the Board carried out in 2015 
covered seven topics: Board role and responsibilities; oversight; 
arrangements for Board meetings; support of the Board; Board 
composition; working together and outcome and achievements. 
The facilitator of this evaluation concluded last year that the 
Board’s effectiveness was strong with an average score of 73% 
across each of the seven topics assessed. The facilitator also 
recommended a small number of items that the Board should 
address with the aim of strengthening the Board’s effectiveness. 
The principal matters were:
• the Board should formally review the Group’s controls over 
cyber-risk on a more regular basis. During the year, the Board 
received a Paper which set out both the risks that existed 
across the Group’s businesses in connection with cyber-
crime and the controls that had been set up at the larger 
business clusters to mitigate this risk. The Board also agreed 
to appoint a member of senior management who would have 
responsibility for monitoring and reporting to the Board any 
significant potential cyber-attacks on the Group’s businesses. 
• the Board should target a timetable for circulating  
Board papers and minutes to all members of the Board.  
A revised timetable has now been agreed and has been  
put into operation.
The internal Board evaluation which was carried out in August 
2016 was less rigorous than the externally led evaluation carried 
out last year. The results of the review were satisfactory and 
there were no negative performance issues identified from the 
evaluation that related to individual Directors or the 
performance of the Board Committees. 
The issues identified in this evaluation were more broadly 
focused on matters that the Board believed should be further 
developed for discussion at meetings of the Board. These 
matters included:
• competitive factors facing the principal businesses in each 
of the Sectors;
• potential impact of innovative or disruptive technologies 
on the Group’s activities; and 
• strategies to manage the Group in a post Brexit and 
potentially lower growth environment. 
The Board will report on progress made with implementing 
these recommendations in next year’s Annual Report 
& Accounts.
The Senior Independent Director, together with the non-
Executive Directors also carried out a performance evaluation 
of the Chairman, having taken account of the views of all of 
the Directors. 
Re‑ election
All Directors of the Board are subject to election by the 
shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment 
by the Board and in accordance with the Code, all Directors 
will also stand for re-election annually at the AGM. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 42
Corporate Governance continued
Conflicts of interest
Directors are subject to a statutory duty under the Companies 
Act 2006 (“the Act”) to avoid a situation where they have, or 
could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
could conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Act allows 
directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and 
potential conflicts where appropriate, where the Articles of 
Association (“the Articles”) contain a provision to this effect. 
The Act also allows the Articles to contain other provisions for 
dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach 
of duty. 
Procedures adopted to deal with conflicts of interest continue 
to operate effectively and the Board’s authorisation powers 
are being exercised properly in accordance with the 
Company’s Articles.
Charles Packshaw, the Company’s Senior Independent Director, 
is also Head of UK Advisory and Managing Director in HSBC’s 
global banking businesses which is one of the principal banks 
that provide bank facilities and ancillary banking services to the 
Group and its businesses. The Board remains satisfied that this 
relationship does not provide a conflict of interest. 
Accountability
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report 
& Accounts taken as a whole present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group and provides the 
information necessary to shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. This 
is achieved through this Annual Report & Accounts, the Annual 
Review and through other periodic financial statements and 
announcements.
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and for maintaining sound risk management and 
internal control systems. The Board is also responsible for 
monitoring the Group’s risk management and internal control 
systems and it reviews the effectiveness of these systems 
through the work of the Audit Committee. 
The principal risks which the Board has identified this year are 
set out in the section on Internal Control and Risk Management 
on pages 30 to 33 of the Strategic Report. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a well-developed investor relations 
programme managed by the Chief Executive Officer and Group 
Finance Director. Through this programme, the Company 
maintains regular contact with major shareholders to 
communicate clearly the Group’s objectives and monitors 
movements in significant shareholdings.
During the past several years, these communications have been 
enhanced by the introduction of Investor Days, both in the UK 
and in Canada which were well attended. In addition, Investor 
Roadshows are now held each year in the US and Canada as well 
as in the UK and formal investor presentations are made twice a 
year to groups of private client fund managers. 
Most shareholder contact is with the Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Finance Director through presentations made twice a 
year on the operating and financial performance of the Group 
and its longer term strategy. The Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Finance Director generally deal with questions from 
individual shareholders. 
The Group’s website contains up-to-date information for 
shareholders which includes the Annual Report & Accounts 
of the past seven years, current and historic share price 
information, news releases, and presentations to analysts and 
key shareholders. The website also contains factual data on the 
Group’s businesses, products and services.
The non-Executive Directors are given regular updates as to the 
views of institutional shareholders and an independent insight 
is sought through research carried out twice a year by the 
Company’s advisors, focused on both investors and analysts.
Through these processes, the Board is kept abreast of key 
issues and the opportunity is available on request for 
shareholders to meet the Chairman or Senior Independent 
Director, separately from the Executive Directors.
Electronic communications to shareholders include the Notice 
of the AGM which is sent at least 20 working days prior to the 
meeting. The Company proposes a separate resolution on each 
separate issue and for each resolution, proxy appointment 
forms provide shareholders with the option to vote in advance 
of the AGM.
All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions at the 
Company’s AGM, when the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer give a statement on the Group’s performance during the 
year, together with a statement on current trading conditions. 
The Chairman of the Board and of the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees are available to answer questions at the meeting.
The Board has resolved, in line with best practice, to conduct a 
poll on each resolution proposed at the AGM. The results of the 
AGM resolutions, including details of votes cast, are published 
on the Company’s website.
With regard to other shareholder meetings, other than AGMs, 
the Board will continue, in ordinary circumstances, to provide as 
much notice as possible and certainly no less than 14 working 
days. However, the Board considers that it should still retain the 
flexibility to reduce the timescale to 14 clear days in the case of 
non-routine business and where it is merited by the business of 
the meeting. For this reason, the Board has again proposed a 
resolution at the AGM to reduce the notice period for General 
Meetings from 21 to no less than 14 clear days. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 43

Audit Committee Report
Anne Thorburn
Chairman of the Audit Committee
“There is a strong culture across the 
Group of maintaining robust and 
effective systems of internal control.”
Members of Committee: Attendance
Anne Thorburn (Chairman, appointed on 
17 November 2015) 6/6
Marie-Louise Clayton (retired on 16 November 2015) 1/1
Charles Packshaw 6/6
Andy Smith 6/6
Dear Shareholder
I was appointed to the Board in September last year and became 
Chairman of the Audit Committee in November. I completed a 
detailed induction process with excellent input from the 
executives and finance staff, particularly the Group Internal 
Audit Manager. I also visited a number of the larger business 
units and had discussions with senior operational management. 
I observed a strong culture across the Group of maintaining 
robust and effective systems of internal control over both 
financial and operational processes. I also noted a particular 
focus on rapid integration of new acquisitions to achieve the 
required Group standards. 
While there were no significant new regulatory requirements 
to address this year, the Committee’s agenda was very full 
and is described in detail on page 44. The Group’s financial and 
operational policies and processes are well established and 
no significant control weaknesses were noted from the issues 
reviewed by the Committee during this year. However, it is 
important to continuously review and develop the risk 
management and control systems to support the ongoing 
growth of the Group. During 2016 we introduced an improved 
whistleblowing process and approved plans to increase the 
Internal Audit resource. 
The Committee remains satisfied that the external auditor 
carries out a robust and effective audit with appropriate 
challenge of executive management. However, in 2017 we will 
be initiating an external audit tender process as Deloitte LLP 
approaches its ten year anniversary as Group auditor. 
Finally, I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM on 
18 January 2017 and will be happy to respond to any questions 
relating to the activities of the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee Report continued
Audit Committee
The Committee is chaired by Anne Thorburn and comprises 
three independent non-Executive Directors. The Chair of the 
Committee is a qualified accountant, who has recent and 
relevant financial experience. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that as a whole, the 
Committee has sufficient knowledge and competence in the 
Sectors in which the Group operates in order to provide 
appropriate challenge to management.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee. The Executive Directors also attend Committee 
meetings and the Internal Audit Manager also attended two 
Committee meetings. The Committee met with the external 
auditor and Internal Audit Manager during the year, without the 
Executive Directors being present. 
Engagement of the external auditor
The external auditor is engaged to express an opinion on the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company. The 
audit includes the review and testing of the systems of internal 
financial control and the data contained in the financial 
statements, to the extent necessary for expressing an audit 
opinion on the truth and fairness of the financial statements.
Deloitte LLP has been the Company’s auditor since its 
appointment in 2008. Deloitte LLP provides the Committee with 
relevant reports, reviews and advice throughout the year, as set 
out in their terms of engagement. 
In accordance with UK regulations, the Company’s auditor 
adheres to a rotation policy based on best practice and a new 
Group lead engagement partner was appointed in 2013 in place 
of the previous lead engagement partner who had completed a 
term of five years in that role. 
During the year, the Committee carried out an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. The assessment was 
led by the Chair of the Committee, assisted by the Group Finance 
Director and focused on certain criteria which the Committee 
considered to be important factors in demonstrating an effective 
audit process. These factors included the quality of audit 
staff, the planning and execution of the audit, and the role of 
management in the audit process. Following this assessment, the 
Committee concluded that the external audit process remained 
effective and that it provides an appropriate independent 
challenge of the Group’s senior management.
The Committee remains satisfied that Deloitte continues to 
provide a robust and effective audit, and supports the work of 
the Committee through clear and objective communication on 
developments in financial reporting and governance. 
In 2016, the Committee commenced its review of the 
Company’s audit tender timetable and processes in preparation 
for the audit tender which is likely to carried out during the 
Spring/Summer of 2017. As part of this process, the Committee 
Chair arranged initial meetings with potential engagement 
partners from the audit firms that are likely to be asked to tender 
for the audit. This timing will ensure that there is sufficient 
opportunity, if necessary to transition the audit of the Group 
from the incumbent auditor to the auditor-elect. It is currently 
anticipated that the auditor-elect will shadow the audit of 
30 September 2017 results, before taking on sole responsibility 
as auditor of the Company following the AGM in 2018. 
The Audit Committee confirms that the Company has complied 
with the provisions of the Competition & Markets Authority 
Order throughout its financial year ended 30 September 2016 
and up to the date of this report.

Financial reporting and significant judgements
As part of its monitoring of the integrity of the financial 
statements, the Committee reviews whether suitable 
accounting policies have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate estimates and judgements 
and seeks support from the external auditor to assess them. 
The main issues reviewed in the year ended 30 September 2016 
are set out below: 
Impairment of goodwill
The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill 
and the assumptions underlying the impairment review. 
The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment largely 
relate to the assumptions underlying the calculations of the 
value in use of the Sector being tested for impairment. These 
judgements are primarily the calculation of the discount rate, 
the achievability of strategic business plans and macroeconomic 
assumptions underlying the valuation process. This area is 
a prime source of audit focus and accordingly the external 
auditor provided detailed reporting to the Committee.
Accounting for acquisitions
The Committee reviewed the accounting for acquisitions 
completed during the year and the assumptions underlying the 
valuation of intangible assets. They discussed the nature of the 
intangible assets with the Group Finance Director and the period 
over which these assets are to be amortised. The Committee 
also discussed the fair value adjustments and the value 
attributed to deferred consideration. The Committee also 
discussed with the external auditor the work they had carried 
out to satisfy themselves that the valuation assumptions 
were appropriate. 
Valuation of inventory
The Committee reviewed the Report of the Group Finance 
Director that set out the gross balances by business, together 
with any related provision against the carrying value. The 
Committee reviewed the bases used to value and confirm 
existence of inventory held across the Group; they also 
considered the appropriateness of provisions held against the 
carrying value of inventory, having regard to the age and 
volumes of inventory, relative to expected usage. This matter 
was also discussed with the external auditor. 
The Committee was satisfied that each of the matters set out 
above had been fully and adequately addressed by the Executive 
Directors, appropriately tested and reviewed by the external 
auditor and that the disclosures made in the Annual Report & 
Accounts were appropriate. 
In addition to the main issues reviewed above, the Committee 
also seeks confirmation from the auditor that the Group’s 
businesses follow appropriate policies to recognise material 
streams of revenue and that the audit work carried out more 
generally has assessed any instances where management may 
be able to override key internal controls designed to guard 
against fraud or material misstatement. The auditor also reports 
to the Committee on other less material matters relating to the 
calculation of, and accounting for the gain on sale of assets in 
2016, the Group’s two pension scheme arrangements, 
(accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised)) and the 
Group’s taxation position.
Risk management and internal control
The principal risks and uncertainties which are currently judged 
to have the most significant impact on the Group’s long term 
performance are set out in a separate section of the Strategic 
Report on Internal Control and Risk Management on pages 30 
to 33. 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control. The system of internal 
control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a clear organisational structure 
with defined authority levels. The day-to-day running of the 
Group’s business is delegated to the Executive Directors of the 
Company. The Executive Directors visit each operating unit on 
a regular basis and meet with both operational and finance 
management and staff.
Key financial and operational measures relating to revenues, 
cash and receivables are reported on a weekly basis. Detailed 
management accounts and KPIs are prepared monthly using 
a robust proprietary reporting system to collect and analyse 
financial data in a consistent format. Monthly results are 
measured against both budget and half year reforecasts which 
have been approved and reviewed by the Board. All capital 
expenditure above pre-defined amounts must be supported 
by a paper prepared by business management. 
All financial data is taken directly from the trial balances of 
each business held in their local ERP systems and re-analysed 
and formatted into a separate Group management reporting 
system, operated by the Group finance department. There is 
no re-keying of financial data and very limited use is made 
of spreadsheets by the Group businesses to report monthly 
financial results. The Group finance department continues to 
develop the functionality of this management reporting system 
to provide greater insights into the activities of the Group’s 
businesses. The Group’s internal auditor regularly audits the 
base data at each business to ensure it is collected by the 
management reporting system. 
As part of the year end close process each business is required 
to complete a self-assessment which evaluates their financial 
control environment in the business designed to identify 
weaknesses in controls. These assessments are critically 
reviewed by the Group’s Internal Audit Manager and a summary 
for each business is prepared for the Audit Committee. In 
addition, senior management of each business are required 
to confirm their adherence with Group accounting policies, 
processes and systems of internal control by means of a 
representation letter addressed to the Audit Committee. 
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management and internal control systems for the period 
from 1 October 2015 to the date of this Report. Taking into 
account the matters set out on pages 30 to 33 relating to 
principal risks and uncertainties and the reports from the 
Internal Audit Manager, the Board, with the advice of the 
Committee, is satisfied that the Group has in place effective 
risk management and internal control systems. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 46
Audit Committee Report continued
Internal Audit
The Group’s finance department includes a separate Internal 
Audit function. This function is managed by a qualified internal 
auditor who is based in one of the Group’s businesses in 
Minneapolis in the US. The internal auditor remains a member of 
the Group management team in Diploma PLC and reports directly 
to both the Group Finance Director and Chair of the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee has approved the recruitment 
of an additional internal audit resource, to commence in the 
New Year and be based from the United Kingdom. 
A full programme of internal audit visits has been completed 
during the year. The scope of work carried out by internal audit 
generally focuses on the internal financial controls and risk 
management procedures operating within each business. In 
January, the Internal Audit Manager presents his audit plan for 
the year to the Committee for their approval. Written reports are 
prepared on the results of each visit which set out weaknesses 
identified during the work, together with recommendations to 
improve the control environment. These reports are reviewed 
and discussed with the Executive Directors.
At the conclusion of the financial year, the Internal Audit 
Manager reports to the Committee on the results of the audit 
work carried out in the year. The Committee reviews 
management’s response to matters raised, including the time 
taken to resolve such matters. There were no significant matters 
identified in the internal audits undertaken during the current 
year, with the exception of concerns reported in connection with 
weak systems of internal control in the recently acquired WCIS 
businesses. These weaknesses were quickly addressed by local 
management with the assistance of resources in Group Finance 
and the control environment has now been stabilised. More 
generally, recommendations were made on other internal audits 
this year relating to inadequate inventory reconciliations, weak 
user access controls in some ERP systems and more timely and 
detailed employee expense reporting.
As well as carrying out Internal Audit on financial transactions, 
work was also targeted this year to ensure high level controls 
were in place to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks and 
on processes and documentation supporting foreign 
currency hedging.
The Internal Audit Manager also continues to assist the 
Committee in its oversight of the Group’s controls designed to 
ensure compliance with the policy on anti-Bribery and Corruption. 
The Internal Audit Manager reported to the Committee that 
good progress had been made by the Group’s businesses in 
implementing recommendations communicated last year and in 
particular in improving procedures operating over formalising 
month end close procedures, policies for inventory provisioning 
and controls over supplier master file data.
The Committee continues to keep under review the need 
for a more independent Internal Audit function in the Group. 
The Committee remains satisfied that the Group’s system of 
internal control is appropriate for a group of the size and nature 
of Diploma PLC and the Committee’s current view is that a 
separate formal independent Internal Audit function is not 
required at this time.
Non‑ audit services 
The Committee has reviewed its internal guidelines covering the 
type of non-audit work that can be carried out by the external 
auditor of the Company, in light of the new regulation set out 
in the EU Audit Directive and Audit Regulation 2014. These 
Regulations came into force on 17 June 2016 and apply to the 
Company from 1 October 2017. 
The Regulations substantially curtail those non-audit services 
which can be provided by the auditor to the Company and in 
particular, prohibits all tax related services, including compliance 
services as well as general advice, and all consultancy and 
advisory services. The Regulations require that Board approval is 
required if eligible non-audit services, such as due diligence and 
similar assurance services exceed 30% of the prior year Group 
audit fee and the Company may not allow eligible non-audit 
services to exceed 70% of the Group audit fee, calculated on 
a rolling three-year basis. 
In Diploma PLC, taxation services are not provided by the 
Group’s audit firm; a separate firm is retained to provide tax 
advice and any assistance with tax compliance matters 
generally. In addition, due diligence exercises on acquisitions 
and similar transactions are not provided by the auditor, but are 
placed with other firms.
The Group auditor is retained to carry out assurance services 
to the Committee in connection with carrying out “agreed 
upon procedures” on the Group’s Half Year consolidated 
financial statements.
The Group Finance Director does not have delegated authority 
to engage the auditor to carry out any non-audit work, but must 
seek approval from the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Committee assures itself of the auditor’s independence by 
receiving regular reports from the external auditor which provide 
details of any assignments and related fees carried out by the 
auditor in addition to their normal audit work, and these are 
reviewed against the above guidelines.
Details of the external auditor’s total fees, including non-audit 
fees of £13,000 paid to Deloitte LLP during the year are set out 
in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
Sanctions
The Audit Committee continued to work with senior 
management of the Company, in conjunction with local 
management of Kentek’s Russian operations, to ensure ongoing 
compliance with EU and US led sanctions. The Committee has 
received reports on compliance with these sanctions and will 
continue to monitor developments until the sanctions are 
suspended or revoked. 
Anti‑ Bribery and Whistleblowing
Diploma has a Group-wide anti-Bribery and Corruption policy 
to comply with the Bribery Act 2010 and it periodically reviews 
its procedures to ensure continued effective compliance in its 
businesses around the world. During the year, the Group rolled 
out an e-learning training programme to all its businesses. This 
training has been undertaken by all senior management and 
employees in customer or supplier facing roles. These training 
programmes are regularly carried out and the e-learning training 
programme is being extended to encompass other regulatory 
and compliance based topics, including Code of Conduct. 
During the year, the Committee updated the Group’s 
Whistleblowing Policy, which provides the framework to 
encourage and give employees confidence to “blow the whistle” 
and report irregularities. The Committee approved the roll out 
of a dedicated 24/7 Whistleblowing Hotline across the Group. 
The Policy, together with Hotline posters are placed on site 
noticeboards across the Group. Employees are encouraged to 
raise concerns via the Hotline which is managed by an 
independent external company. Reports to the Hotline are 
investigated and reported to the Committee, together with 
details of corrective action taken. The Group’s Whistleblowing 
Policy is monitored by the Committee and no Whistleblowing 
matters were reported to the Committee under this policy 
during the year.  Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 47

The Nomination Committee is chaired by John Nicholas, the 
Chairman of the Company. The Committee is chaired by the 
Senior Independent Director on any matter concerning the 
chairmanship of the Company. The Committee comprises the 
non-Executive Directors.
The Group Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Appointment of Directors
As part of any appointment process for new Directors, the 
Committee determines the selection criteria for each Director 
which takes account of diversity, including gender and sets out 
a detailed description of the requirements for the role. The 
Committee works with external search agencies as appropriate, 
who draw up a long list of candidates from a range of industries 
and backgrounds for initial appraisal by the Committee. From 
this, a shortlist is prepared of suitable candidates that most 
closely meet the selection criteria and these candidates are 
interviewed by members of the Committee. Following these 
interviews, the Committee recommends to the Board the 
appointment of a Director. As part of this process the 
Committee ensures that it follows the Board’s policy on 
diversity, described on page 41.
Andy Smith and Anne Thorburn, the two non-Executive 
Directors appointed in 2015, completed their tailored induction 
programmes during 2016, having visited the larger facilities 
since appointment. The Chairman has reviewed and agreed 
the training and development needs of individual Directors 
and encourages them to continually update their skills, together 
with knowledge and familiarity with the Company to fulfil their 
role on the Board and Board Committees.
Succession planning
At the strategy meeting held in June 2015, the Board reviewed 
succession planning for the Executive Directors and for the 
senior management cadre comprising ca.90 senior managers 
across the Group’s businesses. At this meeting the Board 
agreed with the Chief Executive Officer to establish an Executive 
Management Group (“EMG”) of key senior managers who will 
have the potential to provide leadership in the future. This 
initiative forms a key part of the Board’s succession planning 
activities. Members of the EMG were confirmed in the early part 
of the year and formal meetings over two days were held in 
March and September at which members of the EMG discussed 
key issues relating to both the shorter term challenges facing 
the Group and longer term development of strategy and 
operational initiatives. 
The Committee also carries out a review of the Board’s 
succession plans for management and their direct reports at a 
formal meeting of the Committee and the Board in January each 
year. This exercise also sets out development plans to target 
potential successor senior management in the Group over the 
next five years.
The Committee has also reviewed succession planning for the 
non-Executive Directors. While the Board has been recently 
refreshed, the Chairman’s intention is to stagger retirement 
among the non-Executive Directors in order to maintain 
continuity and to preserve Board balance.

appropriate and continue to deliver 
a fair and balanced reward package.”

Dear Shareholder
Executive remuneration has been the subject of much analysis 
and debate generally this year and the Committee has noted the 
emerging views and trends. The Committee is confident that 
the Company’s present policy, as approved by shareholders in 
January 2015, remains appropriate and continues to provide an 
effective mechanism to reward and incentivise Executives to 
deliver outstanding performance and achieve the Company’s 
strategic objectives. 
The Regulations governing Directors’ remuneration require the 
remuneration policy to be reviewed during 2017 and this will 
enable the Committee to present an updated remuneration 
policy for shareholder approval at the AGM in January 2018. In 
carrying out the review, the Committee will take into account 
appropriate external guidance, including the recent publication 
on Principles of Remuneration issued by the Investment 
Association, and will consult as appropriate with the Company’s 
larger shareholders. 
This year’s Annual Report on Remuneration is set out on pages 
54–61 of the Annual Report. Remuneration policies have been 
applied without adjustment. 
Base salaries for Executive Directors for the new financial year 
(that is, from 1 October 2016) have increased by 2.5% (2015: 3%) 
in line with general wage inflation and the increases applied 
generally across the Group’s senior management cadre. 
The financial element of the annual performance bonus paid to 
the Executive Directors this year was at 95% of the maximum 
(2015: 51% of the maximum) as determined by the targets set for 
the increase in adjusted earnings per share. The Group delivered 
an increase of 10% in adjusted EPS and the Committee 
considers the bonus payment to be an appropriate level of 
reward for a very strong performance in a global environment 
of sluggish growth. 
The LTIP awards for the three years ended 30 September 2016 
vested at 45% of the maximum (2015: 25%). This was 
determined by a compound increase of 7% p.a. in adjusted 
earnings per share and of 14% p.a. in total returns to 
shareholders over the period. The shareholder returns from 
Diploma PLC have for many years remained well above the 
median returns reported by the FTSE 250 Index, as shown in the 
graph on page 59, and, accordingly, the Committee considers 
the level of LTIP awards vesting to be appropriate. 
As indicated in last year’s Report, Iain Henderson retired as 
an Executive Director of the Company following the AGM on 
20 January 2016 and from full-time employment with the Group 
on 31 March 2016. The Committee was clear that Iain should 
be treated as a “good leaver” given his performance and 
contribution over 18 years’ service and this was communicated 
to all shareholders via the London Stock Exchange RNS at the 
time. Accordingly, Iain received his salary and contractual 
benefits up to 31 March 2016. His annual performance bonus 
and LTIP awards (including the award that would have vested 
at 30 September 2017) have been performance-tested as at 
30 September 2016 and then reduced pro-rata to recognise Iain’s 
actual employment period. 
The Committee will continue to take an active role in reviewing 
the overall remuneration at senior levels in the organisation to 
ensure that they remain consistent with the actual performance 
delivered and effective in attracting and retaining the talent that 
the Group needs. 
I look forward to meeting shareholders at this year’s AGM on 
18 January 2017 and will be pleased to answer any questions or 
concerns they have on the Company’s remuneration policy.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is chaired by 
Andy Smith and comprises independent non-Executive Directors.
Bruce Thompson, Chief Executive Officer, attends meetings 
at the invitation of the Committee to provide advice to the 
Committee to help it make informed decisions. The Group 
Company Secretary attends meetings as Secretary to 
the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee Report
The Report has again been presented this year in two sections. 
The first section repeats the key elements of the Director’s 
Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 
AGM on 21 January 2015. This Policy, which was set out in the 
2014 Annual Report, will continue for a period of three years until 
21 January 2018, unless replaced or amended by a new policy.
The second section of this Report sets out the annual 
remuneration paid to the Directors in the year ended 
30 September 2016. This section of the Report will continue 
to be subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the AGM.
Remuneration principles and structure
The Committee has adopted remuneration principles which are 
designed to ensure that senior executive remuneration:
• is aligned to the business strategy and promotes the long 
term success of the Company;
• supports the creation of sustainable long term 
shareholder value;
• provides an appropriate balance between remuneration 
elements and includes performance related elements 
which are transparent, stretching and rigorously applied; 
• provides an appropriate balance between immediate and 
deferred remuneration; and
• encourages a high-performance culture by ensuring 
performance-related remuneration constitutes a substantial 
proportion of the remuneration package and by linking 
maximum payout opportunity to outstanding results.
The Policy Table set out on the next page summarises the 
components of reward for the Executive Directors of Diploma 
PLC that will govern the Company’s intentions as regards future 
payments. More detailed descriptions of the incentive plans are 
given in the following sections. 
There have been no changes made to this Policy since it was 
approved by shareholders at the AGM in January 2015, with 
the exception that the Committee has approved clawback 
provisions to PSP awards and the annual bonus plan granted to 
Executive Directors after 1 October 2015. This recommendation 
was included in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code.

Executive Directors
Base salary
In determining the annual base salary increases which apply 
from 1 October, the Committee considers comparative salaries 
in similar companies and the range of remuneration increases 
applying across the Group and in particular for the Group’s 
senior management cadre comprising ca.90 senior managers 
across the Group’s businesses.
Annual Performance Bonus
The Diploma PLC Annual Performance Bonus Plan is a cash-
based scheme designed to reward Executive Directors for 
meeting stretching shorter term performance targets. At the 
start of the financial year (1 October), the Board sets a financial 
performance target principally focused on achievement of 
a  target adjusted EPS, which to pay out at the maximum is 
significantly ahead of both internal annual budgets and market 
consensus. The level of bonus payable for achieving the 
minimum target is 5% of base salary. No bonus is payable if 
adjusted EPS does not meet the minimum target.
The definition of adjusted EPS is consistent with the Group’s 
financial statements, however the Committee has discretion 
to modify the definition in the event of changes in accounting 
policy and/or material operational, market, exchange rate or 
environmental factors in order to more appropriately reflect 
management performance. The Committee has discretion 
to reduce awards if minimum thresholds are not achieved 
for adjusted operating margins, free cash flow and return on 
adjusted trading capital employed (“ROATCE”). Where used, 
the rationale for the exercise of this discretion will be disclosed 
in the next Remuneration Committee Report.
Different performance measures and weightings may be used 
for future cycles of the Annual Performance Bonus Plan to those 
set out in the Policy Table to take into account changes in the 
business strategy.
Individual objectives have also been set for the Chief Operating 
Officer (for the six months until his retirement on 31 March 2016) 
and for the Group Finance Director relating to factors 
including operating performance, business and management 
development activities. At the end of the financial year, the 
Committee meets to assess the performance of each Executive 
Director against the financial and individual objectives. Bonuses 
are normally paid in cash in December.
Long term incentive award
The Company operates a long term incentive award plan for 
Executive Directors, being the Diploma PLC 2011 Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”). The PSP is designed to promote the long 
term success of the Company, while also aligning the Directors’ 
interests with those of Diploma PLC shareholders. 
The PSP provides for a grant of conditional awards of a specified 
number of ordinary shares in the Company, or an option to 
acquire a specified number of shares at an exercise price 
determined by the Committee (which may be nil or a nominal 
amount). No payment is required for the grant of an award.
Awards, which are normally granted annually, must generally be 
made within 42 days after the announcement of the Company’s 
annual results. When making the decision on the level of award, 
the Committee takes into consideration a number of factors, 
including the face value of the award and plan dilution limits.
The face value of an award is equal to the number of shares, or 
shares under option, multiplied by the relevant share price. The 
relevant share price will be the mid-market closing share price on 
the day before the award. A face value limit of 175% of base salary 
applies to each PSP award to Executive Directors, although the 
Committee, at its discretion, may increase the face value of an 
award to a maximum of 250% in exceptional circumstances. 
All awards will normally vest on the date on which the 
performance conditions are determined and confirmed by 
the Committee, following the end of the performance period. 
The vesting of awards is conditional on:
• continued employment;
• the Company’s growth in adjusted EPS over a three-year 
performance period; and
• the Company’s TSR performance over a three-year 
performance period.
The latter two performance conditions apply to each award 
so that the vesting of 50% of the award is based on growth in 
adjusted EPS and 50% of the award is based on the relative TSR 
performance. Each performance condition is measured over a 
three-year period commencing on the first day of the financial 
year in which the award is made. There is no retesting of either 
performance metric. At the minimum performance threshold, 
25% of the PSP awards will vest.
The Committee will regularly monitor the continuing suitability 
of the performance conditions and may impose different 
conditions on awards granted in subsequent years, having 
regard to prevailing market conditions.
The Committee may decide, on or before the grant of a share 
incentive award, that on exercise of the award, the participant 
may receive, in addition to the shares in which he then becomes 
entitled, a dividend equivalent in respect of the dividends 
(excluding any tax credit) which would have been paid to the 
participant in respect of shares vesting between the date of 
the award and the time of vesting. These dividend equivalent 
payments may be made in cash or in an equivalent number 
of shares.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, including 
arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered 
by the Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and 
motivate directors of the calibre required to manage the 
Company and successfully deliver its strategic objectives. 
The Committee considers that a rolling contract with a notice 
period of one year is appropriate for existing and newly 
appointed directors. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts, copies of which are 
held at the Company’s registered office, have been updated to 
recognise developments in law and best practice relating to 
such contracts during recent years. These service contracts 
contain provisions for compensation in the event of early 
termination or change of control, equal to the value of salary 
and contractual benefits for the Director’s notice period. The 
Company may make a payment in lieu of notice in the event 
of early termination and the Company may make any such 
payment in instalments with the Director being obliged in 
appropriate circumstances to mitigate loss (for example by 
gaining new employment). Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 52
Remuneration Committee Report continued

recruitment and retention, and that their inclusion is therefore 
in the best interests of shareholders.

Other remuneration policies
Payment for loss of office
The Committee has considered the Company’s policy on 
remuneration for Executive Directors leaving the Company and 
is committed to applying a consistent approach to ensure that 
the Company pays no more than is necessary.
The loss of office payment policy is in line with market practice 
and will depend on whether the departing Executive Director is, 
or is deemed to be treated as, a “good leaver” or a “bad leaver”. 
In the case of a “good leaver” the policy includes:
• Notice period of 12 months’ base salary, pension and 
contractual benefits or payment in lieu of notice.
• Bonus payable for the period worked, subject to achievement 
of the relevant performance condition. Different performance 
measures (to the other Executive Directors) may be set for 
a departing Director as appropriate, to reflect any change 
in responsibility.
• Vesting of award shares under the Company’s long term 
incentive plan is not automatic and the Committee would 
retain discretion to allow partial vesting depending on the 
extent to which performance conditions had been met at the 
date of cessation and the length of time the awards have been 
held. Time pro-rating may be disapplied if the Committee 
considers it appropriate, given the circumstances.
• The Committee will also provide for the leaver to be 
reimbursed for a reasonable level of legal fees in connection 
with a settlement agreement.
When calculating termination payments, the Committee will 
take into account a variety of factors, including individual and 
Company performance, the obligation for the Executive Director 
in appropriate circumstances to mitigate loss (for example, by 
gaining new employment) and the Executive Director’s length 
of service.
Change of control
Change of control provisions provide for compensation equal to 
the value of salary and contractual benefits for the notice period.
In the event of a change in control, vesting of award shares 
under the Company’s PSP depends on the extent to which 
performance conditions had been met at that time. Time 
pro-rating may be disapplied if the Committee considers it 
appropriate, given the circumstances of the change of control.
Malus and clawback
Malus provisions apply to awards made under the Company’s 
long-term incentive and annual bonus plans which give the 
Committee the right to cancel or reduce unvested share awards 
(or in the case of the Annual Performance Bonus Plan, cash 
payments) in the event of material misstatement of the 
Company’s financial results, miscalculation of a participant’s 
entitlement or individual gross misconduct.
Clawback provisions apply to PSP and Annual Bonus Performance 
Plan awards granted to Executive Directors after 1 October 2015. 
The clawback arrangements will permit the Committee to recover 
amounts paid to Executive Directors in specified circumstances 
and will further safeguard shareholders’ interests. 
Remuneration for new appointments
The Committee has determined that new Executive Directors 
will receive a compensation package in accordance with the 
terms of the Group’s approved Remuneration Policy in force 
at the time of appointment. 
The Committee has agreed the following principles that will 
apply when arranging a remuneration package to recruit new 
Executive Directors:
• The remuneration structure will be kept simple where 
practicable, hence the use of base salary, benefits, pension 
(or cash allowance in lieu), annual performance bonus and 
long term incentives.
• The emphasis on linking pay with performance shall 
continue; hence the use of variable pay in the form of an 
annual performance bonus and a long term incentive award, 
which will continue to be a significant component of the 
Executive Directors’ total remuneration package.
• Initial base salary will take into account the experience and 
calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration 
package. Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary 
initially, a series of increases to the desired salary 
positioning may be given over subsequent years subject 
to individual performance.
• The structure of variable pay will be in accordance with 
Diploma’s approved Policy detailed above with an exceptional 
maximum aggregate variable pay opportunity of 375% of 
salary. Different performance measures may be set in the 
first year for the annual bonus, taking account of the 
responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial 
year that the executive joined.
• Benefits will generally be provided in accordance with the 
approved Policy, with relocation expenses/an expatriate 
allowance paid if appropriate.
• In the case of an external recruitment and after having taken 
into account any variable pay awards to be granted to the 
executive, the Committee may also offer additional cash and/
or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the 
best interests of Diploma and shareholders, to replace 
variable remuneration awards or arrangements that an 
individual has foregone in order to join the Group. This 
includes the use of awards made under section 9.4.2 of the 
UK Listing Rules. Any such payments would take account of 
the details of the remuneration foregone including the 
nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements 
attached to that remuneration and any payments would not 
exceed the expected value being forfeited.  Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 53
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
For more information, please visit:  
www.diplomaplc.com/investor-relations.aspx
• In the case of an internal appointment, any outstanding 
variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will 
be allowed to pay out according to the terms of grant.
• For all new Executive Director appointments, deferral 
arrangements will apply, to be set according to the 
circumstances of individual appointments and will involve 
a requirement to acquire shares with a proportion of any 
post-tax annual bonus and/or retention of a proportion of 
PSP shares received (after tax), in either case, any such 
shares to be retained for at least two years after vesting or 
until the mandated shareholding guidelines have been met.
• Fees for a new Chairman or non-Executive Director will be 
set in line with the approved Policy.
Committee discretion
The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under which 
it operates. In addition, it complies with rules which have either 
been approved by shareholders (e.g. the PSP) or by the Board 
(e.g. the Annual Performance Bonus Plan). These rules provide 
the Committee with certain discretions which serve to ensure 
that the implementation of the Policy is fair both to the 
Executive Director and to shareholders, taking the overall 
performance and position of the Company into account. 
The Committee also has discretions to set components of 
remuneration within a range from time to time. The extent 
of such discretions are set out in the relevant rules or in the 
maximum opportunity sections of the Policy Table.
Dilution
In any ten-year period, the number of shares which are or may 
be issued under option or other share awards under any 
executive share plan established by the Company may not 
exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
from time to time. In any ten-year period, the aggregate number 
of shares which are or may be issued under option, or other 
share awards under all share plans established by the Company, 
may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company, from time to time.
Consultation with shareholders and employees
The Committee will consult with its major shareholders in 
advance of any significant changes to the approved Policy. 
The Committee also receives reports from the Group Company 
Secretary on correspondence received from shareholders 
relating to remuneration matters when their approval of the 
Remuneration Committee Report is sought at the AGM.
The Committee has not consulted with employees on setting 
the Policy for Executive Directors.
Comparison with employee conditions
In determining annual increases in base salary, annual 
performance bonuses and benefits, the Committee takes into 
account the employment conditions applying across the senior 
management cadre. This comparator group comprises ca.90 
senior managers across the Group’s businesses. This senior 
management cadre has been chosen as a representative group, 
since comparisons drawn from across the globe and by differing 
roles, skills, experience and qualifications would reduce the 
scope for meaningful comparisons.
Chairman and non‑Executive Directors
Recruitment and term
The Board aims to recruit non-Executive Directors of a high 
calibre, with broad and diverse commercial, international or 
other relevant experience. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee. Appointments of the non-Executive 
Directors are for an initial term of three years, subject to election 
by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment 
and subject to annual re-election thereafter. The terms of 
engagement are set out in letters of appointment which can 
be terminated by either party serving three months’ notice. 
Chairman
John Nicholas was appointed Chairman on 21 January 2015, 
having previously been the Senior Independent Director. His 
appointment is subject to annual re-election by shareholders 
at the AGM.

Fees
The non-Executive Directors are paid a competitive basic annual 
fee which is approved by the Board on the recommendation of 
the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The Chairman’s fee is 
approved by the Committee, excluding the Chairman. Additional 
fees may also be payable for chairing a Committee of the Board 
or for acting as Senior Independent Director. The fees are 
reviewed each year and take account of the fees paid in other 
companies of a similar size and complexity, the responsibilities 
and the required time commitment.

Long term incentive awards
Performance conditions
Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the long-term incentive awards which vest in 2016 and 
the outstanding PSP awards, including those granted in February 2015 and December 2015. 
With effect from 1 October 2014, new PSP awards were granted at 175% of base salary; no further awards have been made under the 
SMP and the final SMP awards vested in November 2016. The performance conditions applying to new awards made under the PSP 
have been revised from those set out below for existing awards granted in 2013, as set out below. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 56
Remuneration Committee Report continued
Annual Report on Remuneration
The first performance condition for the PSP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Company’s adjusted EPS, 
over the three consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the annual 
compound growth rate in the UK Retail Price Index (“RPI”) by a specified amount over the same period. For the new awards, the 
adjusted EPS targets will be specified as absolute figures, not relative to RPI. The performance conditions are as follows:
Existing awards (December 2013) 
Adjusted EPS growth (over three years)
Percentage of existing 
awards vesting
New awards (from October 2014) 
Adjusted EPS growth (over three years)
% of new

RPI + 3% p.a. 30 15 5% p.a. 25
Below RPI + 3% p.a. Nil Nil Below 5% p.a. Nil
Where the Company’s adjusted EPS performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis. 
For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition 
remains consistent with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Company’s TSR over a three-year period to that of the companies in 
the FTSE 250 Index (excluding Investment Trusts). The performance conditions are as follows:
Existing awards (2013) 
TSR relative to FTSE 250 Index (over three years)

Median 30 15 Median 25
Below Median Nil Nil Below Median Nil
Where the Company’s TSR performance is between these percentage bands, vesting of the award is on a straight-line basis. 
The FTSE 250 Index was chosen because this is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company is a member.
Awards vesting in 2016
The PSP and SMP awards made to the Executive Directors on 9 December 2013 and the PSP award made to Iain Henderson on 
5 February 2015, were subject to operating performance conditions as set out in the table above, independently assessed over 
a three year period ended 30 September 2016 and over a two year period ending 30 September 2016, respectively. The outcome 
of each award is shown in the table below:

Dividend equivalent payments
Dividend equivalent payments were paid in respect of outstanding nil cost options which were exercised during the year.
Long term incentive plan – awards granted in the year
The CEO and Group Finance Director received grants of PSP awards on 17 December 2015, in the form of nil-cost options. These 
awards were based on the mid-market price of an ordinary share in the Company at close of business on the day immediately 
preceding the award. 
Under normal circumstances, the options will not become exercisable until the performance conditions are determined after the end 
of the three-year measurement period which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is made, and provided 
the Director remains in employment. The level of vesting is dependent on the achievement of specified performance criteria at the 
end of the three-year measurement period. The performance conditions for these awards are set out on page 56.
Outstanding share‑ based performance awards 
Set out below is a summary of the share-based awards outstanding at 30 September 2016, including both share awards which 
have vested during the year based on performance and share awards which have been granted during the year. The awards set out 
below  were granted based on a face value limit of 100% of base salary for December 2013 and 175% of base salary for February 
and December 2015. No awards will vest unless the performance conditions set out on page 56 are achieved over a three-year 
measurement period.

Executive Directors’ interest in options over shares
In respect of nil cost options granted under the PSP and SMP, the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated on 
the date that the options first vest. The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive 
Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date (he may exercise the options at any time up 
to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant), any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be 
due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option. This increase 
or decrease in value reflects an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2016 and the movements during the year are as follows:

Shareholding guidelines
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, to encourage substantial long term share ownership. These specify 
that, over a period of five years from the date of appointment, the Chief Executive Officer should build up and then retain a holding 
of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base salary. The guideline holding for the Group Finance Director is 100% of base salary. 
The guidelines also require that, in relation to long-term incentive awards, vested shares (net of tax) should be retained by the 
individual until the required shareholding level is reached. As at 21 November 2016, both Executive Directors exceeded the applicable 
shareholding guidelines.

Senior executives below the Board
The policies and practices with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Executive Directors are generally treated 
consistently with the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have a significant portion of their reward package linked 
to performance. Annual bonuses are linked to short term financial targets which use similar performance metrics to the targets 
for the Executive Directors. They also participate in cash based long term incentive plans which are focused on the operating 
profit growth of their businesses over rolling three-year periods. The Committee reviews and monitors the senior executive 
remuneration arrangements. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 62

required by law and regulation to include within the Annual 
Report & Accounts.
Shareholders
Incorporation and principal activity
Diploma PLC is domiciled in England and registered in England 
and Wales under Company Number 3899848. At the date of 
this  Report there were 113,239,555 ordinary shares of 5p each 
in issue, all of which are fully paid up and quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange.
The principal activity of the Group is the supply of specialised 
technical products and services. A description and review of the 
activities of the Group during the financial year and an indication 
of future developments is set out on pages 4 to 35; the Strategic 
Report on pages 1 to 35 incorporates the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) will be held at midday on 
Wednesday, 18 January 2017 in the Brewers Hall, Aldermanbury 
Square, London EC2V 7HR. A circular setting out the proposed 
resolutions, including a resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as 
the auditor, will be set out in the Notice of the AGM which is a 
separate document which will be sent to all shareholders and 
published on the Group’s website.
Substantial shareholdings
At 18 November 2016, the Company had been notified of the 
following interests amounting to 3% or more of the voting rights 
in its ordinary share capital:
Percentage of  
ordinary share capital
Fidelity Management & Research Co. 8.91
Mondrian Investment Partners Limited 7.21
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. 6.15
Mawer Investment Management Limited 5.75
Royal London Asset Management Limited 5.14
BlackRock, Inc. 4.24
Standard Life Investments Limited 3.97
As far as the Directors are aware there were no other interests 
above 3% of the issued ordinary share capital.
Share capital
The rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares, as well 
as the powers of the Company’s Directors, are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be 
obtained from the Group Company Secretary and are available 
on the Company’s website.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfers of 
securities and/or voting rights, other than those relating to the 
Company’s Share Matching Plan (“SMP”), described further 
below. No person holds securities in the Company carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. The 
Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated 
share that is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not 
prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking place on 
an open and proper basis, or where the Company has lien over 
that share. The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer 
of a certificated share, unless the instrument of transfer is: 
(i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered office 
of the Company or any other place as the Board may decide 
accompanied by the certificate for the share(s) to be transferred 
and/or such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably 
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; 
(ii) in respect of only one class of shares; (iii) in favour of a person 
who is not a minor, infant, bankrupt or a person of unsound 
mind; or (iv) in favour of not more than four persons jointly.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an 
uncertified share in accordance with the regulations governing 
the operation of CREST.
Participants in the Company’s SMP pledge investment shares to 
a nominee for a period of three years, during which period these 
shares cannot be transferred. There are no other restrictions on 
the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company except certain 
restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by laws 
and regulations (for example insider trading laws); or where a 
shareholder with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s 
certified shares has been served with a disclosure notice and 
has failed to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares. 
Shares held by the Diploma PLC Employee Benefit Trust
While ordinary shares are held within the Diploma PLC Employee 
Benefit Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are 
exercisable by the Trustees in accordance with their fiduciary 
duties. The Trustees of the Diploma PLC Employee Benefit Trust 
also waive dividends on all shares held for the purposes of the 
Company’s long term incentive arrangements.
Share allotment
A general allotment power and a limited power to allot shares 
in specific circumstances for cash, otherwise than pro rata to 
existing shareholders, were given to the Directors by resolutions 
approved at the AGM of the Company held on 20 January 2016. 
In the year ended 30 September 2016, the Company has not 
allotted any shares. These powers will expire at the conclusion 
of the 2017 AGM and resolutions to renew the Directors’ powers 
are therefore included within the Notice of the AGM in 2017.
Authority to make market purchases of own shares
An authority to make market purchases of shares was given to 
the Directors by a special resolution at the AGM of the Company 
held on 20 January 2016. In the year to 30 September 2016 the 
Company has not acquired any of its own shares. This authority 
will expire at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM and a resolution to 
renew the authority is therefore included within the Notice of 
the AGM in 2017.
Financial 
Results and dividends
The profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders 
was £38.3m (2015: £36.7m). The Directors recommend a final 
dividend of 13.8p per ordinary share (2015: 12.4p), to be paid, 
if approved, on 25 January 2017. This, together with the interim 
dividend of 6.2p (2015: 5.8p) per ordinary share paid on 15 June 
2016 amounts to 20.0p for the year (2015: 18.2p).
Directors’ Report Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 63
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
For more information, please visit:  
www.diplomaplc.com/investor-relations.aspx
The results are shown more fully in the consolidated financial 
statements on pages 64 to 93 and summarised in the Finance 
Review on pages 26 to 29.
Directors’ assessment of going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review on 
pages 26 to 29. In addition, pages 77 to 79 of the Annual Report 
& Accounts include the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources, together with 
a broad spread of customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas and sectors, often secured with longer term 
agreements. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully 
as described further on pages 30 to 33.
The Group also has a committed multi-currency revolving bank 
facility of £50.0m which expires on 23 June 2017. At 30 September 
2016, the Group had cash funds of £20.6m and had borrowings of 
£10.0m. The Directors remain confident that these facilities will 
be extended or renewed before they expire on 23 June 2017.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report & Accounts.
Statement of disclosure
Each of the Directors has reviewed this Annual Report & 
Accounts and confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
& Accounts, including the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations and 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Standards (UK Accounting Standards) 
including FRS 101 (“Reduced Disclosures Framework”).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, to present fairly the financial position and 
the performance of the Group; the Act provides in relation to 
such financial statements, that references in the relevant part 
of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view, 
are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU.
• For the Parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Parent Company financial statements.
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Act. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group’s consolidated financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and the Parent 
Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group 
and Parent Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
• the Annual Report & Accounts includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group; and
• the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6AX. The consolidated financial statements comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 
21 November 2016. These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest 100,000, except where 
otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”, and are set out in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on pages 92 and 93.
2. Alternative performance measures
The Group uses a number of alternative (non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”)) performance measures which 
are not defined within IFRS. The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the 
Group and, as such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP 
measures are referred to in this Annual Report & Accounts:
2.1 Adjusted operating profit
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted operating profit” is defined as operating profit before amortisation and 
impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses, adjustments to deferred consideration (collectively, “acquisition 
related charges”), the costs of a material restructuring or rationalisation of operations and the profit or loss relating to the sale of 
businesses or property. The Directors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the underlying operational 
performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax
At the foot of the Consolidated Income Statement, “adjusted profit before tax” is separately disclosed, being defined as adjusted 
operating profit, after finance expenses (but before fair value remeasurements under IAS 39 in respect of future purchases of 
minority interests) and before tax. The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the underlying 
performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share
“Adjusted earnings per share” (“EPS”) is calculated as the total of adjusted profit before tax, less income tax costs, but including the 
tax impact on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit, less profit attributable to minority interests, divided by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe that adjusted EPS provides an important 
measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash flow
At the foot of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, “free cash flow” is reported, being defined as net cash flow from operating 
activities, after net capital expenditure on fixed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before 
expenditure on business combinations/investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Company’s 
shareholders. The Directors believe that free cash flow gives an important measure of the cash flow of the Group, available for future 
investment or distribution to shareholders.
2.5 Trading capital employed and ROATCE
In the segment analysis in note 3, “trading capital employed” is reported, being defined as net assets less cash and cash equivalents 
and after adding back: borrowings; retirement benefit obligations; deferred tax; and acquisition liabilities in respect of future 
purchases of minority interests and deferred consideration. Adjusted trading capital employed is reported as being trading capital 
employed plus goodwill and acquisition related charges previously written off (net of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets). 
Return on adjusted trading capital employed (“ROATCE”) at the Group and Sector level is defined as the adjusted operating profit, 
divided by adjusted trading capital employed and adjusted for the timing effect of major acquisitions and disposals. The Directors 
believe that ROATCE is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
3. Business Sector analysis
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) for the purposes of IFRS 8 is the Chief Executive. The financial performance of the 
segments are reported to the CODM on a monthly basis and this information is used to allocate resources on an appropriate basis.
For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main reportable business Sectors: Life Sciences, Seals and 
Controls. These Sectors form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below. The principal activities of each of these 
Sectors is described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 35. Sector revenue represents revenue from external customers; there is 
no inter-Sector revenue. Sector results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a Sector, as well as those that can 
be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Sector assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable 
basis to a business Sector. Sector liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities, acquisition 
liabilities and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business Sector. These items are shown 
collectively in the following analysis as “unallocated assets” and “unallocated liabilities”, respectively.

5. Group employee costs
The key management of the Group are the Executive and non-Executive Directors who have authority and responsibility for planning 
and controlling all significant activities of the Group. The Directors’ remuneration and their interests in shares of the Company are 
given in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 48 to 61. The amount charged against operating profit in the year in respect 
of Director short term remuneration was in aggregate £2.4m (2015: £2.3m). The charge for share-based payments of £0.4m (2015: 
£0.5m) relates to the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), described in the Remuneration Committee Report. The fair value of 
services provided as consideration for part of the grant of the LTIP awards has been based on a predicted future value model and 
was £0.2m (2015: £0.2m).

Current tax
The tax charge is based on the profit for the year and comprises:
 UK corporation tax 2.9 2.6
 Overseas tax 13.7 12.5
16.6 15.1
Adjustments in respect of prior year:
 UK corporation tax (0.2) (0.1)
 Overseas tax (0.2) 0.4 
Total current tax 16.2 15.4
Deferred tax
The net deferred tax credit based on the origination and reversal of timing differences comprises:
 United Kingdom (1.6) (1.0)
 Overseas 0.3 –
Total deferred tax (1.3) (1.0)
Total tax on profit for the year 14.9 14.4
In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the Consolidated Income Statement, deferred tax relating to the retirement 
benefit scheme and cash flow hedges of £1.3m was credited (2015: £0.1m credit) directly to the Consolidated Statement of Income and 
Other Comprehensive Income. A further £0.1m (2015: £Nil) was credited to the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity which 
relates to share-based payments made during the year, comprising a current tax credit of £0.1m (2015: £Nil) less a deferred tax charge 
of £Nil (2015: £Nil). 
The gain on disposal of assets during the year included a net credit of £0.3m as described in note 23. This comprised a £0.5m 
deferred tax credit that was partially offset by a £0.2m current tax charge.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The difference between the total tax charge calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 20.0% to the profit 
before tax of £54.0m and the amount set out above is as follows:
2016 
£m
2015 
£m
Profit before tax 54.0 51.8
Tax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 20.0% (2015: 20.5%) 10.8 10.6
Effects of:
– change in UK tax rates (0.1) –
– higher tax rates on overseas earnings 4.1 3.7
– adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years (0.4) 0.3
– other permanent differences 0.5 (0.2)
Total tax on profit for the year 14.9 14.4
The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas. The UK corporation tax rate was unchanged at 20.0%. As the Group prepares its 
consolidated financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation tax in respect of the year 
ended 30 September 2016 was also 20.0% (2015: 20.5%) and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the above reconciliation. The 
Group’s net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in the US are taxed at rates of up to 
ca.38%. 
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2016 have been calculated based on the future UK corporation tax rate 
of 17.0%, substantively enacted at 30 September 2016. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 72

The Directors have proposed a final dividend in respect of the current year of 13.8p per share (2015: 12.4p) which will be paid on 
25 January 2017, subject to approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 18 January 2017. The total dividend for the 
current year, subject to approval of the final dividend, will be 20.0p per share (2015: 18.2p). 
The Diploma PLC Employee Benefit Trust holds 172,577 (2015: 221,438) shares, which are ineligible for dividends. 
9. Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary 5p share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year of 113,058,835 (2015: 113,007,084) and the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of £38.3m (2015: £36.7m). 
There are no potentially dilutive shares.

The Group tests goodwill for impairment generally twice a year. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the Group’s three operating Sectors. This reflects the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored by management 
and reflects the Group’s strategy of acquiring businesses to drive synergies across a Sector, rather than within an individual business. 
The impairment test requires a “value in use” valuation to be prepared for each Sector using discounted cash flow forecasts. The cash 
flow forecasts are based on a combination of annual budgets prepared by each business and the Group’s strategic plan. Beyond five 
years, cash flow projections utilise a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash flow forecasts relate to gross margins, revenue growth rates and the discount rate.  
The gross margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience; revenue growth rates generally 
approximate to the average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a 
business, such as start-ups. The annual growth rates used in the cash flow forecasts for the next five years represent the budgeted 
rates for 2017 and thereafter, average growth rates for each Sector; these annual growth rates then reduce to 2% over the longer term.

10. Goodwill continued
The cash flow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation using a single market derived pre-tax discount rate of ca.11% 
(2015: 12%). This single rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses operating 
generally in well developed markets and geographies and with robust capital structures. As these features are consistent between 
each of the Group’s Sectors the Board considers that it is more appropriate to use a single discount rate applied to each Sector’s cash 
flow forecasts.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill in any of the Sectors was identified.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions noted above to determine whether a “reasonably 
possible adverse change” in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. The analysis indicates that a 
“reasonably possible adverse change” would not give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the three Sectors.

19. Financial instruments
The Group’s overall management of the financial risks is carried out by a central treasury team under policies and procedures which 
are reviewed and approved by the Board. The treasury team identifies, evaluates and where appropriate, hedges financial risks in 
close co-operation with the Group’s operating businesses. The treasury team does not undertake speculative foreign exchange 
dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than a small number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and 
short term deposits, investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities. Trade 
and other receivables, and trade and other payables arise directly from the Group’s day-to-day operations. 
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital management. 
An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below and on 
page 33 within Internal Control and Risk Management, all of which have been audited. 
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations; this arises principally from the Group’s trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances (including 
deposits) held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies, and large public and private wholesalers, to small 
privately owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world. Trade receivable exposures are 
managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for each customer. 
The Group establishes a provision for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specific trade and other 
receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable. When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the provision 
is written off against the underlying receivable. During the year, the Group had no significant unrecoverable trade receivables; there 
have been no other significant trade receivables written off in the past five years other than £0.2m written off in 2015. 
Exposure to counterparty credit risk with financial institutions is controlled by the Group treasury team which establishes and 
monitors counterparty limits. Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is “AA” or better.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows:
Carrying amount
2016 
£m
2015 
£m
Trade receivables 54.8 44.8
Other receivables 2.4 4.0
Cash and cash equivalents 20.6 23.0
77.8 71.8
There is no material difference between the book value of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date. An analysis 
of the ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16. An analysis of cash 
and cash equivalents is set out in note 18.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group continually monitors 
net cash and forecasts cash flows to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet the Group’s requirements in the short, 
medium and long term. Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored regularly and during 2016 all covenants were 
complied with fully. 
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return 
on deposits. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group 
also has a committed £50.0m revolving bank facility which expires on 23 June 2017. During the year the Group exercised an accordion 
option in respect of £10.0m and increased the committed bank facility to the maximum facility of £50.0m in order to provide cash 
resources to complete an acquisition during the year. Interest on this facility is payable at between 120 and 170bps over LIBOR, 
depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. The Group will review its bank facilities during the next financial year. At 30 September 
2016, £10.0m of the facility had been drawn down (2015: £20.0m). 
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows:

Trade payables 35.8 25.8
Other payables 2.7 2.0

The maturities of the undiscounted financial liabilities are as follows:
Less than one year 40.2 30.5
One to two years 2.0 0.6
Two to five years 3.9 4.7
46.1 35.8
Less: discount (0.8) (1.4)
45.3 34.4
There is no material difference between the book value of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date. 
c) Currency risk
The Group’s principal currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, 
Canadian dollars and Euros. The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents 
and these balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively. Net foreign exchange gains of £0.8m (2015: £0.2m) 
were recognised in operating profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts in certain of the Group’s businesses to hedge forecast transactional exposure 
to movements in the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. These forward foreign exchange contracts are classified as cash flow hedges 
and are stated at fair value. The notional value of forward contracts as at 30 September 2016 was £25.9m (2015: £25.2m). The net fair 
value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2016 was £0.2m (2015: £1.2m). The amount removed 
from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the Consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was £1.5m 
(2015: £0.3m). The change in the fair value of cash flow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the year was £0.2m 
(2015: £1.5m).
Management considers that the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the US dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro. The Group’s 
sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in UK sterling against each of these currencies (with all other variables held constant) is as follows:
2016 
£m
Decrease in adjusted operating profit (at average rates)
US dollar: UK sterling (1.8)
Canadian dollar: UK sterling (1.4)
Euro: UK sterling (0.9)
Decrease in total equity (at spot rates)
US dollar: UK sterling (4.3)
Canadian dollar: UK sterling (7.9)
Euro: UK sterling (1.6)
d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Group’s results. The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily 
from its cash funds and borrowings. The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates. All cash deposits, held in the UK 
and overseas, are held on a short term basis at floating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent 
rate. Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between 
one and six months at rates that are generally fixed by reference to the relevant UK base rate, or equivalent rate. An increase of 1% in 
interest rates would not have a significant impact on the Group’s adjusted profit before tax. An analysis of cash and cash equivalents 
at the reporting dates is set out in note 18. 
e) Fair values
There are no material differences between the book value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value. The basis for 
determining fair values are as follows:
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end forward rates, adjusted for the forward points to the contract’s value date with 
gains and losses taken to equity. No contract’s value date is greater than 18 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the book value is deemed to reflect the fair value. 
Other liabilities
The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reflect the fair value.

f) Capital management risk
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence and to provide 
good returns to shareholders which will support the future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group 
comprises cash and cash equivalents, longer term debt (which includes bank borrowings) and equity attributable to equity holders 
of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the Group’s approach 
to capital management during the year. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or increase bank borrowings.

At 30 September 5.1 5.7
At 30 September 2016, the Group retained put options to acquire minority interests in TPD, Kentek and M Seals. On 14 July 2016 and 
following the exercise of a put option, the Group acquired 10% of the minority interest outstanding in TPD for total consideration of 
£1.9m (€2.3m).
At 30 September 2016, the estimate of the financial liability to acquire the outstanding minority shareholdings was reassessed by the 
Directors, based on their current estimate of the future performance of these businesses and to reflect foreign exchange rates at 
30 September 2016.
This led to a remeasurement of the fair value of these put options and the liability was increased by £0.8m (2015: reduced by £0.1m) 
which related to foreign exchange and by a £0.5m (2015: £0.5m) charge from unwinding the discount on the liability. In aggregate 
£1.3m (2015: £0.4m) has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
The put options to acquire the remaining minority interest of 10% held in TPD are exercisable in November 2017 and November 2019; 
the put option to acquire the minority interest of 10% held in M Seals and the 10% held in Kentek are exercisable in October 2018.

on the performance of these businesses in the period following their acquisition by the Group.
During the year, outstanding deferred consideration of £0.6m (€0.8m) was paid to the vendor of Kentek relating to the purchase 
of his minority interest last year. In addition, £0.1m (US$0.2m) was paid to the vendor of HPS in respect of the performance of the 
business in the year ended 30 September 2015. The balance of £0.2m was not required and has been deducted from acquisition

On 12 October 2015, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of West Coast Industrial Supplies Pty Limited based in Perth, 
Australia and its affiliate company, West Coast Industrial Supplies New Caledonia SAS based near Noumea in New Caledonia 
(together “WCIS” ) for an aggregate maximum consideration of £9.8m (A$20.5m).
The cash paid on acquisition was £7.6m (A$15.8m), after adjustments to net assets of £1.2m (A$2.7m) and including net debt acquired 
of £0.4m (A$0.8m), but before acquisition expenses of £0.4m (A$0.8m). Maximum deferred consideration of up to £1.0m (A$2.0m) 
is payable based both on the performance of WCIS during the year ended 30 September 2016 and on the renewal of specific 
customer contracts. 
On 24 February 2016, the Group acquired 100% of Ascome SARL, based in Paris, France, for total consideration of £0.7m (€0.8m), 
including cash acquired of £0.3m (€0.4m); £0.6m (€0.7m) was paid on completion and £0.1m will be paid in 2017.
On 8 March 2016, the Group acquired 100% of Cablecraft Limited based in Houghton Regis, England, together with its trading 
subsidiaries Birch Valley Plastics Limited and Krempfast Limited (together “Cablecraft”) for initial consideration of £27.2m, which 
included £6.2m of surplus cash and was before acquisition expenses of £0.7m. A further £0.1m was paid based on the final net assets 
at completion. Maximum deferred consideration of up to £5.0m is payable based on the performance of Cablecraft for the 12 months 
ended 31 March 2017.

22. Acquisition of businesses continued
From the date of acquisition to 30 September 2016, the newly acquired WCIS business contributed £6.7m to revenue and £0.7m to 
adjusted operating profit, the newly acquired Cablecraft business contributed £9.2m to revenue and £1.7m to adjusted operating profit 
and the newly acquired Ascome business contributed £0.4m to revenue and had a negligible contribution to adjusted operating profit. 
If  these businesses had been acquired at the beginning of the financial year, they would in aggregate have contributed on a pro rata 
basis £23.2m to revenue and £3.6m to adjusted operating profit. However these amounts should not be viewed as indicative of the 
results of these businesses that would have occurred, if these acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of the year.

The Group has a committed multi-currency revolving facility of £50.0 million (2015: £40.0 million) which expires on 23 June 2017. On 
7 March 2016, the Group exercised an accordion option to increase the committed bank facility from £40.0 million to a maximum 
facility of £50.0 million. At 30 September 2016, the Group had total borrowings under this facility of £10.0 million (2015: £20.0 million). 
Interest on this facility is payable between 120 and 170bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. The Group will 
review its bank facilities during the next financial year.
26. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group maintains two pension arrangements which are accounted for under IAS 19 (Revised) “Employee Benefits”. The principal 
arrangement is the defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, maintained by Diploma Holdings PLC and called the Diploma Holdings 
PLC UK Pension Scheme (“the Scheme”). This Scheme provides benefits based on final salary and length of service on retirement, 
leaving service or death and has been closed to further accrual since 5 April 2000. 
The second and smaller pension arrangement is operated by Kubo in Switzerland and provides benefits on retirement, leaving 
service or death for the employees of Kubo in accordance with Swiss law. Kubo was acquired by the Group on 13 March 2015. 
The Kubo pension scheme is a defined contribution based scheme, which for various technical reasons, is required under IFRS 
to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised).

arrangements is:

Diploma Holdings PLC UK Pension Scheme
The Scheme is subject to a Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004 which requires that a valuation of the Scheme 
is carried out at least once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met. As part of the process 
the Company must agree with the Trustees of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory 
Funding Objective. The most recent triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013 reported that the Scheme had 
a funding deficit of £2.7m and held assets which covered 90% of its liabilities at that date. The next triennial actuarial valuation of the 
Scheme will be carried out as at 30 September 2016 and the results of the valuation will be reported in the 2017 Annual Report & 
Accounts. There were no Scheme amendments, curtailments or settlements during the year.
The Scheme is managed by a set of Trustees appointed in part by the Company and in part from elections by members of the 
Scheme. The Trustees have responsibility for obtaining valuations of the fund, administering benefit payments and investing 
the Scheme’s assets. The Trustees delegate some of these functions to their professional advisors where appropriate.

The Scheme exposes the Company and therefore the Group, to a number of risks:
• Investment risk. The Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while 
these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, volatility over the short term can cause additional funding 
to be required if a deficit emerges.
• Interest rate risk. The Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the 
liabilities. As the Scheme’s assets include equities, the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way.
• Inflation risk. A significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. The Scheme’s assets are expected 
to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long term, however movements over the short term could lead to funding 
deficits emerging.
• Mortality risk. In the event that members live longer than assumed, a larger funding deficit may emerge in the Scheme.

Risk mitigation strategies
When setting the investment strategy for the Scheme, the Trustees, in conjunction with the employer, take into account the liability 
profile of the Scheme. The current strategy is designed to broadly match assets and liabilities in respect of pensioner members, but 
to invest in growth assets in respect of non-pensioners. Annuity policies have been taken out in respect of some historic pensioners, 
but the Scheme has not purchased annuities for retirements since 2005.

Effect of the Scheme on the Group’s future cash flows
The Company is required to agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustees of the Scheme following each triennial actuarial 
valuation. Following the triennial actuarial valuation carried out as at 30 September 2013, the Company agreed to contribute £0.3m 
in cash annually to the Scheme. The next valuation of the Scheme is being carried out as at 30 September 2016.
The Kubo Pension Scheme (“the Kubo Scheme”)
In accordance with Swiss law, Kubo’s pension benefits are contribution based with the level of benefits varying according to category 
of employment. Swiss law requires certain guarantees to be provided on such pension benefits. Kubo finances its Swiss pension 
benefits through the ASGA Pensionskasse, a multi-employer plan of non-associated companies which pools risks between 
participating companies. As at 30 September 2016 the ASGA Pensionskasse had a local coverage ratio of 108.7%.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The accounting policies set out below have 
been consistently applied in 2016 and the comparative year. 
There were no new Standards, amendments or interpretations 
to existing Standards which have been published and endorsed 
by the EU and which have a significant impact on the results, 
financial position or presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 30 September 2016.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, except for derivative 
financial instruments which are held at fair value. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on 
a going concern basis, as discussed on pages 62 and 63.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries). Control exists when the Company 
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The assets, 
liabilities and results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into 
line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial 
statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Non-controlling interests, defined as minority interests, in the 
net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately 
from the Group’s equity therein. Minority interests consist of the 
amount of those interests at the date of the original business 
combination and the minority’s share of changes in equity since 
the date of the combination.
1.3 Acquisitions
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method 
as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. Goodwill at the acquisition date 
represents the cost of the business combination (excluding 
acquisition related costs, which are expensed as incurred) plus 
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in 
excess of the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Minority interests may be initially measured at fair value or, 
alternatively, at the minority interest’s proportionate share of 
the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement basis is made for each business 
combination separately.
1.4 Divestments
The results and cash flows of major lines of businesses that have 
been divested have been classified as discontinued businesses. 
There were no discontinued operations in either 2016 or 2015.
1.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for goods and services supplied to 
customers, after deducting sales allowances and value added 
taxes; revenue receivable for services supplied to customers, 
as opposed to goods, is less than ca.3% of Group revenue. 
Revenue is recognised when the risk and rewards of ownership 
transfers to the customer, which depending on individual 
customer terms, is at the time of despatch, delivery or upon 
formal customer acceptance. Provision is made for returns 
where appropriate. Service revenue received in advance is 
deferred and recognised on a pro rata basis over the period 
of the contract.
1.6 Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the 
defined contribution and defined benefit type. The defined 
benefit plan is operated by Diploma Holdings PLC and is closed 
to the accrual of further benefits.
a) Defined contribution pension plans: Contributions to the 
Group’s defined contribution schemes are recognised as 
an employee benefit expense when they fall due.
b) Defined benefit pension plan: The deficit recognised in the 
balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension plan 
is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit cost method and by 
discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest 
rates on high quality corporate bonds. The pension expense 
for the Group’s defined benefit plan is recognised as follows:
i) Within the Consolidated Income Statement:
–  Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments 
– where the item that gave rise to the settlement or 
curtailment is recognised in operating profit.
–  Interest cost on the net deficit in the plan – calculated 
by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability at the start of the annual reporting period.
ii) Within the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other 
Comprehensive Income (“Other Comprehensive Income”):
–  Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and 
liabilities of the plan arising from actual experience and 
any changes in assumptions at the end of the year.
 The Group has adopted a policy of recognising all actuarial 
gains and losses for its defined benefit plan in the period in 
which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income 
Statement, but in Other Comprehensive Income.
c) Share-based payments: Equity-settled transactions (which 
are where the Executive Directors and certain senior 
employees receive a part of their remuneration in the form  
of shares in the Company, or rights over shares) are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined  
at the grant date takes account of the effect of market based 
measures, such as the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
targets upon which vesting of part of the award is 
conditional, and is expensed to the Consolidated Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding credit to equity. The cumulative 
expense recognised is adjusted to take account of shares 
forfeited by executives who leave during the performance 
or vesting period and, in the case of non-market related 
performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely that 
shares will vest. For the market-based measure, the Directors 
have used a predicted future value model to determine fair 
value of the shares at the date of grant.
 The Group operates an Employee Benefit Trust for the 
granting of shares to Executives. The cost of shares in the 
Company purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust are 
shown as a deduction from equity.
Group Accounting Policies
For the year ended 30 September 2016 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 88
1.7 Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are 
prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which that entity 
operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results and financial position of each entity are 
translated into UK sterling, which is the presentational currency 
of the Group.
a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency:
 Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
At each subsequent balance sheet date:
i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences arising on the settlement or retranslation 
of monetary items are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not retranslated.
iii) Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are retranslated using the exchange rates at the 
date the fair value was determined. Where a gain or loss 
on non-monetary items is recognised directly in equity, 
any exchange component of that gain or loss is also 
recognised directly in equity and conversely, where a gain 
or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement, any exchange 
component of that gain or loss is also recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
b) Translation from functional currency to presentational 
currency:
 When the functional currency of a Group entity is different 
from the Group’s presentational currency, its results and 
financial position are translated into the presentational 
currency as follows:
i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates 
prevailing at the balance sheet date.
ii) Income and expense items are translated at average 
exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such 
an average rate does not approximate the exchange rate 
at the date of the transaction, in which case the 
transaction rate is used.
iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income; these cumulative exchange 
differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in the period in which the foreign operation is 
disposed of.
c) Net investment in foreign operations:
 Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms 
part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign 
operation are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in the separate financial statements of the 
reporting entity or the foreign operation as appropriate. 
In the consolidated financial statements such exchange 
differences are initially recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income as a separate component of equity and subsequently 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on 
disposal of the net investment.
1.8 Taxation
The tax expense relates to the sum of current tax and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year, which differs 
from profit before taxation as reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Taxable profit excludes items of income and 
expense that are taxable (or deductible) in other years and also 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax, including UK corporation tax and 
overseas tax, is calculated using rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax is recognised on differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Temporary 
differences arise primarily from the recognition of the deficit 
on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the difference 
between accelerated capital allowances and depreciation and 
for short term timing differences where a provision held against 
receivables or inventory is not deductible for taxation purposes. 
However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax profit, nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are also recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is possible that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. No deferred tax is 
recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, 
as the Group controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated 
Income Statement, except when the item on which the tax or 
charge is credited or charged directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. The carrying amount 
of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of 
the assets to be recovered. Tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to enforce current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred 
income tax relates to the same fiscal authority.
1.9 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred 
in bringing the asset into use, but excluding interest. All repairs 
and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other items of 
property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available 
for use and is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on 
a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less residual value of 
the asset, over its estimated useful life as follows:
Freehold property –  between 20 and 50 years 
Leasehold property –  term of the lease
Plant and equipment
–  plant and machinery between  
3 and 7 years
–  IT hardware between 3 and 5 years
–  fixtures and fittings between  
5 and 15 years
Hospital field equipment – 5 years

1.9 Property, plant and equipment continued
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated 
useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at 
each financial year end. Assets held under finance leases are 
depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis 
as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant 
lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses 
arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales 
proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
1.10 Intangible assets
All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business 
combination, are stated at their amortised cost or fair value less 
any provision for impairment.
a) Research and development costs
 Research expenditure is written off as incurred. Development 
costs are written off as incurred unless forecast revenues for 
a particular project exceed attributable forecast development 
costs in which case they are capitalised and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life. Costs 
are capitalised as intangible assets unless physical assets, 
such as tooling, exist when they are classified as property, 
plant and equipment.
b) Computer software costs
 Where computer software is not integral to an item of 
property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised as other 
intangible assets. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line 
basis over its useful economic life of between three and 
seven years.
c) Acquired intangible assets – business combinations
 Intangible assets that may be acquired as a result of a 
business combination, include, but are not limited to, 
customer lists, supplier lists, databases, technology and 
software and patents that can be separately measured at fair 
value, on a reliable basis, are separately recognised on 
acquisition at the fair value, together with the associated 
deferred tax liability. Amortisation is charged on a straight-
line basis to the Consolidated Income Statement over the 
expected useful economic lives.
 Fair values of customer and supplier relationships on larger 
acquisitions are valued using a discounted cash flow model; 
databases are valued using a replacement cost model. For 
smaller acquisitions, intangible assets are assessed using 
historical experience of similar transactions.
d) Goodwill – business combinations
 Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents 
the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the 
consideration over the aggregate fair value of the identifiable 
intangible, tangible and current assets and net of the 
aggregate fair value of the liabilities (including contingent 
liabilities of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition). 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is 
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Transaction costs are expensed and 
are not included in the cost of acquisition.
1.11 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying 
amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the 
higher of: (i) its fair value less costs to sell: and (ii) its value in use; its 
value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected 
to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit, discounted 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset or cash-generating unit. Impairment losses are 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
a) Impairment of goodwill
 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to a 
cash-generating unit; cash-generating units for this purpose 
are the Group’s three Sectors which represent the lowest 
level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored by 
the Group’s Board of Directors for internal and management 
purposes. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may 
be impaired.
 If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the goodwill attributable to the 
cash-generating unit. Impairment losses cannot be 
subsequently reversed.
b) Impairment of other tangible and intangible assets
 Other tangible and intangible assets are reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1.12 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (generally calculated 
on a weighted average cost basis) and net realisable value, after 
making due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving inventory. 
Cost comprises direct materials, duty and freight-in costs.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale.
1.13 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group 
balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
a) Trade receivables
 Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value, do not 
carry any interest and are reduced by a charge for impairment 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Such impairment 
charges are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
b) Trade payables
 Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are initially 
measured at their nominal value. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 90
1.13 Financial instruments continued
c) Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, interest 
bearing deposits, bank overdrafts and short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and 
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank 
overdrafts are repayable on demand and can form an integral 
part of the Group’s cash management.
d) Put options held by minority interests
 The purchase price of shares to be acquired under options 
held by minority shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries are 
calculated by reference to the estimated profitability of the 
relevant subsidiary at the time of exercise, using a multiple 
based formula. The net present value of the estimated future 
payments under these put options is shown as a financial 
liability. The corresponding entry is recognised in equity as a 
deduction against retained earnings. At the end of each year, 
the estimate of the financial liability is reassessed and any 
change in value is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, as part of finance income or expense. Where 
the liability is in a foreign currency, any change in the value 
of the liability resulting from changes in exchange rates is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
e) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
 The Group holds derivative financial instruments in the form 
of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign 
currency exposure. These derivatives are designated as cash 
flow hedges. 
 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and subsequent changes 
in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised in equity in the hedging reserve and in Other 
Comprehensive Income, and are reclassified to profit or loss 
on maturity of the derivative. Changes in the fair value of 
foreign currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not 
meet the criteria for hedge accounting in accordance with 
IAS 39 are recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
 The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, 
the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged 
items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy 
for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on 
an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting 
changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
 No derivative contracts have been designated as fair value 
hedges or net investment hedges.
f) Borrowings
 Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration received. They are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost. Borrowings are classified as non-current 
when the repayment date is more than 12 months from the 
period-end date or where they are drawn on a facility with 
more than 12 months to expiry.
1.14 Investments (available for sale financial assets)
The investment held by the Group comprises equity shares which 
are not held for the purposes of equity trading and in accordance 
with IAS 39 is classified as available for sale. They are initially 
recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they 
are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised 
in Other Comprehensive Income.
1.15 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. Leases include hire purchase contracts 
which have characteristics similar to finance or operating leases. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals 
payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive 
to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line 
basis over the expected lease term.
1.16 Other liabilities
Other liabilities are recognised when the Group has legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is 
possible that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. 
Other liabilities are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of 
the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date. 
1.17 Dividends
The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved 
at the AGM; interim dividends are charged in the period they 
are paid.
1.18 Share capital and reserves
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The Group 
also maintains the following reserves:
a) Translation reserve – The translation reserve comprises all 
foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of 
the financial statements of foreign businesses.
b) Hedging reserve – The hedging reserve comprises the 
effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair 
value of cash flow hedging instruments that are determined 
to be an effective hedge. 
c) Retained earnings reserve – The retained earnings reserve 
comprises total cumulative recognised income and expense 
attributable to shareholders. Bonus issues of share capital 
and dividends to shareholders are also charged directly to 
this reserve. In addition the cost of acquiring shares in the 
Company and the liability to provide those shares to 
employees, is accounted for in this reserve. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity 
share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury 
shares or indirectly within an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of 
income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently 
sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders. These shares are used to satisfy 
share awards granted to Directors under the Group’s share 
schemes. The Trustee purchases the Company’s shares on the 
open market using loans made by the Company or a subsidiary 
of the Company.

1.19 Related parties
There are no related party transactions (other than with the 
Executive Directors who are considered to be key management) 
that are required to be disclosed in accordance with IAS 24. 
Details of their remuneration are given in the Remuneration 
Committee Report on pages 48 to 61.
1.20 Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments 
to published standards not yet effective
The IASB has published a number of new standards, 
amendments and interpretations to existing standards which 
are not yet effective, but will be mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2016. Set 
out below are those which are considered most relevant to 
the Group:
• IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”: IFRS 15 
is effective for the Group for the year ended 30 September 
2019. The Group is completing an impact assessment on the 
consolidated financial statements but expects the impact to 
be isolated to the Life Sciences Sector.
• IFRS 16 “Leases”: IFRS 16 is effective for the Group for the 
year ended 30 September 2020 and the Group anticipates 
commencing an impact assessment on the consolidated 
financial statements towards the end of 2017.
The following new or amended standards are not expected 
to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements:
• IAS 1 “Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 1”
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 “Clarification of acceptable methods 
of depreciation and amortisation”
• IFRS 14 “Regulatory deferral accruals”
• IAS 12 “Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses”
• IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
1.21 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In order to prepare these consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 1.1 to 
1.20 above, management has used estimates and judgements 
to establish the amounts at which certain items are recorded. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are those which 
have the greatest impact on the financial statements and require 
the most difficult and subjective judgements about matters that 
are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on factors 
including historical experience and expectations of future events 
that management believe to be reasonable. However given the 
judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be 
different from the assumptions used. The critical accounting 
estimates and judgements are set out below:
1.21.1 Goodwill impairment
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to 
which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance 
of the Group over future periods. To assist in making this 
judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment of the 
carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill, using 
discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the “value in use” to 
the Group of the capitalised goodwill. This calculation is usually 
based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period 
and using a perpetuity to incorporate expectations of growth 
thereafter. A discount factor is applied to obtain a current value 
(“value in use”). The “fair value less costs to sell” of an asset is 
used if this results in an amount in excess of “value in use”.
Estimated future cash flows for impairment calculations are 
based on management’s expectations of future volumes and 
margins based on plans and best estimates of the productivity 
of the assets in their current condition. Future cash flows 
therefore exclude benefits from major expansion projects 
requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure 
has not been approved at the balance sheet date.
Future cash flows are discounted using discount rates based on 
a market derived weighted average cost of capital, adjusted if 
appropriate for circumstances specific to the asset being tested. 
The weighted average cost of capital is impacted by estimates 
of interest rates and equity returns and is reviewed on an 
annual basis.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an 
appropriate period over which to view the future results of 
the Group’s businesses for this purpose. Changes to the 
assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts 
could significantly alter the Directors’ assessment of the 
carrying value of goodwill.
1.21.2 Accounting for acquisitions 
When the Group makes a large acquisition it recognises the 
identifiable assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, 
at fair value, with the difference between the fair value of 
net assets acquired and the fair value of consideration paid 
comprising goodwill. The most significant assets acquired are 
intangible assets (predominantly customer relationships); the 
key assumptions used to determine the valuation of intangible 
assets acquired are the forecast cash flows, the discount rate 
and customer attrition. Customer relationships are valued using 
a discounted cash flow model. Acquisitions often comprise an 
element of deferred consideration and may include a minority 
interest, which are subject to put options. These put options 
are also required to be fair valued at the date of acquisition. 
Deferred consideration is fair valued based on Directors’ 
estimate of future performance of the acquired entity. 
1.21.3 Inventory and trade receivable provisions
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to 
establish the net realisable value of various elements of working 
capital, principally inventory and trade receivables. Impairment 
charges are made against obsolete or slow-moving inventories, 
bad or doubtful receivables.
The decision to make an impairment charge is based on the 
facts available at the time the consolidated financial statements 
are approved and are also determined by using profiles, based 
on past practice, applied to certain aged inventory and trade 
receivables categories. In estimating the collectability of trade 
receivables, judgement is required in assessing their likely 
realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each 
customer and related ageing of the past due balances. Specific 
accounts are assessed in situations where a customer may not 
be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of 
its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy.
1.21.4 Future purchases of minority interests
The Group’s financial statements include a financial liability for 
the net present value of the expected amount that it will pay in 
future years to acquire the outstanding shares held by minority 
shareholders in the Group’s subsidiaries. This amount is based 
on the Directors’ estimate of the future profitability of the 
relevant subsidiary and the assumption that year end exchange 
rates will remain consistent until the exercise of the option. Any 
changes to the estimated profitability of the relevant business 
and/or changes to the assumption of the relevant exchange 
rate, will change the estimate of this financial liability. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 92

a) Accounting policies
a.1) Basis of accounting
The Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosures Framework”. The Directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Parent Company Financial Statements. The Parent Company Financial Statements are presented in UK sterling and 
all values are rounded to the nearest million pound (£m) except when otherwise indicated.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company. There 
were no gains or losses either in the current or preceding years recognised in other comprehensive income. 
In the transition to FRS 101 from extant UK GAAP, the Company has applied IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards” whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101. The transition to FRS 101 
from extant UK GAAP has not required any measurement and recognition adjustments to previously reported equity, net assets or 
profit after taxation.
The following disclosures have not been provided as permitted by FRS 101: 
• a cash flow statement and related notes;
• a comparative period reconciliation for share capital;
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• disclosures in respect of capital management;
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRS;
• an additional statement of financial position for the beginning of the earliest comparative period; and
• disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel as required. 
As the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the 
exemption under FRS 101 available in respect of the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” 
in respect of group settled share-based payments.
a.2) Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when received. Final dividend distributions are recognised in the Company’s financial statements 
in the year in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
a.3) Diploma PLC Employment Benefit Trust and employee share schemes
Shares held by the Diploma PLC Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) are stated at cost and accounted for as a deduction from 
shareholders’ funds in accordance with UITF 38. Shares that are held by the Trust are not eligible for dividends until such time 
as the awards have vested and options have been exercised by the participants.
a.4) Auditor’s remuneration
Fees payable to the auditor for the audit of the Company’s accounts of £3,500 (2015: £3,500) were borne by a fellow Group undertaking.
b) Directors’ and employees’ remuneration
No remuneration is paid directly by the Company; information on the Directors’ remuneration (which is paid by an immediate holding 
company) and their interests in the share capital of the Company are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 48 to 
61. The Company had no employees (2015: none).

Opinion on financial statements of Diploma PLC
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 “Reduced

The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Income and Other 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related 
notes 1 to 29 and the Group Accounting policies. This also

Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal 
risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained on page 63 and the Directors’ 
statement on the longer term viability of the Group contained 
within the Strategic Report on page 30. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 30 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 31 to 33 that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in the Directors’ Report about 
whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements;
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Diploma PLC
• the Directors’ explanation on page 30 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also 
confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. 
For each of these risks we assessed whether the key controls, 
which are in place to prevent material misstatements in the 
financial statements, were designed appropriately. In addition, 
we assessed that the implementation of these controls was, in 
practice, effective in preventing such material misstatements. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Last year our report included one other risk which is not included 
this year: appropriateness of trade receivables provisioning.
This risk was no longer one of the areas which had the greatest 
impact on our audit strategy. The majority of the Group’s 
receivables are current and the level of bad debt write-offs has 
fallen on the prior year. The amount of overdue debt as a 
percentage of gross debtors has also fallen on the prior year. 
The policy applied in calculating the receivable provision 
remained consistent. 
The description of the below risks should be read in conjunction 
with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on page 45. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 95

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Recoverability of goodwill and assessment for impairment
Refer also to page 43 (Audit Committee Report), page 87 for 
the Group Accounting Policies and note 10 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 72).
As at the year end the Group held an aggregate of £115.2m of 
goodwill (2015: £89.3m) on the Statement of Financial Position 
and, as such, it is the most significant asset class. This goodwill 
has been recognised in respect of acquisitions that the Group 
has undertaken in the current and prior years.
We consider that the carrying value of goodwill is a key area 
due to the judgemental inputs involved in the assessment 
for impairment. There are a number of such inputs used 
when assessing for impairment including projected cash 
flows, determination of the discount rate, the allocation of 
cash-generating units, long term growth rates and the 
sensitivities applied.
We have obtained management’s goodwill impairment review 
calculations and assessed the mechanical accuracy of the 
model. Furthermore, we challenged the assumptions and 
inputs used in the impairment model including the cash flow 
projections, discount rates, cash-generating unit allocation, long 
term growth rates and the sensitivities applied and disclosed.
Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with 
reference to historical trading performance and the Board-
approved budget, and consulting with our valuation specialists 
who benchmarked assumptions such as the discount rate to 
external macroeconomic and market data.
We challenged management’s allocation of cash-generating 
units by confirming that it was consistent with prior years, 
assessing whether they still represented the smallest group of 
assets that generated independent cash flows, and confirmed 
that the allocation is consistent with how financial information 
is reported within the business.
The long term growth rate used in the cash flow projections was 
assessed to check that it did not exceed the average long term 
growth rate in any territories in which the Group operates.
Having ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions 
that either individually or collectively would be required for the 
assets to be impaired by reperforming sensitivity analysis on 
the key assumptions, we considered the likelihood of such a 
movement in those assumptions arising and the adequacy of 
the disclosures within the financial statements.
Accounting for acquisitions
Refer also to page 43 (Audit Committee Report), page 87 for 
the Group Accounting Policies and note 22 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 80).
The Group has made two material acquisitions in the year in 
WCIS and Cablecraft Limited. The total combined consideration 
transferred for these acquisitions was £29.7m and an additional 
£18.2m of goodwill and £11.7m of intangibles was recognised. The 
judgements used in determining the value of the goodwill and 
intangibles and the allocation between these asset classes could, 
if performed inaccurately, lead to a material misstatement.
Inaccuracy in this judgement could be caused in the 
following areas:
• There is significant judgement and complexity involved in 
the allocation of excess consideration over net assets of 
the acquiree between intangible assets and goodwill. This 
includes estimates for perpetuity growth rates, discount 
rates and customer retention rates.
• Management must exercise judgement to accurately 
measure the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as 
at the acquisition date. This includes, for example, assessing 
the amounts required for any additional inventory or 
receivables provisions.
We have obtained management’s calculations for the accounting 
of each acquisition and performed the following procedures:
• We checked the mathematical accuracy of each 
acquisition model. 
• We assessed the adjustments to assets and liabilities in order 
to bring them to fair value and have held discussions with 
management in order to challenge the completeness of 
these adjustments.
In order to assess the accuracy of the acquired intangible assets 
valuation, we have reviewed the methodology applied in 
management’s calculation and challenged the assumptions 
behind the calculation including the perpetuity growth rates, 
discount rates, and customer retention rates. We have 
involved our own internal specialists to assist in our assessment 
and compare the methodology and inputs to standard 
industry practice. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 96
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Appropriateness of inventory obsolescence provisioning
Refer also to page 43 (Audit Committee Report), page 87 for the 
Group Accounting Policies and note 15 of the consolidated 
financial statements (page 75).
The valuation of inventory as at 30 September 2016 is £66.8m 
(2015: £56.6m), recorded net of provisions of £7.8m (2015: 
£5.9m). High levels of inventory are held across the Group, which 
gives rise to a greater risk of there being slow moving or 
obsolete lines of inventory. Therefore, we have determined that 
there is a key risk that inventory is recorded in excess of its net 
realisable value due to insufficient obsolescence provisions.
Management judgement is required in determining the 
completeness of inventory provisions and making an 
assessment of their adequacy, considering the age and volumes 
of inventory relative to expected usage.
Changes to these assumptions could result in a material change 
in the carrying value of inventory and the associated 
movements recorded in the income statement.
We evaluated the recorded inventory obsolescence provision 
by obtaining management’s workings and independently 
recalculating the provision in line with their stated policy. 
We challenged the underlying assumptions and completeness of 
the provision by considering the age and volumes of inventory 
relative to expected usage. Any aged inventory lines which were 
excluded from management’s calculation were also challenged 
in order to further verify completeness of the provision.
Management’s historical ability to estimate the required 
inventory obsolescence provision was assessed by comparing 
write-offs during the period to the prior period provision.
Furthermore, we compared the actual sales value of a sample of 
inventory items to their book value to ascertain that the carrying 
value of inventories does not exceed their net realisable value.
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Diploma PLC continued
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work. We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.7m 
(2015: £2.7m), which is approximately 5% of profit before tax 
(2015: 5%).
Profit before tax has been chosen for the basis for materiality 
as this is the measure by which stakeholders and the market 
assess the wider performance of the entity and is the key metric 
that current and potential investors monitor when making their 
financial decisions.
Audit of all components are performed at a materiality level 
not exceeding 50% of Group materiality in both 2016 and 2015.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £130,000 
(2015: £53,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, 
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. Having 
assessed the facts and circumstances of the Group and the 
prior history of misstatements, we determined that an increase 
in this threshold from the prior year was appropriate. We also 
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of 
the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level and where these are most likely to occur in the business. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at 12 (2015: 11) locations, with the 
increase from the prior year due to the acquisition of Cablecraft 
Limited. Each of these 12 locations was subject to a full scope 
audit. An additional eight (2015: eight) locations were subject to 
specified audit procedures which address each of the significant 
balances and key audit risks within these entities. Together the 
work at these locations represents the principal business units 
of the Group and accounts for 75% (2015: 75%) of the Group’s 
revenues and 80% (2015: 80%) of the Group’s operating profit.
The Group audit team has designed and implemented a country 
visit programme so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or another 
senior member of the Group audit team visits the component 
locations to hold discussions with the lead partner, review their 
working papers, conclude on any findings and attend close out 
meetings with local management. Each year this programme of 
visits includes the three most significant territories (being the 
US, Canada and UK).
Where no visits are carried out the Senior Statutory Auditor or 
another senior member of the team has held discussions with 
the lead partner and attended close out meetings by phone.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process 
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
in the aggregated financial information of the remaining 
components not subject to audit or specified audit procedures. 
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 97
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
For more information, please visit:  
www.diplomaplc.com/investor-relations.aspx
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report 
if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Remuneration 
Committee Report to be audited is not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from 
our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), 
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have 
not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team 
and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

Notes
1 Acquisition related charges comprise the amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisitions expenses and adjustments to 
deferred consideration.
2 Acquisition liabilities comprise amounts payable for the future purchases of minority interests and deferred consideration.
3 ROATCE represents adjusted operating profit, before acquisition related charges, as a percentage of adjusted trading capital employed (adjusted for the 
effect of the timing of major acquisitions and disposals). Trading capital employed and adjusted trading capital employed are calculated as defined in 
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
4 Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in accordance with note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
5 Total shareholders’ equity per share has been calculated by dividing equity shareholders’ funds by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the year end.
6  Dividend cover is calculated on adjusted earnings as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

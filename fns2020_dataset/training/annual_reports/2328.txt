During the course of 2009 there was 
a notable change in sentiment within 
the oil sector. At the start of the year the 
oil price was around $35 per barrel, global 
exploration had been scaled back and 
share prices of oil companies had fallen. 
However, the oil price progressively 
increased towards $80 per barrel by 
the end of the year and this rise was 
accompanied by a noticeable change 
in appetite for exploration risk, including 
frontier exploration. This was partly 
to do with success stories in places 
such as Ghana, Uganda, Kurdistan 
a n d 	 S i e r r a 	 L e o n e . 	 I n 	 t h e 	 fi r s t 	 h a l f 	 o f	
2010 the oil price has stabilised around 
the $80 to $85 per barrel mark.
Against this background, our activity during the 
year involved consolidating our prospect inventory and 
initiating preliminary well planning. We have also focused

drilling programme. Deep water wells are expensive and 
having commissioned a well cost analysis, the board 
considered that it required around $185 million to fund 
2 to 3 wells with contingency, assuming 100% funding 
of the wells along with all the mobilisation and 
demobilisation costs of the rig and equipment. 
In November 2009 the Board decided that the market 
conditions were right to support a major fundraising 
and the company successfully raised $190 million 
(before expenses) at a price equivalent to the then 
market price. The response was incredible and we 
were delighted with the quality of the new institutional 
shareholders. We believe that the positive response 
f r o m 	 m a j o r 	 f u n d s 	 r e fl e c t s 	 t h e 	quality	of	the	technical	
case and the quality of the work undertaken to date but 
most importantly, the quality of the initial prospects that 
have been prioritised for drilling.
I would like to welcome our new shareholders and thank 
them for their support. I would also like to thank our new 
joint-brokers Mirabaud, along with existing joint-brokers 
Panmure Gordon and Ocean Equities, for their help in 
making the issue such a success.

www.bordersandsouthern.com
Borders & Southern’s cash balance of $206.3 million 
at year end allows us to move forward independently 
to fund the wells that we would like to drill and to set 
our own time line. In this regard, we are currently trying 
to source a deep water rig to be active in the next 
summer season in the Falklands (the back end of 2010 
and	the	first	quarter	of	2011).	There	are	rigs	available	
in this time frame but it is a competitive environment 
with others competing for the same rigs. However, we 
are optimistic that we can meet our objectives and will 
inform shareholders once we have secured a suitable rig. 
As we look forward, the next twelve months should prove 
the most exciting in our short history as we source a rig, 
finalise	the	well	planning	and	begin	drilling	the	acreage.

“ The fund raising in November 
was a tremendous success. 
Our forward programme 
is now fully funded which 
allows us to control our 
own destiny.”
We operate from the Falkland Islands
Borders & Southern’s objective is to test 
the hydrocarbon potential of the east-west 
trending fold belt, located approximately 
150 km to the south of the Falkland Islands. 
This fold belt trend contains numerous large 
simple structures (up to 150 sq km in area), 
including thrust cored anticlines and tilted 
fault	blocks.	The	clear	definition	of	these	
structures has been achieved through the 
acquisition of 2,862 km of 2D seismic and 
1,492 sq km of 3D seismic.

a conclusion. As Borders & Southern had 
f u l fi l l e d 	 a l l 	 o f 	 i t s 	 w o r k 	 p r o g r a m m e 	 o b l i g a t i o n s	
and had worked up an impressive prospect 
inventory, we requested a three year extension 
to	this	first	phase	from	the	F alkland	Islands	
Government. This was subsequently granted 
so long as we commit to drill one exploration 
well during that period.
During the year we continued to work our seismic 
data	and	continued	to	refine	our	prospect	inventory .	
In addition, we purchased more 2D non-exclusive 
regional seismic data covering areas outside our 
licensed acreage. The purpose of this was to improve 
our knowledge of the basin as a whole, which could 
be fed back into the evaluation of our prospects.
We also progressed our Environmental Impact 
Assessment. This led to the submission of our 
Environmental Impact Statement in February 2010. 
A public consultation was subsequently held in the 
Falkland Islands allowing feedback on the document 
and having responded to questions, we now await 
approval from the Falkland Islands Government. 
Prior to our fundraising in November 2009, consultants AGR 
completed initial well designs for our Darwin and Stebbing 
wells along with some initial cost estimates. Darwin and 
S t e b b i n g 	 h a v e 	 b e e n 	 h i g h 	 g r a d e d 	 a s 	 t h e 	 b e s t 	 first	tests	of	
our acreage as they are robust structural traps and have 
impressive geophysical attributes that help to reduce risk. 
Also, in the case of Darwin, there are good success case 
analogues in the contiguous Malvinas and Magellanes 
basins to the west. 
Although exploration risk can never be eliminated, we 
are particularly excited about drilling these prospects. 
The two prospects are completely independent of each 
other except that they require the same source rock 
to be working. We will therefore be learning as much 
as we can about the geology and petroleum systems 
of our acreage. 
As I write this review, operations in the North Falkland 
Basin are underway. As reported previously, the geology 
in the North Falklands Basin is completely different 
from that in the South. The prime difference is that the 
sediments in the North were deposited in lakes whilst 
the sediments in the South were deposited in a marine 
environment. Consequently, the outcomes in the north, 
both positive and negative have absolutely no impact 
on the prospectivity of our acreage.

Shortly ,	the	first	well	in	the	South	F alkland	Basin	will	be	
drilled, operated by BHP Billiton. Our understanding is 
that their prospect is a structural/stratigraphic trap. 
This	contrasts	with	the	structural	traps,	defined	by	3D	
seismic, that we will be drilling. So whilst their well will 
be drilling similar geology, in detail the prospects are 
considered	significantly	different.	The	key	differences	
are the age of reservoir and seal, the source kitchen 
and migration pathways and importantly, the 
trapping mechanism. 
T echnical work on our acreage will continue. For instance 
we have recently kicked off a pre-stack depth migration 
study of the Stebbing prospect and a pore pressure 
prediction study for both prospects. However, the majority 
of the technical activity will be focused on detailed 
well engineering. 
Currently our energies are directed towards accessing 
a deep water rig. We are fully funded to cover all of the 
drilling and mobilisation costs. Hopefully, we will be able 
to share some of the mobilisation and demobilisation costs 
with other operators in the region.
Howard Obee
Chief Executive
what’s next... drilling two of our 
key prospects
Darwin	and	Stebbing	have	been	selected	as	the	first	
targets in our acreage. They are completely independent 
other than requiring the same source rock. This means 
that they have different aged reservoirs and seals, different 
source kitchens and migration pathways and different 
structural styles. 
Darwin	in	a	robust	tilted	fault	block	with	a	Lower	
Cretaceous aged reservoir interval. The prospect has 
a	flat	spot,	amplitude	conformance	to	structure	and	an	
AVO anomaly. P50 resource estimates for the anomaly 
alone are 300 million barrels of recoverable oil. P50 resource 
estimates for the entire structure down to the mapped 
spill point are 760 million barrels of recoverable oil.
Stebbing is a robust simple fold with reservoir intervals 
in the Tertiary and Upper Cretaceous. The prospect has 
AVO anomalies in the Tertiary. P50 resource estimates for 
the combined reservoir intervals are 1,280 million barrels 
of recoverable oil.
If either or both of the prospects are successful then 
there is plenty of follow up potential in the 3D area. 
Similar folds and tilted fault blocks have been mapped 
and evaluated along with many interesting structural/
stratigraphic traps. The 3D area represents 7.6% of the 
total area under licence. Success would also lead to 
an expansion of the area covered by 3D seismic.

In the 2008 Annual Report, I wrote that 
we were looking at different options to fund 
the cost of drilling at least two exploration 
wells in the Falkland Islands, including the 
introduction of a partner. In the latter part of 
last year, higher oil prices, the return of an 
appetite for risk in the natural resources 
sector by investors and the broad recognition 
of the quality of the company’s prospects, 
all combined to make the raising of the 
funds through a private placement possible 
and the preferred option. This placement, 
at 50p/share, raised $184 million after costs 
from existing and new shareholders. It was 
a fantastic outcome for the company greatly 
assisted by the high quality of our brokers 
and advisors.
Whilst we raised the monies in pounds sterling, we decided 
to	move	the	bulk	of	the	monies	into	US$	to	reflect	both	
the currency we expect to be invoiced in and our 
presentational currency. To avoid a currency risk from
the time we announced the capital raising and the 
receipt of the funds post the Extraordinary General 
Meeting, we took out a forward contract for most of the 
proceeds. As it happens, the £:$ rate declined during 
that period so we made a gain on this transaction and 
this	largely	accounts	for	the	profit	made	during	the	year .
We have placed the company’s cash funds with high 
quality large banks so, whilst we do not get a high interest 
rate, we are not talking excessive risk with the funds. 
As you will have read elsewhere in this report, we are 
currently seeking to contract a drilling rig to drill at least 
two exploration wells either later in 2010 or, more likely, 
early in 2011. Based on a third party review of drilling 
costs,	we	have	sufficient	funds	to	drill	these	two	wells	
with the possibility of drilling a third well under certain 
circumstances including sharing of mobilisation and 
demobilisation costs.

directors’ report
for the year ended 31 December 2009
The directors present their report and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Domicile
The parent company of the group (which is also the ultimate parent), Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc, is a public limited company 
and is registered and domiciled in England.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the group is the exploration for oil and gas. 
Results and dividends
The group statement of comprehensive income is set out on page 18 and shows the result for the year.
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend.
Review of business and future developments 
A review on the operations of the group is contained in the Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review on pages 4 and 6. 
Principal risks and uncertainties and financial risk management
Exploration risk
The exploration for and development of hydrocarbons is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. These risks include the uncertainty 
that the group will discover sufficient oil or gas to exploit commercially.
Financial risk management
The company’s operations are such that it has exposure to a variety of financial risks. These may, from time to time, include the effects 
of changes in price risk, liquidity risk and a foreign exchange risk. 
Given the size of the company, the directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to a sub‑committee 
of the board. The company’s management implements the policies set by the board of directors.
Price risk 
The company is exposed to price risk due to normal inflationary increases in the purchase price of goods and services. The company has 
no exposure to equity securities price risk, as it holds no listed or other equity investments.
Liquidity risk 
The company has no long term commitments and is able to satisfy any current liability from cash reserves. 
Foreign exchange risk
The company has potential exposure due to some of its purchases being invoiced in UK sterling. To mitigate the risk, the company retains 
funds on UK sterling bank accounts to settle these liabilities.
The company also has potential exposure to cash being raised in UK Sterling but planned future expenditure being in US Dollars. To mitigate 
against this risk the company may take out forward exchange contracts when necessary.
Key performance indicators
The company’s key performance indicators (discussed in the Chief Executive’s Review and Finance Review on pages 4 to 7) are on the 
management of its cash position ($206.3m at year end, 2008: $19.5m including UK Government bond) and the fulfilment of the exploration program.  11

Post balance sheet events
All events that have occurred since the year end which require reporting have been disclosed in note 21.
Charitable and political donations
There were no political or charitable contributions made by the company or the group during the year.
Health, safety and environment
The group has an overriding commitment to health, safety and environmental responsibility. The group works closely with host governments 
and communities in the countries in which it operates, together with its contractors and partners, to ensure internationally recognised standards 
are implemented and maintained along with compliance to local legislation. 
The group’s exploration activities are subject to the relevant environmental protection acts. The group closely monitors its activities to ensure 
to the best of its knowledge there is no potential for the breach of such regulations. There have been no convictions in relation to breaches 
of these Acts recorded against the group during the reporting period.
Creditor payment policy
It is the group’s policy to settle the terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of the transaction, to ensure that suppliers are 
aware of these terms and to abide by them.
The amounts owed to the company and group’s trade creditors at the year end represented 14 days (2008: 5 days) as a proportion of the 
total amounts invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Financial instruments
Details of the use of financial instruments by the company and its subsidiary undertaking are contained in note 22 of the financial statements.
Directors and their interests 
The beneficial and other interests of the directors and their families in the share capital at the beginning of the year or the date of their appointment 
to the board, whichever is later, and at 31 December 2009, were as follows:

Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare 
the group financial statements and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and company and of the profit or loss of the 
group and company for that period. The directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the 
London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 13

in equity, the company statement of financial position, the company statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows, 
the company statement of cash flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent 
company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements

(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion: 
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 
and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.  17

notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2009
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied 
to all years presented.
These consolidated and parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European 
Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, as modified by the revaluation of available for sale 
financial assets.
Effective 1 July 2008, the Company’s functional currency changed from Pounds sterling (£) to the US dollar ($). This change was made 
as, due to significant balances being denominated in $, the directors considered the $ to most faithfully represent the economic effects of the 
underlying transactions, events and conditions in the Company. Concurrent with this change in functional currency, the Group adopted the 
$ as its presentation currency.
In accordance with International Accounting Standards, this change in functional currency has been accounted for prospectively by translating 
all items using the $:£ exchange spot rate on that date, being $1.9902:£1. In the parent company accounts the resulting translated amounts 
for non‑monetary items at this date have been treated as their historic cost.
New and revised Standards effective for 31 December 2009 year ends that are not currently relevant to the Group

Basis of consolidation
Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or business 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements present the results of the 
company and its subsidiaries (“the group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group 
companies are therefore eliminated in full.
* These standards, interpretations and amendments have not been endorsed by the EU. 27

Profit/(loss) for the financial year
The company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own income 
statement in these financial statements. The group profit for the year includes a profit after tax of $3,181,392 (2008: loss of $4,713,772) which 
is dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company.
The company’s investments in subsidiaries
In the parent company’s accounts subsidiaries are carried at cost less amounts provided for impairment.
Income
At the end of the year the group had not commenced commercial production from its exploration sites and therefore has no revenue 
in the year.
Finance income
Finance income consists of interest on cash deposits, treasury stock interest and foreign exchange gains.
The treatment of foreign exchange gains on derivatives is discussed under financial instruments.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision‑maker. 
The chief operating decision‑maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segment 
and that make strategic decisions, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Property, plant and equipment
Office equipment is initially recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on office equipment so as to write off the cost, less any estimated 
residual value, over their expected useful economic life as follows:
Office equipment 33
1
/3%
Assets are depreciated from the date of acquisition, and on a straight line basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
As permitted under IFRS 6, the group has accounted for exploration and evaluation expenditure using the full cost method, whereby all costs 
associated with oil exploration are capitalised as intangible assets on a project‑by‑project basis, pending determination of feasibility of the 
project. Costs incurred include appropriate technical and administrative expenses but not general overheads. Where a licence is relinquished, 
a project is abandoned, or is considered to be of no further value to the group the related costs are written off. All capitalised costs are reviewed 
annually against the underlying value of oil and gas reserves.
Impairment 
Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indication of impairment, if any, where circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. If an indication of impairment exists, the asset is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of assets.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount, generally by reference to the present value of future net cash flows 
expected to be generated from the production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit (CGU) applied for impairment testing is usually 
the individual field, except that a number of fields may be grouped together to form a single CGU where the cash flows are interdependent. 
Any impairment loss arising from the review is charged to the statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of the 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into dollars at the closing rates at the statement of financial position date and 
the exchange differences are included in the statement of comprehensive income. The functional and presentational currency of the parent 
and all group companies is in dollars.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the lease term. 28

Share based payments
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using the Black‑Scholes pricing model. Non‑employee options granted as part of 
consideration for services rendered are valued at the fair value of those services. Where information on the fair value of services rendered is 
not readily available, the fair value of is calculated using the Black‑Scholes pricing model. In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share‑based Payments’ 
the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options. The amount of charge is adjusted each year to 
reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Where equity settled share options are awarded, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the 
vesting period. Non‑market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each 
balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that 
eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other vesting conditions are 
satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for 
failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately 
before and after the modification, is also charged to the consolidated income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows: 
  Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest, 
net of allowances for impairment.
  Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective rate of interest.
  The group may use derivative financial instruments such as currency forward contracts to manage the risks associated with foreign 
exchange. They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the finance income or expense line. 
  Financial instruments issued by group companies are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial 
liability. The group’s and company’s ordinary shares are all classified as equity instruments.
  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank on demand and balances on deposit with an original maturity of three months or less.
  Assets available for sale comprise of government treasury stock. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised 
directly in equity. Where there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available for sale financial asset, the full amount 
of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement.
Taxes
The major components of income tax on the profit or loss include current and deferred tax.
Current tax is based upon the profit or loss for the year adjusted for items that are non‑assessable or disallowed and is calculated using 
tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except where the tax relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, 
in which case the tax is also dealt within equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs to its tax base.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
assets can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when deferred tax liabilities and assets are settled or recovered.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future 
such estimates and assumptions, which are based on Management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the 
actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions with be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change. 
Where necessary, the comparatives will be reclassified from the previously reported results to take into account presentational changes. 29

1 Accounting policies continued
Management has made the following judgements which have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
  Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
The group uses the full cost method of accounting, whereby exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised as intangible assets if the 
associated project is commercially viable, and reviewed for impairment. This requires judgemental assessment as to (a) the likely future 
commerciality of the asset, and (b) future revenues and costs relating to the project in order to determine the recoverable value of the asset.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, which have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are as follows:
  Share options
The group’s share based payments were recognised at fair value, as in the prior period, using a 70% volatility rate. See note 7.

3 Earnings per share 
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year. The profit for the financial year for the group was $3,150,736 (2008: loss of $4,727,900) and the 
weighted average number of shares in issue for the year was 204,611,972 (2008: 194,344,170). 
Potentially dilutive share options
At 31 December 2009 there were options over 2,250,000 shares outstanding which are potentially dilutive (2008: 1,000,000). These options 
are described in note 7. For the majority of the options their exercise price is greater than the weighted average share price during the year 
and it would not be advantageous of the holders to exercise these, therefore these options have been excluded from the calculation of diluted 
EPS. As a result the diluted earnings per share is not materially different to the basic earnings per share. 30

$686,000 at 31 December 2009 (2008: $4,305,000). The rate of tax used in the calculation of the deferred tax asset is 28% (2008: 28%).
The deferred tax asset has not been recognised in the financial statements as the timing of the utilisation of the economic benefit is uncertain. 33

22 Financial instruments
The main risks arising from the group’s operations are cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency translation risk and credit risk. The group 
monitors risk on a regular basis and takes appropriate measures to ensure risks are managed in a controlled manner.
Liquidity is not considered a risk due to the sufficient cash funds readily available to the group at the year end.
The group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. There have been no substantive changes in the group’s exposure to financial 
instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods 
unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the group from which financial instrument risk arises, held by category, are as follows:
 Trade and other receivables
 Cash and cash equivalents
 Trade and other payables
The treasury stock classified as available for sale is measured at a fair value by reference to quoted prices in active markets.
The fair values of the group’s financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2009 and at 31 December 2008 are materially equivalent to their 
carrying value as disclosed in the balance sheet and related notes.
a) Cash flow interest rate risk
The group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk from monies held at bank and on deposit at variable rates.
The group’s financial assets and liabilities accrue interest at prevailing floating rates in the United Kingdom or at pre‑arranged fixed rates, 
as described further below. The group does not currently use derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk.
At 31 December 2009 the group and company held cash at bank and in deposits under its control of $206,321,177 (2008: $9,522,035). It also 
held treasury stock of $9,950,668 in 2008, which matured in March 2009. This forms the majority of the group’s working capital. Of the cash 
at bank and in deposit, $950,774 (2008: $584,285) relates to deposits placed with banking institutions that are available on demand which carry 
interest at prevailing United Kingdom deposit floating rates. The balance represents restricted deposits of $205,370,403 (2008: $8,937,750) 
with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 0.5% (2008: 1.7%) for three months. If there was 1% change in interest rates the impact on the 
statement of comprehensive income would be $441,500 (2008: $580,000). 38

b) Foreign currency translation risk
The operational currency of the oil and gas exploration and evaluation activities of the group is US$ and the group’s functional and 
presentational currency is US$. Foreign exchange risk arises because the group’s services and treasury function is UK sterling, which 
results in gains or losses on retranslation into US$. To minimise this foreign currency risk cash balances are held in both £ sterling and US$.
In general the group does not enter into derivatives to manage currency risks, however during the year the group entered into a forward 
contract for the purchase of US$ for a period of 21 days. This was taken out in order to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of receiving the 
sales proceeds from the share issue during the year in UK £. There were no forward contracts outstanding at the year end.
The foreign currency profile of financial assets and liabilities of the group and the company are as follows:

c) Credit risk
The group has no customers so formal credit procedures are in the process of being established. Credit risk on cash balances and treasury 
stock is managed by only banking with reputable financial institutions with a high credit rating. The only significant concentration of credit risk 
is cash held at bank and treasury stock and the maximum credit risk exposure for the group and company is detailed in the table below:

Capital
The objective of the directors is to maximise shareholder return and minimise risk by keeping a reasonable balance between debt and equity. 
To date the group has minimised risk by being purely equity financed. The group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, 
share premium, accumulated retained deficit and other reserves.  40

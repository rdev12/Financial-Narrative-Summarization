Domestic supply is projected to 
fall short of expected demand creating 
a robust environment to monetise 
gas discoveries.
India is currently the fourth largest 
consumer of energy in the world after 
USA, China and Russia. India’s demand 
for natural gas is expected to grow by 
about 19 per cent per annum and 
domestic supply is projected to fall well 
short of expected demand (see Fig 1).

India’s sedimentary basins are under-
explored and signiﬁcant accumulations 
of hydrocarbons remain to be found. 
India has an estimated sedimentary 
area of 3.14 million km

 comprising of 
26 sedimentary basins. India estimates 
that 130 billion barrels of oil and gas 
equivalent are yet to be found.

India’s political, legal and upstream 
regulatory policies combined with 
globally competitive ﬁscal terms 
provide a positive foreign investment 
environment.
Transparent political environment
With a population of over one billion, India 
represents the world’s largest democracy. 
This political framework provides a good 
level of transparency and a robust platform 
for political discussion.
Stable legal framework 
The Indian legal system is based on 
common law providing a good platform to 
protect contractual rights and enforcement 
of obligations.
Domestic upstream 
technical expertise 
As a result of the success of ONGC 
(majority owned by the GOI), there is a 
strong community of upstream technical, 
operating and commercial professionals 
based in India.
Attractive ﬁscal platform
Production sharing contracts (PSC) 
provide for ﬁscal stability; full cost 
recovery of investment; seven-year tax 
holiday on mineral oil; and free market 
pricing provisions in PSCs.

Asset Overview
Gujarat-Saurashtra Basin
Located in the relatively shallow waters off 
the west coast of India the Gujarat-Saurashtra 
Basin has many signiﬁcant producing oil and 
gas ﬁelds. The Company’s Dhirubhai 33 natural 
gas discovery is located within the GS-01 
licence. In 2011 the Dhirubhai 33 discovery 
was declared commercial and a ﬁeld 
development plan has been submitted 
to the GOI.
Krishna Godavari Basin
Located on the east coast of India, the KG 
basin is regarded as the most proliﬁc gas basin 
in India. It is a proven oil and gas province with 
the world class D6 gas development and a 
number of signiﬁcant producing oil ﬁelds 
(Ravva, MA). To date four consecutive natural 
gas discoveries have been drilled on the D3 
block. Net risked prospective resources are 
estimated at approximately 396 bcf.
Cauvery Basin
The Cauvery Basin is located in the south east 
of India. The basin is a proven oil and gas 
province. Hardy is the operator of two licences 
(PY-3 and CY-OS/2) within this basin. The 
PY-3 oil ﬁeld commenced production in 1997 
and has produced over 24 mmbbl. Currently 
shut-in, the Company estimates that a further 
15 mmbbls can be recovered with the drilling 
of additional wells. The Ganesha-1 natural gas 
discovery is located in the CY-OS/2 block and 
is currently under appraisal.

Business Review
Chairman’s Statement
Overview
Early in 2012, I accepted an appointment 
to Hardy’s Board and assumed the 
Chairmanship shortly thereafter. I was 
very pleased with the Board’s prompt 
appointment of Ian MacKenzie as Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer. Ian has an exceptional 
track record of delivering results in a 
competitive industry and his experience 
and leadership qualities are well suited 
to implement our objectives.
With the Board’s support, an early priority 
for Ian was to oversee a strategic review 
which resulted in two key conclusions: the 
Company’s India-focused asset portfolio 
has good underlying value; and there were 
opportunities to implement organisational 
efﬁciencies to reduce overhead 
expenditures. Drawing on these 
conclusions we have subsequently put 
in place clear business plans for each 
asset and taken steps to conserve capital 
through cutting organisational overhead.
Management has built
positive momentum
going into an important
year for Hardy
“ In 2013, our primary objectives will be to build on the 
current positive momentum by securing key stakeholders’ 
approvals and initiating activity to take us closer to realising 
production from our D3, PY-3 and GS-01 blocks.”

Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
Management has built positive momentum 
going into an important year for Hardy, 
speciﬁcally:
On D3, we expect the recommencement 
of exploration drilling, of the ﬁfth well, in 
the second quarter of 2013 and the sixth 
and ﬁnal committed exploration well due 
later in the year. In 2012 the D3 joint 
venture Operating Committee reviewed 
and resubmitted a declaration of 
commerciality proposal for the Dhirubhai 
39 and 41 natural gas discoveries subject 
to a Government of India (GOI) review. 
The proposed development is a dry gas, 
subsea cluster development with the 
ﬂexibility to add in additional discoveries. 
The GOI’s review is ongoing.
On PY-3 we will submit a comprehensive 
full ﬁeld development plan to the GOI for 
approval after which we expect to secure 
appropriate offshore production and 
storage facilities and initiate planning 
for a development drilling programme 
to recommence production in 2014. 
On GS-01 we intend to conclude 
discussions with our joint venture partner 
to increase our interest in the block. A 
priority in 2013 will be to secure GOI 
approval of the ﬁeld development plan 
and initiate planning for development.
Finally, on CY-OS/2, an early priority of 
the Company is to have the block restored 
to the joint venture, as per the Hon’ble 
Tribunal’s award, which provides for a 
further three years to complete the 
appraisal of the Ganesha-1 natural gas 
discovery. Once restored to the Company, 
as operator, we will initiate planning for the 
appraisal programme. The joint venture 
was also awarded interest cost on its 
Rs5.0 billion (approximately $90 million) 
investment in the block (Interest Cost) and 
various costs associated with the 
arbitration process (Cost). The Interest 
Cost of $24.6 million and Cost of $0.2 
million that were awarded are currently 
considered as contingent assets in the 
ﬁnancial statements for the year 2012 
(note 15). Interest has accrued at simple 
interest rate of nine per cent per annum on 
the joint venture’s investment. 
Key results
No revenue was realised in 2012 
compared to $11.3 million in 2011  
(in July 2011 the PY-3 ﬁeld was shut-in). 
Administrative expenses increased to $7.5 
million compared to $6.9 million in 2011. 
The Company made a total comprehensive 
loss of $11.1 million in 2012. 
The Group started 2012 with cash 
reserves of $36.5 million. Net cash used 
in continuing operating activities was $6.5 
million. Exploration-related expenditures 
amounted to $1.5 million and interest and 
investment income was $0.9 million. As a 
result, the Group’s cash reserves at the 
end of 2012 fell to $29.1 million. The 
Group remains in a strong ﬁnancial 
position with no debt.
Our business model 
Hardy creates value through the 
exploration and production of 
hydrocarbons. In order to explore we 
must ﬁrst be granted a licence by the 
Government of the countries in which we 
choose to invest. After extensive analysis, 
exploration campaigns are planned to try 
to discover oil and gas ﬁelds within 
underexplored sedimentary basins. 
When we have a signiﬁcant discovery 
we undertake appraisal programmes 
which may include the drilling of wells and 
further geotechnical analysis to determine 
the size and quality of the discovery. 
If the appraisal programme conﬁrms 
that development of a discovery will be 
commercially and ﬁnancially viable, 
we begin work on a development plan. 
This maps out how we will get the 
hydrocarbons into production to generate 
revenue and cash ﬂow. We also create 
value through the implementation of 
enhanced production strategies to 
optimise the value of recoverable 
hydrocarbons from existing 
producing ﬁelds.
Our strategy 
We undertook a strategic review through 
2012, following which we have concluded 
that Hardy’s India-focused portfolio has 
the potential to add signiﬁcant shareholder 
value and our medium-term focus will 
therefore remain on India. The outcome of 
planned activity through 2013 is expected 
to conﬁrm our view on the longer-term 
prospects of our portfolio. In the interim 
we will continue to consider all 
opportunities to accelerate value creation 
for our shareholders.
India energy demand – India’s demand for 
natural gas is expected to grow by about 
19 per cent per annum (from 194 million 
standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd)
in 2013 to 466 mmscmd in 2017) to meet 
the incremental requirement of the power, 
fertiliser and other industries. The CNG 
and city gas sector will also see a 
quantum growth in natural gas use. It is 
expected that by 2017, 300 cities will be 
covered with city gas distribution. 
Domestic supply is projected to be 231 
mmscmd, falling well short of expected 
demand creating a robust environment in 
which to monetise the Company’s current 
and potential gas discoveries.
Board appointments
The Board underwent a signiﬁcant 
reorganisation which has resulted in the 
appointment of three new Directors and 
retirement of three other Non-Executive 
Directors. I was appointed to the Board 
as Chairman in January 2012. 
Prior to my appointment, Carol Bell, Ian 
Bruce, and Paul Mortimer had indicated 
that they did not intend to put themselves 
forward for re-election at the Company’s 
next Annual General Meeting and would 
retire from the Board of Hardy. On behalf 
of the Board I would like to thank them for 
their contribution over their tenure. 
On 1 March 2012, the Company 
announced the appointment of Peter Milne 
as a Non-Executive Director and he has 
subsequently assumed the role of Audit 
Committee chair and Senior Non-
Executive Director. Peter brings to the 
Board extensive ﬁnancial expertise and 
upstream experience. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Business Review
Chairman’s Statement continued
At the time of my appointment Yogeshwar 
Sharma expressed his intention to step 
aside as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and 
assume a non-executive role with the 
Company. We are grateful to Yogeshwar 
Sharma, one of the founders of the 
Company, for his invaluable contribution 
over many years and we are particularly 
grateful for the continuity provided through 
the transition to Non-Executive Director.
On 1 March 2012 we were pleased 
to announce the appointment of Ian 
MacKenzie. Under challenging conditions 
Ian has made an immediate impact to the 
business and recent actions have built 
positive momentum as we head into an 
important year for the Company. Ian and 
his management team have been 
methodical in their approach to formulating 
sound business plans for each of our 
assets with clear deliverables and 
accountability. We are conﬁdent that his 
experience and leadership qualities are 
best suited to optimise value for our 
shareholders.
Governance
We undertook a number of initiatives 
to improve our corporate governance 
practices. Earlier this year the Board 
adopted a new Code of Business 
Conduct (the Code). Subsequently, Ian 
MacKenzie has introduced and explained 
the Code to all employees and 
contractors. The Board reviewed and 
amended the Board committees’ terms of 
reference in accordance with Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
(ISCA) guidelines and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We are in regular 
contact with major shareholders and we 
are committed to implement and enhance 
governance practices appropriate for a 
Company of our size and resources.
Risk management
The Board remains focused on identifying 
and managing keys risks to our business 
objectives. The Board has put in place 
a formal risk and uncertainties review 
process, involving the generation and 
identiﬁcation of key risks, the formulation 
of mitigation strategies by the Company’s 
senior management team and regular 
reporting to the Board. This process 
facilitates a dynamic risk management 
process. 
The Board has identiﬁed the following 
principal risks for 2013:
 – Strategic risk – Asset portfolio over-
weighted to long-cycle appraisal and 
development; sub-commercial 
exploration results
 – Financial risk – Absence of stakeholder 
approvals for proposed development 
and appraisal programmes; liquidated 
damages for incomplete minimum work 
programmes
 – Operational risk – A loss of well control 
could occur during offshore drilling 
operations; securing timely approval for 
a PY-3 full ﬁeld development plan; lack 
of control of timing of exploration 
drilling; staff retention
 – Compliance – Deteriorating stakeholder 
sentiment; changing regulatory and 
political environment in India
“ The outcome of planned activity through 2013 
is expected to conﬁrm our view on the longer-term 
prospects of our portfolio.” Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
Going concern
Having regard to the Company’s existing 
working capital position and its ability to 
raise potential ﬁnancing, the Directors 
are of the opinion that the Group has 
adequate resources to enable it to 
undertake its planned work programme 
of exploration, appraisal and development 
activities over the next 12 months.
Outlook
The D3 exploration licence in the Krishna 
Godavari Basin remains at the core of our 
organic growth potential and we expect 
drilling to recommence in the second 
quarter of 2013. The Krishna Godavari 
Basin is an emerging world-class 
petroleum province and, together with 
rapidly improving Indian gas pipeline 
infrastructure and high demand for 
gas, the prospects for the economic 
development of gas resources in this area 
are excellent. The CY-OS/2 award is very 
encouraging and we will provide updates 
as we re-engage with the GOI to advance 
appraisal activity on this block.
In 2013, our primary objectives will be to 
build on the current positive momentum by 
securing key stakeholders’ approvals and 
initiating activity to take us closer to 
realising production from our D3, PY-3 and 
GS-01 blocks. We have clear deliverables 
for each asset in 2013 and management 
are fully accountable for the implementation 
of agreed plans. Energy demand in India is 
growing at an exceptional rate and there 
are indications that a more collaborative 
environment is taking hold in India. We 
believe that these external factors should 
complement our efforts.
The Company remains in a strong working 
capital position from which to fund its 
planned work activity.

Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
1. Obtaining exploration rights 
Obtaining hydrocarbon exploration 
rights is accomplished through:
a. The granting of exploration licences 
by the Government of the countries  
in which we choose to invest. In India 
this is accomplished via the New 
Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), 
a periodic competitive closed bid 
process.
b. The acquisition of exploration 
licences from third parties. This can 
be accomplished via direct farm-in, 
purchase, or corporate mergers.
2. Exploration
Exploration campaigns are planned to 
try to discover oil and gas ﬁelds within 
under-explored sedimentary basins. 
Initial activity will typically involve 
investment in extensive geotechnical 
analysis which will typically include 
geological modelling of sedimentary 
basins, the acquisition of seismic and 
other data; which is then integrated to 
facilitate the identiﬁcation of possible 
subsurface hydrocarbons accumulations 
(prospects). Drilling of exploration wells 
commences if a prospect has a 
reasonable chance of success and 
meaningful size estimate.
3. Appraisal
When we have a signiﬁcant discovery 
we undertake appraisal programmes 
which may include the drilling of wells 
and further geotechnical analysis to 
determine the size and quality of the 
discovery. Initial development concepts 
are also formulated at this time to 
facilitate the determination of 
commerciality. Presence of markets to 
monetise the discovered hydrocarbon  
is identiﬁed at this time.
4. Development
If the appraisal programme conﬁrms that 
the development of a discovery will be 
commercially and ﬁnancially viable, we 
begin work on a development plan. The 
plan will map out the optimal process to 
extract the hydrocarbons in a cost 
effective manner and identify which 
markets the production may be sold into. 
Field developments are complex, require 
signiﬁcant capital investment and may 
take many years to implement.
5. Production optimisation and 
enhanced recovery
Once a discovery is producing we use 
our expertise and knowledge to ensure 
production strategies optimise recovery 
in a safe and cost effective manner. 
Later in a ﬁeld’s life we create value 
through the implementation of enhanced 
production strategies to optimise the 
value of recoverable hydrocarbons from 
existing producing ﬁelds.
6. Return proﬁts to shareholders
After retaining sufﬁcient proﬁt to reinvest 
in the business, we return proﬁts to our 
shareholders. Dispositions and farm 
downs, throughout the investment cycle 
described above, may also accelerate 
returning proﬁts to shareholders. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
Overview
I joined Hardy early in 2012 and, following 
a comprehensive induction process, I 
assumed the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer role 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) in May. At the time, the PY-3 oil 
ﬁeld had been shut-in since July 2011 and 
the Company had recently announced the 
relinquishment of the D9 exploration block. 
Consequently, my ﬁrst priority was to 
undertake a strategic review to identify the 
key value drivers of the Company’s asset 
portfolio and establish a clear business 
plan to optimise shareholder value. Our 
efforts have started to generate positive 
momentum for the year ahead as we 
continue to implement our plan.
Strategic review
With the guidance of the Board, 
management initiated a strategic review. 
Our review was focused on assessing 
Hardy’s existing assets, organisational 
competencies and opportunities to create 
value for shareholders. The Board 
concurred with management that Hardy’s 
India-focused asset portfolio provides a 
good platform from which to create 
signiﬁcant shareholder value.
India’s improving investment climate
Throughout 2012 we have observed 
robust public debate regarding the 
performance and practices of India’s 
upstream oil and gas sector. We welcome 
a higher level of transparency which 
should result in an increase in investment 
in the sector and the streamlining of 
various approval processes. India’s gas 
market fundamentals remain strong and 
the gap between demand and supply is 
expected to increase with consequent 
upward pressure on future gas pricing.
Reorganisation 
As a result of the shut-in of the Company’s 
producing assets, an early objective of our 
review was to align our underlying 
overheads with value creating activities 
without compromising the competencies 
required to remain an offshore operator. 
Based on our review, the Company’s UK 
corporate ofﬁce was relocated to 
Aberdeen, Scotland. The new location 
is in close proximity to industry expertise 
in designing, planning and executing 
complex offshore hydrocarbon projects. 
In addition annualised overhead reduction 
of approximately $1.0 million has been 
achieved. We also modiﬁed the 
Company’s internal budgeting and 
ﬁnancial reporting practices to enhance 
transparency and accountability.
We are committed to 
a plan with set timelines, 
deliverables and 
accountability.

Ongoing assessment
We intend to undertake further direct 
recruitment or engagement of support 
personnel and resources, as we advance 
execution of our plans for the PY-3, GS-01 
and CY-OS/2 assets. We continue to 
assess and evaluate further opportunities 
that complement our existing portfolio in 
India and identify longer term upstream 
opportunities to diversify the Company’s 
portfolio.
Implementation
In 2012 we secured agreement, from the 
PY-3 joint venture on the technical 
speciﬁcation of the PY-3 ﬁeld production 
system. We are now in the process of 
gaining consensus with our partners for 
the submission of a comprehensive full 
ﬁeld development plan. Once partner and 
GOI approvals are secured we can initiate 
planning to fast-track recommencement of 
production.
Extensive reprocessing of 3D seismic data 
was completed by the D3 joint venture in 
2012. As a result, a number of prospects 
have been high-graded and, with the 
arrival of the deepwater drillship, Dhirubhai 
Deepwater KG2, we are expecting two 
exploration wells to be drilled in 2013. 
Once these wells have been drilled the 
joint venture will compile data collected, 
including the four previous natural gas 
discoveries, and set out to engineer a 
comprehensive development strategy for 
all proven hydrocarbon accumulations. 
Near the end of 2012, a full ﬁeld 
development plan for GS-01 was 
submitted for the shallow water, natural 
gas discovery, Dhirubhai 33 located 
offshore the west coast of India. We had 
worked closely with the operator to have 
the full ﬁeld development plan submitted 
by the prescribed deadline to the 
respective department of GOI. Early in 
2013 the Company conﬁrmed that it was 
in discussions with Reliance to increase 
our participating interest. These 
discussions are ongoing and we will 
provide an update once discussions are 
concluded. As approvals are secured we 
will be able to advance planning for the 
development of the asset.
As announced in February 2013, the 
Hon’ble Tribunal issued an award in the 
CY-OS/2 joint venture’s favour. The ruling 
entitles the joint venture to undertake 
appraisal of the Ganesha-1 natural gas 
discovery over a three-year period from 
the date the block is restored to the joint 
venture. Our immediate priority is to 
re-engage with the regulator and initiate 
planning for the appraisal of the 
Ganesha-1 natural gas discovery.
A common theme with our assets is 
dependence on securing approvals from 
partners and various GOI authorities. We 
fully recognise the impact that extended 
delays have to the valuation of our assets 
and we are making it our priority to utilise 
all acceptable avenues to secure 
approvals in a timely manner.
Health, safety and environment (HSE)
As an offshore operator, the Company is 
committed to excellent health and safety 
practices which are at the forefront in all 
of our activities. Although all offshore 
activities were suspended in March 2012 
we intend to initiate activities in the future 
and will continue our robust commitment 
to maintain high HSE standards 
throughout the organisation. The 
Company’s HSE policy document was 
reviewed and amended with increased 
focus on leadership and accountability. 
Subsequently the revised policy was 
rolled out and discussed with all staff.
Resource potential
Due to limited drilling activity in 2011 and 
2012 and the uncertainty regarding the 
timing of PY-3 oil ﬁeld’s recommencement 
of production, the Company has not 
undertaken the updating of a Competent 
Person’s Report (CPR). We intend to 
re-evaluate whether or not to update 
our CPR following the completion of 
exploration drilling on the D3 block. 
Stakeholder engagement
Stakeholder engagement will be a 
key focus for Hardy through 2013. We 
believe that maintaining open and close 
relationships with existing partners and 
other key stakeholders in the upstream oil 
and gas sector in India are critical to the 
successful execution of the Company’s 
strategy. We achieve this through regular 
collaborative dialogue and the sharing of 
independent views and objectives. 
2013 programme
The D3 exploration licence in the Krishna 
Godavari Basin remains at the core of our 
near term growth potential. The Krishna 
Godavari Basin is a world-class petroleum 
province and together with rapidly 
improving Indian gas pipeline 
infrastructure and the high demand 
for gas, the prospects for the economic 
development of gas resources in this 
area are excellent. 
Through 2013, we will continue to 
collaborate actively with our partners 
Reliance Industries Limited (Reliance) and 
BP to optimise the exploration programme 
for this highly prospective block. The 
declaration of commerciality proposal for 
the D3 block is being reviewed by the GOI 
and this process is expected to continue 
through 2013. Processing of 3D seismic 
data covering the eastern area of the D3 
block was completed in 2012 and 
interpretation continues. With the arrival 
of the drillship Dhirubhai Deepwater KG2 
in Indian waters, drilling of the ﬁfth 
exploration well is expected to commence 
in the second quarter of 2013 and the 
sixth and ﬁnal committed exploration 
well scheduled later in 2013.
The working capital position of the 
Company remains strong and we are 
well funded to meet our planned work 
programmes. We will continue to seek 
opportunities to build value for 
shareholders.
Staff and outlook
Following the Company’s strategic review 
the decision was taken to implement cost 
reducing measures which resulted in the 
regrettable reduction of staff in some 
areas. We have also committed to a plan 
with set timetables, deliverables and 
accountability and we are conﬁdent we 
have the right people in place to meet 
our objectives. 
I would like to acknowledge the high level 
of professionalism, commitment and 
patience demonstrated by our employees 
during a year of transition and uncertainty. 
Our methodical approach has built up 
positive momentum and I expect Hardy 
to build on this through the year.

Business Review
Review of Operations
Hardy’s key activities in 2012 were: 
the progression of the D3 exploration 
programme; the submission of a ﬁeld 
development plan for GS-01; CY-OS/2 
dispute resolution; deliberation with 
the PY-3 joint venture partners; and 
rationalisation of corporate overhead.
The Company’s exploration and 
production assets are based in India 
and are held through its wholly owned 
subsidiary Hardy Exploration & Production 
(India) Inc. (HEPI).
2012 Performance 
Health, safety and environment
The Company had zero recordable injuries 
to report in 2012 compared to two for the 
same period in 2011. All offshore activities 
were suspended in March 2012. 
The Board has tailored the Group’s HSE 
policy and management system taking 
reference from world-class operations to 
suit Indian conditions. Hardy’s HSE policy 
was reviewed and amended in early 2013. 
The revised policy has subsequently been 
presented and explained to all employees 
and contractors.
Exploration 
At the beginning of 2012 the Company’s 
exploration plans were to carry out special 
processing (pre-stack depth migration 
(PSDM)) 3D seismic data covering the 
phase-II area of D3 exploration block and 
possibly drill an exploration well in D9. 
Subsequently the D9 joint venture elected 
to relinquish the D9 block due to poor 
hydrocarbon potential and made a 
payment for the unﬁnished minimum work 
programme (MWP). Special processing 
of the D3 seismic data progressed and 
exploration drilling is expected to 
recommence in the second quarter 
of 2013.
Development
The D3 joint venture re-submitted 
a proposal for the declaration of 
commerciality (DOC) for the Dhirubhai 
39 and 41 natural gas discoveries to the 
GOI. The proposed development plan 
provides for a dry gas, subsea cluster 
development with the ﬂexibility to add in 
additional zones and future area 
discoveries. Near the end of 2012, Hardy 
submitted a ﬁeld development plan for the 
Dhirubhai 33 natural gas discovery (well 
name GS01-B1) in the GS-01 exploration 
block. The development plan provides for 
dry-tree completions to an unmanned 
platform and multi-phase pipeline to shore 
with onshore processing and export 
facilities.
Production
The PY-3 oil ﬁeld remained shut-in 
pending stakeholder approval for the 
drilling of additional wells and the 
procurement of suitable production 
facilities. Throughout 2012 the Company 
worked closely with all stakeholders to 
advance the approval process for a 
comprehensive full ﬁeld development plan. 
The ﬁeld’s existing wells are capable of 
producing at a daily rate of over 3,000 
barrels per day (bbld) and additional wells 
are expected to increase the daily 
production rate to over 8,000 bbld. 
Arbitration
Through 2012 the Company continued 
to participate in a formal dispute resolution 
process to extend the expiry date of the 
CY-OS/2 licence. Early in 2013 the 
Hon’ble Tribunal, hearing our dispute, 
issued an award in the joint venture’s 
favour which provides for the GOI to 
restore the joint venture’s interest and a 
further three years to complete appraisal 
activity for the Ganesha-1 natural gas 
discovery.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Board recently reviewed its KPIs. 
Taking into account the challenges facing 
the Company today the Board has 
identiﬁed two ﬁnancial and three non-
ﬁnancial measures as key performance 
indicators for Hardy. The measures reﬂect 
the Company’s exploration-focused 
strategy, the importance of a positive cash 
position and our underlying commitment 
to ensuring safe operations. In addition to 
the ﬁve key measures the Company also 
recognises that timely stakeholder 
approvals of our ﬁeld development plans 
are important milestones in our pursuit 
of realising production and creating 
signiﬁcant shareholder value.
The key performance indicators for 2012 
are summarised in the table below:
Outlook for 2013
D3 – Recommencement of exploration 
drilling, of the ﬁfth well, in the second 
quarter of 2013 and the sixth and ﬁnal 
committed exploration well due later in 
the year. In 2012 the D3 joint venture 
Operating Committee reviewed and 
resubmitted a declaration of commerciality 
proposal for the Dhirubhai 39 and 41 
natural gas discoveries subject to a GOI 
review. The proposed development is 
a dry gas, subsea cluster development 
with the ﬂexibility to add in additional 
discoveries. The GOI’s review is ongoing.
PY-3 – Submit a comprehensive full ﬁeld 
development plan to the GOI for approval, 
after which we expect to secure 
appropriate offshore production and 
storage facilities and initiate planning 
for a development drilling programme 
to recommence production in 2014. 
GS-01 – Conclude discussions with 
our joint venture partner to increase our 
interest in the block. A priority in 2013 
will be to secure GOI approval of the ﬁeld 
development plan and initiate planning for 
development.
CY-OS/2 – Have the block restored to the 
joint venture, as per the Hon’ble Tribunal’s 
award, which provides for a further three 
years to complete the appraisal of the 
Ganesha-1 natural gas discovery. Once 
restored to the Company, as operator, 
we will initiate planning for the appraisal 
programme. The joint venture was also 
awarded interest cost on its Rs5.0 billion 
(approximately $90 million) investment in 
the block (Interest Cost) and various costs 
associated with the arbitration process 
(Cost). The Interest Cost of $24.6 million 
and Cost of $0.2 million that were 
awarded are currently considered 
as contingent assets in the ﬁnancial 
statements for the year 2012 (note 15). 
Interest has accrued at simple interest rate 
of nine per cent per annum. 
CPR update
Due to limited drilling activity in 2011 and 
2012 and the uncertainty regarding the 
timing of PY-3 oil ﬁeld’s recommencement 
of production, the Company has not 
undertaken the updating of a CPR. 
The Board will re-evaluate following 
the completion of exploration drilling 
on the D3 block.

Business Review
Review of Operations continued
Operations
The joint venture continued to undertake a 
number of geotechnical studies including 
the PSDM reprocessing of over 1,292 km
2
 
of 3D data. Geotechnical studies have 
been focused on assessing the potential 
of the eastern area of the block and high 
grading prospects, including deeper plays. 
A revised proposal for the DOC for the 
Dhirubhai 39 and 41 natural gas 
discoveries, submitted earlier this year, 
remain under review by the GOI. The 
proposed development plan provides for 
a dry gas, subsea cluster development 
with the ﬂexibility to add in additional wells 
and to include a possible adjoining area of 
discoveries.
Outlook 
The deepwater drillship Dhirubhai 
Deepwater KG2, contracted to the 
D3 joint venture operator, Reliance, 
is currently operating in Indian waters. 
Drilling of a ﬁfth exploration well is 
expected to commence in the second 
quarter of 2013. 
The GOI’s review of the D3 DOC proposal 
will likely continue through 2013.

Review of Operations continued
Operations 
Hardy continued discussions with the 
operator to facilitate the preparation of 
a detailed ﬁeld development plan for the 
Dhirubhai 33 natural gas discovery. As a 
result of our efforts the ﬁeld development 
plan was submitted to the GOI for review 
prior to the end of the year. The 
development plan provides for several 
dry tree wells, and unmanned platforms, 
multiphase pipelines to shore and onshore 
processing and export facilities.
Early in 2013 the Company conﬁrmed 
that it was in discussions with its partner, 
Reliance, to increase our participating 
interest. These discussions are ongoing 
and we will provide an update once 
discussions are concluded.
Outlook
The GOI’s review of the ﬁeld development 
plan is likely to continue through 2013.
Background
In 2011, the GS-01 joint venture secured 
the GOI’s approval for a DOC proposal for 
the Dhirubhai 33 discovery (GS01-B1, 
drilled in 2007) which ﬂow-tested at a rate 
of 18.6 million standard cubic feet per day 
(mmscfd) gas with 415 bbld of 
condensate through a 56/64 inch choke 
at ﬂowing tubing head pressure of 1,346 
pounds per square inch (psi). The GS-01 
licence is located in the Gujarat-
Saurashtra offshore basin off the west 
coast of India, northwest of the proliﬁc 
Bombay High oil ﬁeld, with water depths 
varying between 80 m and 150 m. The 
retained discovery area covers 600 km
2
. 
The Dhirubhai 33 natural gas 
discovery is in close proximity 
to the industrial state of 
Gujarat which has an 
established natural gas 
infrastructure and robust 
energy demand growth 
projections.

(Hardy 18 per cent interest – Operator)
As previously announced, the PY-3 ﬁeld 
remained shut-in throughout the year 
and no production was realised by the 
Company. We continued to work closely 
with partners and government authorities 
to plan for the timely recommencement of 
production. We have held a number of 
constructive meetings with partners and 
the India upstream oil and gas regulator 
Directorate General of Hydrocarbons 
(DGH). As a result we have agreed to 
a timeline to submit a comprehensive full 
ﬁeld development plan early in 2013. 
Outlook
Assuming timely approvals from partners, 
a comprehensive full ﬁeld development 
plan is to be submitted for the GOI’s 
review and approval by the end of the 
second quarter of 2013. Once the revised 
plan is approved, we intend to initiate a 
tendering process for the required 
production facility and drilling services. 
Based on current assumptions, production 
could recommence in the ﬁrst half of 
2014. The ﬁeld’s existing well is capable 
of producing at a gross daily rate of over 
3,000 bbld and with future planned wells, 
the ﬁeld has the potential to reach 
8,000 bbld.
Background
The PY-3 ﬁeld is located off the east coast 
of India 80 km south of Pondicherry in 
water depths between 40 m and 450 m. 
The Cauvery Basin was developed in the 
late Jurassic/early Cretaceous period and 
straddles the present-day east coast of 
India. The licence, which covers 81 km
2
, 
produces high-quality light crude oil 
(49° API).
As operator of the PY-3 ﬁeld 
Hardy implemented key 
enhanced recovery techniques 
that have signiﬁcantly 
increased the estimated 
recoverable volumes and 
extended the life of the ﬁeld. 
Following the drilling of new 
wells the ﬁeld could produce 
for a further ten years. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Operations
The formal dispute resolution process, 
to extend the expiry date of the CY-OS/2 
licence, progressed throughout the year. 
On 4 February 2013 the Company 
announced that the joint venture was 
successful in obtaining an extension of the 
CY-OS/2 licence. A brief summary of the 
Hon’ble Tribunal’s award is provided below:
Dispute
Hardy, along with Gas Authority of India 
Limited (GAIL) and Oil and Natural Gas 
Corporation (ONGC), are a party and 
operator to a PSC for the CY-OS/2 block. 
Hardy holds 75 per cent participating 
interest
1
 in the block. Hardy and GAIL 
declared a gas discovery on 8 January 
2007 which discovery qualiﬁed as 
non-associated natural gas (NANG) under 
the terms of the PSC. The GOI’s, Ministry 
of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG) 
however, stated that the discovery being 
oil and the commerciality of the block not 
having been declared within 24 months 
from the date of the notiﬁcation of the 
discovery, the block stood relinquished. 
Hardy had disputed the characterisation of 
the discovery as oil and the consequential 
relinquishment.
Hon’ble Tribunal
This dispute was referred to arbitration 
under the PSC to a tribunal consisting of 
three arbitrators who were former Chief 
Justices of India. The Hon’ble Tribunal 
passed the award on 2 February 2013 
at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
Award summary
The Hon’ble Tribunal has awarded and 
directed as follows:
a) the Ganesha-1 discovery made 
by Hardy and GAIL is NANG;
b) the order of relinquishment by the 
MOPNG was illegal, being on the 
erroneous impression that the 
discovery was oil;
c) that the parties shall be immediately 
relegated to the position in which they 
stood prior to the order of 
relinquishment and the block shall 
be restored to Hardy and GAIL; Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

d) Hardy shall be entitled to a period of 
three years from the date on which the 
block is restored to it, to carry out 
further appraisal;
e) MOPNG shall pay to Hardy and GAIL 
interest at the simple rate of nine per 
cent per annum on the amount of 
Rs.5.0 billion spent by them on the 
block, from the date of relinquishment 
till the date on which the block is 
restored (approximately $24.6 million 
net to Hardy).
Outlook
Once the MOPNG has restored the 
licence to the CY-OS/2 joint venture, 
Hardy will recommence work on the 
appraisal of the Ganesha-1 natural gas 
discovery.
Background
Hardy is the operator of the CY-OS/2 
exploration block and holds a 75 per cent 
participating interest
1
, through its wholly 
owned subsidiary Hardy Exploration & 
Production (India) Inc and GAIL holds the 
remaining 25 per cent participating interest. 
The block is located in the northern part of 
the Cauvery Basin immediately offshore 
from Pondicherry, India and covers 
approximately 859 km
2
. The licence 
comprises of two retained areas with the 
Ganesha-1 natural gas discovery located in 
the northern area, which comprises an area 
of approximately 300 km

. 
Ganesha-1
The natural gas discovery Ganesha-1, 
announced in January 2007, was drilled 
to a depth of 4,089 m, encountering 
sandstone reservoir within the Cretaceous 
section. The well ﬂow tested at a peak rate 
of 10.7 mmscfd. The Company published 
a CPR, prepared by Gaffney, Cline & 
Associates, dated March 2011, which 
estimates gross 2C Contingent 
Resources of approximately 130 billion 
cubic feet (bcf).

Operations 
The D9 joint venture elected to surrender 
the off-shore exploration block in the 
Krishna Godavari Basin. Following the 
integration of all geoscientiﬁc data and 
the results of the three exploration wells, 
including the KG-D9-A2 natural gas 
discovery, the block’s hydrocarbon 
potential was deemed low. The MOPNG 
of the GOI has subsequently been notiﬁed 
of the joint venture’s election to relinquish 
the block and payment has been made 
toward the unﬁnished minimum work 
programme.
1 In the event of a 
declaration of 
commerciality, the 
Government of India’s 
nominee is entitled to 
assume a 30 per cent 
participating interest 
in the block. As a 
result, Hardy’s 
participating interest 
would be 52.5 
per cent. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Business Review
Financial Review
Taxation
No current tax was payable for the 
12 months ended 31 December 2012. 
The Company has recorded a current tax 
credit of $0.2 million and deferred tax 
credit of $1.4 million against the pre-tax 
loss of $12.7 million for the year ended 
31 December 2012. This compared to 
current tax credit of $ 1.3 million and 
deferred tax credit of $1.3 million for 
the same period in 2011.
Total comprehensive loss
The Company recorded total 
comprehensive loss of $11.1 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 compared 
to a total comprehensive loss of $1.9 
million for the same period in 2011.
Cash ﬂow from operating activities
The Company’s cash outﬂow from 
operating activities was $7.1 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 compared 
with cash outﬂow from operating activities 
of $3.4 million for the same period in 
2011.
Capital expenditure
The Group’s capital expenditure during 
the 12 months ended 31 December 2012 
amounted to $1.5 million compared to 
$6.5 million incurred for the same period 
in 2011. Capital expenditure was primarily 
associated with the compensation paid to 
the GOI towards the unﬁnished minimum 
work programme for the surrendered D9 
exploration block. This capital expenditure 
was subsequently written-off.
“ The Company currently plans to drill up to two  
exploration wells in 2013 which will be funded  
from existing cash resources.”
Unsuccessful exploration costs
In April 2012 the Company surrendered its 
10 per cent interest in the D9 exploration 
licence resulting in an unsuccessful 
exploration charge of $5.4 million for the 
12 months ended 31 December 2012 
(2011: $3.4 million).
Administrative expenses
Administrative expense was $7.5 million 
compared to $6.9 million for the same 
period in 2011. As part of the Company’s 
strategic review we have moved our 
corporate ofﬁce to Aberdeen, Scotland 
from London and reduced staff in the UK 
and India. These initiatives have reduced 
our underlying overhead expenditures 
leading into 2013.
Operating loss 
The Company is reporting an operating 
loss of $13.2 million for the 12 months 
ended 31 December 2012 compared with 
a loss of $4.7 million for the same period 
in 2011.
Investment and other income
Investment and other income increased to 
$0.8 million for the 12 months ended 31 
December 2012 compared to $0.4 million 
in 2011. The increase is mainly due to 
$0.3 million interest received on tax 
refunds.
Overview
During 2012, the Company recorded an 
operating loss of $13.2 million and exited 
the year with cash and short-term 
investments of $29.1 million with no 
debt. The Company currently plans to 
drill up to two exploration wells in 2013 
which will be funded from existing cash 
resources.
Results for the year
The Company recorded a total 
comprehensive loss of $11.1 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2012. No 
dividends were paid or declared during 
the period. 
As a result of the extended shut-in of the 
PY-3 oil ﬁeld no revenue from production 
was realised in 2012 compared to $11.3 
million revenue in 2011. The average sales 
price realised in 2011 was $110.54 per 
barrel.
Cost of sales
Production cost amounted to $0.3 million 
for the 12 months ended 31 December 
2012. The cost is attributed to support 
services required during the shut-in of the 
PY-3 ﬁeld. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Company Information 
Cash and short-term investments
The Company has cash and short-term 
investments of $29.1 million on 31 
December 2012 compared to $36.5 
million on 31 December 2011. The 
Company has no debt.
Summary statement of 
ﬁnancial position
The Company’s non-current assets 
decreased from $97.3 million at 31 
December 2011 to $95.1 million at 
31 December 2012. This decrease is 
principally due to the write-off of the 
unsuccessful exploration cost of block D9 
net of the deferred tax credit. Current 
assets represent the Group’s cash 
resources, trade and other receivables 
and inventories which have decreased 
from $39.7 million as at 31 December 
2011 to $32.5 million as at 31 December 
2012. Current liabilities are principally 
trade and other account payables which 
remained unchanged at $6.1 million at the 
end of 2012. The Group has considered a 
contingent asset of $24.6 million on the 
interest cost awarded by the arbitration 
tribunal for the block CY-OS/2 (note 15).
Dividend
The Directors do not recommend 
the payment of a dividend in the 
foreseeable future.
Accounting policies
The Company’s signiﬁcant accounting 
policies and details of the signiﬁcant 
judgements and critical accounting 
estimates are disclosed within the notes 
to the ﬁnancial statements. In 2011 the 
Company changed to the successful 
efforts method of accounting for its oil 
and gas assets which allows for the 
capitalisation of successful exploration 
costs, whereas the dry hole and its 
associated geological and geophysical 
costs are written-off. The Company has 
not made any material changes to its 
accounting policies in the year ended 
31 December 2012.
Liquidity risk management and 
going concern
The Company closely monitors and 
manages its liquidity risk. Cash forecasts 
are regularly produced and sensitivities 
run for different scenarios including 
changes in timing of developments and 
cost overruns of our exploration activity. 
At 31 December 2012, the Company had 
liquid resources of approximately $29.1 
million, in the form of cash and short-term 
investments, which is available to meet 
ongoing capital, operating and 
administrative expenditures. The 
Company’s forecasts, taking into account 
reasonably possible changes as 
described above, show that the Company 
will have sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources for 
the 12 months from the date of approval 
of the 2012 Annual Report and Accounts. 
At the present time, the Company does 
not have any debt.
2013 principal risks and uncertainties
The Board identiﬁes the key risks for the 
Company and monitors mitigation plans 
and performance on a regular basis. The 
Company has identiﬁed its principal risks 
for the next 12 months as being:
 – Strategic risk – Asset portfolio over-
weighted to long-cycle appraisal and 
development; sub-commercial 
exploration results
 – Financial risk – Absence of stakeholder 
approvals for proposed development 
and appraisal programmes; liquidated 
damages for incomplete minimum work 
programmes
 – Operational risk – A loss of well control 
could occur during offshore drilling 
operations; securing timely approval for 
a PY-3 full ﬁeld development plan; lack 
of control of timing of exploration 
drilling; staff retention
 – Compliance – Deteriorating stakeholder 
sentiment; changing regulatory and 
political environment in India

Code of Business Conduct
Introduction
The Board recently adopted a Code of 
Business Conduct (the Code) and was 
introduced to all staff by the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer, Ian MacKenzie, in 
January 2013. Our reputation with our 
investors, partners and those communities 
of which we are part is based on our 
collective behaviour. The Board expects 
every employee and all those who work 
on the Group’s behalf to exercise good 
judgement while carrying out our business 
activities. Everyone working for Hardy is 
personally responsible for following the 
Code and ensuring that we conduct our 
business safely and in a fair, honest and 
ethical manner. A copy of the Code can 
be found on the Company website 
www. hardyoil.com
Compliance awareness
As part of the introduction process 
employees and contract staff were invited 
to attend meetings with the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and reviewed and 
discussed the Code in detail and 
questions answered to ensure the Code 
is  embedded through the business. The 
Company intends to follow-up with further 
reviews throughout the year. 
Raising concerns
Hardy employees and contractors are 
encouraged to promptly report any 
concerns they have about the Company’s 
business practices or where someone is 
concerned or suspects that the Code has 
been breached. Where staff do not feel 
comfortable reporting concerns to their 
line manager or executive they have been 
invited to contact the Senior Non-
Executive Director directly through a 
conﬁdential email address. The Board will 
not tolerate retaliation against an individual 
reporting in good faith. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Health, safety and environment 
(HSE) activities
Keeping our people safe and 
minimising our environmental footprint
The Board has tailored the Group’s HSE 
policy and management system taking 
reference from world-class operations to 
suit Indian conditions. Safety, security and 
emergency procedures have been 
incorporated into the weave of the Group’s 
operations. The Company’s HSE policy 
was reviewed and amended in late 2012 
and subsequently presented to all staff 
in 2013. 
The central HSE Committee and 
Environment Management Committees 
normally meet on a monthly basis to 
assess and monitor compliance. As a 
result of the shut-in of the PY-3 oil ﬁeld, 
the meetings ceased in March 2012. 
Past practices 
The Company has regularly undertaken 
internal and external HSE audits, including 
pre-mobilisation HSE audit of rigs and 
vessels. The Company has also 
undertaken periodical environmental 
marine monitoring around the PY-3 
production facilities and around the drilling 
locations. Prompt compliance with 
applicable regulations by the Group has 
been recognised by concerned agencies. 
No such studies were undertaken in 2012.
Regulatory compliance
Engagement of, and compliance with, 
ministerial and regulatory bodies such 
as OISD, DGH, MOEF, DGMS, ODAG, 
Coast Guard, Navy, TMB and others have 
been maintained via submitting necessary 
reports as required and addressing 
queries promptly. Hardy participates in 
different meetings convened by these 
agencies.
2012 HSE performance 
The PY-3 ﬁeld remained shut-in throughout 
2012. The ﬂoating production unit (FPU), 
Tahara, and ﬂoating storage and ofﬂoading 
vessel (FSO) have been out of contract 
since 2011. Citing safety reasons the PY-3 
joint venture continued to provide the FPU 
and FSO with support services such as 
stand-by offshore supply vessel (OSV) 
and helicopter facilities. As operator, 
Hardy has had no direct contact with the 
owner of the FPU or FSO in 2012 and 
terminated support services in 
March 2012. 
We are pleased to report that there were 
no recordable injuries for PY-3 oil ﬁeld 
support services through to termination 
of contract services. As such there is no 
change to our HSE record for 2012.
Environmental management system 
Hardy’s environmental management 
system is intended to mitigate the risks 
of marine pollution due to routine and 
accidental discharges of wastes and 
consequent adverse impacts on the 
marine environment. In 2011 the PY-3 ﬁeld 
has been suspended in accordance with 
international industry standard.

Business Review
Corporate Social Responsibility continued
Our people
Being a rewarding, challenging and 
pleasant place to work
The Board is appreciative of the continued 
professionalism and commitment that our 
employees have demonstrated during a 
year of transition and uncertainty. Following 
the Company’s strategic review the 
decision was taken to undertake cost 
reducing measures which resulted in the 
regrettable reduction of staff in some areas. 
Outlook
The Board believes that prevention of 
accidents and ill health, and protection 
of the environment are essential to the 
efﬁcient operation of its business. The 
Board is committed to high standards of 
HSE protection. These aspects command 
equal prominence with other business 
considerations in the decision-making 
process. HSE protection are 
responsibilities shared by everyone 
working for the Company and the full 
support of all the Company’s staff, 
corporate partners and contractors is vital 
to the successful implementation of this 
policy. The Board ensures that personnel 
are aware of their delegated HSE 
responsibilities and are properly trained to 
undertake them diligently. The Board aims 
to ensure that the necessary resources 
are provided to support this policy fully 
and to seek continuous improvement in 
performance.
“ I would like to acknowledge the high level  
of professionalism, commitment and patience 
demonstrated by our employees during a year  
of transition and uncertainty.” 
Local content 
India has an extensive pool of upstream oil 
and gas professionals. As a result we have 
been fortunate to assemble and maintain 
100 per cent local content of our India-
based professionals and staff.
Management have now put in place 
concrete plans for each of the Company’s 
assets and our India team will continue to 
be instrumental in driving the core of our 
business. We expect to realise a number 
of key objectives in 2013 and intend to 
enhance our technical, operational and 
management competencies in due course. 
Management have set ambitious targets 
which will require Hardy employees to 
maintain their high level of proﬁciency 
and strive for excellence.
The Board would like to take this 
opportunity to recognise the importance 
of our team and acknowledge their efforts 
and patience in the past year. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Risks and Uncertainties
As an oil and gas exploration and 
production company with operations 
focused in India, Hardy is subject to 
a variety of risks and uncertainties. 
Managing risk effectively is a critical 
element of our corporate responsibility 
and underpins the safe delivery of our 
business plans and strategic objectives. 
It protects our reputation, supports our 
ability to do business and helps to create 
long-term competitive advantage. The 
Group has a systematic approach to risk 
identiﬁcation and management which 
combines the Board’s assessment of 
risk with risk factors originating from and 
identiﬁed by the Group’s senior 
management team.
Clear responsibility
The Board is responsible for the 
overall Group strategy, acquisition 
and divestment policy, approval of major 
capital expenditure projects, corporate 
costs, signiﬁcant ﬁnancing matters and 
the management of risk. The Board 
recognises that risk is inherent across 
Hardy’s operations, and all activities are 
subject to an appropriate review to ensure 
that risks are identiﬁed, monitored and 
managed to the extent possible.
Identiﬁcation and monitoring
The Board has adopted a framework for 
risk assessment and monitoring providing 
for four distinct categories: strategic; 
ﬁnancial; operational; and compliance. 
The Board’s review of the Company’s risks 
and uncertainties involves a detailed 
description of each risk and an assessment 
of its perceived relevance and likelihood 
of materially impacting Hardy’s business. 
Risks that are identiﬁed as high and/or 
trending upwards are noted and assigned 
to the Executive Directors to monitor and, 
if possible, pro-actively mitigate. The Board 
is provided with regular updates of the 
identiﬁed principal risks at scheduled 
Board meetings.
The underlying risks and uncertainties 
inherent with Hardy’s current business 
model are summarised below.
Strategy risk
The Group’s strategy is predominantly 
driven by the exploration, appraisal, 
development and production of its existing 
assets in India. There are risks inherent in 
the exploration, appraisal, development 
and production of oil and gas reserves and 
resources. The Group’s strategy includes 
acquiring additional oil and gas properties 
principally in India. The Group cannot 
guarantee that it will be able to identify 
appropriate properties, or negotiate 
acquisitions on favourable terms, or that 
it will be able to secure the ﬁnancing 
necessary to complete such future 
acquisitions.
Financial risk
Any volatility and future decreases in 
international crude oil prices or India-
natural gas prices could materially and 
adversely affect the Group’s business, 
prospects, ﬁnancial condition and results 
of operations. Other major ﬁnancial risks 
facing the Company are: inability to 
access debt and/or equity ﬁnancing for 
further exploration and development; cost 
inﬂation or overruns activities; and overall 
deterioration of shareholder sentiment. 
Additional discussion of ﬁnancial risks 
is provided for in the Financial Review 
section.
Operations risk
Exploration and production activities 
by their nature involve signiﬁcant risks. 
Risks such as delays in executing work 
programmes as a result of access to 
drilling rigs, in the construction and 
commissioning of production facilities or 
other technical difﬁculties, lack of access 
to key infrastructure, adverse weather 
conditions, environmental hazards, 
industrial accidents, occupational and 
health hazards, technical failures, labour 
disputes, unusual or unexpected 
geological formations, explosions 
and other acts of God are inherent 
to the business.
Compliance risk
The Group’s current business is 
dependent on the continuing enforceability 
of the PSCs, farm-in agreements and 
exploration and development licences. 
The Group’s core operational activities 
are dependent on securing various 
governmental approvals. Developments 
in politics, laws, regulations and/or 
general adverse public sentiment could 
compromise securing such approvals 
in the future. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Business Review
Principal Risks For 2013
Throughout the year, Hardy’s senior management and Board have critically reviewed and evaluated the risks facing the Group. 
As a result of this process, the Board has identiﬁed principle risks and uncertainties for 2013 and has established clear policies 
and responsibilities to mitigate their possible negative impact to the business, a summary of which is provided below:
Risk or uncertainty Mitigating action
Strategic Ineffective or poorly executed strategy fails to create stakeholder value or fails 
to meet stakeholder expectations.
Asset portfolio over-weighted to long-cycle 
appraisal and development licences
Preferential allocation of resources to advance current discoveries to the development 
stage. Continually assessing acquisition opportunities, consistent with stated objectives, 
offering near-term production increases.
Sub-commercial exploration results Effective portfolio management comprised with rigorous review and implementation of 
best practice exploration processes and techniques. Internal expertise review process 
and, when necessary, third party consultation prior to Board approval.
Financial Asset performance and excessive leverage results in the Group being unable 
to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as and when they are due.
Absence of stakeholder approval for 
proposed development and appraisal 
programmes
Regular and proactive communication with stakeholders to identify and maintain an 
understanding of key agendas and constraints. Maintain sufﬁcient working capital to 
account for extended delays and maintain tight controls on overhead inﬂation.
Liquidated damages for incomplete  
minimum work programmes
The Company has minimum work commitments on its exploration assets. The GS-01 
block has reached the end of its exploration phase with outstanding MWP commitment 
and D3 MWP has yet to be completed. The Company makes provisions when the 
amount is ascertained by the operator of the licence. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
Risk or uncertainty Mitigating action
Operational Operational event impacting staff, contractors, communities or the environment 
leading to loss of reputation and/or revenue.
Loss of well control could occur during 
offshore drilling operations
The Company’s planned work programme for 2013 involves the drilling of up to two 
deepwater wells. These wells are on non-operated blocks and, as such, the Company 
relies on the HSE procedures mandated by the operator and the contractors. Liabilities 
associated with an accident are insured to the extent reasonably possible.
Lack of control on timing of exploration 
on D3
Proactive communication with partners to drive corporate interests and mandates. 
Each licence is governed by joint operating agreements, which provide for processes 
and procedures designed to ensure that the input and interests of non-operating 
partners are considered.
Securing timely approval for a PY-3 full ﬁeld 
development plan
Proactive communication with partners to address individual interests and agendas. 
Clearly formulate and articulate mutual beneﬁcial proposals. Mitigate expenditures prior 
to budget approvals.
Loss of key staff and succession planning The Company’s ability to compete in the upstream oil and gas exploration and 
production industry is dependent on being able to retain and attract experienced 
technical personnel. Structure performance-based remuneration practices and promote 
a positive and rewarding work environment.
Compliance The overall external political, industry or market environment may negatively impact 
on the Group’s ability to independently grow and manage its business.
Deteriorating stakeholder sentiment Communicate with investors on a regular basis providing transparent and timely 
information. Effectively convey strategic goals and objectives and improve delivery.
Changing regulatory and political 
environment in India
Develop sustainable relationships with governments and communities. Indian PSC 
includes ﬁscal stability clauses. Actively collaborate with industry groups to formulate 
and communicate interests to government authorities.

Governance Report
Introduction
The Board is committed to ensuring that high levels of corporate 
governance are achieved. Hardy Oil and Gas plc is incorporated 
in the Isle of Man and is not subject to any corporate governance 
regime in its place of incorporation.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company does maintain a listing on the London Stock 
Exchange and as a result is required to make certain statements 
relating to the way it is governed, covering issues provided for in 
The UK Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010 
(the UK Code). The Code is publically available on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk. In compliance 
with the UK Code, this report describes the manner in which the 
Company has applied the main principles of governance set out 
in the UK Code and provides an explanation where the Board has 
chosen to not comply.
The Company is a small cap upstream oil and gas company 
with a modest resource base. The Company has a clear mandate 
to optimise the allocation of limited resources to support its 
exploration programme and development plans. As such, the 
Company strives to maintain a balance between conservation of 
limited resources and maintaining robust corporate governance 
practices. As the Company evolves the Board is committed to 
enhancing the Company’s corporate governance policies and 
practices deemed appropriate for the size and maturity of the 
organisation.
Set out below are Hardy’s corporate governance practices for 
the year ended 31 December 2012. Disclosures below include 
matters where Hardy has not fully complied during 2012.
Leadership 
The Company is headed by an effective Board which is 
collectively responsible for the long-term success of the 
Company.
The role of the Board 
The Board sets the Group’s strategy, ensuring that the necessary 
resources are in place to achieve the agreed strategic priorities, 
and reviews management and ﬁnancial performance. It is 
accountable to shareholders for the creation and delivery of 
strong, sustainable ﬁnancial performance and long-term 
shareholder value. To achieve this, the Board directs and monitors 
the Company’s affairs within a framework of controls which enable 
risk to be assessed and managed effectively. The Board also has 
responsibility for setting the Group’s core values and standards of 
business conduct and for ensuring that these, together with the 
Group’s obligations to its stakeholders, are widely understood 
throughout the Company. The Board has a formal schedule of 
matters reserved which is provided later in this report.
Board meetings 
The core activities of the Board are carried out in scheduled 
meetings of the Board and its Committees. These meetings are 
timed to link to key events in the Company’s corporate calendar 
and regular reviews of the business are conducted. Additional 
meetings and conference calls are arranged to consider matters 
which require decisions outside the scheduled meetings. During 
2012, the Board met on six occasions. The Board endeavours to 
arrange for one meeting to be held at its India-based ofﬁce. This 
provides senior managers from across several disciplines with 
the opportunity to present to the Board and to meet the Board 
members informally. It also provides the Board with an 
opportunity to meet a broad cross-section of staff and to assess 
senior managers at ﬁrst hand.
Outside the scheduled meetings of the Board, the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer maintain frequent contact with the other 
Directors to discuss any issues of concern they may have relating 
to the Company or their areas of responsibility, and to keep them 
fully briefed on the Company’s operations.
Matters reserved speciﬁcally for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved that can 
only be decided by the Board. The key matters reserved are the 
consideration and approval of:
 – the Group’s overall strategy;
 – ﬁnancial statements and dividend policy;
 – management structure including succession planning, 
appointments and remuneration (supported by the Nomination 
Committee);
 – material acquisitions and disposal, material contracts, major 
capital expenditure projects and budgets;
 – capital structure, debt and equity ﬁnancing and other matters;
 – risk management and internal controls (supported by the Audit 
Committee);
 – the Company’s corporate governance and compliance 
arrangements; and
 – corporate policies.
Subject to those reserved matters, the Board delegates authority 
for the management of the business primarily to the Executive 
Director and members of the Company’s Senior Executive team. 
Certain other matters are delegated to the Board committees, 
namely the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
Summary of the Board’s work in the year 
During 2012, the Board considered all relevant matters within 
its remit, but focused in particular on the following key issues:
 – strategy and management with a particular focus on the 
optimisation of the Company’s India-focused portfolio;
 – ﬁnancial management;
 – regulatory/compliance;
 – environment, health and safety;
 – appointment and succession planning – this is dealt with more 
fully in the Nomination Committee’s report on pages 44 and 
45; and 
 – stakeholder relations.

Financial Statement 
Company Information 
Division of responsibility 
There is a deﬁned separation of the responsibilities between 
Alasdair Locke, the Non-Executive Chairman, and Ian MacKenzie, 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, which has been set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. The Chairman is primarily responsible for 
the effective working of the Board, whilst the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer is responsible for the operational management of the 
business, for developing strategy in consultation with the Board 
and for implementation of the strategy.
The Chairman
On appointment as Chairman on 16 January 2012, Alasdair Locke 
met the independence criteria set out in the Code. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring a broad range of business 
and commercial experience to the Company and have a particular 
responsibility to challenge independently and constructively the 
performance of the Executive management and to monitor the 
performance of the management team in the delivery of the 
agreed objectives and targets. As part of this responsibility, the 
Non-Executive Directors meet at least twice a year without the 
Executive Directors present. Separately, the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer hold informal meetings with the Non-Executive 
Directors to discuss current issues affecting the Company.
As Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, Peter Milne is 
available to meet shareholders if they have concerns that cannot 
be resolved through discussion with the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer or for which such contact is inappropriate. Efforts are made 
to ensure that the Non-Executive Directors are briefed on the more 
technical and operational aspects of our activities. 
Non-Executive Directors are initially appointed for a term of three 
years, which may, subject to satisfactory performance and 
re-election by shareholders, be extended by mutual agreement. 
Pradip Shah and Yogeshwar Sharma have been members of the 
Board for over nine years. As a result they are subject to re-
election on an annual basis.
Delegations of authority
Board Committees
The Board has delegated matters to three committees, namely 
the Audit, Remuneration, and Nomination Committees. The 
memberships, roles and activities of these committees are 
detailed in separate reports: the Audit Committee on pages 35 
and 36, the Nomination Committee on pages 44 and 45, and the 
Remuneration Committee on pages 37 to 43. Each committee 
reports to the Board and the issues considered at meetings of 
the committees are provided by the respective committee 
chairmen. The terms of reference of each committee are 
reviewed by the Board every other year.
In January 2013 the Board agreed to form a Risk Committee and 
appointed Ian MacKenzie (chair), Alasdair Locke and Peter Milne 
as members. The Risk Committee’s terms of reference will be 
available on the Company’s website.
Executive Committee
The Board delegates authority for the management of the 
day-to-day business and operational matters to the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and other Executives. The Executive Committee 
meets on an informal basis at least once a month. The Committee 
currently comprises the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer (of HEPI) and the Treasurer & Corporate Affairs Executive.
Other governance matters
All of the Directors are aware that independent professional 
advice is available to each Director in order to properly discharge 
their duties as a Director. In addition, each Director and Board 
committee has access to the advice of the Company Secretary.
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is Richard Vanderplank who is retained 
on a consultancy basis. He is available to Directors and 
responsible for the Board complying with Isle of Man procedures. 
He is supported by the Treasurer & Corporate Affairs Executive 
in the provision of company secretarial services to the Company.
Effectiveness
The Board currently comprises of a Non-Executive Chairman, 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, and three independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Biographical details of the Board members are set 
out on page 28 and 29 of this report.
The Directors are of the view that the Board and its committees 
consist of Directors with an appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, independence and diverse backgrounds to enable 
them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.
Changes to the Board
The following changes in Board composition were made during 
the year:
 – On 16 January 2012, the Board approved the appointment 
of Alasdair Locke as Non-Executive Director and Chairman 
of the Board.
 – On 1 March 2012, the Board approved the appointment 
of Ian MacKenzie as Executive Director and became Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer effective 16 May 2012.
 – On 1 March 2012, the Board approved the appointment 
of Peter Milne as a Non-Executive Director.
 – On 16 May 2012, Yogeshwar Sharma stepped down as Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and the Board conﬁrmed his re-appointment 
as a Non-Executive Director.
 – On 16 May 2012, Carol Bell, Ian Bruce and Paul Mortimer 
ceased to be Directors of the Company.
At the Company’s AGM held on 16 May 2012, shareholders 
elected Alasdair Locke, Ian MacKenzie, and Peter Milne to the 
Board. In addition Pradip Shah and Yogeshwar Sharma were 
re-elected as Non-Executive Directors.
Independence
The Non-Executive Directors bring a broad range of business 
and commercial experience to the Company. The Board 
considers Alasdair Locke, Peter Milne and Pradip Shah to be 
independent Directors in character and judgement.
Pradip Shah has served as a Director for a period of more than 
nine years. He has also been awarded 260,233 employee stock 
options to purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company. Such 
options were granted upon the Company’s listing on AiM in June 
2005. The Board has dispensed with the grant of stock options 
to the Non-Executive Directors since 2005. He is based in India  Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Governance
Governance report continued
and is actively involved in many business endeavours, holding 
executive and non-executive roles across a diverse range of 
industries and is well established within India’s commerce and 
political communities. Notwithstanding Pradip Shah’s tenure and 
option holdings, the Board is fully satisﬁed that he demonstrates 
complete independence, robustness of character and judgement 
both in his designated role and as a Board member. The 
appointment of a new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, in 2012, has 
reinforced the Board’s view of his independence.
Yogeshwar Sharma has served as an Executive Director of Hardy 
for more than nine years. He was the Company’s Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer from 4 March 2010 to 16 May 2012. He has previously 
been granted 1,280,700 options to purchase Ordinary Shares 
in the Company (details of the awards are provided on page 40). 
Such options were issued as part of his remuneration package 
as an Executive Director of the Company. The Board considers 
Yogeshwar Sharma a signiﬁcant member of the Board, providing: 
upstream oil and gas technical expertise; strong relationships in, 
and an in-depth perspective of, the India commercial and 
geopolitical environment; and, as a founder of the Company, 
possesses signiﬁcant knowledge of the history of Hardy. Due 
to his recent tenure as an Executive Ofﬁcer and interest in Hardy 
share options, the Board does not consider Yogeshwar Sharma 
to be an independent Director. 
Appointments
The Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the 
structure, size and composition of the Board and making 
recommendations to the Board with regards to any required 
changes.
Commitments
All Directors have disclosed any signiﬁcant commitments to the 
Board and conﬁrmed that they have sufﬁcient time to discharge 
their duties.
Induction
All new Directors received an induction as soon as practical on 
joining the Board. This included meetings with the Executive 
Committee members and other senior management and, where 
appropriate, visits to the Company’s principal ofﬁces of operation. 
The new Directors were also provided an overview of their duties 
as a Director, corporate governance policies and established 
Board procedures as part of the induction process. An induction 
was given to Messrs Locke, MacKenzie and Milne at the 
beginning of 2012. In 2012, the Chairman reviewed training and 
development needs with each Director. It was agreed that each 
Director had the necessary current and relevant experience and 
expertise to effectively discharge their respective responsibilities.
Conﬂict of interest
A Director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he or she has, 
or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conﬂicts, or possibly 
may conﬂict with the interests of the Company. The Board had 
satisﬁed itself that there is no compromise to the independence 
of those Directors who have appointments on the Boards of, or 
relationships with, companies outside the Company. The Board 
requires Directors to declare all appointments and other 
situations which could result in a possible conﬂict of interest.
Board performance and evaluation
Hardy has a policy of appraising Board performance annually. 
Having reviewed various approaches to Board appraisal, Hardy 
has concluded that for a company of its current scale, an internal 
process in which all Board members submit answers to a 
questionnaire that considers the functionality of the Board and its 
committees is most appropriate at this stage. This questionnaire 
also contains a series of questions to evaluate the performance 
of individual Board members and that of the Chairman.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is responsible 
for reporting on this matter to the Board, including reviewing the 
performance of the Chairman, with the exception of reviewing 
their own performance (which is carried out by the Chairman). 
The process of completing the performance evaluation of the 
Board as a whole, its Chairman, and individual Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors, was completed in early 2013. In 
summary, it was felt that the Board was functioning well and 
that all the Directors feel proud to be part of Hardy’s team.
Re-election
The Board has agreed that Pradip Shah and Yogeshwar Sharma 
will stand for re-election at the Company’s 2013 AGM. The 
Directors’ position is subject to satisfactory performance of their 
responsibilities and is subject to reappointment by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors is pleased 
with the attendance of all Directors at Board and committee 
meetings, despite signiﬁcant travel and time requirements. The 
Board of Directors is also satisﬁed with the participation by all 
the Directors in formulating corporate strategies and for their 
engagement in meaningful dialogue and discussions at Board 
and committee meetings.
Accountability
The Board is committed to providing shareholders with a clear 
assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. This is 
achieved through this report and as required other periodic 
ﬁnancial and trading statements. 
The arrangements established by the Board for the application 
of risk management and internal control principles are detailed on 
pages 25 to 27. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee 
oversight of the relationship with the Company’s auditors as 
outlined in the Audit Committee report on page 35.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors likely 
to affect its future operations, ﬁnancial position, and liquidity 
position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Statement, Review of Operations, Financial Review, 
and the Risks and Uncertainties sections of the Annual Report. 
In addition, note 25 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
discloses the Company’s ﬁnancial risk management practices 
with respect to its capital structure, foreign currency risk, liquidity 
risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk, and other 
related matters. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
The Directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of 
the opinion that the Company has adequate working capital to 
execute its operations and has the ability to access additional 
ﬁnancing, if required, over the next 12 months. The Directors, 
therefore, have made an informed judgement, at the time of 
approving ﬁnancial statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result, 
the Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance 
for Directors of UK Companies 2009.
Internal controls
The Board of Directors reviews the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal controls in line with the requirement 
of the Code. The internal control system is designed to manage 
the risk of failure to achieve its business objectives. This covers 
internal ﬁnancial and operational controls, compliances and risk 
management. The Company has necessary procedures in place 
for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors acknowledge their 
responsibility for the Company’s system of internal controls and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board conﬁrms the need for 
an ongoing process for identiﬁcation, evaluation and 
management of signiﬁcant risks faced by the Company. A risk 
assessment for each project is carried out by a team consisting 
of the Executive Directors and senior management before 
making any commitments. This team meets as and when 
required. Internal and external risks, including exploration and 
development risks, regulatory and compliance obligations under 
various production-sharing contracts, economics including oil 
price, interest rate and currency exposure, as well as natural 
catastrophes are continuously assessed.
The Audit Committee regularly reviews and reports to the Board 
on the effectiveness of the system of internal control. Given the 
size of the Company, the relative simplicity of the systems and the 
close involvement of senior management, the Board considers 
that there is no current requirement for an internal audit function. 
The procedures that have been established to provide internal 
ﬁnancial control are considered appropriate for a company of its 
size and include controls over expenditure, regular reconciliations 
and management accounts. Most of the assets are owned jointly 
with others, budgets and expenditures are rigorously reviewed 
and approvals as well as external project audits take place with 
respect to capital and operating expenditures on a regular basis.
The Directors are responsible for taking such steps as are 
reasonably available to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Business model
Hardy creates value through the exploration of undiscovered 
hydrocarbons. In order to explore we must ﬁrst be granted a 
licence by the governments of the countries in which we choose 
to invest. After extensive analysis, exploration campaigns are 
planned to try to discover oil and gas ﬁelds within underexplored 
sedimentary basins. When we have a signiﬁcant discovery we 
undertake appraisal programmes which may include the drilling of 
wells and further geotechnical analysis to determine the size and 
quality of the discovery. If the appraisal programme conﬁrms that 
development of a discovery will be commercially and ﬁnancially 
viable, we begin work on a development plan. This maps out how 
we will get the hydrocarbons into production to generate revenue 
and cash ﬂow. We also create value through the implementation 
of enhanced production strategies to optimise the value of 
recoverable hydrocarbons from existing producing ﬁelds.
Remuneration
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee 
responsibility for agreeing the remuneration policy for the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and senior executives. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 and 43 contains full 
details of the role and activities of the Remuneration Committee.
Shareholder relations
Communication and dialogue
Open and transparent communication with shareholders is given 
high priority and there is regular dialogue with institutional 
investors, as well as general presentations made at the time of 
the release of the annual and interim results. All Directors are 
kept aware of changes in major shareholders in the Company 
and are available to meet with shareholders who have speciﬁc 
interests or concerns. The Company issues its results promptly 
to individual shareholders and also publishes them on the 
Company’s website: www.hardyoil.com. Regular updates to 
record news in relation to the Company and the status of its 
exploration and development programmes are included on the 
Company’s website. Shareholders and other interested parties 
can subscribe to receive these news updates by email by 
registering online on the website free of charge. 
The Chairman and Executive Director are available to meet 
with institutional shareholders to discuss any issues and gain 
an understanding of the Company’s business, its strategies 
and governance. At the 2012 Annual General Meeting of 
shareholders, most Directors were present, including the 
Chairman. Peter Milne currently serves as the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company and is 
available to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been 
resolved through the normal channels of Chairman or Executive 
Director. Meetings are also held with the corporate governance 
representatives of institutional investors when requested.
Annual General Meeting
At every AGM individual shareholders are given the opportunity 
to put questions to the Chairman, Executive Directors and to 
other members of the Board that may be present. Notice of the 
AGM is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting. Details of proxy votes for and against each resolution, 
together with the votes withheld, are announced to the London 
Stock Exchange and are published on the Company’s website 
as soon as practical after the meeting.  Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Governance
Governance Report continued
Non-compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company did not comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code in the following matters during 2012:
Code provision Subject matter Discussion
B.1.1 Non-Executive Directors meeting 
independence requirements
Pradip Shah has served on the Board for more than nine years. He was also granted 
share options in 2005 when the Company’s Ordinary Shares were listed on AIM. 
Notwithstanding the above, Pradip’s actions in 2012 demonstrated independent 
character and judgement and having regard for the Company’s appointment of a 
new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer the Board considers Pradip Shah independent.
The Board considers Yogeshwar Sharma an instrumental member of the Board, 
providing: upstream oil and gas technical expertise; strong relationships in, and an 
in-depth perspective of, the India commercial and geopolitical environment; and, as 
a founder of the Company, signiﬁcant knowledge of the Company’s history. Due to his 
recent tenure as an Executive Ofﬁcer and his interest in share options, the Board does 
not consider Yogeshwar Sharma to be independent. 
The Board conﬁrms, notwithstanding the above, that it considers Pradip Shah as an 
independent Director.
B.2.4 Use of an external search 
consultancy or open advertising 
Appointment of Non-Executive Director – With the expected departure of the Audit 
Committee chair, the primary recruitment criteria for a non-executive candidate was 
current and relevant ﬁnancial expertise and signiﬁcant industry experience. Mr Locke 
put forward Peter Milne, a strong candidate that met the Board’s identiﬁed criteria. 
As a result the Board deemed the expense of securing an external consultant 
inappropriate.
D.1.3 Remuneration for Non-Executive 
Directors should not include share 
options
Share options were granted in 2005 to Non-Executive Directors when the Company 
was listed on AIM and not subject to the UK Code.
No share options have been granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
The Board believes that its composition is suitable having regard to its international stature with a focus on India. Notwithstanding 
the long tenure of some of the Directors, the Board believes all of the Non-Executive Directors provide valuable advice and counsel 
in furthering the business objectives of the Company.
Although Hardy is a publicly listed company and has been listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities 
since February 2008, the Company is a small cap upstream oil and gas company with a modest resource base. The Company has 
a clear mandate to optimise the allocation of limited resources to support its exciting exploration programme. As such, the Company 
strives to maintain a balance between conservation of limited resources and maintaining robust corporate governance practices. 
As the Company evolves, the Board is committed to enhancing the Company’s corporate governance policies and practices 
deemed appropriate for the size and maturity of the organisation.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee comprises of three Non-Executive Directors 
and oversees the Company’s ﬁnancial reporting and internal 
controls, and provides a formal reporting link with the external 
auditors. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving 
the Annual Report and Accounts and the half-yearly reports 
remains with the Board. 
Main responsibilities
The Audit Committee acts as a preparatory body for discharging 
the Board’s responsibilities in a wide range of ﬁnancial matters by:
 – monitoring the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements and formal 
announcements relating to the Company’s ﬁnancial 
performance;
 – reviewing signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting issues and accounting 
policies and disclosures in ﬁnancial reports;
 – overseeing that an effective system of internal control and risk 
management systems are maintained;
 – ensuring that effective whistle-blowing, anti-fraud and bribery 
procedures are in place;
 – considering the Company’s internal audit requirements and 
make recommendations to the Board;
 – overseeing the Board’s relationship with the external auditors 
and, where appropriate, the selection of new external auditors;
 – approving non-audit services provided by the external auditors, 
or any other accounting ﬁrm, ensuring the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors is safeguarded when 
appointing them to conduct non-audit services; and
 – ensuring compliance with legal requirements, accounting 
standards and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules.
The Audit Committee terms of reference can be accessed via 
the Company’s website www.hardyoil.com. Following a review, 
the Board approved the amendment of the Audit Committee’s 
terms of reference in January 2013. The Committee fully 
discharged its responsibilities during the year.
Governance
The UK Code requires that at least one member of the Audit 
Committee has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. Mr 
Milne, who has been the Chairman of the Audit Committee from 
16 May 2012, has been a Chartered Accountant for 35 years and 
has over 30 years of oil and gas sector experience. He was until 
2010 the Finance Director of Abbot Group plc, the largest UK 
headquartered drilling contractor, with turnover of more than £1 
billion, operations in 20 countries and employing over 8,000 
people. Pradip Shah, who was a member of the Audit Committee 
throughout the year, is also a Chartered Accountant. As a result 
the Board is satisﬁed that the Audit Committee has recent and 
relevant ﬁnancial experience.
Members of the Audit Committee are appointed by the Board 
and all of its members are considered to be independent.
The Company’s external auditors are Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP 
and the Audit Committee closely monitor the level of audit and 
non-audit services they provide to the Group. In 2012 Crowe 
Clark Whitehill LLP did not provide non-audit services to the 
Company.
In 2012 the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (of Hardy Exploration & 
Production (India) Inc) and the Treasurer were invited to attend 
each meeting of the Audit Committee. The external auditors have 
unrestricted access to the Audit Committee Chairman. During 
the 2012 audit process, the Audit Committee Chairman met with 
the audit engagement partner from Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP, 
without the presence of management.
Meetings
In 2012, the Audit Committee met on three occasions. Meetings 
are scheduled to allow sufﬁcient time to enable full discussion of 
key topics. Some or all Executive Directors attend meetings of the 
Audit Committee by invitation. The attendance of members at the 
Audit Committee meetings held in 2012 was as follows:

The key work undertaken by the Audit Committee was as follows:
Consideration and review of full-year and half-yearly results
 – The Audit Committee met with the external auditors as part 
of the full-year and half-yearly accounts approval process.
 – During the audit process the Audit Committee considered the 
most appropriate treatment and disclosure of any new or 
judgemental matters identiﬁed during the audit of the full-year 
accounts or half-yearly review, as well as any other 
recommendations of observation made by the external auditor.
Audit planning and update on relevant accounting 
developments 
 – The Company prepares ﬁnancial statements under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
 – The Audit Committee continued to review the appropriateness 
of the Company’s accounting policies and was satisﬁed that 
the policies adopted by management are currently appropriate.
 – The Audit Committee approved the scope of the work to be 
undertaken by the external auditors for interim and year-end 
statutory audits. 
Consideration and approval of the risk management 
framework, appropriateness of key performance indicators 
 – The Audit Committee considered the recommendations put 
forward by the management to adopt a risk management 
framework which provides for a systematic approach to risk 
identiﬁcation and management which combines the Board’s 
assessment of risk with risk factors originating from and 
identiﬁed by the Group’s senior management.
 – The management provided clear updates of risk and 
uncertainties facing the Company and accompanying actions 
to mitigate such risk.
 – The Audit Committee undertook a review of the key 
performance indicators that had been adopted by the 
Company in previous years. As a result of the review the Audit 
Committee recommended that the Board modify its reported 
key performance indicators for 2012. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Review of the Company’s Code of Business Conduct 
 – In line with best practice and to ensure that Hardy works to the 
highest ethical standard, in early 2013 the Company adopted 
a Code of Business Conduct which provides clear guidance 
for ethical behaviour and decision making as well as whistle-
blowing and anti-bribery procedures and practices. The Code 
of Business Conduct was introduced to all employees in the 
ﬁrst quarter of 2013 and a copy is available on the Company’s 
website www.hardyoil.com. The Committee considers the 
whistle-blowing procedure to be appropriate for the size and 
scale of the Company.
Review the Audit Committee terms of reference
 – The Audit Committee reviewed its terms of reference during 
the year. As a result of the review the Audit Committee 
recommended that the Board adopt several amendments 
to comply with current ISCA guidelines and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Key amendments were:
 – 9.3 – added a committee duty to review and monitor the 
Company’s compliance, whistle-blower and fraud policies 
and practices;
 – 9.6 – added a committee duty to advise the Board as to 
whether the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 
provide a fair and balanced representation of the Company.
 – A copy of the revised terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website www.hardyoil.com.
Review of the effectiveness of the Audit Committee
 – During the year the Board completed a review of its 
effectiveness which included the assessment of the Audit 
Committee. The review was coordinated by the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and Treasurer. As a result the Audit 
Committee was considered to be operating effectively and 
in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Internal controls
 – As part of my induction in 2012, I undertook a comprehensive 
review of the Company’s internal control and risk management 
policies and practices. The Company’s established procedures 
to provide internal ﬁnancial control are considered appropriate 
for a company of Hardy’s size and current activities. The 
procedures include controls over expenditure, regular 
reconciliations and management accounts. Most of the assets 
are owned jointly with others and as a result budgets and 
expenditures are subject to rigorous reviews and approvals. 
External project audits, of jointly held assets, take place with 
respect to capital and operating expenditures on a regular basis.
The UK Code states that the Audit Committee should have 
primary responsibility for making a recommendation on the 
appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external auditors.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present a report on 
Directors’ remuneration for 2012, for which we will be seeking 
approval from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.
The Committee is aware of the sensitive nature of executive 
remuneration and regularly considers the guidelines on executive 
remuneration set out by the Association of British Insurers and 
discusses remuneration practice with major shareholders.
The Committee has noted feedback from various shareholder 
interest groups regarding the Company’s previous remuneration 
practices. Based on the Committee’s recommendations, the 
Board has adopted a simple and effective incentive arrangement. 
The Committee believes the current incentive arrangement 
adopted best serves the mission that management is charged 
with, which is focused on creating shareholder value.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank shareholders for their 
continued support. Should any shareholder wish to contact me 
in connection with the Company’s senior executive remuneration 
policy, please email me at investor.relations@hardyoil.com.

Introduction
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority. The relevant legislation requires the 
auditors to report to the Company’s members on the ‘auditable 
part’ of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state whether, 
in their opinion, the part of the report that has been subject to 
audit has been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant 
legislation. This report is therefore divided into separate sections 
to disclose the audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises of three 
Non-Executive Directors: Pradip Shah (Chairman), Alasdair 
Locke, and Peter Milne. 
Hardy’s Remuneration Committee operates within the terms of 
reference approved by the Board. The Remuneration Committee 
reviewed its terms of reference during the year. As a result of the 
review the Remuneration Committee recommended that the 
Board adopt several amendments to comply with current ISCA 
guidelines and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The key 
amendments were:
 – Duties – Clauses 9.3 to 9.7 – several clauses were amended 
clarifying the Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities to 
monitor internal and external remuneration trends, full authority 
to commission remuneration consultants and determine 
individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, Executive 
Director and other senior executives;
 – other matters regarding: access to resources; timely training; 
consideration of law and regulations; and periodic review of 
committee performance.
A copy of the revised terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website www.hardyoil.com.
Committee’s main responsibilities
 – The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration policy, 
employment terms and remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and also reviews the remuneration of senior management. 
 – The Remuneration Committee’s role is advisory in nature and 
it makes recommendations to the Board on the overall 
remuneration packages for Executive Directors and senior 
management in order to attract, retain and motivate high-quality 
executives capable of achieving the Group’s objectives. 
 – The Remuneration Committee also reviews proposals for 
the share option plans and other incentive plans, makes 
recommendations for the grant of awards under such plans, 
as well as approving the terms of any performance-related 
pay schemes.
 – The Board’s policy is to remunerate the Group’s senior 
executives fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the 
recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualiﬁed 
personnel.
 – The Remuneration Committee, while considering the 
remuneration packages of Hardy executives, has reviewed 
the policies of comparable groups in the industry. The 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by 
the Chairman and the Executive Director outside the framework 
of the Remuneration Committee. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Committee evaluation
The performance of the Remuneration Committee was evaluated 
as part of the Board evaluation which was completed in 2013. 
The review was coordinated by the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and Treasurer. As a result the Remuneration 
Committee was considered to be operating effectively.
Committee advisers
In the past the Remuneration Committee had engaged Simon 
Patterson of Patterson Associates as a Remuneration Consultant 
to assist the committee in setting the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive Directors. No remuneration advisers 
were retained by the Remuneration Committee during 2012.
The Company also consults with the Company’s major investors 
and investor representative groups as appropriate. No Director 
takes part in any decision directly affecting their remuneration. 
The Company Chairman also absents himself during discussion 
relating to his own fees.
Statement of Hardy’s policy on Directors’ remuneration
The Company’s policy is to maintain levels of remuneration so 
as to attract, motivate, and retain Executive Directors and senior 
executives of the highest calibre who can contribute their 
experience to deliver industry leading performance with the 
Company’s operations. The remuneration package for Executive 
Directors and senior executives comprises of base salary, annual 
bonus, taxable beneﬁts, pension payments and participation in 
the Company’s share incentive arrangements.
A meaningful proportion of executive and senior managements’ 
remuneration is structured so as to link rewards to corporate 
and individual performance, align their interests with those of 
shareholders and to incentivise them to perform at the highest 
levels. The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration 
policy and the employment terms and remuneration of the 
executives and makes recommendations to the Board of 
Directors on the overall remuneration packages for the 
executives.
Remuneration components
Base salaries
The base salaries are reviewed annually. No changes to base 
salaries were made in 2012. Ian MacKenzie joined Hardy on 
1 February 2012 and became a board member on 1 March 2012. 
Senior executive remuneration was last reviewed in 2011.
Pension and other beneﬁts
The Company provides for pension contributions to the Executive 
Director’s personal pension plan as well as life, long-term 
disability and medical insurance. 
Annual bonus
Although the Company has a policy of awarding cash bonuses, 
no such awards have been made to the Executive Director or 
senior executives in 2012. In the future, the Remuneration 
Committee will consider recommending the total amount 
available for annual bonuses having regard to the cash 
requirements and overall performance of the Group. The size of 
the bonus will correspond to the salary of the Executive Director 
and each participant based upon performance targets, including 
corporate, team and individual performance measures. Each year, 
transparent objectives are to be set for each participant.
Share incentive arrangements
The Company has adopted a policy of granting stock option 
awards on an annual basis although stock option awards are 
not made during close periods. The Board believes that equity 
incentives are and will continue to be an important means of 
retaining, attracting and motivating Directors, senior management 
and key employees. The Board has adopted a simple and 
effective incentive arrangement which it believes best serves 
the mission that management is charged with, which is to get 
a higher share price for all shareholders. Pradip Shah received 
his awards at the time the company was listed
Unapproved share options
In June 2005, the Board adopted the share option scheme 
entitling the Company to award options to Directors and 
employees. The Company’s share option scheme was 
considered and approved by the shareholders in 2006. Options 
are not granted at a discount to the market value. Under the 
scheme, options are exercisable between the 1st and 10th 
anniversaries of the date of grant. 
Options granted in June 2005 were subject to performance 
conditions whereby the share price of Hardy would need to rise 
by 20 per cent, 45 per cent and 70 per cent of the price at which 
the Hardy initial public offering (IPO) was undertaken. In the ﬁrst 
year of the performance period, one third of the options would 
become exercisable at or after 12 months following the date of 
grant. One third of the options would become exercisable at or 
after 24 months following the date of grant. The remaining one 
third of the options would become exercisable at or after 36 
months following the date of grant. All of such performance 
conditions have been met.
All options granted in 2010 and subsequent years will generally 
vest between the third and ﬁfth anniversary of the date of 
grant (the “Vesting Period”) subject to the satisfaction of a 
Performance Condition. The Performance Condition shall be 
satisﬁed where at any time during the Vesting Period, the volume  Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Company Information 
weighted average market price of an Ordinary Share for any ten 
consecutive London Stock Exchange trading days is equal to 
or greater than the Ordinary Share price of the Company on the 
date of grant as increased by compounded growth of ﬁve per 
cent per annum in the share price as at the end of such 10-day 
period. In the event that the Performance Condition is not 
satisﬁed by the ﬁfth anniversary of the date of grant, the options 
shall lapse. Options will vest immediately upon the occurrence 
of a Rule 8 Event under the unapproved share option scheme 
(relating to change of control etc).
ExSOP scheme
The ExSOP scheme is an executive shared ownership plan. 
Under the terms of the ExSOP certain employees and/or 
executive Directors may be invited to acquire (for a nominal 
payment), jointly with the trustee of an employee trust, the 
beneﬁcial interest in a number of shares upon the terms of a joint 
ownership agreement (JOA). Under a JOA, the employee/director 
will beneﬁt from any growth in value of the jointly owned shares 
from the time of the award in excess of a “carrying cost” ﬁxed by 
the Committee in respect of each award. Arrangements on similar 
terms may be put in place for Non-Executive Directors. The 
ExSOP was considered and approved by Shareholders at the 
Company’s 2012 Annual General Meeting. To date no awards 
have been made under the ExSOP scheme.
Non-Executive remuneration
Policy
The main goals of the Company’s remuneration policy for the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are to assure alignment 
with shareholders through independence, recognise time 
commitments devoted to corporate affairs and attract and 
retain outstanding candidates.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined 
by the Chairman and the Executive Director outside the 
framework of the Remuneration Committee and approved by 
the Board of Directors. The fees paid are set at a level to attract 
individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make 
a signiﬁcant contribution to the Company’s activities, while also 
reﬂecting the time commitment and responsibility of the role. 
None of the Directors participate in any discussion or votes 
on any proposal relating to his or her own remuneration.
Director fees
Each Non-Executive Director currently receives an annual fee 
of £36,000. Alasdair Locke received an additional annual fee 
of £64,000 to reﬂect his additional responsibilities as Chairman 
of the Board. Peter Milne received an additional £14,000 to 
reﬂect his additional responsibilities as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Each Non-Executive Director is also entitled to the 
reimbursement of necessary travel and other expenses.
Restricted share awards
Effective 1 January 2009, restricted shares are to be issued 
to the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director on an annual 
basis. The number of restricted shares to be issued will be 
equivalent to 25 per cent of their annual fee based on the market 
value of Hardy shares on the last trading day prior to the date of 
issue. These shares will remain restricted for three years from the 
date of issue. The shares will become unrestricted and are 
delivered to the individual three years after the date of issue. The 
share award will be in addition to the annual cash fee. In the event 
of a close period, such shares will not be issued until after the 
close period is over. In the event of change of control of Hardy 
and the participant is no longer a Director going forward, all of 
the restricted shares will vest. In the event of death of a Director, 
all shares will become fully vested. Upon the Director not being 
re-elected at a general meeting of shareholders after offering 
himself for re-election as a Director at a general meeting, the 
shares will vest. In all other circumstances, shares that will remain 
restricted are forfeited if the participant is no longer a Director of 
Hardy. In addition, the Board has discretion to accelerate vesting 
on a date determined by it.
A one-time restricted share award may be made to a new 
Non-Executive Director on joining the Board. Such an award 
was made to Alasdair Locke and Peter Milne following their 
appointments. The shares were allotted to them in March 2012. 
Such shares will be held in trust and will be released after three 
years from the date of issue (subject to earlier release in certain 
circumstances) provided they remain Directors of the Company 
for that period.
Legacy share option awards to Non-Executive Directors
Pradip Shah and Yogeshwar Sharma have previously been 
granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares of Hardy. No 
options have been granted to Non-Executive Directors since 
2005. Yogeshwar Sharma received his awards as part of his 
remuneration package as an executive of Hardy. Pradip Shah 
received his awards before the company was listed.
Options will be forfeited if a Director resigns before the options 
vest. In other circumstances, the vesting of options will be at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee and Board approval. 
In the event of a change of control, all of the unvested options will 
vest. Options granted following the initial public offering in June 
2005 were subject to performance conditions based upon 
appreciation in the price of Ordinary Shares of the Company. 
All of the performance conditions have been met. Subsequent 
options granted have been subject to vesting provisions over a 
three-year period, commencing from the anniversary of the date 
of grant.
Chairman’s additional remuneration
Alasdair Locke’s terms of agreement provides for the one-time 
award of restricted shares equivalent to £50,000 in the event that 
the average price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares remains 
above £3.00 for any consecutive three-month period during the 
term of his appointment. In line with Alasdair Locke’s appointment 
letter, upon the appointment of Ian MacKenzie as Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer, Alasdair Locke was awarded restricted shares equivalent 
to £50,000. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

No price was paid for any grant of options by the Directors to the Company. There were no variations made during the year in the 
terms and conditions with respect to any outstanding share options granted by the Company.
Options granted on 7 June 2005 are subject to performance criteria based upon appreciation in the market value of Ordinary Shares 
of the Company. All of such performance conditions have been met. All subsequent options granted to the end of 2009 are subject to 
vesting provisions whereby one third of the options granted vest on each of the three anniversaries from the date of grant. All options 
granted in 2010 and subsequent years will generally vest between the third and ﬁfth anniversary of the date of grant (the Vesting 
Period) subject to the satisfaction of a Performance Condition. The Performance Condition shall be satisﬁed where at any time during

trading days is equal to or greater than the Ordinary Share price of the Company on the date of grant as increased by compounded 
growth of ﬁve per cent per annum in the share price as at the end of such 10-day period. In the event that the Performance Condition 
is not satisﬁed by the ﬁfth anniversary of the date of grant, the options shall lapse. Options will vest immediately upon the occurrence 
of a Rule 8 Event under the unapproved share option scheme (relating to change of control etc). Ian MacKenzie’s 750,000 share 
options awarded in 2012 are subject to the conditions outlined above.
No share options were exercised by any of the Directors of the Company during 2012.

Restricted shares
As mentioned above, the Board of Directors has adopted a policy whereby restricted shares will be issued to the Chairman and each 
Non-Executive Director on an annual basis. The number of restricted shares to be issued will be equivalent to 25 per cent of their 
annual cash fee based on the market value of Hardy shares on the last trading day prior to the date of issue. These shares will remain 
restricted for three years. The share award will be in addition to the annual cash fee. 
In the event of change of control of Hardy and the participant is no longer a Director going forward, all of the restricted shares will vest. 
In the event of death of a Director, all shares will become fully vested. 
In the event that a Director is not re-elected at a general meeting of shareholders after offering himself for re-election as a Director at 
a general meeting, the shares will vest. In all other circumstances, shares that are still restricted are forfeited if the participant is no 
longer a Director of Hardy. In the event of a close period, the restricted shares will, subject to Board approval, be issued after the 
close period is over. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Chair succession 
Paul Mortimer had advised the Board in 2011 that he intended 
to retire as Chairman. Accordingly, the Nomination Committee 
considered the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board and prepared job speciﬁcations and estimated time 
commitments. Following a comprehensive recruitment process, 
which included the appointment of an external consultant and 
consultation with major shareholders, the Nomination Committee 
made a recommendation to the Board that Alasdair Locke be 
appointed to the Board as Chairman with effect of 16 January 
2012. The recommendation was approved by the Board on 
16 January 2012.
Chief Executive succession 
In late 2011 Yogeshwar Sharma advised the Board of his 
intention to cease being an Executive Director and his desire to 
continue as a Non-Executive Director following the recruitment 
of an appropriate candidate. Subsequently Alasdair Locke, 
Chairman of the Board, put forward a candidate for the 
Nomination Committee’s consideration. Members of the 
Nomination Committee undertook a number of interviews with the 
candidate, resulting in the Nomination Committee recommending 
to the Board the appointment of Ian MacKenzie as Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer.
Board refreshment
In 2012 Carol Bell, Ian Bruce and Paul Mortimer advised the 
Board that they would not be putting themselves forward for 
re-election at the Company’s 2012 Annual General Meeting 
scheduled for 16 May 2012.
Accordingly, the Nomination Committee evaluated the skills 
and experience of the outgoing non-executives, the Committee’s 
review noted that Carol Bell, senior non-executive and Chair of 
the Audit Committee, and Ian Bruce, Chair of the Nomination 
Committee and member of the Audit Committee, had extensive 
relevant ﬁnancial experience and expertise. It was agreed that a 
primary requirement of potential candidates would be current and 
relevant ﬁnancial experience and expertise.
Having consideration for the pending loss of Board members 
with current and relevant ﬁnancial experience and expertise, 
Alasdair Locke put forward a non-executive candidate for the 
Nomination Committee to consider. The Nomination Committee 
interviewed the candidate put forward by Alasdair Locke and 
subsequently recommended to the Board for the appointment 
of Peter Milne as Non-Executive Director. The Board accepted 
the Nomination Committee’s recommendation and Peter Milne 
was appointed as a Non-Executive Director to the board which 
took effective on 1 March 2012.
Board Committee membership
The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating 
appropriate individuals for membership of the Board’s 
Committees. Following the refreshment of the Board a number of 
changes were made to the composition of the Board Committees 
to ensure that they are comprised of individuals with necessary 
skills, knowledge and experience. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Governance
Directors’ Report continued
In addition to the above, the Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and of the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud or other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant to disclosure 
and Transparency Rule 4.1.12
The Directors conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge:
a) the ﬁnancial statements, which are prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Group; and 
b) the Directors’ Report, Annual Report and incorporate 
statements includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
Internal control and risk management systems
The Board has the ultimate responsibility for the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems. The Audit Committee 
monitors internal controls and risk management systems on 
an annual basis. 
The Group has established a system of control and risk 
management involving an appropriate degree of oversight 
by senior management in each of the business units in which 
it operates.

to continue as auditors. In accordance with the Isle of Man

position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer’s Statement, Review of Operations, Financial Review,

Company’s ﬁnancial risk management practices with respect 
to its capital structure, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, 
interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk, and other 
related matters.
The Directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of the 
opinion that the Company has adequate working capital to 
execute its operations over the next 12 months. The Directors, 
therefore, have made an informed judgement, at the time of 
approving ﬁnancial statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result, 
the Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the shareholders  
of Hardy Oil and Gas plc
We have audited the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial statements”) of Hardy Oil and Gas plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated and Parent Company 
Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity, and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004.
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 15 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 
1982. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Chairman’s Statement, Directors’ Report (The information 
in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the Review of Operations and Financial Review that is cross 
referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report) and the unaudited sections of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
 – the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2012 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
 – the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 – the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004; and
 – the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 
and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – the parent company and the Group have not kept proper accounting records; 
 – the ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
 – if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
 – if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 – the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern;
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with certain elements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code speciﬁed for our review; and
 – certain elements of the Board of Directors’ Remuneration Report to shareholders.

Financial Statement
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2012
1. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied in preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Hardy Oil and Gas plc 
(Hardy or the Group). The country of incorporation, address of the registered ofﬁce and a description of the Group’s principal 
activities can be found in the Director’s Report. 
a) Basis of measurement
Hardy prepares its ﬁnancial statements on a historical cost basis except as otherwise stated.
b) Going concern
The Group has in the past generated working capital from its production activities and successfully raised ﬁnance to provide 
additional funding for its ongoing exploration and development programmes. The Directors, having considered the guidance given in 
the document Going concern and liquidity risk: Guidance for Directors issued in October 2009 by the Financial Reporting Council, 
having reviewed the Group’s ongoing activities including its future intentions in respect of the drilling of exploration wells, having 
regard to the Group’s existing working capital position and its ability to potentially raise ﬁnance, if required, are of the opinion that 
the Group has adequate resources to enable it to undertake its planned work programme of exploration, appraisal and development 
activities over the next 12 months from the date of these ﬁnancial statements.
c) Basis of preparation

d) Functional and presentation currency
These ﬁnancial statements are presented in US dollars which is the Group’s functional currency. All ﬁnancial information presented 
is rounded to the nearest US dollar.
e) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statement includes the results of Hardy Oil and Gas plc and its subsidiary undertakings. The Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows include the results and cash ﬂows of subsidiary 
undertakings up to the date of disposal.
The Group conducts the majority of its exploration, development and production through unincorporated joint arrangements with other 
companies.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements reﬂect the Group’s share of production revenues and costs attributable to its participating 
interest under the proportional consolidation method. 
f) Revenue and other income
Revenue represents the sale value of the Group’s share of oil (which excludes the proﬁt oil sold and paid to the Government of India 
as a part of proﬁt sharing) and the income from technical services to third parties if any. Revenues are recognised when crude oil has 
been lifted and title has been passed to the buyer or when services are rendered. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

g) Joint ventures
The Group participates in several unincorporated joint ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Group’s oil and 
gas exploration and production activities. The Group accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of joint 
ventures in the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Comprehensive Income as appropriate.
h) Oil and gas assets
i) Exploration and evaluation assets
Hardy has adopted the successful efforts based accounting policy for its oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to acquiring the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately in the income statement.
Expenditure incurred in connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration and appraisal of oil and gas assets are 
capitalised for each licence granted under the production sharing contracts and are undepleted within intangible exploration assets 
until the validity to explore the contract area is ended or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred for geological and geophysical activities before the commencement of exploratory drilling is initially 
capitalised within intangible exploration assets. Exploration drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the 
success or otherwise of the well has been established. The success or failure is assessed on a well-by-well basis. Exploration well 
costs are written off on completion of the well unless the results indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which have reasonable 
commercial potential.
Following appraisal of successful exploration, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction is 
demonstrated, the related capital intangible exploration and appraisal costs are transferred into a cost centre within the property, 
plant and equipment – development assets after testing for impairment, if any. Where exploration well results indicate the presence 
of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs will be written-off to the income statement.
ii) Oil and gas development and producing assets
Development and production assets are accumulated on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis. These comprise the cost of developing commercial 
reserves discovered to put them on production and the exploration and evaluation costs transferred from intangible exploration and 
evaluation assets, as stated in the policy above. In addition, interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly 
attributable to development projects, if any, and assets in the production phase, as well as cost of recognising provision for future 
restoration and decommissioning, are capitalised.
iii) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a ﬁeld, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning facilities, plugging and abandoning 
wells. The full discounted cost of decommissioning is estimated and considered as an asset and liability. The decommissioning cost is 
included within the cost of property, plant and equipment-development assets. Any revision in the estimated cost of decommissioning 
which alters the provisions required also adjusted in the cost of asset. The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production 
basis based on proved reserves, is shown as “Decommissioning charge” in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and unwinding 
of the discount on the provision is included in the ﬁnance costs.
iv) Disposal of assets
Proceeds from any disposal of assets are credited against the speciﬁc capitalised costs included in the relevant cost pool and any 
loss or gain on disposal is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Gain or loss arising on disposal of a subsidiary 
is also recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
i) Depletion and impairment 
i) Depletion
The net book values of the producing assets are depreciated on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis using the unit of production method, based on 
proved and probable reserves. Hardy periodically obtains an independent third party assessment of reserves which is used as a basis 
for computing depletion. 
ii) Impairment
Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 Exploration and Evaluation 
of Mineral Resources, where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. In such circumstances, if the 
exploration asset has a corresponding development/producing cost pool, then the exploration costs are transferred to the cost pool 
and depleted on unit of production. In cases where no such development/producing cost pool exists, the impairment of exploration 
costs is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Impairment reviews on development/producing oil and gas assets 
for each ﬁeld are carried out on each year by comparing the net book value of the cost pool with the associated discounted future 
cash ﬂows. If there is any impairment in a ﬁeld representing a material component of the cost pool, an impairment test is carried out 
for the cost pool as a whole. If the net book value of the cost pool is higher than the associated discounted future cash ﬂows, the 
excess amount is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as impairment and deducted from the pool value.  Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful 
economic lives as follows:

Annual rate 
(%)
Depreciation 
method
Computer software 33 Straight line
Amortisation charges included within the administrative expenses.
l) Investments
Investments by the parent company in its subsidiaries are stated at cost.
m) Short-term investments
Short-term investments are regarded as “ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss” and are carried at fair value. In practice, 
the nature of these investments is such that the fair value equates to the value of initial outlay and therefore in normal circumstances 
no fair value gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
n) Inventory
Inventory of crude oil is valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value. Average cost is determined based on actual 
production cost for the year. Inventories of drilling stores are recorded at cost including taxes, duties and freight. Provision is made 
for obsolete or defective items where appropriate, based on technical evaluation.
o) Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised at fair value in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position based on the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value as reduced by necessary provisions 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value.
p) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Hardy and the Group are recorded at net proceeds after direct issue costs.
q) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the taxable proﬁt of the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as it excludes certain item of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in years other than the current 
year and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The current tax liability is calculated using the tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the year end date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the 
liability method.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Company Information 
1. Accounting policies continued
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences 
associated with investment in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is possible that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the year end date, where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more tax.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods 
in which temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted at the year end date.
r) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the year end date, 
all foreign currency monetary assets and monetary liabilities are restated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising out of actual 
payments/realisations and from the year end restatement are reﬂected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Rates of exchanges were as follows:
31 December 
2012
31 December 
2011
£ to US$ 1.62 1.55
US$ to Indian Rupees 55.01 53.24
s) Leasing commitments
Rental charges or charter hire charges payable under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as part of production cost over the lease term. 
t) Share-based payments
Hardy issues share options to Directors and employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of the 
equity-settled options determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period. In performing the 
valuation of these options, only conditions other than market conditions are taken into account. Fair value is derived by use of the 
binomial model. The expected life used in the model is based on management estimates and considers non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. In case of lapsed vested options, the amount recognised in the shares to be issued 
is adjusted to the retained earnings as a reserve movement.
u) Contingent assets
Contingent assets are disclosed but not recognised where the receipt of income is probable but not virtually certain. The asset 
and related income is only then recognised in the period when the change occurs and the receipt becomes virtually certain.
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by deﬁnition, seldom 
equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are addressed below.
i) Intangible assets – exploration
Hardy has been awarded costs and interest after the conclusion of the arbitration on the CY-OS/2 block, in which it holds a 75 per 
cent participating interest. Hardy’s share of these awards totals approximately $24.8 million and has been disclosed as a contingent 
asset. This is regarded as a signiﬁcant area of judgement and full details are disclosed in note 15 to these ﬁnancial statements.
ii) Decommissioning
The liability for decommissioning is reviewed based on the updated current cost estimates of the decommissioning, which is 
predominated by the charter hire charges of drill ship and supply boats. Accordingly, the provision made in the books will reﬂect 
the risk free discounted future cost for decommissioning and this is an annual adjustment based on the changes in costs as a result 
of technical advancements and other factors. Further details are contained in note 23.
iii) Deferred tax asset
The deferred tax asset will be realised with the recommencement of production from PY-3 ﬁeld and also from the production of oil 
and gas from those areas which are available for commercial development. Further details are contained in note 12. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Indian operations of the Group are subject to a tax rate of 42.024 per cent which is higher than UK and US corporations tax rates. 
To the extent that the Indian proﬁts are taxable in the US and/or the UK, those territories should provide relief for Indian taxes paid, 
principally under the provisions of double taxation agreements. Based on the current expenditure plans, the Group anticipates that 
the tax allowances will continue to exceed the depletion charge of each year, though the timing of related tax relief is uncertain.

In March 2009, Hardy were informed by the Government of India that the block CY-OS/2, in which Hardy holds a 75 per cent 
participating interest, was relinquished as Hardy had failed to declare commerciality within the two years from the date of discovery 
which is applicable to an oil discovery. Hardy disputed this ruling believing that the discovery was a gas discovery and consequently 
that it was entitled to a period of ﬁve years from the date of discovery to declare commerciality. As no agreement was reached the 
dispute was referred to arbitration under the terms of the PSC.
The arbitrators ruled on 2 February 2013 that the discovery was a gas discovery and consequently that the order for the 
relinquishment of the block was illegal. The arbitrators have ordered the Government of India to restore the block to Hardy and its 
partners and to allow them a period of three years from the date of restoration to complete the appraisal programme. In addition, the 
arbitrators awarded costs of $0.2 million and interest on the exploration expenditure incurred to date. Hardy’s 75 per cent share of the 
interest awarded is approximately $24.6 million. As the award was only received in February 2013 and as the Government of India has 
not yet indicated to Hardy the acceptance of the arbitration award, the above amounts will be accounted for when their receipt is 
virtually certain and therefore it is currently treated as a contingent asset.  Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

25. Financial risk management
Hardy ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of equity and retained earnings. Finance requirements are reviewed by the Board 
when funds are required for acquisition, exploration and development of projects.
Hardy’s policy is to maintain a strong ﬁnancial position to sustain future development of the business. There were no changes to 
the Group’s capital management approach during the year.
Hardy’s treasury functions are responsible for managing fund requirements and investments which include banking, cash ﬂow 
management, interest and foreign exchange exposure to ensure adequate liquidity at all times to meet cash requirements.
Hardy’s principal ﬁnancial instruments are cash, deposits and short-term investments and these instruments are only for the purpose 
of meeting its requirement for operations. 
Hardy’s main ﬁnancial risks are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, commodity price risk and credit risks. Set out below are policies that 
are used to manage such risks:
Foreign currency risk
The Group reports in US dollars and the majority of its business is conducted in US dollars. All revenues from oil sales are received in 
US dollars and all costs except a portion towards expenses for overheads are incurred in US dollars. For currency exposure other than 
US dollars, a portion of the cash is kept on deposit in other currencies to meet its payments as required. No forward exchange 
contracts were entered into during the year.
Liquidity risk 
The Group currently has surplus cash which has been placed in deposits and short-term investments which can be converted into 
cash at short notice, ensuring sufﬁcient liquidity to meet the Group’s expenditure requirements. Hardy has no outstanding loan 
obligations at year end dates.
Interest rate risk
Surplus funds are placed in deposits and short-term investments at ﬁxed or ﬂoating rates. Hardy’s policy is to place deposits only 
with well established banks or ﬁnancial institutions that offer the competitive interest rates and ensure security of capital at the time 
of issue.
Commodity price risks
The Group’s share of production of crude oil from PY-3 ﬁeld is sold to the Government of India’s nominee Chennai Petroleum 
Corporation Limited. The sale price is arrived at based on an average price for the 30 days period commencing 15 days before 
and ending 15 days after the delivery of crude oil. No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into by the Group.
Credit risk
All Hardy’s sales are to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited, a state oil company in India. As it is the Government of India nominee 
for the purchase of crude oil, the credit risk is negligible.
Deposits and other money market instruments, as a general rule, are placed with banks and ﬁnancial institutions that have ratings 
of not less than AA or equivalent, which are veriﬁed before placing the deposits. Cash surpluses are also invested in short-term 
investments in certain liquid funds. These funds are primarily invested in terms deposits and graded commercial papers of not less 
than AA or equivalent.
The Board will continue to assess the strategies for managing credit risk and is satisﬁed with the existing policies for sale of crude oil 
to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited. At year end, the Group did not have any bad debt risk. The maximum ﬁnancial risk 
exposure relating to the ﬁnancial assets is the carrying value of such ﬁnanced assets as on the year end date.
Capital management
The objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that there is sufﬁcient liquidity within the Group to carry out the 
committed work programme requirements of all its production sharing contracts. The Group monitors the long-term cash ﬂow 
requirements of the business in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to 
maintain ﬂexibility. The Group considers its capital to consist of share capital only.
The Board manages the structure of the capital and makes necessary adjustments to accommodate the changes in the economic 
conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Board may issue new shares for cash, repay debit if any, put in place new 
debt facilities or such other restructuring as appropriate. No signiﬁcant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes 
during the year ended 31 December 2012. Hardy Oil and Gas plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

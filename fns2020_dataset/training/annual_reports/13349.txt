Annual Report 2007
2007 was another year of excellent progress for The Restaurant Group, with substantial
increases in both revenue and profits. Againstamoredifficultbackground for consumer-
facing businesses the Group grew like-for-likesales by 5.5% following on from growth
of 5% for the previous year.Our strong and resilient market positioning combined with
affordable offerings enabled the Group to producearecordset of results, with adjusted
earnings per sharegrowth of 27%. We sold morethan 30 million meals (including around
four andahalf million children’smeals) during 2007, an increase of three million total meals
on the previous year and also created approximately 1,000 full and part time new jobs.
2007 was the second full year of trading in the Group’srefocused form. Youwill recall that
we took the decision to direct our focus away from the increasingly crowded high street
marketplace and positioned TRG’sbusiness firmly in the out of town segments of the
eating out market. This strategy has served us well as it affords us some protection in
amorechallenging economicenvironment.
Buildingonastrong performance for the first half of the year the Group made further
progress during the second half to produce an excellent set of full year results. Revenue
increased by 17% to £367m, adjusted profit beforetax increased by 24% to £43.5m
(2006: £35.0m) and adjusted earnings per shareincreased by 27% to 14.64p (2006:
11.50p).Following on froma27% increase in adjusted earnings per sharein2006 this
isavery strong performance and, asaresult, the Boardisrecommendingafinal dividend
of 5.99p per share(2006: 4.95p) givingatotal dividend for the year of 7.25p (2006: 6.00p)
per share, an increase of 21%. Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the
final dividend will be payable on9July 2008 to shareholders on the register on 13 June 2008
and the shares will be marked ex-dividend on 11 June 2008.
Both of our divisions, Leisureand Concessions, performed superbly during 2007
with growth in like-for-like sales, revenue, profit and margins. We openedatotal of
36 new restaurants and pub restaurants during the year and we aredelighted with
their performance. Our expansion plans areunchanged and we aretargetingafurther
30-35 new openings for 2008. In October 2007 we acquired the Brunning&Price
pub restaurant business which added 14 high quality pub restaurants to this growing
part of our Leisuredivision. We welcome the Brunning&Price team to TRG and we
aredelighted with the performance of the business since its acquisition.
Our Leisuredivision, which incorporates Frankie&Benny’s, Chiquito, Garfunkel’sand Pub
Restaurants, enjoyed another successful year withastrong increase in like-for-like sales
growth, an improvement in adjusted operating profit margin anda21% increase in adjusted
operating profit. During the year we opened 34 new restaurants and pub restaurants within
this division–these areperforming well and areset to deliver strong returns.

Group-wide, this is another excellent set of results and is testament to the hardwork
and dedication of our Directors, senior management team and all staff. We arefortunate
to haveahigh quality and stable team at TRG and on behalf of the BoardIwould like to

Annual Report 2007
Introduction
2007 was another year of good progress for The Restaurant Group (“TRG”) building on
the strong performance of the previous year.Both divisions performed well and all of our
key performance metrics improved. Revenue, EBITDA, profits and margins all grew and
this serves to highlight both the benefits of our strategy of focusing on the out of town
marketplace and also the efficacy of our model. It is particularly encouraging that TRG
was able to achieve these results againstamorechallenging economic backdrop and this
demonstrates both the defensive and resilient characteristics of our market positioning
and the strength of our operations and brands. Asaresult, the Group achievedarecor d
level of adjusted earnings per shareat14.64p representing growth of 27% on the previous
year.Considering that the “bar” had been raised significantlyin2006, when earnings
per sharegrewby27%, these results representavery satisfactory performance.
TRGrationale
Our coreobjective continues to be growth in shareholder value and our strategy to
achieve this has been, and will continue to be, to buildabusiness capable of delivering
long-term, sustainable and growing cashflows.Iampleased to report that, again, we
have successfullyconverted our profits into cash atavery healthy rate. Strong growth in
earnings per sharehas translated into strong growth in cashflow per share. Our model
enablesthe Group to continue its growth inapredominantly organic and highly value
accretive way,funded through internally generated funds. Wherewedeem it appropriate
we arealso able to supplement this organic growth via targeted acquisitions, as we did
during 2007 with the acquisition of the Brunning&Price pub restaurant business. Our
touchstones arecashflow and returnoninvestment and, whether we areassessinga new
site or an acquisition, our focus is on ensuring that the investment is value accretive.
TRG’sprimary focus is on edge of town, out of town, rural, semi-rural and airport
locations. These locations have significant barriers to entry,offer good growth prospects
and enableustogenerate consistentlyhigh returns on investment. We occupy leading
marketpositions in each of these segments and we arewell placed to continue to grow
our business in these areas. Looking forward, we haveastrong pipeline of new sites for
the next three years.
Group results
*Results marked as adjusted arestated excluding non-trading items (refer to note 2)
All of our key performance metrics improved during 2007 with growth in both of our
divisions:
> Building on the 5% increase in like-for-like sales in 2006, we grew this metric by 5.5%
in 2007.Approximately70% of this increase represented “covers” growth with mor e
people using our restaurants and in 2007 we sold morethan 30 million meals;
> Revenue increased by 17% to £367m;
> Adjusted EBITDA increased by 22% to £67.8m and adjusted operating profit increased
by 23% to £48.2m; and
> Margins improved at both divisional and Group levels with our Group adjusted operating
profit marginincreasing by 60 basis points to 13.1%–avery satisfactory result
particularly againstatough hurdle of 140 and 90 basis point improvements in 2006
and 2005 respectively.
Again, the increase in profit was the product of three principal components–like-for-like
profit increases from the existing estate, profitable contribution from new openings and
further cost savings resulting from operational efficiencies and purchasing initiatives.This
combination representsahealthy background to our continued profitable development.

have been excellent and they areset to deliver very strong returns. This year we ar e
aiming to openasimilar number of new restaurants and, having been busy in recent years
buildingahigh quality pipeline of new sites, we lookforwardtocontinued strong returns.
Chiquito(53units)
Chiquito enjoyed another excellent year with growth in EBITDAand operating profit
of almost30% and operating profit margin up 90 basis points. Againstabackground
of very high growth in profits and margins in both 2006 and 2005, this represents an
outstanding performance. Last year we challenged the Chiquito team to build on their
terrific performance in 2006 and they did not let us down.Iamconfident that they will be
just as keen to repeat that feat in 2008! During the year we opened eight new restaurants
and we aredelighted with their performance. We expect to open 5-8 new Chiquito
restaurantsin2008. As noted in my report last year we areparticularly pleased with the
performance of our restaurants which areco-located with Frankie&Benny’sand we ar e
continuing with our plans to pursue these dual roll-out opportunities.
Garfunkel’s(26units)
Garfunkel’sperformed well during 2007 and, notwithstanding that we lost 19 weeks of
trade during the first half whilst restaurants wereclosed for refurbishment, the business
delivered approximatelythe same level of profit as for 2006. The refurbishments wer e
completed by the end of the first half and during the second half profits and margins
increased significantly. Garfunkel’sisnow in its 29th year and continues to deliver
excellent profits and returns.
PubRestaurants(42units)
This business now comprises Blubeckers and, following its acquisition in October 2007,
the Brunning&Price pub restaurant business. Blubeckers performed solidly during 2007
and has good potential.During 2006 we embarked uponamoreambitious rollout
programme for Blubeckers and this continued in 2007.Last year we opened six new
Blubeckers pub restaurants and in the summer we strengthened the Blubeckers team
by introducing senior management withastrong track recordwithin TRG of operational
management and also good experience of executing successful rollouts. The impact
of this has been very positive.
Following the acquisition of Brunning&Price (“B&P”), we addedafurther 14 new pub
restaurantstoour portfolio. We aredelighted with the performance of the B&P pub
restaurantssince the acquisition and we intend to grow the business.The B&P pub
restaurantshaveamorerelaxed feel compared with Blubeckers. Although B&P’spubs
arenot branded they all shareasimilar typeoffit out and operating style. The quality
of food is high–B&P won the Good Pub Guide’s Pub Group of the Year Awardfor the
thirdtime in 2007–and they attractaregular and loyal customer base. We aredelighted
to have retained all of the operational management team at Brunning&Price. It is an
experienced, talented and successful team and we look forwardtoworking with the
team to further develop and grow our Pub Restaurant business.
During 2008 we areexpecting to openatotal of 5-10 new pub restaurants and, longer-
term, the Pub Restaurantbusiness has the potential to becomeasignificant part of
the Group.

Our Concessions division enjoyed another year of good progress producingastrong
increase in operating profit and an improvement in margin. Againstamorechallenging
operating background both logisticallyand cost-wise this is an outstanding performance.
We opened two new units during 2007 and these aregenerating strong returns. We
expectasmallnet increase in the number of Concessions units during 2008 in what will
beayear of significant change given the developments at Heathrow airport. In late March
we will open four new sites at the new Terminal5and later in the year when Terminal 2
closes we will close our restaurant there. During 2008 we areexpecting some significant
swings in trading patterns at Heathrow as passengers migrate from the existing terminals
into the new T5. Going forward, we areconfident that these new developments place our
Concessions business inavery strong position.
Non-cor e
During the year losses from non-coreactivities decreased by £0.55m and we will continue
to take steps to reduce these non-corelosses.
Corporateactivity
In October 2007 we acquired Brunning&Price Limited for £32m in cash. The business
comprises of 14 trading pub restaurants and one development site. B&P is based
predominantly in the North West and hasalong history of profitable growth. We have
retained B&P’soperational management team, will continue to operate the pub restaurants
in the existing, highlysuccessful style and we will gradually add new pubs to the B&P
business. Together B&P and Blubeckers provideavery attractive opportunity to grow
our Pub Restaurant business.
Marketdynamicsandeconomicbackdrop
We areconfident that prospects for the eating out market remain positive. Socio-
economic factors such as an ageing population, morefemales in work and levels of
disposableincomes significantly higher than in previous generations augur well for our
industry.Lifestyle changes arealso positive with an increasing propensity to spend
on leisureactivities.Eating out, particularly at our popular price points (£10-£16 spend
per head),has becomeahabitual part of most people’slives and is something many ar e
reluctant to give up. During 2007 the smoking ban came into effect in England and
Wales, following the ban in Scotland the previous year.Overall, we believe that TRG has
benefited from this as morefamilies and those with an aversion to smoking have visited
our restaurants.
During most of 2007 and into 2008 much has been said and written aboutthe
deteriorating economic backdrop and pressures on the consumer.A series of successive
interest rate rises starting in 2006 and continuing through into 2007 saw base rates rise
by 125 basis points (in effect increasing the cost of borrowing almost 30%). The cost
of servicing an already high level of personal debt thereforerose for much of the UK
population. Compounding this we saw inflation rise, by varying amounts depending upon
which particular index one chose to use, and the burden of taxation increase. Together
this combination has served to make life moredifficult for the UK consumer and looking
forwardinto 2008 we anticipateacontinuation of these tighter conditions.
Whilst we would not suggest that TRG is completely impervious to these economic
factors, we arevery encouraged that our business has demonstratedaconsiderable
level of resilience in the face ofaslowing UK economy andatighter consumer market.
We believethat this is the result ofanumber of factors including our popular price point
and value for money,our focus on areas with higher barriers to entry (and thus lower
supply-side risk), the strength of our brands, consumers’ reluctance to forego eating out
and, very importantly, the skill and application of the TRG team. Restaurants which have
opened within the last few years have performed very well, delivering strong returns and
we intend to continue to openasimilar number of new restaurants each year for the
foreseeable future.

TheRestaurantGroupplc
Annual Report 2007
We believe that interest rates and employment levels aretwo key drivers of consumer
spend which can potentially impact our marketplace. We have recently seen two
reductions in base rates to the current level of 5.25% and we note that employment levels
are, and areprojected to remain, high. Whilst it is suggested that thereisscope for further
monetary relaxation during 2008 we believethat, in the light of current levels of inflation as
measured by the CPI, it may take some time beforethe base rate drops back below 5%.
We arealso mindful of the risks of further taxation pressures asaresult of the level of the
budget deficit. Furthermore, GDP growth is forecast to slow in 2008 toabelow trend level
but, looking further ahead, thereisthe prospect ofapick-up, back towards trend, in 2009.
Asaresult, we have factoredaless favourable macro-economic backdrop into our
planning for 2008 than we have experienced over the last five years.
Despite this we believe that TRG is well-placed to weather these tighter conditions. Recent
trading has been solid and we continue to see excellent results from our new openings.
Cost pressures have been an issue for some time. We identified the risk of inflationary
cost pressures with respect to our input costs two years ago and, during 2006 wherew e
wereable to, we took steps to remove or minimise that risk through taking out longer term
(typically three years) fixed or capped price contracts.This approach served us well during
2007 and we will continue to benefitfromthis in 2008 and 2009. However,weare still
exposed in some areas wherecurrently cost pressures arebeing felt (mainly fresh meats
and dairy/milk products). In these areas we would normallyfix prices for 6-12 months
but at present we are, in most cases, eschewing fixes of morethan three months as our
purchasing team anticipateareasonable possibility of prices softening later in the year.
We have also kept our menu content under regular review so as to try to mitigate the
impact of cost inflation through careful menu engineering. In the light of the current tighter
consumer market and, we believe, the importance of value for our customers we arelikely
to hold offincreasing menu prices in the short term but we will be carefully reviewing this
during the second quarter with the prospect of some increases later in the year.
Futureprospects
2007 was another year of good progress for the Group with both divisions achieving
growth. The current year has started well with like-for-like sales growth during the first nine
weeks at +4% (of which covers growth represents 70%) and total revenue for the same
period up 21% (a 16% increase excluding B&P). At this stage last year,like-for-like sales
growth was +5% (of which covers growth represented 75%) and total revenue was 16%
ahead. Whilst we areencouraged by this, we recognise both the ongoing impact of
acontinuation ofatighter consumer marketplace and alsothe fact that our comparative
like-for-like hurdles,at+8.3% and +7.3% in quarters two and three, aredemanding.
We have madeasolid start to the year and, providing thereisnotasignificant further
deterioration in the UK economy,weare confident of continuing our progress in 2008.

EBITDA in the year was £72.1m.AdjustedGroupoperating profit grew by 23.0% to
£48.2m.In terms of margins wemade further good progress,adjustedGroupEBITDA
at 18.5% showedanimprovement of 80 basis points on the previous year, whileadjusted
Groupoperating profit marginat 13.1% was 60 basis points aheadof 2006.
Totalinterest costs in the year of £4.0m were 22.2%higher than the previous year .
This reflects the higher levels ofaverage net debt during 2007 (following payment of the
£35m specialdividend inMarch 2006 and the £32macquisition ofBrunning&Pricein
October 2007).
Totaladjusted profit before tax excludingLiving Ventures was £44.2m,anincreaseof
23.1% on the prior year.After taking intoaccount TRG’s shareof the losses ofLiving
Ventures totalGroupprofit before tax and non-trading items was £43.5m,anincrease
of 24.2%on the prior year .
Capitalexpenditur e
During 2007 theGroupinvesteda totalof £47.4m (2006: £40.8m) incapitaladditions.
This consisted of the following:
> £37.8m invested in 36 new sites (20 Frankie&Benny’s, eight Chiquito, six Blubeckers
and twoConcession outlets).This includes twofreehold developments and the
Heathrow Terminal5fit out costs.
> £9.6mon refurbishment and maintenanceexpenditure.
As wehavehighlighted previously, the Groupis very focused on ensuring that our
investments generateexcellent returns on investment. Inorder toensure that this is
achieved, we adopt a rigorous approach to capitalinvestment appraisal. All new site
proposals are subject to this process whichincludes detailed financialevaluations and
demographicanalysis,as well as local competitor and market analysis. All significant
projects are subject to approval by the Group Board and we conduct post completion
reviews on a regular basis. These confirm that we are continuing to achieve the excellent
expected levels of financial returnon a very consistent basis.
Cashflow 
Set out below is a summary cashflow statement for 2007.This demonstrates once
again the very strongcashgenerationcharacteristics ofTRG,and the very transparen t
conversion of reported operating profit intocash.Cashflow generated from operations a t
£73.8m showedanincreaseof16%on the prior year.After interest, tax and maintenance
capex, freecashflow of £50.6mgrew by 19% compared to 2006. This level of free cash
flow means that, onceagain, theGroup’s expanding development programmeas wellas
a significantly increasedlevel of ordinary dividend was entirely financed out of internally
generatedcashflow.

The Restaurant Group plc–key performanceindicators
The BoardofDirectors and executive management receiveawide rangeofmanagementinformation delivered inatimely manner .
Listed below arethe principal measures of progress that arereviewed onaregular basis to monitor the development of the Group.
Like-for-like sales
This measureprovides an indicator of the underlying performance of our existing restaurants, and highlights successful development of
our offerings to best match changing consumer demandsover time.During 2007, the Group like-for-like salesincreased by 5.5%, which
followeda5%increase in 2006 anda3%increase in 2005.
New sites opened
The expansion of our brands isakey driver of Group’sprofitability.Asnoted in the Group Finance Director’sreview,potential new sites
aresubjecttoarigorous appraisal process beforethey arepresented to the Boardfor approval. This process ensures we maintain the
quality of openings as well as the quantity of sites opened. During 2007 the Group opened 36 new sites and plans to open 30-35 new
restaurantsduring 2008.
EBITDA
The ability of the Group to finance its roll-out programme is aided by strong cash flows from the existing business. The Group defines
EBITDA as operating profit beforedepreciation, amortisation and non-trading items. EBITDA serves asauseful proxy for cash flows
generated by operations and is closely monitored. During 2007 the Group generated£67.8m EBITDA, an increase of 22% on the
2006 level of £55.6m .
Operating profit margin
The Boardand management closely monitor profit margins as an indicator of operating efficiency within restaurants and across the
Group. During 2007 the Group adjustedoperating margin improved by 60 basis points to 13.1%.
In addition, the Group closely scrutinises the returns on investedcapital from new site openings and the average EBITDAgenerated
by restaurants.
Internal control
The Boardisresponsiblefor the Group’ssystem of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.Inaccordancewith guidance for
directors “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the CombinedCode” (the “Turnbull Guidance”), the Boardhas ensured that there
is an ongoing process for reviewing the effectiveness of the systemofinternal control including identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group. This process, which is regularly reviewed by the Board, is carried out in conjunction with business
planning and is documented inarisk register that has been progressively enhanced during the financial year and up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Whilst acknowledging its overall responsibility for the system of internal control, the Boardisawarethat the system is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failuretoachieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Report of the Directors of
The RestaurantGroup plc
continued The Group has well established procedures which have been developed over many years which meet the requirementsofthe Turnbull
Guidance.Akey control procedureisthe day-to-day involvement of executive members of the Boardinall aspects of the business and
their attendance at regular management meetings at whichperformance against planand business prospects arereviewed. The Group
has establishedamonthly executive management meeting wherethe four executive Directors,senior operational managersand head of
functional departments review Group performance and issues affecting the Group.
Additionally,the Boardseeks to continually strengthen the internal control system wherethis is consistent with improving the relationship
between risk and reward. The Group’sassociate company,Living Ventures Limited (now restructured as Pimco2637 Limited), does not
fall under the same internal controls as the Group.The internal controls within the associateare discussed with management of that
companyduring shareholdermeetings and areconsidered to be appropriatefor an entity of its size.
Other key features and the processes for reviewing effectiveness of the internal control system aredescribed below:
•Terms of reference for the Boardand its sub-committees, includingaschedule of matters reserved for the Boardand an agreed
annual programme of fixed agenda items for Boardapproval.
•Anestablishedorganisationalstructurewith clear lines of responsibility and rigorous reporting requirements. Operational performance
and operational matters areconsidered at monthly meetings of the executive Directors with senior management. Financial
performance is monitored and action taken through weekly reporting to the executive Directors and monthly reporting to the
Boardagainstannual budgets approved by the Board.
•Capital investmentisregulatedbyabudgetary processand authorisation levels, with appraisals and post-investment reviews.
•Comprehensive policy manualssetting out agreed standards and control procedures.These includehuman resources related
policies, information technologyand health and safety .
•Aninternal audit functionheaded by an experienced internal auditorhas access to all areas of the Company and Group’sbusiness
and reports into the Board.

Parent company financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements.
Information provided to auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps that they ought reasonably to have taken to make themselves aware of any
material information needed by the Company’s auditors for the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware
of that information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant material information of which the auditors are unaware.
Going concern
Based on the Group’s plans for 2008 and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the financial statements.
Corporate responsibility
The Restaurant Group plc (“TRG”) acknowledges that it has a significant role to play with regard to the community and wider
environment in which it operates. This statement sets out the principal areas of focus and activity that the Group has undertaken
to date, and what the Group is looking at for future development, in managing its impact on customers, employees, communities
and the wider environment.
This is split into five sections:
• Our market – the area of business that our strategy is focused on.
• Our environment – the impact of TRG on the wider environment, and how we are seeking to reduce this.
• Our people – the Group’s policies and actions towards our 8,500 and more employees.
• Our communities – how TRG interacts with those communities from which our customers and employees are drawn from.
• Our shareholders – those that have invested capital in the development of The Restaurant Group plc, and to whom the Directors
and management of the Group are reporting to.
Our market
The Restaurant Group has a clearly defined strategic aim – to grow shareholder value by operating in the expanding casual dining
market, focusing on those areas of this market which can offer barriers to entry, high returns on investment and strong and growing
cash flows. The general trend of a growing dining out market in the UK continues, but in recent years there has been an increased focus
from customers and regulatory authorities on healthy dining issues including dietary habits, drinking and smoking.
Healthy eating
Healthy eating is a personal responsibility but TRG acknowledges that as a provider of food and drink we have a role to play in providing
appropriate options from which individuals may choose when they eat out. TRG strongly believes that it should provide its guests with
choice. Whilst we do not wish to be prescriptive we aim to provide a healthy choice at each menu point, alongside more indulgent options.
For many people dining out is a treat and therefore the normal restrictions which may be applied to healthy eating on a day-to-day basis
are waived in favour of enjoyment and experience. For example whilst completing the weekly shop a consumer may choose chocolate
fudge cake for their weekend dessert as opposed to a piece of fruit during the week.
During 2007 TRG worked extensively on its children’s menus to provide a selection of healthy meals alongside the more “traditional”
dishes which, by virtue of their make-up, contain a higher number of calories. Healthy dishes are clearly marked on the children’s menus
in Chiquito & Garfunkel’s and all of our brands offer vegetables or salad with every child’s meal. We believe that a balanced diet is as
important as regular exercise and appropriate rest and relaxation in promoting physical and mental well being.
Healthy dining is of particular concern when it affects young people, and our Chiquito, Garfunkel’s and Filling Station brands have
children’s dishes which have no added sugar, colours or preservatives and are low in salt. These brands also offer a free salad with
every main dish on our children’s menu. In Frankie & Benny’s, all children can receive, at no additional cost, a portion of vegetables or
salad with any main course, and can replace fries with jacket potatoes. We also serve a wide range of alternatives to the traditional fried 
potato chip such as mashed potato, rice and jacket potatoes.
Report of the Directors of
The RestaurantGroup plc
continued Hydrogenated fats
In light of UK government and consumer focus with regardtoconsumptionofproducts containing high levels of fat, particularly
saturated fats and artificial hydrogenated trans-fats*, which have been linked to potential risks to cardiovascular health, during 2007
in conjunction with our external food safety consultants we conductedadetailedreview of our suppliers and our menu ingredients.
•Wehave worked closely with all of our supplierstoidentify the types and levels of fats and oils in our ingredients to facilitate
aprogramme of removal,replacement or reduction,whilst maintaining our required quality standards.
•The vast majority of our ingredients (>99%)are now free from hydrogenated fats and oils.
•Since August 2007 we have prohibited the supply of new ingredients containing added hydrogenated fats and oils.
•Wecontinuetowork closelywith all of our suppliers to identify and progress opportunities for reducing overall levels of saturatedfat
wherever possible and to provide healthier choices.
*Whilst some trans-fats occur naturally and arefound in small amounts in meat and dairy products, concerns have been raised about artificial trans-fats, formed duringafood
manufacturing process called hydrogenation that turns oils into solid/semi-solid fats. These hydrogenated fats/oils can be found in products such as biscuits, cakes, margarine,
processed foods and cooking oils.
Genetically modified foods
For many years the Grouphas hadapolicy of not sourcing genetically modified foods and new suppliers arerequired to confirm
that they will not provide The Restaurant Group with such products .
Drink aware
All our restaurants operate an “AreYou 21” policy,whereby we will ask for proof of identification to anyone who appears to be under21.
We also do not permit the sale of alcohol to under 18’s, even if the alcohol is for consumption withameal. All of our restaurants offer a
wide range of non-alcoholic drinks including fruit juices, carbonates, minerals and non-alcoholic cocktails.
Smoking
From1July 2007 we havecompliedfully with the legislation throughout the United Kingdomwhich has banned smoking in public areas.
Our environment
The Restaurant Group takes its commitment to the environment very seriously.Weare developinganumber of initiatives to reduce
our impact on the wider environment, which link in with improving our cost base. Our initial focus is ensuring we have reliable and
measurabledata to monitor our impact; hence we have been upgrading our facilities to measureconsumption of gas, electricity and
water.This will allow us to analyse inefficient use of these resources and then take steps to improve our usage. This will reduce our
impact on the environment and also save costs. We aretaking steps to recycle morepackaging and waste within the Group.Weare
working with suppliers to increase volumes of glass recycling and paper recycling–itissurprising how few suppliers areable to offer
assistance in this area–but we continuetowork with them to achieve this.
We haveanumber of initiatives and trials across the Groupwhich have been instigated over the past couple of years. We have been
monitoring their progress during the 2007 and look forwardtoincreasing these schemes. For example:
•During 2007 we have trialled glass recycling schemes in ten restaurants and arenow evaluating rolling this out across our restaurant
businessinthe Leisuredivision during 2008. We arealso currently working with our waste contractors to developasystem whereby
we can economically recycle our cardboardwaste.
•Within Frankie&Benny’swehave undertakenascheme to replace as many as possible of our light bulbs with lower wattage, more
energy efficient devices.
•For the past 18 months we have been installing refrigeration units that have new energy efficientcontroller technology,which can save
up to 15% on energy usage and costs on refrigeration equipment.
•During 2007, in co-operation with our principalfood distributor,wehave successfully trialled the use of reusable “Eco-trays”for the
delivery of fresh produce. This delivery mechanism has now been rolled out to 75% of our restaurants in early 2008 and it is planned
to increase this during the year .
•All new units complywith the latest environmental regulations .
•Our new head office at Marshalsea Road has recycling facilities for waste paper throughout the building.

Our people
It is often said thatacompany’smost important assetisits people. At TRG we endeavour to build great teams, in which individuals
can develop their skills,contribute toasuccessful business and enjoy their time at work .
We employ over 8,500 people and this number is expanding rapidly–the roll-out of our great brandsmeans thereare plenty of
opportunities for individuals to develop with the Group inavariety of rewarding and challenging roles.
Our staffhandbook clearlysets out that the Group offers equal employment rights regardless of age, colour,gender,sexual orientation,
disability or religion.This is reinforced across our teams from the recruitment process onwards.
We have clear and fair terms of employment within the Group.All staffare provided withacontract of employment or service agreement
and thereare fully documentedprocedures in place for disciplinary issues and grievances raised by employees. The Group has
adefined termination policy,should this be required.
The Group devotes considerable resource to training our teams. Training commences on the first day of joining any of our brands
and we have recently invested inanew HR system to enable continual monitoring of the development of individuals through their time
with TRG. Employees take part in performance reviews on at least an annual basis with training and development opportunities or
requirements identified.
With an expanding portfolio of sitesandasizeable Group already in place, communications with all our teams areofvital importance.
All restaurants receive regular communicationpacks with updatesofwhat is happeningwithintheir brands. We also have processes
in place for monthly meetings within restaurants to cascade information throughoutthe Group. Most importantly,our moresenior
managersspendaconsiderable amount of time visiting the restaurants and discussing matters with the teams.
The health and safety of our customersand employees is of paramount importance. The Group has extensive procedures to ensurewe
mitigate risks to our guests and teams as far as possible. We have very clear procedures and standardsinplace, and to enforcethese
we employexternal auditorsand carry out benchmarking of our restaurants. We have also significantly increased the level of training in
health and safety matters across the Group in recent years to further enhance the clean, safe environment for our customers and staff.
Our communities
The Restaurant Group hasahistoryofinvolvement in the local communities around our restaurants andpub restaurants. Whilst the
Group hasabroad nationwide portfolio of sites, it is vital that each site has its roots in its local community.Whether it isaBlubeckers
or Brunning&Price pub, oftenabuilding of local historical importance, that has been carefully developed maintaining many of its original
features and characteristicsand so offering the warmth ofa“local” inasmall rural community,orabusy Frankie&Benny’sona large
leisurescheme, we aim to ensureour restaurants areinvolved in their communities.
Each year our brands choose various charities to support. During 2005, Frankie&Benny’scelebrated its 10th anniversary by
supporting the BBC’sChildren in Need charity,and through the effortsofour staffand customers, over £150,000 was raised for
this worthwhile cause.
In 2006, Frankie&Benny’s supported Great Ormond Street Hospital as the nominated charity.The charity of the yearfor 2007 was the
NSPCC, and therehave beenanumber of fund raising initiatives carried on at our restaurants to support this.During 2007,our teams in
Frankie&Benny’s have been actively encouragedtoget involvedinlocal projects and we areinvolved withanumber of schools through
sponsorship of sports teams up and down the country .
Chiquito also nominatesadifferentcharity each year to support throughamajor fund raising event across the brand on 5th of May ,
“Cinco de Mayo”. Cinco de Mayo isaNationalFiesta in Mexico, so it is very appropriate that Chiquito celebratesthis date with special
events at the restaurants. In 2007 £15,000 was raised on this one night alone. During 2008 Chiquito is proud to be working with
Childline to help raise funds and the profile of this worthwhilecause and thereareanumberofpromotions in place during the year ,
including the Cinco de Mayo celebrations.
Blubeckers support charities locally.Theme nights and events areheld on an ad-hoc basis to raise funds for local causes. Thousands
of pounds worth of vouchersare donated to charitableevents every year,tobeused as raffle prizes and auction lots.

The Group has hadaclear strategy since 2001–todeliver value for shareholders by focusing on sectors within the eating out market
that offer high barriers to entry,wherewecan generate sustainable and growing cash flows and which offer high returns on investment.
This hasled the Group to focus investmentinto the Leisuredivision and our Concessions division, which operates principally on airports.
In 2005 the Group disposed of its high-street focussed brands, Est Est Est and Caffe Uno. Garfunkel’sinCentral London,Bath and

its obligations. At 30 December 2007 the Company had no trade creditors.The Group had an average of 56 days (2006:52days)
purchases outstanding in trade creditors.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensurethat it will be able to continue asagoing concernwhile looking to maximise returns to
shareholders. The capital structureofthe Group consists of equity (comprising issued sharecapital, reserves and retained earnings),
debt, finance leases and cash and cash equivalents. The Group monitors its capital structureonaregular basis through cash flow
projections and consideration of the cost of financing its capital .
In December2007 the Group completedarefinancing exercise and further detail on this is set out in the Group Finance Director’ s

must be covered by at least four times by profit beforeinterest and tax, and net debt must not exceed 2.5 times EBITDA. During 2007
the Groupremained within its external limits throughout the year .
Financial risk management
The BoardofThe Restaurant Group plc regularly reviews the financialrequirements of the Group and the risks associated therewith.
The Group does not use complex financial instruments, and wherefinancial instruments areused it is for reducing interest rate risk. The
Group does not use derivativefinancial instruments for trading purposes. Group operations areprimarilyfinanced from retained earnings
and bank borrowings (including an overdraft facility).
In additiontothe primaryfinancial instruments, the Group also has other financial instruments such as debtors, prepayments, trade
creditors and accruals that arise directly from the Group’soperations. Further information is provided in note 26 to the accounts.

(2006: 12.0 times) by profit beforetax, interest and non-trading items. Based on year end debt and profits for 2007,a1%rise in
interest rates would reduce profits beforetax and non-trading items by 0.7% (2006: 0.1%) and interest cover would reduce to
11.3 times (2006:12.0 times) .
At 30 December 2007 the Group had gross borrowings attracting interest (including overdraft) of £79.0m (2006: £48.2m) and cash

Report of the Directors of
The RestaurantGroup plc
continued Introduction
This reporthas been prepared in accordancewith Schedule7aofthe Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevan t
requirements of the Listing Rules of the FinancialServices Authority and describes how the Boardhas applied the PrinciplesofGood
Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations,aresolution to approvethe report will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements aresubject to approval.
The Regulations requirethe auditors to reporttothe Company’smembers on the part of the Directors’ remuneration report subject
to audit and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the
Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has thereforebeen divided into separate sections for audited and
unauditedinformation.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has establishedaRemuneration Committee (“the Committee”) which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations
of the Combined Code. The members of the committee during the year wereJohn Jackson, Andrew Thomas,and David Richardson
(from1February 2007) who wereall independent non-executive Directors. During the year the Committee was chaired by Andrew
Thomas and following his retirementfromthe Boardon6February 2008 is chaired by John Jackson. With effect from1January 2008,
Tony Hugheshas been appointedtothe Remuneration Committee.
None of the Committee has any personalfinancial interest in the Company (otherthan as shareholders). The Committee makes
recommendations to the Board. No Director playsapart in any discussion about his own remuneration. In determining the other
executive Directors’ remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan Jackson (Chairman) about its proposals.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (appointed independent adviserswho provided no other services to the Group during the year)
provided advice to the Committee,encompassing all elementsofthe remuneration packages.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages aredesigned to attract,motivate and retain Directors of the high calibreneeded to progress and
developthe Group and to rewardthem for enhancingvalue to shareholders.The performance measurement of the executive Directors
and the determination of their annual remuneration package areundertaken by the Committee. In addition, the Committeedetermines
the remuneration for the Chairman.The remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board. Thereare four
main elements of the remuneration package for executiveDirectors :
•Basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
•Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 100% of basic salary for executiveDirectors;
•Long-Term Incentive Plan awards; and
•Pension arrangements.
The Company’spolicy is thatasubstantialproportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related.
As describedbelow,executive Directors may earnannual incentivepaymentsofupto100% of their basic salary together with the
benefits of the participation in the Long-Term IncentivePlan.
Executive Directors areentitled to accept appointments outsidethe Company or Group. Thereisnorequirement for Directors to remit
fees earned from appointments outsideofthe Company or Group to The RestaurantGroup plc.
Basic salary
An executive Director’sbasic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginningofeach year and when an individual
changes position or responsibility.Indecidingappropriatelevels, the Committee considers the Group asawhole and by reference
to remuneration levels at other companiesinthe leisureand hospitality sectors.Basic salaries werereviewed in December 2006 with
increases taking effect from1January 2007. They wereagain reviewed in December 2007 with increases from1January2008.
In additiontobasic salary,the executive Directors receive pensioncontributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principallyacar (or car
allowance), and health and life insurance .
Changes to the basic salary in 2007 represented increasesofbetween 25% and 40%.These significant adjustments wereconsidered
necessary to ensurethat the managementteam wereretained in circumstances whereseveral members of the team had been
approached by other organisations offering very attractive packages (potentially significantly higher than the current packages). In part,
this increase also recognised the increased complexity of the businessand performance of the Company and individual executives.

Annual bonus payments
The annual bonus is basedonthe achievement of stretching profit beforetax targets and personal objectives.Performance targets
areset annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the financial year .
The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid in respect of performancein2008 is 100% of basic annual salary and for
significant bonuses to be paid, performance must be outstanding. For any bonus payment made in excess of 75% of salary thereisa
reinvestment commitment for the Director into shares in The Restaurant Group plc, and these shares form part of the matching element
described in the Long-Term Incentive Plan detailed below .
Long-term incentives
The Company operates the 2005 Long-TermIncentive Plan (“LTIP” or “Plan”),and the 2003 Save As YouEarn(“SAYE”) Scheme under
which awards may be granted to executive Directors.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The 2005 LTIP is the primarylong-term incentive scheme of the Company.Under the terms of the LTIP,individualsmay receive an
awardofconditional free shares (“Conditional Awards”) withaface value at grant of up to 100% of salary per annum, vesting at least
three years after grant subject to performance conditions and continued employment.
In addition, the Plan has the flexibility to grant conditional awards onamatching basis, prorata to the number of shares purchased
via the annual bonus (“Matching Awards”). Matching Awards may be grantedover shares worth up to 37.5% of base salary per
annum. The aggregate value of annual awards (Conditional and Matching)iscapped at 137.5% of base salary.Under the Plan,
the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to increase this cap to 200% of salary if the Committeedecides thereare exceptional
circumstances in relation to retention and recruitment of employees. The Remuneration Committee has determined that exceptional
circumstances do currently exist in relation to the retention of certain key employees and Directors and may exercise its discretion to
make awards of up to 200% of salary in 2008.
The Committee considers that Earnings Per Share(“EPS”)and Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)are the most appropriate measures
of performance, with EPS targets rewarding significant and sustained earnings growth and TSR providingabalance to the financial
performance and retainingashareprice discipline in the remuneration package.
For the Conditional Awards to executive Directorstobemade in 2008, two separate performance conditions apply to proportions
of the award. These have been reviewed to ensuretheir continued appropriateness:
•The performance conditionattached to 50% of the Conditional Awards requires average annual EPS growth from1January 2008
to 31 December 2010 of between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% p.a. for between 30% and 100% of this part of the awardtovest
(i.e. between 15% and 50% of the total award).
•The performance conditionattached to the other 50% of the Conditional Awards is based on TSR performance measured against the

Accounting policies for
the consolidated accounts
Significant accounting policies
The Restaurant Group plc (the “Company”) isacompanyincorporated and registered in Scotland. The consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the year ended 30 December 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”)
and the Group’sinterest in its associate.
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards(“IFRSs”)
and its interpretationsadopted by the InternationalAccounting Standards Board(“IASB”) and as adopted by the European Union.
(b) Basis of preparation
The accounting year runs to the nearest Sunday to 31 December each year which will bea52or53week period .
The financial statements arepresented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand. They arepreparedonthe historicalcost basis
except derivative financial instruments which areheld at their fair value. Non-currentassets and disposal groups held for sale arestated
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires managementtomake judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions arebased on historicalexperience and various other factors that arebelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assetsand liabilities that arenot readilyapparent
from othersources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions arereviewed on an ongoingbasis. Revisionstoaccounting estimates arerecognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and futureperiods if
the revision affects both current and future periods.
In the current year the Group has adopted IFRS7“Financial Instruments: Disclosures”, which is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after1January 2007 and the related amendmenttoIAS1“Presentation of Financial Statements”.The impact of the
adoptionofthese standards has been to expand the disclosuresprovided in the financial statementsregarding the Group’s financial
instruments and management of capital.
Futureaccounting policies
IFRS8“Operating Segments” will be mandatoryfor the Group for the 2009 year end results. This will require the Group to amend
certain disclosures but will not change the Group’sresult. The Group does not consider that any other standards or interpretations
issues by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have any significant impact on the financialstatements.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries areentities controlled by the Company.Control exists when the Company has the power,directly or indirectly,togovern
the financial and operatingpolicies of an entity so as to obtain benefitsfromits activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that
presently areexercisable or convertible aretaken into account,regardless of management’sintention to exercise that option or warrant.
The financialstatements of subsidiaries areincluded in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until
the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates
Associates arethose entities in which the Group has significant influence,but not control, overthe financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’sshareofthe total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity
accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significantinfluence ceases. When the Group’ s
shareoflosses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’scarrying amount would be reduced to nil and recognition of further
lossesisdiscontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf
of an associate.
(iii) Transactions eliminatedonconsolidation
Intragroup balancesand any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions areeliminated in preparing
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates areeliminated to the extent of the
Group’sinterest in the entity.Unrealised losses areeliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there
is no evidence of impairment. (d) Foreign currency
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies aretranslated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet.
Transactions in foreign currencies aretranslatedinto sterling at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. The profitand loss
accounts for overseas operations aretranslated at the average rate of exchange for the periods covered by the accounts. Exchange
differences that relate to the net equity investment in overseas activities aretaken directly to reserves. Allother translation differences
aretaken to the income statement.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposuretointerest rate risks arisingfromoperational, financingand
investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy,the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instrumentsfor trading
purposes. However,derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting areaccountedfor as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instrumentsare recognised initiallyatcost. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivativefinancial instruments are
stated at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. However,where
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of anyresultantgain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or paytoterminate the swap at the balance
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties .
(f) Property,plant and equipment
Items of property,plant and equipment arestated at cost less accumulateddepreciation (see below) and impairment losses
(see accountingpolicyk).
Whereparts of an item of property,plant and equipment have different useful lives, they areaccountedfor as separate items of property ,
plant and equipment.
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership areclassified as finance leases.
The owner-occupied property (excluding land element) acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower
of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease paymentsatinceptionofthe lease, less accumulated depreciation
(see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy k). Lease paymentsare accountedfor as describedinaccounting policy r.
Subsequent costs
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property,plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item
when that cost is incurred if it is probablethat the futureeconomic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the Group and the cost
of the item can be measured reliably.All other costs arerecognisedinthe income statement as an expenseasincurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement onastraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item
of property,plant and equipment.The estimated useful lives areasfollows:
Freehold land Indefinite
Freehold buildings50years
Long and short leasehold property Term of lease or 25 years, whichever is lower
Fixtures and equipment 3-10 years
Motor vehicles 4years
Computer equipment 3-5 years
(g) Intangible assets–Goodwill
All business combinations areaccounted for by applyingthe purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition
of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. In respectofbusiness acquisitions that have occurred since1January 2004, goodwill
representsthe difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to1January 2004 has not been reconsidered
in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balancesheet at1January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested at least
bi-annually for impairment (see accounting policy k). In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying
amount of the investment in the associate.
Negativegoodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.

(h) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables arestated at their cost less impairment losses (see accounting policy k).
(i) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
(j) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that arerepayable on demand and form
an integral part of the Group’scash management areincludedasacomponent of cash and cash equivalents for the purposeofthe
statement of cash flows.
(k) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets arereviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether thereisany indication
of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’srecoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and assets that have an
indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. An impairment loss is recognisedwhenever
the carrying amount of an asset or its cashgenerating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairmentlosses arerecognised in
the income statement.
(l) Share-based payment transactions
The shareoption programme allows Group employees to acquireshares of the Company.The fair value of options granted is
recognisedasanemployee expense withacorresponding increase in equity.The fairvalue is measured at grant date and spread over
the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured
usingaStochastic model,taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options weregranted. The amount recognised
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shareoptions that vest except whereforfeitureisonly due to market based
conditionsnot achieving the threshold for vesting.
(m) Provisions
Aprovision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group hasapresent legal or constructive obligation asaresult ofapast event,
and it is probable that an outflowofeconomicbenefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are
determined by discountingthe expected futurecash flows atapre-tax rate that reflects current market assessmentsofthe time value
of money and, whereappropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
(n) Deferred and current tax
Corporation tax payable is provided on the taxable profit at the current rate. Deferred tax is recognisedinrespect of all temporary
differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the deferred tax arises from
the initial recognition of goodwill. Temporary differencesare differences between the carrying amount of the Group’sassets and liabilities
and their tax base.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that areexpected to apply in the periodsinwhich the timing differences areexpected to
reverse based on tax rates and laws that areenacted, or substantively enacted,bythe balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured
onanon-discountedbasis.
(o) Pensions
The Groupmakes contributions for selected employees into defined contribution pension plans and these contributions arecharged to
the income statement as they become payable. The Group does not operateany defined benefit plans.
(p) Onerous contracts
Aprovision for onerous contracts is recognisedwhen the expected benefitstobederived by the Group fromacontract arelower than
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
(q) Revenue
Revenue represents amounts received and receivable forservices and goods provided (excluding value added tax and voluntary
gratuities left by customers for the benefit of employees) and is recognised at the point of sale.

Incentives to enter into an operating lease arealso spreadonastraight line basis over the lease term.
(ii) Finance lease payments

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’saccounting policiesasdescribed above,management has made the following judgements and
estimations that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
a) Impairment of carrying value of associate
Following the disposal by LivingVentures Limited of the Living Rooms business and the subsequent capital restructure, the Directors
have concluded that it is appropriate to makeafurther provision of £1.7m, which together with the £9.5m provision made in the year
ended 31 December 2006, leavesa£nil carryingvalue of both the investment and the loan note due. Further details areprovided in
notes5and 14.
b) Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least onabi-annualbasis. This requires an estimate of the value-in-use of the
assets to which goodwill is ascribedto. Estimating the value-in-use requires the Group to makeanestimate of the futurecash flows
from those assets and to chooseasuitable discountrate in order to calculatethe present value of those cashflows.
c) Acquisition of Brunning and Price Limited
Following the acquisition of Brunningand Price Limited on 17 October2007, the Group has consolidated the fair value of its assets
and liabilities at that date. This required an estimate of the fair value of the properties acquired which the Directors have determined
based on advice from an independent firm of qualified valuers .

Credit risk refers to the risk thatacounterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances arewith financialinstitutions with strong creditratings. The Group is exposed to credit
related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’scustomer base beingspread overalarge number of
customers primarily transacting in cash or by credit cardand areshort-term in nature. Management thereforebelieve thereisno
additional provisionrequired in excess of thenormal provision for doubtful debts and thereare no material amounts past due that
have not been provided against. 26 Financial instruments and derivatives continued
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of £10.4m due from LV Finance Limited (previously Living Ventures Limited).
This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures Restaurants Limited,formerly Est Est Est Restaurants Limited, but is subject
toaprior ranking behind LV Finance Limited’sbank. Followingadetailed review of the carryingvalue of the business, including the
loan note receivable, the Boardconcluded that it is appropriatetomakeafull provision against the loan note due (2006: £9.5m
provision). Following the restructuring of Living Ventures Limited in June 2007, the payment terms and interest on the loan have
also been restructured.
The carryingamount of financial assets recordedinthe financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, representthe Group’ s
maximum exposuretocredit risk .
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity
management requirements. Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reservesand bank facilities by
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturityprofiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’sloan
facilities, which maturein2012 (as set out in note (a) above), ensurecontinuity of funding.
(d) Foreign currency risk
As the Group operates primarily within the United Kingdom any transactional or translational exposuretochanges in foreign exchange
rate is limited. The three restaurants the Group operates in Spain areserviced by local Eurodenominated debt. The Group is not
materiallyexposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forwardcontracts.
(e) Interest rate risk
Exposure to interest rate movements is controlled through the use of floatingrate debt and an interest rate swap to achieveabalanced
interest rate profile and to ensurethataminimum level of borrowings areatfixed rates for the next three years in line with the Group’ s
treasury strategy. Details of the current swap areset out in note (a) above. The interest rate profile is reviewed onaregular basis.

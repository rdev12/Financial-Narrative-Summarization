SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 Shed Media (the ‘Group’) has succeeded in transforming the scale and scope of the business in the 16
month period to 31 December 2007. The acquisition of three companies during the period: Outright
Distribution, Twenty Twenty and Wall to Wall, has significantly broadened the Group by genre,
broadcaster base and geographic spread. These acquisitions have changed the risk profile of the Group,
reducing dependence on any one particular brand, and Shed Media now serves 13 broadcast customers in
both the UK and the US.
Outright Distribution enables the Group to exploit its programme rights more effectively, selling into over
125 territories worldwide, and to retain the margin otherwise paid out to external distributors. Outright is
also growing its quality third party business, attracted by efficient exploitation into many territories and an
outstanding catalogue of programme brands.
Shed Media's core strategy of building a portfolio of long run returning series, with the capability of
generating revenue from intellectual property rights, characterised the acquisitions completed in the
period. At the same time as executing this strategy the Group has maintained its position as one of the
most efficient producers in the UK, sustaining high operating margins of 18%, twice the industry average. 
I am delighted to have welcomed to the Board Chris Bonney, MD of Outright, Peter Casely-Hayford, MD
of Twenty Twenty, and Alex Graham, CEO of Wall to Wall. Their experience combined with their
enthusiasm for the continued growth of Shed Media has made the task of integrating the businesses very
straightforward and effective.
Ann McManus and Maureen Chadwick, founders of Shed Productions, stood down from the Board. Their
knowledge and creativity has been, and continues to be the backbone of Shed drama, as they continue in
their roles as leading show runners and writers of our long run drama series. I thank them for their
invaluable contribution.
In changing economic conditions, broadcast customers need efficient producers and Shed Media's forward
order book of 64% of target revenue commissioned, and our proven expertise at delivering quality
programming, provides the basis for our confidence in the year.
The expansion of the business and the demands of our customers in competitive markets has placed
continuing high demands on the talents and resources of our staff, and I would like to thank them for their
hard work and commitment.

SHED MEDIA A NNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Chairman’s Statement OVERVIEW FOR THE 16 MONTHS
I am pleased to announce Shed Media’s final results covering the 16 months to 31 December 2007.
Over the 16 months, adjusted operating profit increased to £11.1m. Operating margin, before goodwill
amortisation, remains high at 18%, nearly double the industry average of 9.3%.* 
Revenue from the Group’s core activities, content production and IP exploitation, has grown strongly.
During the period, the Group delivered 209 hours of programming – 38 hours of drama and 171 of factual.
Programmes included new ITV1 drama, Rock Rivals, Waterloo Road series three and Supernanny USA
season three.
Shed Media’s in-house distribution arm, Outright Distribution, has performed strongly, successfully
distributing Shed Media content and growing its third party business.  Revenue from the Group’s IP
exploitation accounted for 30% of gross profit.  We expect this area of business to grow as the library
expands with Shed Group and third party business.
One of the main highlights of the period was the acquisition of Twenty Twenty and Wall to Wall, two
highly respected and trusted production companies, renowned for their compelling, quality programming.
The acquisitions further diversify the Group’s programme portfolio and broaden our broadcaster
customer base.  Both companies produce highly profitable programming across a wide range of genres and
are an excellent fit alongside Shed Productions and Ricochet.  Brands include Who Do You Think You Are?,
New Tricks, Brat Camp and The Choir. The US presents further opportunities in which to launch Wall to
Wall and Twenty Twenty formats and content. 
Drama
During the 16 months, Shed Productions secured new drama commissions and re-commissions. A third
series of Waterloo Road was re-commissioned and delivered for BBC1 during the period, with a substantial
increase in the order from 12 hours to 20 hours.  Rock Rivals, an 8 hour prime-time drama, was delivered
for ITV1 and Catwalk Dogs, a 90 minute drama for ITV1 was delivered.   
Post period, a fourth series of Waterloo Road has been re-ordered for BBC1 for a run of 20 hours and a
new prime-time drama, Hope Springs has been ordered for BBC1 (8 x 60 mins).
Shed currently has more major drama series in funded and non-funded development than ever before for
broadcasters in the UK and the US.  
Factual
Ricochet performed extremely well during the 16 months, securing 17 new series, 5 in the US and 12 in the
UK, whilst delivering a total of 171 hours of programming.
The US business experienced strong growth.  In the period, Supernanny USA 3 was delivered to the ABC
Network and the order for Supernanny USA 4 was increased from an initial 13 episodes to 25 episodes.  In
addition, Ricochet delivered a new prime-time factual entertainment series, Fat March, to ABC.  Other new
commissions included an 8-part series for Bravo, The Real Housewives of New York City and a 7 x 60 mins
order for an extreme survival series, The Alaska Experiment, for Discovery US.
Post-period, ABC has ordered a 5th season of Supernanny USA (13 x 60 mins) and a pilot episode of Super-
Manny.  Bravo has ordered a second season run of 10 episodes of The Real Housewives of New York City
following its ratings success and Discovery US has picked up a new 3 x 60 mins major documentary series.
03
SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Chief Executive’s Statement In the UK, highlights include two new series for the BBC, Blood Sweat and T-Shirts (4 x 60 mins) and Open
House (20 x 30 mins) as well as two new brands for Five, Breaking into Tesco (6 x 60 mins) and
Unbreakable (8 x 60 mins).  In the period, Ricochet also won its first commissions for ITV and UKTV.
Ricochet also delivered new series of Supernanny UK, The Mummy Diaries and Born to be Different for
Channel 4, and Living in the Sun and Extreme Dreams for the BBC.
Post-period, Channel 4 has ordered a new prime-time factual entertainment series, Danger Women (4 x
60mins), Five has ordered a new features series, Cowboy Builders (6 x 60mins), as well as re-commissioning
Breaking into Tesco (6 x 60mins), and the BBC has ordered a new landmark documentary series (3 x
60mins).
Intellectual Property (IP) Exploitation
IP exploitation was strong and contribution to the bottom line accounted for 30% of gross profit.  During
the period Outright Distribution sold over 2,100 hours of television in 125 different territories.  The
programme library continues to grow and with effective exploitation by Outright Distribution, this
provides a reliable and growing income stream going forward.  Outright continues to capture more profit
from Group product, whilst continuing to grow third party business.
A major highlight was securing record pre-sales for Shed’s new ITV1 drama Rock Rivals prior to production
and securing a Europe wide DVD deal.
Outlook
Four months into our current financial year we have 227 hours commissioned, representing over 80% of
hours and 64% of revenue target. These commissions include most of the major revenue generating
brands. Drama accounts for 38 hours, including a new peak time drama, Hope Springs for BBC1 (8 x
60mins) and re-commission of Waterloo Road (20 x 60mins) both for Shed Productions.  A fifth series of
New Tricks (8 x 60mins) for Wall to Wall and a new 90min drama, Whatever It Takes for Twenty Twenty.
ABC has ordered a fifth series of Ricochet’s Supernanny USA (13 x 60mins) and BBC1 has re-commissioned
a fifth series of Wall to Wall’s Who Do You Think You Are? (10 x 60mins).
In addition to the commissions for 2008, Wall to Wall has been re-commissioned to produce a sixth series
of New Tricks (8 x 60mins) and sixth series of Who Do You Think You Are? (8 x 60 mins) both for BBC1
and due for delivery in 2009.
The US continues to be an attractive area for growth with our LA production office presently
commissioned to make four series this year for broadcasters including ABC, NBC, Bravo and Discovery US.
An additional four shows are in paid development with MTV, Spike and SoapNet. Supernanny USA is as
strong as ever and the Group is looking forward to the benefit of syndication revenues from 2009.
Delivering on our stated strategy to leverage both Wall to Wall and Twenty Twenty into the US market,
Wall to Wall has received its first commission from NBC to develop and cast six episodes for a US version
of its successful brand, Who Do You Think You Are?  Twenty Twenty has been commissioned by MTV to
produce a pilot inspired by its successful Brat Camp format.
The acquisition of Outright Distribution in September 2006 has enabled the Group to capture more profit
from its IP rights.  The acquisition also made it possible for Outright Distribution to significantly transform
its business.  Its library has more than doubled with the addition of over 500 hours of major new brands
from the Shed Media Group.  Outright’s strong and extensive library attracts all major international buyers
as well as quality third party UK production companies.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Chief Executive’s Statement (continued) Revenue and Profits
The 16 month period ending 31st December 2007 saw revenue increase to £63.1m (2006: 12 months –
£43.5m).
Geographically, 66% of Group revenue in 2007 was from the UK (2006: 71%), 26% from the US (2006:
19%) and 8% from the rest of the world (2006: 10%).
During the period the Group was commissioned directly by 13 broadcasters in both the UK and US and
sold production rights to over 125 territories worldwide. 
Statutory reported operating profits are £8.6m with a reported profit on ordinary activities of £7.5m.
Operating profits before goodwill amortisation are £11.1m with a profit before tax and goodwill of £10m.
Operating margin before goodwill deduction for the period was 18% (2006: 18%) with gross margin at 37%
(2006: 30%). The increase in the gross margin is due to stronger ancillary sales and corresponding lower
amortisation rates.
Acquisitions
In September 2006 the Group completed the acquisition of Outright Distribution for £2m which was
satisfied by £1m in cash and £1m in shares. An additional consideration of £0.5m in cash and £0.5m in
shares is conditional upon profit performance for the period ending June 2008.
In September 2007 we completed the acquisition of Twenty Twenty for £18m which was satisfied by
£13.4m in cash and loan notes and £4.6m in shares. An additional consideration of £1.0m in cash and loan
notes is conditional upon profit performance for the period ending December 2008.
In November 2007 we completed the acquisition of Wall to Wall for £20.4m which was satisfied by £12.7m
in cash and loan notes and £7.7m in shares. An additional consideration of £4m in shares and a super
earnout of £1m in cash is conditional upon profit performance for the period ending June 2009.
Capital Structure and Treasury Policy
During the period Shed Media Plc (“the Company”) increased issued ordinary shares to 78,970,292 ordinary
shares of 0.1p each. The increase in issued ordinary shares financed both the final earn-out for Ricochet
Limited and the acquisitions of Outright, Twenty Twenty and Wall to Wall.  
During the period we arranged a debt facility of £44m with Barclays and the Bank of Ireland to help fund
the acquisitions and to provide a working capital facility consisting of;
A £32m five year facility to fund the acquisitions of Outright, Twenty Twenty, Wall to Wall and to
refinance the existing debt facility used to purchase Ricochet.
A £4m in guaranteed loan notes to fund the acquisitions of Outright, Twenty Twenty and Wall to Wall
which are redeemable in one year.
The Company also has a £8m working capital facility which had not been drawn down by the period end.

SHED MEDIA A NNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Financial Review Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share in the period was 6.49p (2006: 7.44p) based on earnings of £4.3m divided by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of 66,092,144 (2006: 57,634,688). Diluted
earnings per share in the period was 6.42p (2006: 7.37p) based on the weighted average number of shares
in issue of 66,827,444 (2006: 58,151,598).
After adjusting for FRS 20 charges and goodwill amortisation, adjusted basic earnings per share was 10.67p
(2006: 9.6p) and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 10.56p (2006: 9.53p).
Cash flow 
Net Cash Inflow from operating activities was £6.5m (2006: £10.4m), with the main movements being a
£3m increase in debtors due to timing of productions and a decrease in creditors of £5.2m. 
The overall net cash decreased by £72k (2006: £1m increase) which was the net of the overall growth in
the business offset by the acquisitions made during the year.
Balance Sheet
Fixed assets The £5.3m increase in film assets during the period represents the capitalisation of new
productions during the period and the addition of  the Twenty Twenty and Wall to Wall film libraries. In
the current period the Group depreciated on average 82% of assets arising from new drama productions
and 90% on new factual entertainment productions. The remainder will be amortised over the life of the
production defined by expected future sales. The £1.3m increase in Fixtures, Fittings and Equipment
includes a combination of additions from acquisitions, leasehold improvements, and new edit suites.
Debtors The increase in debtors in the period is due to the inclusion of Outright, Twenty Twenty and Wall
to Wall debtors. Of the £18.2m (2006: £9.2m), £7m were trade debtors and £9.2m represented accrued
income. 
Creditors Due Within One Year The increase in creditors in the period to £27.7m (2006: £21.2m) has been
partly due to the inclusion of Outright, Twenty Twenty and Wall to Wall creditors but also partly due to
short term bank loans for production of Rock Rivals £3.6m and New Tricks £1.8m. 
Creditors Due After One Year During the period creditors due after one year increased to £26.4m (2006:
£nil) as a 5 year loan facility was arranged to purchase Outright, Wall to Wall and Twenty Twenty.  
Goodwill During the period an additional £43.4m of goodwill representing the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of net assets acquired with Outright, Wall to Wall and Twenty Twenty  was
recognised and is being written off over 20 years.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Group will be reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) from the year
commencing 1 January 2008. Management are currently reviewing how this change will affect future
results.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Financial Review (continued) Taxation
The tax charge for the period is £3.2m at an effective rate of 32% (2006: 30%) on the operating profit
before goodwill amortisation. The effective rate has increased due to a proportion of the operating profit
being taxed in the USA.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Board of Directors (continued) The directors have pleasure in presenting their report on the Group together with the audited financial
statements for the period ended 31 December 2007.
Principal activity
Shed Media (the “Group”) is an independent television production and distribution company. The Group
specialises in contemporary, original drama and factual programming and content and in distributing
subsequent rights from these programmes.
Change of accounting reference date
During the period the Group announced a change in accounting reference date. The nature and timing of
the Group’s business means it is more appropriate to have a final reporting date after the peak production
season and the board is aware that for comparative purposes it is useful for the Group to align the
accounting reference date with those of other public companies in the sector.
Results and Dividends
The results for the Group show a pre-tax profit of £7.5 million (2006 12 months: £6.6 million) for the
period and sales of £63.1 million (2006: 12 Months, £43.5 million). The Group has net debt of £30.5 million
(2006: 12 Months, Net Funds of: £5.6 million). Net cash flow from operating activities for 2007 was £6.5
million (2006: £10.3 million). The Directors have recommended a final dividend for 2007 of 1.1p per share,
which subject to confirmation at the AGM, will be paid 18 July 2008 to shareholders on the register at 20
June 2008.
The final dividend proposed at 31 August 2006 of 1p per share was paid on 12 January 2007.
The six month interim dividend of 0.25p per share proposed on 28 February 2007 was paid on 5 July 2007.
Business Review
Business environment
The independent television market has benefited from changes in the law. The Communications Act in
2003 and the corresponding changes in terms of trade have enabled producers to own and control the
rights to the content they create. This new legislation has most benefited those companies that create
valuable rights that sell well in international and UK secondary markets.
The emergence of new media is also an important development in the television market. New technology
such as mobile phone streaming and internet downloading give independent producers more
opportunities to exploit their content. The companies which own attractive, recognisable brands that
platform owners need benefit most from these market developments.
12
SHED MEDIA A NNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Directors’ Report The independent production sector has traditionally been fragmented with hundreds of companies
producing a limited number of programmes and owning few, if any, of the rights to those programmes.
The favourable changes to market conditions have enabled the emergence of a few dominant players
strong enough to buy out smaller competitors. This has led to the creation of the “Super Indie” which
benefits from diversification into different production genres thus mitigating the risks associated with
creative businesses.
Within this competitive environment the Group has differentiated itself from its competitors as follows:
• Business Model – Focussed on multiple profit streams rather than turnover.
• Brands – Creating powerful brands that sell internationally and across new platforms.
• Operating Margins – Consistently delivering strong operating margins.
• Visibility of Revenue – Strong brands and a good reputation with broadcasters who re-commission
existing brands and are open to new programme developments.
• Growth – Organically through an expanding in-house talent pool and strategically through
acquisition of brand – owning, brand-creating companies.
Strategy
The Group’s overriding objective is to achieve attractive and sustainable rates of growth and returns
through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. 
• Strong organic growth through:
• • Maintaining and securing key production talent
• • Building on success and reputation with broadcasters
• • Successful exploitation of programming rights
• • Building new broadcaster relationships in the UK and internationally and in particular the US
• Selective acquisition of companies meeting strict criteria:
• • Production companies in valuable new genres
• • Brand owning and brand creating capabilities
• • Talent tied in by ownership
• • Right Price
• • New Media
Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
The board monitors progress on the overall Group strategy and the individual strategic elements by
reference to six KPIs.
1 Growth in sales (%) 
Year on year sales growth expressed as a percentage. The increase is in line with the Group’s growth
strategy. Sales have improved due to our successful acquisition and integration of Outright Distribution

led to the Group strengthening its product through expansion of its genres and making direct distribution

Directors’ Report (continued) 2 Gross margin (%) 
Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation to sales
expressed as a percentage. Gross margin has improved on last year within the Group 37% (2006: 30%) 
3 Operating Profit Margin (%)
Operating profit margin is the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation
to sales expressed as a percentage. Gross Margin is important to maintain to ensure productions are
profitable, but it is essential the Group keeps overheads under control and maintains a strong operating
profit margin. The Group produced a strong operating profit margin in the period 18% (2006: 18%).The
operating profit margin is very strong compared to the industry as a whole and as a KPI will continue to be
monitored by the Group.
4 EBITDA 
The Group monitors its ability to pay loans on a monthly basis by reviewing interest to EBITDA and loan
amount to EBITDA. The Group ensures it is clearly able to meet the terms set out in its loan agreements.
5 Programming Hours
The Group monitors commissioned programming hours per annum as a KPI.  The Group produced 209
programme hours (2006: 12 months, 132 programme hours).
6 International Sales
In order to grow as a business it is important for the Group to continue to exploit its programmes in the
international market. This performance target is reviewed quarterly and the Group anticipates annual
growth which enables continual growth of the business. This area of the business has continued to grow in
the period.
Principal Risks
Risks are formally reviewed by the board and appropriate processes put in place to monitor and mitigate
them. If more than one event occurs, it is possible that the overall effect of such events would compound
the possible adverse effects on the Group.
The directors consider the following to be the principal risks faced by the Group.
1 Competition
The Group operates in a highly competitive market with many companies, small and large, competing for
broadcasters’ commissions. For the Group to grow it needs to secure re-commissions of existing brands
and have new programme brands ready to be commissioned when more mature ones fade. To mitigate
the risk of a slow-down in the overall rate of growth our creative teams are constantly developing new
programme brands to ensure a healthy pipeline of new productions.
A reputation for consistently delivering high quality programmes is a prime asset in the market and this
reputation is dependent on maintaining a pool of high quality creative staff.
14
SHED MEDIA A NNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Directors’ Report (continued) 2 Key Creative Staff
The Group’s performance depends largely on the retention of key creative staff. The loss of key individuals
or failure to recruit sufficient talent with the right experience and skills can adversely impact the Group’s
results. During the period the Group has added to its pool of creative staff and encouraged commitment
to the Group through share incentive plans. The Group has also successfully trained up younger staff
members to take on creative roles and has been successful in retaining them over the long term. When
acquiring companies the Group ensures that the talent is tied in through share ownership and
performance-based earn out schemes.
3 Control of Productions Costs
Once the executive producers have negotiated programme prices with the broadcasters, an internal
budget is agreed and it is up to the production departments to ensure programmes are made within or
below that budget. There is a risk that productions go over budget at some point during the production
process. To control this risk the Group employ skilled production accountants who report into senior
Group management on at least a weekly basis. Any drift over budget can be dealt with quickly to ensure
the overall production budget is adhered to. There is also adequate insurance in place for each production
to cover any unforeseen problems that may affect the cost of production such as key cast illnesses or
major equipment failure.
4 Financial Risk Management
The board regularly reviews the financial requirements of the Group and the risks associated therewith.
The Group does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments are used it is
for reduced interest or exchange rate risk. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. Group
operations are primarily financed from equity funds raised, retained earnings and bank borrowings
(including overdraft facilities). In addition to the primary financial instruments, the Group also has other
financial instruments such as debtors, prepayments, trade creditors and accruals that arise directly from
the Group’s operations. Further information is provided in note 18 to the financial statements.
Directors
The directors of the Group are named on pages 9 to 11, together with brief biographical notes. All
directors have been in office for the duration of the period unless stated on pages 9 to 11.
Directors’ interests in shares and options
Details of directors’ interests in shares and share options can be found in the Director’s Remuneration
Report on pages 20 to 23.
Retirement and Re-elections of Directors
Katherine Innes Ker and David Kogan retire by rotation from office at the Annual General Meeting. Chris
Bonney, Peter Casely-Hayford and Alexander Graham being newly elected to the board will also retire
from office at the Annual General Meeting. Being eligible, these directors will offer themselves for re-
election in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Directors’ Report (continued) The directors support high standards of Corporate Governance and confirm that they intend to comply
with the requirements of the new “Combined Code” on Corporate Governance (“the code”) published in
2006, so far as practicable given the size, nature and current stage of the development of the Group. The
key Group objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value.
The Board of Directors
The Board consisted of twelve directors during the period whose names and details appear on pages 9 to
11. The two non-executive directors are considered to be independent of management and free of any
relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
A formal schedule of matters is considered by the board, which meets at least 10 times per year and keeps
under constant review the need to hold additional meetings. The board is responsible for:
• Overall Group strategy.
• Acquisitions.
• Monitoring the operating and financial results against plans and budgets.
• Ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its
objectives.
• Ensuring that the Group’s obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and met.
The following committees, which have written terms of reference, deal with specific aspects of the
Group’s affairs:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of the two non-executive directors and meets at least twice a year. It is
responsible for ensuring that the financial activities of the Group are properly monitored, controlled and
reported on. It meets the external auditors without executive directors being present and reviews reports
from the auditors.
The Audit Committee recommends the appointment of the external auditors, reviews the audit fee and
audit plan and pre-approves all non-audit work in respect of external auditors, prior to commitment by the
Group.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of two non-executive directors. It reviews the performance of the
executive directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration and that of senior management
and the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of shareholders. In determining
the remuneration of the executive directors and senior management the committee seeks to ensure that
the Group will be able to attract and retain executives of the highest calibre. It makes recommendations to
the full board concerning the allocation of incentive schemes to employees. No director participates in
discussions or decisions concerning his own remuneration.
Further details of the Group’s policies on remuneration including details of director’s share options are
given in the report of the Remuneration Committee report on pages 20 to 23.
Nomination Committee
The directors consider that, given the size of the board, nominations should be a matter for the board as a
whole, and accordingly there is no separate Nomination Committee. This will be reviewed regularly.
18
SHED MEDIA A NNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Corporate Governance Report Internal Controls
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal controls and for
reviewing their effectiveness. These internal controls are designed to safeguard the assets of the Group
and to ensure the reliability of financial information for both internal and external publication. The
effectiveness of the system of internal controls has been reviewed by the directors and they are satisfied
the controls are effective with regard to the size of the Group and the stage of its development. Any
system of internal control can only be designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives and can provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Given the size of the Group, there is currently not an internal audit function. This will be reviewed as the
Group grows.
Relationship with Shareholders
The directors attach great importance to maintaining good relationships with shareholders.
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. The directors meet and discuss the
performance of the Group with shareholders during the year. Queries raised by shareholders are promptly
answered by whoever on the board is best placed to do so. Investors are encouraged to participate in the
Annual General Meeting at which the Chairman will present a review of the results and comment on
current business activity. The board will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer shareholder
questions.
Going Concern
After making enquiries the directors have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and that it is therefore
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In forming this view the
directors have reviewed the annual profit plan for the year ending 31 December 2008 and strategic plan
projections for subsequent years. The directors have satisfied themselves that the Group is in a sound
financial position and sufficient borrowing facilities will be available to meet the Group’s foreseeable cash
requirements.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Corporate Governance Report (continued) The following report outlines the Group’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors and gives
details of the remuneration packages of executive directors and of the fees paid to non-executive
directors for the period ended 31 December 2007. A resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting of the Group. The directors have applied the principles of good governance
related to director’s remuneration as described below:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises two independent non-executive directors David Kogan (chair)
and Katherine Innes Ker.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy of the Committee and of the board is to provide remuneration packages for the
Executive Directors and other senior executives in the Group which are appropriate to the size and nature
of the Group’s business and which will attract and retain high calibre executives. It is the Group’s policy
that a substantial proportion of the executive directors’ remuneration should be performance related in
order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder return and that
remuneration should be linked to both individual and Group performance.
Accordingly, executive directors may earn up to an additional 50% of their basic salaries as a performance
bonus and have benefited from participation in the Group’s share option scheme, as set out below.
It is the policy of the Committee and the board to maintain the above approach to remuneration packages
for executive directors and other senior executives of the Group for the current financial year and future
financial years, subject to review in the light of any changes in relevant legislation, regulations or market
practice. The Committee will continue to review base salaries and performance targets to ensure that they
align with the remuneration policy of the Committee and the board and with the Group’s strategic
objectives. The individual salary, bonus and benefit levels of the executive directors’ are, and will continue
to be, reviewed annually by the committee. This year the Committee has also undertaken a review of the
longer term remuneration, with particular emphasis on selecting longer term incentives.
It is the Group’s policy to employ executive directors under contracts with an indefinite term subject to
the termination by notice by either party of 12 months. Any compensation payable by the Group would be
subject to normal legal principles of mitigation of loss. No compensation would be payable if the service
contracts were to be terminated by notice from the executive director or for lawful termination by the
Group. There are no provisions for payment of pre-determined compensation under the service contracts.
In relation to future appointments of executive directors, the Committee’s and board’s policy will remain
one of restricting notice periods to 12 months.
Details of individual directors’ remuneration and share options are set out on pages 22 and 23 of this
Report. The main components of the remuneration for executive directors are:
Basic Salary
The Group’s policy is that basic salaries for executive directors’ should take into account the individual’s
role and responsibilities, performance and experience. For an executive director who is experienced and
fully effective in his role, basic salary is targeted at the retail market median for comparable roles.
Annual bonus
Executive directors are eligible to receive an annual performance bonus up to a maximum of 50% of their
annual basic salaries at the time the bonus scheme is announced. The amount of bonus is based on the
20
SHED MEDIA A NNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Directors’ Remuneration Report achievement of profit targets specified and agreed at the beginning of the year. The performance targets
for bonus entitlements are intended by the Remuneration Committee to create keen incentives to
perform at the highest levels. 
Share Option Schemes
On 14th March 2005 the Group adopted an EMI Scheme under which the Group employees (including
executive directors) are eligible for the grant of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Group. Further
details are in note 19.
Performance Share Plan
A key element of the Group’s retention and reward strategy is to encourage employee share ownership
and facilitate the retention of key staff and talent. The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (PSP) to
provide additional share awards to certain employees to reward and motivate existing staff and attract key
new hires. The PSP will allow participants to acquire shares subject to and to the extent that performance
conditions are satisfied. Awards in the period are detailed in note 19.
Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to be provided with private healthcare insurance. Alexander Graham
received a pension in the period.
Non-executive Directors
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive members of the board and are
based on market surveys.
The Group’s practice is to appoint non-executive directors under letters of engagement rather than under
service contracts. These letters of engagement set out fixed terms of appointment of three years, which
may be extended with the agreement of the board.
Executive Directors’ Service Contracts
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts are as follows: 
Date of service
Agreement
Eileen Gallagher 18 February 2005
Brian Park 18 February 2005
Ann McManus 18 February 2005
Maureen Chadwick 18 February 2005

Nicholas Southgate 24 November 2005
Chris Bonney 28 September 2006
Peter Casely-Hayford 19 September 2007
Alexander Graham 29 November 2007
The Group may terminate any of the above service contracts by giving not less than 12 months notice. Any
compensation payable by the Group for early termination would be subject to the normal legal principles
of mitigation of loss. No compensation would be payable if a service contract were to be terminated by
notice from any of the above directors or for lawful early termination by the Group.
21
SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) In concluding the service contracts, for the directors, the Group took into account the provisions of the
Combined Code regarding notice periods for service contracts. In relation to future appointments of
executive directors, the committee’s and board’s policy will remain one of restricting notice periods of
termination service contracts to twelve months.
Non-executive Directors: Letters of appointment
The Group’s practice for the appointment of non-executive directors is consistent with the provisions of
the Combined Code. Non-executive directors are appointed under letters of engagement (rather than
under service contracts).
Details of the non-executive directors’ letters of engagement are as follows:
Date of Unexpired term
letter of at the date
engagement of this report
Katherine Innes Ker 18 March 2008 10 Months
David Kogan 18 March 2008 10 Months
Each letter of appointment is terminable by either party by giving not less than three months notice or by
the Group on payment of fees in lieu of notice. No compensation would be payable to a non-executive
director if his/her engagement were terminated as a result of him/her retiring by rotation at an Annual
General Meeting, not being elected or re-elected at an Annual General Meeting or otherwise ceasing to
hold office under the provisions of the Articles of Association of the Group.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. Company law requires
the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which provide a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and the profit and loss of the Group in that period. In
preparing those statements the directors are required to:
• Select appropriate accounting policies and apply them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates which are prudent and reasonable; and
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any material
departure disclosed and explained in the financial statements and to disclose and prepare the
accounts on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue
in business.
The directors confirm that the financial statements on pages 27 to 57 comply with all the above
requirements. 
The directors are also responsible for maintaining adequate accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and which allow
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
They also have a general responsibility in law for taking such suitable measures as are available to them to
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. They are also
responsible for ensuring that the annual report includes information required by the AIM Rules of the
Financial Services Authority.
The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the directors; the work
carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they
were initially presented on the website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
24
SHED MEDIA A NNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities We have audited the financial statements on pages 27 to 57.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. This other information comprises only the Chairman’s statement, Chief
Executive’s statement, the Financial Review, the Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance Report and
the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by
the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in
the financial statements.

notes as part of the acquisition of Twenty Twenty Productions Limited see note 28. On 29 November
2007 the Group issued Share Capital and £2.1m in loan notes for the acquisition of Wall to Wall Holdings
Limited see note 28. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied in the Group’s financial information
throughout the period under review, are as follows:
Basis of accounting
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial information relating to Shed Media Plc
and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2007.
Development Expenditure
Development expenditure has been written off as incurred, unless the Directors are satisfied as to the
technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In this situation, the development
expenditure is deferred.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost.
For programme assets, depreciation is provided in accordance with the income forecast method whereby
depreciation is taken to the profit and loss account on a pro rata basis calculated as the income received in
the accounting period in relation to the expected revenue over the life of the programme.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write each asset down to its
estimated residual value evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:–
Fixtures, fittings & equipment 25% straight line
Computer equipment 50% straight line
Programme assets held under finance leases
Programme assets held under finance leases are treated as if they had been purchased outright at the
present value of the rentals payable, less finance charges, over the primary period of the agreements. Any
surplus generated from the excess of interest due from the sale proceeds held on deposit as compared
with the interest payable under the lease agreement is recognised as profit in the period of initial contract,
after accounting for related costs.
Operating Leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis
over the period of the lease.
Going Concern
The Directors regularly review that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future, and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements. See corporate governance statement for additional
information.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for diminution in value.
32
SHED MEDIA ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 Accounting policies (continued)
Stock and Work In Progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all direct costs
incurred in bringing the television productions to their present stage of completion.
Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to
completion and disposal.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss
account for the year.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future
or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that
arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they
are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for work carried out in producing television programmes and is
recognised on the basis of the value of costs related to production activity. Turnover also includes sums
receivable from the exploitation of programmes in which the Group owns rights. Gross profit on
production activity is recognised based upon the stage of completion of the production and in accordance
with the underlying contract.
For distribution income the amount recognised in the profit and loss account represents the value of the
licence fees including withholding tax but excluding Value Added Tax.
Distribution income is recognised when
– An agreement is contracted.
– The arrangement is fixed and determinable.
– And for finished programme sales when the programme is delivered.
Goodwill
The goodwill arising on acquisitions has been capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over 20
years from the date of acquisition. The amortisation period is considered by the directors to be a
reasonable estimate of useful economic life. Goodwill is based on the difference between the fair value of
the consideration including all costs relating to the acquisition and the net assets of the acquired entity
(after fair value adjustments).
33
SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 Accounting policies (continued)
Deferred Consideration 
Where the deferred consideration is dependent upon future trading performance, an estimate of the
present value of the likely consideration payable is made. This contingent deferred consideration is re-
assessed annually and a corresponding adjustment is made to goodwill arising on acquisition. The
difference between the present value and the total amount payable at a future date gives rise to a finance
charge which is charged to the profit and loss account and credited to the liability over the period in which
the consideration is deferred. 
Deferred financing Costs
Bank arrangement fees and associated legal costs are amortised over the term of the debt facility.
Share-Based Payment
The Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 20 (FRS20) Share-based payments in the current
year. FRS20 requires the recognition of a charge for share-based payment transactions which include for
example share options granted to employees that require a certain length of service before vesting.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value is
measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been
adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions
and behavioural considerations.
There was not a material difference between the prior year charge under UITF 17 and the current year
charge and consequently no prior year adjustments have been made.

9. Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of
shares has been adjusted for the issue of shares during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to
assume conversion for all dilutive potential ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to
employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Group’s ordinary shares,
determined in accordance with the provisions of FRS 22.

18. Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments principally comprise borrowings, cash at bank, loan notes and various
items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to raise money for the Group’s operations.
Although the majority of transactions the Group undertakes are with UK broadcasters, UK Suppliers and
UK distributors in UK Sterling, the Group does have a satellite office in the United States of America and
enters into contractual arrangements with American broadcasters. Contractual arrangements are also from
time to time made in US dollars by the UK entities within the Group. In certain circumstances some
purchasing takes place with overseas suppliers who bill in local currency.
Where exchange risk is perceived the Group considers its exposure and uses financial instruments to
reduce this risk. At 31 December 2007 the Group did not have any financial instruments in place.
Short–term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the
currency risk disclosures.

c) Currency exposures
The Group reviews currency risk and considers hedging when occasionally entering into large foreign
currency contracts to eliminate the cost. At the year end there were no foreign exchange hedges (2006:
Nil).
The Group had one bank account denominated in a currency other than the Group reporting currency. At
31 December 2007 the US dollar balance translated to £873,240 (2006: £nil).

of 7.15%. The loan notes are at a fixed rate of 5.25%.
At 31 August 2006 there was a banking facility of £4m of which £1m was drawn at the balance sheet date.

The long term loan is secured against the net assets of the main operating companies in the Group while
the short term production loans are secured against the production income contracted from the
broadcaster.
e) Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is not considered to be materially different from
their book values. 
f) Liquidity Risk
The Group reviews its cash position on a monthly basis and ensures it has sufficient access to cash for its
operational needs. The repayment of the loan notes, £4m (2006: £7.5m) will be financed by cash resources.

The balance held in Share Option reserves, both within the Group and the Company relates to payments
due for the above share schemes as per FRS20 – Share Based Payments.
The charge for the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following
inputs:
31 December 2007
Expected volatility 23.9%
Expected Life (years) 5
Risk Free Rate 5.4%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price from
listing on 29 March 2005 to 28 February 2008. The expected life used on the model is based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural
considerations.
A risk free rate of 5.4 per cent has been used for both years, which reflects the interest rate that it is
assumed can be obtained by investing in financial instruments with no default risk.
No share options were exercised during the year.
Own shares held in trust
On 17 August 2007 the Group purchased £450,000 of its own shares. This equated to 456,496 shares with
a purchase value of 98.5p.

27. Substantial transactions
The Group has entered into various sale and leaseback transactions on the television programmes “Bad
Girls” series 2,3 and 4 and “Footballers Wives” series 1 and 2. Amounts are held on deposit accounts as a
result of these transactions and comprise money to provide for the discharge of future leasing liabilities.
The banks with which these sums are deposited have given guarantees to the lessors in respect of lease
liabilities. A liability would only crystallise upon the failure of the bank holding the deposit. This is
considered remote and therefore these balances have not been included within the Group’s balance sheet.
The amounts involved are as follows:

time to time determine in accordance with the articles of association of the Company and Chapter VII of
Part V of the Act, provided that this power shall:
(a) expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company or 15 months after the

offer or otherwise) to holders of equity securities in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the
respective numbers of equity securities held by them, subject to such exclusions or other
arrangements as the directors may deem necessary or expedient in relation to fractional entitlements

an aggregate nominal amount of £3,949
and save that the Company may make an offer or agreement before the expiry of this power which would
or might require equity securities to be allotted for cash after such expiry and the directors may allot equity
securities for cash pursuant to any such offer or agreement as if the power conferred by this resolution had
not expired.

64 APPENDIX
EXPLANATORY NOTES OF PRINCIPAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY’S
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
1. Articles which duplicate statutory provisions
Provisions in the current articles which replicate provisions contained in the Companies Act 2006 are in the
main amended to bring them into line with the Companies Act 2006.  Certain examples of such provisions
include provisions as to the form of resolutions, the variation of class rights and provisions regarding the
period of notice required to convene general meetings. The main changes made to reflect this approach are
detailed below.
2. Form of resolution
The current articles contain a provision that, where for any purpose an ordinary resolution is required, a
special or extraordinary resolution is also effective and that, where an extraordinary resolution is required, a
special resolution is also effective.  This provision is being amended as the concept of extraordinary
resolutions has not been retained under the Companies Act 2006.
3. Convening extraordinary and annual general meetings
The provisions in the current articles dealing with the convening of general meetings and the length of
notice required to convene general meetings are being amended to conform to new provisions in the
Companies Act 2006. In particular an extraordinary general meeting to consider a special resolution can be
convened on 14 days’ notice whereas previously 21 days’ notice was required.
4. Votes of members
Under the Companies Act 2006 proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands whereas under the current
articles proxies are only entitled to vote on a poll.  The time limits for the appointment or termination of a
proxy appointment have been altered by the Companies Act 2006 so that the articles cannot provide that
they should be received more than 48 hours before the meeting or in the case of a poll taken more than 48
hours after the meeting, more than 24 hours before the time for the taking of a poll, with weekends and
bank holidays being permitted to be excluded for this purpose.  Multiple proxies may be appointed provided
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share held by the shareholder.
Multiple corporate representatives may also be appointed.  The proposed articles reflect all of these new
provisions.
5. Age of directors on appointment
As a provision limiting the age at which a director can be appointed could now fall foul of the Employment
Equality (Age) Regulations 2006, the provision in the current articles providing for no retirement on account
of age is unnecessary so has been removed from the proposed articles.
6. Conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 sets out directors’ general duties which largely codify the existing law but with
some changes.  Under the Companies Act 2006, from 1 October 2008 a director must avoid a situation
where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the
company’s interests. The requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a
director of another company or a trustee of another organisation. The Companies Act 2006 allows directors
of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where the articles of
association contain a provision to this effect.  The Companies Act 2006 also allows the articles of association
to contain other provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.  The
proposed articles give the directors authority to approve such situations and to include other provisions to
allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position with respect to conflicts
arising on or after 1 October 2008.
65 There are safeguards which will apply when directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential
conflict.  First, only directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the
relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the directors must act in a way they consider, in good
faith, will be most likely to promote the company’s success. The directors will be able to impose limits or
conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
It is also proposed that the new articles should contain provisions relating to confidential information,
attendance at board meetings and availability of board papers to protect a director being in breach of duty
if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises. These provisions will only apply where the
position giving rise to the potential conflict has previously been authorised by the directors.  It is the Board’s
intention to report annually on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that the Board’s powers to authorise
conflicts are operated effectively.
7. Notice of board meetings
Under the current articles, when a director is abroad he can request that notice of directors’ meetings are
sent to him at a specified address and if he does not do so he is not entitled to receive notice while he is
away. This provision has been removed, as modern communications mean that there may be no particular
obstacle to giving notice to a director who is abroad.  It has been replaced with a more general provision that
a director is treated as having waived his entitlement to notice unless he supplies the Company with the
information necessary to ensure that he receives notice of a meeting before it takes place.
8. Directors’ indemnities and loans to fund expenditure
The Companies Act 2006 has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of a company to indemnify
directors and to fund expenditure incurred in connection with certain actions against directors. In particular,
a company that is a trustee of an occupational pension scheme can now indemnify a director against liability
incurred in connection with the company’s activities as trustee of the scheme. In addition, the existing
exemption allowing a company to provide money for the purpose of funding a director’s defence in court
proceedings now expressly covers regulatory proceedings and applies to associated companies.
9. Generally the opportunity has been taken to bring clearer language into the proposed articles and in some
areas to conform the language of the proposed articles.

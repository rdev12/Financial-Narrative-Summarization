Key figures from across Afren
Afren’s portfolio of world-class assets contains 
a balance of cash-generative producing assets, 
high cash return development projects and 
transformative high-impact exploration and 
appraisal opportunities.
These are organised into three business units: Nigeria and 
other West Africa; Afren East Africa Exploration; and the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq.
In each business unit we hold market leading positions 
among our peers and are well placed to achieve further 
growth, capitalising on our early-mover advantage and 
operational track record.

Strategic report
This represents a major opportunity for an 
agile and responsive independent like Afren 
to capitalise on its established and growing 
credentials, and act as a strategic partner 
in bringing these undeveloped assets into 
production. In addition, as pressure grows 
to optimise the development of Nigeria’s 
national hydrocarbon resources, a secondary 
asset acquisition and divestiture market 
is opening up in the country. Given our 
platform of cash-generative assets, strong 
local identity and rich resources, we are 
very well positioned to continue to grow 
our presence in the region. 
Beyond Nigeria, our West African portfolio 
includes attractive exploration acreage in 
Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Congo Brazzaville 
and South Africa across the West African 
Transform and the South Atlantic Margins. 
Nigeria’s largest  
independent E&P
From the outset a key strategic priority for 
Afren was to establish a reliable platform 
of cash-generating reserves and production 
that would enable us to build and grow the 
business in a sustainable way. 
Our entry into the region, and specifically 
Nigeria, allowed us to fulfil this objective and 
develop the necessary operating track record 
and cash flow to expand across Africa and 
the Middle East. To date, we have successfully 
delivered production from three high-quality 
Nigerian development projects (Okoro, Ebok 
and OML 26) and have built a portfolio 
of further development, appraisal and 
exploration projects across the region.
Nigeria and other West Africa remains a 
prolific oil and gas region, with proven oil 
reserves of over 53 billion bbls and proven 
gas reserves of over 204 tcf. In Nigeria alone, 
home to the majority of our West African 
portfolio, remaining reserves are assessed 
at 37 billion bbls of oil and 181 tcf of gas, 
ranking it tenth in the world for oil reserves, 
and ninth for gas reserves. 
Despite an abundance of opportunities, 
fewer than 35% of the 770 fields in Nigeria 
are currently in production. Furthermore, 
according to Wood Mackenzie, of the 
approximately 440 fields that remain 
undeveloped, about 90 contain recoverable 
reserves of between 50 to 500 million bbls. 
Most of these fields have either been licensed 
to indigenous operators or are peripheral 
within the major international oil companies’ 
portfolios, and would therefore struggle to 
access the financial and technical resources 
needed for their development.

High-impact exploration 
across the East African 
Transform Margin and  
East Africa Rift Basins
East Africa, both onshore and offshore, 
remains an under-explored region of Africa, 
with approximately 500 wells drilled, compared 
to over 7,400 wells and 9,200 wells drilled 
in West Africa and North Africa respectively. 
This has been primarily due to limited early 
exploration success in the region, which saw 
the industry divert its attention to focus on 
more easily accessible offshore opportunities 
in West Africa and onshore opportunities in 
North Africa.
However, with the rise in oil prices, and host 
governments allowing access to the region, 
there has been more activity in recent years, 
following high profile discoveries onshore 
Kenya and Uganda and offshore Tanzania and 
Mozambique. This has encouraged increased 
M&A activity in the region from large-cap 
oil companies and national oil companies 
looking to position themselves strategically 
to develop this significant resource base and 
consolidate smaller players in the region. 
According to Wood Mackenzie, the region is 
set to contribute an additional 1.4 mmboe/d 
to global oil supply by 2023.
Recognising the potential of the region 
ahead of its peers, Afren deemed 2010 
an opportune time to take an East African 
position of scale, and completed the all-share 
acquisition of Black Marlin Energy Holdings Ltd 
(Black Marlin). The acquisition afforded Afren 
an early-entry position of critical mass in East 
Africa, consistent with its original mandate 
of establishing a pan-African presence. 
The acquisition immediately expanded our 
exploration inventory by adding several 
exploration targets across multiple geological 
basins, play types that have allowed the 
Group to take advantage of its profitable 
cash generative production base in Nigeria 
and other West Africa. In 201 1, we augmented 
our position further by acquiring 74% in the 
Tanga Block, offshore north-east Tanzania, 
adjoining our Blocks L17 & L18 in Kenya. 
Our East African exploration portfolio today 
covers over 85,000 km
2
 of multiple play types 
across Cretaceous, Jurassic and Tertiary rift basins, 
in geological settings which have yielded 
significant industry discoveries in nearby 
Uganda, Sudan, Tanzania, Madagascar, 
Mozambique and Kenya. Over the last few 
years, we have significantly increased seismic 
coverage and interpretation, with a total of 
11,506 km 2D and 4,976 km
2
 3D across the 
portfolio, the largest coverage in the region. 
This has helped significantly de-risk the 
portfolio ahead of an exciting E&A 
programme that will be targeting 
1,237 mmboe in net prospective 
resources in 2014.

Early-mover advantage – 
further value to come
Kurdistan is a semi-autonomous region 
in north-west Iraq, believed to contain 
approximately 30% (c.45 billion boe) of 
Iraq’s oil reserves. It is one of the last major 
onshore exploration provinces with the 
potential to deliver abundant hydrocarbon 
resources in a low-risk geological setting 
with attractive economics. 
As an opportunity for Afren, Kurdistan is 
similar to Nigeria in that while oil has been 
discovered in abundance and plays are proven, 
political uncertainty has affected the timing 
of monetising the vast resources in the 
region. This has created an opportunity for 
smaller, agile independents to secure, appraise 
and develop assets with world-class potential, 
at low entry costs. The region is developing 
rapidly, with over 40 oil companies awarded 
production sharing contracts (PSCs) since 
2004, including four of the top ten oil majors, 
which followed Afren’s entry into the region.

ahead of the competition and leverage our 
development track record, in 201 1 Afren

acquired the Barda Rash (operated) and 
Ain Sifni (non-operated) PSCs. The acquisition, 
in line with our strategic priorities, enabled 
us to deliver independently certified net 2P 
& 2C resources at US$0.68 per 2P & 2C bbl – 
well below other regional transaction values. 
Following our entry, and as a direct result of 
our ongoing appraisal and development work, 
RPS Energy have independently reclassified 
190 mmbbls of gross 2C resources on the 
Barda Rash PSC as 2P reserves. In addition, 
the recent declaration of commerciality at 
the Simrit discovery on the Ain Sifni PSC, 
is expected to further grow our reserves 
and resources in the region. We have an 
exciting work programme in 2014 that 
will target increased production from the 
Barda Rash PSC, as well as ongoing appraisal 
work on both assets. 
Recent political developments, including 
the completion of the independent oil 
export pipeline and the inter-governmental 
gas sales agreement with Turkey, have 
provided positive impetus to the long-term 
prospects for the region and should 
encourage increased levels of investment 
and M&A activity.

 “2013 was another strong year for Afren. 
We enjoyed record revenues and cash flow 
underpinned by strong production from our 
greenfield developments offshore Nigeria. 
We continue to achieve industry-leading 
exploration success and have materially 
enhanced the business with the basin-opening 
discovery at Ogo, one of the largest discoveries 
in the world in 2013. ”
Egbert Imomoh  
Chairman
In just nine years we have made a remarkable 
transition from an AIM start-up into an 
established ‘mid-cap’ independent, through 
our ability to identify opportunities early, 
use our technical capability, and achieve 
sustainable production and reserves growth 
responsibly. With an established portfolio of 
significant scale giving us leadership across 
our three business units, we are now in a 
strong position to build on these foundations 
for the next phase of our growth. I am 
confident that we will continue to create 
significant value for our shareholders.
Exceptional exploration  
and appraisal success
For Afren, 2013 was another year of exceptional 
exploration and appraisal (E&A) achievement. 
The highlight for the year was the basin-opening 
discovery at the Ogo-1 well, located on the 
OPL 310 licence offshore Nigeria. The well 
encountered light oil and condensate rich 
gas in a four way dip closed structure and 
light oil/condensate in the syn-rift, with 
estimated P50 gross recoverable resources 
significantly ahead of pre-drilling expectations 
at 774 mmboe. The discovery at Ogo was 
one of the largest in the world in 2013, 
and the largest in Nigeria for over a decade, 
a testament to our growing exploration 
credentials. The Partners have commenced a 
detailed marine 3D seismic programme ahead 
of planned appraisal drilling. We are very 
excited about the long-term prospects for 
Ogo and the other prospects on the block.
Elsewhere, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, 
following the world-class discovery at the 
Simrit-2 well (1,509 ft of net oil pay and 
aggregate flow rates of 19,641 bopd) in 2012, 
we completed drilling on the Simrit-3 well, 
confirming the eastern extent of the Simrit 
anticline and achieved a cumulative test rate 
of 6,293 bopd. Following the declaration 
of commerciality, the Partners expect to 
submit a Field Development Plan in Q1 2014, 
and remain on-track to deliver incremental 
growth in our reserves and resources base 
in 2014. The Maqlub-1 exploration well, 
testing the high potential Maqlub structure 
on the block, is currently drilling ahead, 
and has encountered hydrocarbons in the 
Cretaceous and Jurassic reservoirs. We have 
an exciting E&A campaign planned over 
the next 12 months that will be targeting 
1,237 mmboe in net resources across 
proven petroleum systems in established 
and frontier basins.

Active portfolio management
As part of our commitment to creating 
sustainable value for shareholders, we 
constantly review and evaluate the balance 
of our portfolio to ensure an optimal 
allocation of resources and capital, targeting 
projects with the highest cash returns. 
In May 2013, we completed the acquisition 
of an additional 10.4% beneficial interest in 
First Hydrocarbon Nigeria Company Limited 
(FHN) to the original 45% interest, for a total 
consideration of some US$37 million. This 
enabled us to consolidate the holding of FHN’s 
reserves and production as a subsidiary and 
augment our existing offshore position in Nigeria 
by acquiring an attractive onshore portfolio 
of scale, with net reserves and resources of 
433 mmboe (including management estimates 
of additional 2C upside of 144 mmboe), capable 
of delivering incremental growth of 18,000 
bopd net to Afren by 2016. FHN’s portfolio 
also includes the offshore Aje field, which is 
contiguous to the OPL 310 block and which 
has previously tested at commercial rates. 
In July 2013, Afren further increased its holding 
in FHN by acquiring an additional 23.3% 
beneficial interest, increasing our effective 
holdings at the end of December 2013 to 78%. 
The acquisitions have been achieved at accretive 
multiples of under US$2.0/2P & 2C bbl, and we 
look forward to working closely with NPDC to 
further increase production and undertake an 
extensive appraisal and exploration programme 
on the portfolio. 
In August 2013, we completed the sale of our 
net interest in the CI-11 block and Lion Gas 
Plant to Petroci, realising a provisional profit 
on disposal of US$25.3 million. The assets 
have afforded Afren a stable production 
and cash-generative base, but we deemed 
them to be non core to our operations due 
to the competing capital demands of other 
higher return projects in the portfolio. Since 
acquisition, the CI-11 block and Lion Gas Plant 
have delivered net operating cash flow of 
over US$150 million. 
Record financial performance 
driven by a high-quality,  
oil-focused production  
and development base
I am delighted to report that Afren achieved 
record revenues and cash flow in 2013, 
driven by the 7.5% year-on-year growth 
in net production to 47,112 boepd and 
continued strength and stability in the oil 
price environment. We achieved record 
turnover of US$1.64 billion and generated 
operating cash flows of over US$1.22 billion.
Profit after tax of US$475 million was 
influenced by the achievement of a tax 
exemption relating to the Ebok field, largely 
offset by additional post-cost recovery 
amounts due to other participants in the field.
Our main production base, in Nigeria, 
continues to perform strongly and ahead 
of pre start-up expectations. Furthermore, 
following our successful exploration 
campaign in 2012 and 2013, we remain on 
track to commence the Okoro Further Field 
Development, Ebok North Fault Block and 
Okwok in 2014, all of which are expected 
to generate high-margin cash flow for the 
Group. These new developments, alongside 
the ongoing ramp-up in production from 
OML 26, onshore Nigeria, and the Barda Rash 
PSC, Kurdistan region of Iraq, will contribute 
towards delivering double-digit production 
growth over the next five years.
Progressive de-risking of  
a material resource base
In 2013, we achieved a 2P reserves 
replacement ratio of 201%, following the 
approval of the Okwok FDP in January 2014. 
We expect our 2014 development and E&A 
campaign to further de-risk our material 
resource base of 810 mmboe net contingent 
resources and 10,031 mmboe net prospective 
resources, as we look to move these assets 
along the value chain and so produce 
sustainable growth in organic reserves.
Well-funded and strong 
balance sheet
The Group is in a strong position, with net debt 
of US$739 million supported by a stable cash-
generative production base that we expect 
to fund our work programme. We expect 
capital expenditure for 2014 to be US$845 
million and focus both on projects with high 
cash return, and further exploration drilling.
During the year the Group successfully 
extended the maturity of its liabilities and 
lowered the cost of its debt following the 
refinancing of the Ebok facility and a tender 
offer for our Senior Secured notes, funded by 
a new bond issue with a longer term and a 
lower interest rate. We have also significantly 
improved our forward cash tax position 
following the award of a five-year tax 
exemption at the Ebok field in Nigeria from 
mid-2011 to mid-2016. The tax exemption 
at Ebok was awarded in recognition of the 
positive contribution that independents such 
as Afren in partnership with local indigenous 
operators have made to the development 
of the oil and gas sector in Nigeria. The tax 
exemption has enabled us to increase capex

at Ebok in 2014 and 2015 in line with our 
objective of allocating capital towards the 
highest cash return projects.
Also during the year, we reached agreement 
with our Partner on the Ebok field to secure 
future capital allowances and other benefits 
with a value of US$300 million. This agreement 
means the Group has secured the full benefit 
from its capital expenditure.
We continue to maintain an open-dialogue 
with the relevant authorities and during 2013 
we paid circa US$400 million in royalties and 
taxes in Nigeria.
An exceptional team  
of people
Afren’s growth and success is principally 
due to the professionalism, creativity and 
commitment of our people. To ensure we 
can attract and retain the best people, our 
remuneration is competitive, encouraging 
exceptional performance with a balance of 
short and long-term rewards, and offering 
comprehensive benefits. We continued to grow 
our team in 2013, with 58 new appointments 
taking our total workforce to 424, of whom 
the vast majority are local nationals. We will 
continue to evolve our employment practices 
and policies to ensure we are able to attract 
and retain the best talent. 
Working responsibly 
Corporate responsibility (CR) is one of the 
five strategic priorities we have identified to 
ensure we achieve our vision, objective and 
strategy. Our approach is to apply guiding 
frameworks such as those provided by the 
industry association IPIECA, to develop 
a corporate responsibility strategy tailored 
to the particular requirements of the countries 
we operate in. 
We have identified five key areas of focus 
to achieve our aim of being a responsible 
business at all times, these are – environment 
and climate change, health and safety, 
communities, business conduct and people. 
We have developed policies, systems and key 
performance indicators for each of these key 
areas. We monitor this information regularly 
at a senior level throughout the business, and 
it is a topic of discussion at Board and senior 
management meetings. 
We are in constant dialogue with shareholders 
and other stakeholders concerning our 
corporate responsibility performance; 
this information exchange is important 
to developing our approach. In the first half 
of 2014 we intend to further develop the 
corporate responsibility section of our website 
so it contains a report in line with the latest 
reporting guidelines. We also aim to develop 
our reporting through mechanisms such 
as the Carbon Disclosure Project. 
We include more information on our 
CR initiatives and performance in 2013 
on pages 62 to 73.
Effective risk management 
Monitoring and managing risks to the 
business are integral to Afren’s activities. 
We constantly identify and analyse potential 
risks that could adversely affect our ability 
to achieve our objectives and we have a 
robust and effective system for reporting 
these to the Board. We continue to 
enhance our risk management process and 
its effectiveness within the organisation, 
so we can identify all risks early and put 
mitigation measures in place, and to ensure 
we are fully equipped to deal with our 
constantly evolving operating and business 
environment. We are communicating the 
need to manage risks to all organisational 
levels, to reaffirm that everyone is 
responsible for managing risks that may 
affect their day-to-day work. 
Board changes
I am pleased to announce that we have 
strengthened our Board this year with the 
appointment of Ms Sheree Bryant, the first 
female director appointed to our Board. 
Ms Bryant, who is also a member of the 
Nomination Committee, joined in October 
2013, and brings to the Board valuable 
experience of leading and developing various 
corporate responsibility initiatives, a key 
priority as we increase our operational and 
social footprint. 
Governance
Our collective responsibility as a Board is to 
promote the long-term success of the Group, 
providing entrepreneurial leadership within the 
framework of prudent and effective controls. 
I firmly believe that high standards of corporate 
governance are central to achieving this 
success in a responsible manner that takes 
account of the interests of all our stakeholders. 
Our focus on maintaining high ethical 
standards and strong personal integrity is 
formalised in our Group Code of Business 
Conduct. This is implemented across the 
business and sets out clear expectations of how 
our employees and those who work on behalf 
of Afren should behave. The Board sets the 
tone, and works with management to establish 
these values throughout the organisation.
A clear strategy and 
a positive outlook
This time last year I wrote that Afren had 
a bright future ahead after an outstanding 
2012. We continued to make remarkable 
progress in 2013 towards our vision to be 
a leading major independent exploration 
and production company. Our excellent 
performance is due to strong leadership by 
our Chief Executive Osman Shahenshah, his 
executive colleagues and all our employees, 
who are committed to building a high-quality, 
value-driven enterprise. We are in great shape 
and gearing up for an exciting new phase 
of growth, underpinned by strong cash flows 
and financial flexibility, to optimally explore 
and develop our high quality portfolio well 
into the future.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank 
our shareholders for their continued support.

Governance Board
We are committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance 
and consider it critical for upholding 
our business integrity wherever 
we work around the world. 
The Board has been fully briefed on the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and are 
committed to complying with it.
Our governance principles
Independence 
The independence of each of the Non-Executive 
Directors is considered upon appointment, annually 
and at any other time a Director’s circumstances 
change in a way that warrants reconsideration. 
Following a review of Board composition, 
the Company has reassessed the independence 
of all its Non-Executive Directors. It regards all as 
“independent” within the meaning of the term 
as defined in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Knowledge 
Our Non-Executive Directors contribute international 
operational know-how and were chosen for their 
wide range of skills and experience. They understand 
the sectors in which we operate and have valuable 
knowledge of international capital markets. 
In addition, they bring in-depth understanding 
of the health, safety, environmental, political and 
community challenges we face.
Responsibility 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decisions. Responsibility 
for developing and implementing the Group’s 
strategic and financial objectives is delegated to 
the senior management of the Group. The roles 
of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and 
the responsibilities of Chairman and Chief Executive 
are independently defined.

Strategic report
Oil and gas analysts and forecasters,  
Groppe, Long & Littell, provide an insight  
into the economics of the oil and gas  
industry that we operate in.
Economic context
Global economic growth remained subdued 
in 2013, with GDP growth declining from 
3.2% in 2012 to an estimated 2.9% in 2013. 
This marked three consecutive years of 
decline and, in real terms, highlighted a global 
slowdown in GDP growth rate compared 
to pre-crisis levels.
This prolonged period of weakness has 
compelled the major economies to continue 
various quantitative easing measures and 
remain unconvinced of changes in the global 
economic conditions. Financial markets 
have in turn benefitted, with the FTSE 350 
index rising 16% during 2013. Stock prices 
for oil and gas producers, however, have 
collectively underperformed the broader 
index, rising only 8%, as a result of poor 
exploration success and failure to meet 
forecasted production guidance. Afren’s stock 
performance was stellar in comparison, rising 
by 23% on the back of positive exploration 
results, including the Ogo discovery offshore 
Nigeria and delivering production ahead 
of guidance.
Oil consumption in 2013 was essentially flat 
year-on-year, at 87.3 million barrels per day 
(mmbpd). Consumption in the developing 
economies rose 0.5 mmbpd, led by China. 
The increase was offset by lower consumption 
in the developed OECD nations, where oil 
demand has been steadily declining, due 
largely to the continued expansion of the 
world’s natural gas industry. 
The key factor supporting the rise in gas 
production has been higher oil prices. When 
oil was US$30 per barrel, or approximately 
US$5 per mmbtu energy equivalent, 
corresponding natural gas prices were too 
low to justify the production, liquefaction 
and transport of natural gas in most places 
around the world. However, with an oil 
price environment in excess of US$100 per 
barrel, or over US$17 per mmbtu energy 
equivalent, a level that has been maintained 
for the better part of three years, resultant 
natural gas prices have supported increased 
development and shipment in the form 
of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Crude oil prices
Benchmark Brent crude oil averaged US$108 
per barrel in 2013, slightly lower than the 
US$111 per barrel realised in 2012. The price 
was largely range-bound over the course of 
the year, having oscillated between US$100 
– US$120 per barrel. This relative stability 
masks several developments which had direct 
impacts on the oil industry in 2013.
Tightening of economic sanctions continued 
to reduce oil production in Iran through most 
of 2013. Production in Libya plunged from 
July as political instability crippled the nation’s 
oil industry. In all, geopolitical events have 
constrained oil supply by over 3 mmbpd since 
the end of 2010.
Left unchecked, these supply constraints 
would have pushed oil prices significantly 
higher. However, the outages were offset 
by increased production, primarily in Iraq, 
the United States and Saudi Arabia – which 
acts as the global swing producer.
Development of tight oil reservoirs has 
reversed the decades-long decline in 
US oil production. The application of 
proven technologies – hydraulic fracturing 
and horizontal drilling – along with higher 
oil prices, has made it possible to expand 
production from these lower grade resources. 
The rapid increase in oil production created 
logistical bottlenecks that resulted in price 
discounts for West Texas Intermediate (WTI)-
based crudes relative to Brent. The discount 
has narrowed with the addition of new 
pipeline capacity, but remains volatile 
due to the effects of refinery shutdowns, 
weather and other factors.
Most of the new US production is light oil 
and has displaced foreign imports of similar 
quality. US imports from Nigeria have fallen 
from over 1 mmbbls/d at the end of 2010, 
to less than 150 kbpd at the end of 2013. 
This shift could have pressured Brent prices 
as the Nigerian barrels sought to penetrate 
other outlets. Instead prices remained 
relatively stable, as these volumes were used 
to backfill declining North Sea output and 
the reduction in Libya’s oil production – 
both predominantly light in quality.

Market outlook
Oil consumption is forecast to remain 
relatively flat as higher oil prices have set in 
motion key structural changes. These include 
greater efficiency of use, and a reduction 
in government subsidies, in addition to the 
key shift of fuel substitution to natural gas.
At the same time, oil supply is set to expand 
significantly. Some resolution of geopolitical 
constraints is expected along with continued 
growth in North American production for 
the near term. Plans are underway to expand 
oil production in southern Iraq, from the 
current 3 mmbbls/d to over 9 mmbbls/d by 
2017 . Infrastructure requirements and political 
instability may prevent the full goal from being 
reached, but volumes are still forecast to double.
Oil production in Kurdistan, the semi-
autonomous region in northern Iraq, is 
also poised to expand. The availability of 
Production Sharing Contracts and sizeable 
reserves have attracted a range of companies, 
including large IOCs such as ExxonMobil, 
as well as smaller independents such as Afren. 
Based on the success of recent discoveries, 
the productive capacity in Kurdistan is 
forecast to triple over the next five years.
Crude oil prices could come under pressure 
during the next couple of years as supply 
looks set to outpace demand. Brent prices 
in the US$70 to US$90 per barrel range 
are forecast through to 2020. These lower 
prices will slow additions to oil supply where 
resources are more expensive to develop, 
such as the unconventional oil plays in North 
America. Areas with more competitive cost 
of supply, and therefore higher operating 
margins – such as Kurdistan and Nigeria – 
are likely to be less affected, given robust 
economics at much lower oil price thresholds. 
Africa will continue to play a key role in global 
oil production. The region saw the greatest 
expansion in exploration and development 
activity during 2013, with the number of 
drilling rigs increasing by over 25% from 
2012. Exploration in West Africa continues 
to expand, with a focus on deep-water and 
pre-salt drilling. Nigeria remains an important 
element in global oil supply and ranks in the 
top ten of worldwide proved oil reserves, 
with an estimated 37.1 billion barrels. It also 
holds Africa’s largest natural gas reserves 
at 181 trillion cubic feet.
Global natural gas consumption has been 
expanding at over 2% per year and currently 
stands at nearly 60 million barrels of oil 
equivalent per day. Substantial efforts are 
underway to help meet this growing need, 
including investment in exploration, pipelines 
and LNG. Sizeable gas discoveries in East 
Company description
Groppe, Long & Littell has been 
providing thoughtful, proven insight 
on the economics of the oil and gas 
industry since 1975. Recognising 
that markets move in discontinuous 
patterns, the firm specialises in  
forecasting major changes of direction  
based on thorough bottom-up analysis  
of supply and demand.
Africa are set to transform that region 
into a significant exporter of LNG. A new 
liquefaction plant is planned for Mozambique 
and further exploration efforts are well 
underway in neighbouring countries.
Natural gas prices remain disconnected along 
regional lines. Expansion of LNG exports is 
forecast to help narrow the imbalances over the 
longer term. The significant capital cost required 
to develop LNG is supportive of gas prices within 
an environment of strong demand growth. 
Meeting the energy challenge
Oil and natural gas currently provide over 
50% of the world’s energy needs. These 
hydrocarbons will continue to play an 
important role in the challenge of sustaining 
global development, especially in nations 
with developing economies. Global oil and 
gas markets tend to move in a discontinuous 
fashion rather than in a straight-line trend, 
driven by a number of complex factors 
that influence the industry, including 
geopolitics, economics, technology, the 
regulatory environment, and the underlying 
fundamentals of supply and demand. 
The resulting uncertainty creates challenges 
as well as opportunities for oil and gas 
companies operating in this environment.
Independent operators have an advantage 
over larger competitors in their ability to 
respond quickly to shifting market conditions. 
The most successful companies use their 
agility to harvest assets while prices are high 
or make valued acquisitions when prices are 
low. Crystallising these opportunities requires 
focus and a disciplined approach to portfolio 
management over the long term.

Strategic report
Afren’s business continues to go from strength 
to strength following a significant number 
of operational successes during 2013. Here, 
the Chief Executive Osman Shahenshah 
answers investors’ questions.
Osman Shahenshah  
Chief Executive and Founder
How would you summarise 
Afren’s performance in 2013?
2013 was another exceptional year for Afren, 
and a continued validation of our business 
model and growth strategy. We have 
achieved record results and performed well 
against the KPIs and Performance metrics 
we use to assess the strength of our business. 
Our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for the period 
was 23%, representing an upper quartile 
performance compared to the FTSE 350 
Oil & Gas Index, a significant achievement 
given the ongoing market turbulence, and 
the net equity outflows in the E&P sector. 
It is worth noting that since listing in 2005, 
we have achieved a TSR of 746%, significantly 
outperforming both the FTSE 350 Oil & Gas 
and FTSE All Share indices. 
A number of factors enable Afren’s continued 
success. While we have assembled a world-
class portfolio of assets, we have also invested 
in making sure we have the right people to 
manage and operate them. We also prioritise 
long-term relationships with local Partners, host 
communities and governments, ahead of short-
term gains. With a record of project delivery, 
strategic acquisitions and maturing exploration 
credentials, we are well placed to continue 
to create significant value for our shareholders.
What were the year’s 
operational highlights?
There have been a number of significant 
highlights this year. Of particular note is the 
continued E&A success. We achieved industry-
leading exploration success and a 2P reserves 
replacement ratio in 2013 of 201 %, a testament 
to our ability to grow organic reserves and de-risk 
our opportunity-rich portfolio. 
In Nigeria, the basin-opening discovery at Ogo 
was one of the largest in the world in 2013 
and the largest in Nigeria for over a decade. 
P50 gross recoverable resources at the field are 
estimated to be 774 mmboe, significantly larger 
than our pre-drill estimates of 202 mmboe. 
We plan to drill an appraisal well in the second 
half of 2014, ahead of a planned development. 
We also enjoyed significant exploration and 
appraisal success in Kurdistan, with the Simrit-2

encountered hydrocarbons in the Cretaceous 
and Jurassic reservoirs. Early results from our 
ongoing multi-well E&A drilling campaign have 
been encouraging, and we have multiple wells 
planned over the remainder of the year targeting 
1,237 mmboe of net prospective resources.
2013 was also a year of strong production 
growth, which has led to record financial 
results for the Group. The combined 
performance of our producing assets yielded 
a year-on-year net production growth of 
7.5% to 47,1 12 boepd, at the top end of 
our 2013 guidance. Our main producing 
assets in Nigeria, the Ebok and Okoro fields, 
offshore Nigeria, continue to perform ahead 
of expectations and we remain on track to 
ramp up production from the Barda Rash PSC, 
Kurdistan region of Iraq, and OML 26, onshore 
Nigeria. Our discoveries in 2012 and 2013 have 
laid the foundations for an exciting phase of 
development that will ensure Afren delivers 
double-digit growth over the next five years.
How do you view the 
balance of the portfolio?
Balance is a very important concept. We believe 
our portfolio offers an attractive mix of near, 
medium and long-term growth opportunities, 
spanning the full E&P value chain. It is this 
balance which differentiates us from our 
peers and which has enabled us to establish 
a leading position across each of our main 
areas of operation. Our growth ambitions 
are underpinned by a disciplined approach 
to financial management and capital allocation. 
How would you characterise 
Afren’s exploration strategy?
We have constructed our exploration 
portfolio around play-based themes, with 
an emphasis on blending exposure across:
•  Low-risk opportunities that are quick 
to monetise, in and around our major 
production and development areas in the 
Niger delta and the Kurdistan region of Iraq
•  Moderate-risk, proven-play concepts that 
offer significant upside along the West 
African Transform Margin and other parts 
of the region
•  Higher-risk, play-opening opportunities 
in the rift and coastal basins of East Africa.
We believe that technical maturity of an 
asset is key to reducing risk and uncertainty, 
and we use available technologies and data 
to minimise pre-drill risks and maximise our 
chance of a successful drilling outcome. 
We also look to manage our portfolio 
from a risk/reward perspective, and will 
consider farm-in and farm-out opportunities 
as appropriate.
What are your current 
objectives for the  
Ogo discovery?
We are aiming for further appraisal 
drilling in the second half of 2014, and in 
preparation for this we will gather additional 
3D marine seismic to augment our existing 
seismic database. The discovery at Ogo has 
significantly increased Afren’s net prospective 
resource and provides a platform to develop 
a major new production hub in a previously 
under-developed region of the West African 
Transform Margin. We are excited about the 
prospects for Ogo and the neighbouring 
OML 113 field, which we will also be drilling 
this year, and look forward to working with 
our Partners in realising the potential of this 
significant discovery. 
How do you see the 
East Africa portfolio 
changing?
East Africa remains an exciting region for 
Afren. Since assembling the portfolio we have 
successfully acquired and interpreted over 
11,500 km of 2D seismic, 4,976 km
2
 of 3D 
seismic and 25,580 km of gravity-magnetic 
data. The results of this work have enabled us 
to increase our net prospective resources from 
2,113 mmboe to 8,501 mmboe, representing 
a fourfold increase since acquisition. Following 
a period of evaluation at Block 10A, Kenya, 
the Partners elected to relinquish the acreage 
in late 2013. We have matured ready-to-drill 
prospects on the Tanga block in Tanzania 
and L17/L18 and Block 1 in Kenya, which 
we expect to drill in 2014.

What do you see as your 
main challenges?
There is intensified pressure on the price of 
oil, mainly due to expansion in US oil and gas 
production, and continued political unrest in 
the Middle East. This remains a factor, though 
the jurisdictions we operate in and sell to 
have continued to see high demand, and 
sales remain strong. To mitigate the effects 
of negative oil price movements, we maintain 
an active hedging strategy, described in the 
Financial Review. Furthermore, the benefits 
of operating in favourable economic 
environments mean our projects could 
continue to break even, at significantly lower 
oil price levels.
Another major challenge is operating 
an international company, which means 
exposure to local political change. Managing 
this issue remains a high priority, and we 
ensure all parties we work with pay close 
attention to it. We are also committed 
to complying to the highest standards of 
governance and we will continue to work 
to achieve the high standards expected 
of a large mid-cap oil company. 
Will you continue to make 
acquisitions in 2014?
Well, the key here is our quest to maximise 
shareholder value. While we continue to add 
resources and reserves organically, we always 
consider new opportunities if we can see 
clear potential at an attractive price, and if 
they fit with our strategic objectives. Our 
acquisitions to date illustrate our forward-
thinking approach, and ability to enter new 
territories ahead of peers.
What were the recent key 
corporate responsibility 
highlights for the business? 
Corporate responsibility matters are a very 
important aspect of our business and directly 
linked to our licence to operate. We are 
always looking for ways to improve our 
approach and performance. For example, 
at our Ebok field, we recently began injecting 
gas back into the ground rather than flaring 
it. We’re looking at ways of extending this 
initiative around the business. 
As for business conduct, we believe the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
(EITI) is important as it encourages 
transparency of revenues and transactions 
between host governments and natural 
resource companies. Consequently, we have 
decided to become a corporate supporter 
of the organisation. 
We also continue to work closely with local 
communities to encourage the sharing of 
economic wealth and the building of local 
capacity. Our community relations teams are 
involved in a wide range of education, health 
and job creation initiatives. You can find 
information about these on our website.
What steps are you taking to 
ensure the highest standards 
of corporate governance?
We will continue to improve our standards of 
governance. This year, we have strengthened 
the Board with the appointment of 
Ms Sheree Bryant who brings to the Board 
a balanced and unique perspective on 
corporate responsibility and community 
development, as we look to expand our 
footprint across Africa and the Middle East.
What is Afren’s growth 
strategy in the medium term?
Our targets to 2015 remain those we 
set out in 2011, and we are well on our 
way to achieving these, as shown in the 
table opposite. Essentially our strategy is 
to continue to grow our presence in the 
main areas of our activity, while ensuring 
we deploy capital in the most efficient way 
in relation to our full business cycle, and 
optimising our production and development 
operations for maximum value. Technically, 
in that time frame from 2012-2015, 
we set out to discover 250 mmboe of net 
recoverable 2P & 2C reserves and resources 
from our forward exploration drilling 
programme; to maintain valuation discipline 
by targeting 2P & 2C additions at a cost 
of under US$4/bbl; and to progressively 
evolve a significant portion of our existing 
2C resource base into the 2P reserves 
category. All this activity is underpinned 
by aiming for the highest standards of 
governance and by continually improving 
our CR performance. 
It is evident that Afren made significant 
progress toward its business objectives, 
during the period, and we have carried 
this momentum into 2014.
What will the Company’s 
main focus be in 2014?
In simple terms, we will continue to create 
exceptional shareholder value using our 
technical and financial strengths. Our drilling 
success over the past two years has created 
a unique opportunity set from which 
we can organically grow production and 
cash flows. Accordingly, we have a busy 
work programme planned for 2014, both 
in development and in exploration and 
appraisal. I am confident that Afren has the 
right team, the right approach, and the right 
assets and funding in place to continue our 
record of delivering operational success and 
creating significant shareholder value.

Business target Progress in 2013 Outlook for 2014
Continue to grow Afren’s 
presence in our main 
areas of activity and 
geological plays.
We are an established leading independent oil 
producer in Nigeria and a leading industry participant 
in East Africa and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. 
We have 25 assets in 10 countries.
We continue to build upon the successes we  
have achieved in each of our three business units, 
through our operational expertise and our  
partner relationships. 
Progressively convert a 
significant portion of our 
existing 2C resource base 
into 2P reserves.
We achieved net 2P reserves growth of 34.1 mmbbls 
in the year following the successful E&A campaign at 
Okwok and extension of cost recovery at Ebok. This 
has resulted in a 2P reserves replacement ratio in 
2013 of 201%. 
In addition to the approval expected on the FDP 
submitted on OML 26, we recently submitted a 
declaration of commerciality on Ain Sifni. These are 
expected to further grow our reserves and resources 
base in 2014. 
Discover 250 mmboe of 
net recoverable 2P & 2C 
reserves and resources 
from our forward 
exploration drilling 
programme by 2015.
We achieved a world-class exploration success 
in 2013. This is attributable to the three significant 
discoveries in Nigeria and the Kurdistan region of 
Iraq. Our discovery in Nigeria has organically added 
net 2P reserves of 26.4 mmbbls. Since 2012, 
we have successfully added 73.1 mmbbls of net 2P 
& 2C reserves and resources and are well on our way 
to achieve our target of 250 mmboe net recoverable 
2P & 2C reserves and resources by 2015.
In 2014 we will target 1,237 mmboe of net 
prospective resources. This is in adherence to our 
strategy of focusing on:
•  Exploration in proven areas which are low risk and 
easy to monetise (Ebok in Nigeria and Barda Rash 
in the Kurdistan region of Iraq).
•  Moderate-risk proven plays that offer significant 
upside (OPL 310 in Nigeria).
•  Higher-risk, play-opening opportunities 
in East Africa (Tanga in Tanzania, Block 1 in Kenya). 
Grow production  
year-on-year.
Like-for-like net production in 2013 increased by 
7.5% to 47,1 12 boepd. This was at the upper end 
of our production guidance.
Following cost recovery on Ebok, we expect net 
production in 2014 to average approximately 
40,000 boepd. 
Manage and optimise 
our production and 
development operations 
to maximise the value 
of the business.
Production at the Ebok field increased by 16% 
year-on-year and at Okoro field increased by 7%.  
At Okoro, production operations have run seamlessly 
in 2013, with significant progress being made 
on the Okoro Further Field Development. At Ebok,  
three production wells were brought on stream 
in record time. 
In 2014 we are looking to build on our strong 
operating base at Ebok and Okoro. Having reached 
cost recovery on two greenfield developments they 
are now self-funding and able to generate 
sustainable long-term value for shareholders.
Ensure available capital 
is deployed in the most 
efficient way and to suit 
our full cycle business 
requirements. 
Capital expenditure in 2013 was in line with  
guidance at US$716 million, and balanced across  
our production, development, appraisal and 
exploration activities.
Capital expenditure for 2014 is expected to be 
approximately US$845 million and focuses both  
on high cash return projects and further  
exploration drilling.
Continually improve 
CR performance.
We performed exceptionally well in 2013, achieving, 
and in some cases exceeding, our targets.
We intend in 2014 to significantly enhance our 
reporting on corporate responsibility issues, 
recognising the increasing interest from our 
stakeholders in these matters.  Afren plc

How we are organised 
At Afren, we aim to be a responsible 
and transparent business. The Board 
has established a management structure 
with defined lines of responsibility and 
clear delegation of authority. The various 
committees are key elements of the overall 
control structure. The Group has developed 
a formal business planning process, which 
operates on an annual cycle. The Board 
approves the consolidated annual budget, 
and budget performance is monitored and 
reported to the Board.
We identify and assess the key risks to our 
strategy in the context of our business plans, 
and functional and line managers monitor 
and act upon the risk registers generated. 
The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board 
is then regularly updated of the progress in 
implementing the risk management systems, 
and takes steps to mitigate significant 
business risks.

We create value by pursuing a clear and consistent strategy 
that aims to achieve a balance between exploration, appraisal 
and development investment, with funding from production 
and capital financing. To do this successfully and sustainably, 
our business model is supported by a meticulous planning and 
financial management process. This focuses on achieving specific 
‘milestones’ within projects, and ensuring we adhere to high 
standards of governance, corporate and social responsibility.
In addition, as part of our ongoing portfolio management process, 
we continually review and look to optimise our portfolio through 
farm-outs and strategic divestments. This allows us to mitigate 
risk and introduce new Partners with complementary skills. 
It also generates cash flow to re-invest in our growth strategy, 
and supports a range of funding options to ensure we maintain 
a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.

Strategic report
Our vision is to be the 
leading independent 
upstream exploration 
and production (E&P) 
company in each area 
we operate in. 
This is underpinned by a clear and consistent 
strategy – one designed to provide sustainable 
long-term growth across the E&P value chain 
through balanced funding, exploration and 
production in our main areas of operation 
– Nigeria and other West Africa, Afren 
East Africa Exploration and the Kurdistan 
region of Iraq.
To fulfil our strategy, we have identified 
five clear priorities focusing on running 
our business, and growing efficiently 
and responsibly.
Strategic priorities KPIs Risk 
Portfolio management 
Our opportunistic entrepreneurial approach has enabled us to be successful 
in accessing low cost reserves. We have been consistent in achieving low entry 
costs by seizing the early-mover advantage and focusing on areas where 
we have a strategic and competitive advantage.
We focus on areas where:
•  there are proven working hydrocarbon systems
•  opportunities have been overlooked, under-developed or may be out of reach 
to much larger companies
•  we have an in-depth understanding of the subsurface, key relationships 
or local structure we can use to our advantage.
During the year we increased our holding in First Hydrocarbon Nigeria Company 
Limited by 31.3%. The acquisition has established a large onshore presence, 
grown our material reserves and resources, and established a solid production 
platform to continue to grow.

Effective portfolio management is a critical task that seeks to mitigate the risks associated 
with the various assets within the portfolio either to access attractive opportunities 
through acquisition or to divest where, for example, exploration or operating risks are 
deemed unacceptable. Acquisitions and divestments are the subject of detailed risk 
assessments in the same way as for other projects and cover issues such as geology, 
reservoir, production facilities, financial exposure and, where relevant, wider aspects  
such as the integration of people and management systems. 
For more information see: P30
Reserves growth 
We place great emphasis on achieving exploration and appraisal success, as this 
is integral to creating value for our shareholders. Our dedicated E&A team 
is responsible for identifying exploration ideas, prioritising our prospect 
inventory, ensuring efficient deployment of capital and executing our exploration 
and drilling activities.
Our exploration strategy is play led and balanced across key themes:
•  Exploration in proven areas, which are low risk and quick to monetise
• Proven play concepts that offer significant upside, with moderate risk
•  Higher-risk frontier areas with play-opening possibilities and potential large rewards.
In 2013, our exploration and appraisal campaign yielded remarkable results, 
with the play-opening discovery in OPL 310, offshore Nigeria, one of the largest 
discoveries in the world last year and the successful drilling and testing results 
on the Ain Sifni and Barda Rash PSCs, Kurdistan region of Iraq. Our E&A success 
has resulted in net 2P reserves addition of 34.1 mmbbls and a 2P reserves 
replacement ratio for 2013 of 201%.

Production growth 
The growth in our production platform has enabled us to generate high-margin 
predictable cash flows for the Group, which in turn has enhanced our financial 
flexibility to undertake our work programme efficiently. 
In 2013, our production was at the upper end of guidance, having achieved 
an average net production 47,112 boepd – representing a increase of 7.5% 
(excluding discontinued operations in Côte d’Ivoire) from the previous year.
With a net 2P & 2C recoverable reserves and resources total of over a billion 
barrels, the vast majority of which has yet to be developed and brought into 
production, we have a sustainable platform for long-term growth.

Production operations come with a wide range of risks, both subsurface, associated 
with reservoir and well performance, and above ground in respect of the processing, 
storage and export of oil. We have complex systems in place to mitigate these various 
risks, such as our EHSS management system, well planning and engineering and reservoir 
modelling. Critical to mitigating risks in this area are our close working relations with our 
key contractors providing drilling, operations and maintenance services.

Operational efficiency  
and financial discipline
We have effective operational and financial management processes which place 
emphasis on delivery, safety and efficient allocation of capital. As an agile 
independent company, we employ a range of funding sources, including debt, 
equity, operating cash flow and portfolio management.
We continue to have strong operating cash flow and a well-funded balance 
sheet. At 31 December 2013, we had US$1.22 billion of operating cash flow 
and net debt (excluding finance leases) of US$739 million.

by carrying out detailed project risk assessments. Financial discipline has traditionally 
been one of the main focuses of business risk management and is deeply embedded 
in our culture.

Definition
Our share of oil and gas production during the year. 
Relevance
An indicator of our production growth from existing 
assets, and the impact of organic and acquired reserves 
growth on production in the year. 
Progress
Net production has been primarily influenced by increased 
production from the Ebok and Okoro fields in Nigeria. 
In July 2013 Afren commenced preliminary crude oil sales 
from the Barda Rash PSC. Gross production at the field 
averaged 639 bopd during 2013. 
Outlook
The Group maintains a strong base from which it will 
continue to produce in 2014, whilst continuing the 
development of the Ebok (and after taking into account 
the effect of cost recovery in 2014), Okoro, Okwok, 
OML 26 and Barda Rash assets to achieve production 
growth going forward.  
Risk management
The in-depth geological understanding of our assets and 
close monitoring and planning of production performance 
helps us guard against unplanned interruptions and 
to maximise production.

Relevance
An indicator of our ability to replenish reserves through 
the success of our E&A programme.  
Progress
Our successful E&A campaign at Okwok has resulted in 
net 2P additions in the year of 26.4 mmbbls. In addition, 
the extension to cost recovery at Ebok has increased net 
entitlement by 8 mmbbls. 
Outlook
The ongoing E&A campaign at Ain Sifni, Kurdistan region 
of Iraq and at OPL 310, offshore Nigeria is expected 
to further grow our reserves resources base in 2014. 
Risk management
Exploration risks are managed through our wide portfolio 
of assets, with each asset being subject to rigorous peer 
review and detailed evaluation of prospects. In addition, 
the Directors will continue to consider materially accretive 
acquisitions to supplement organic reserves growth, 
if deemed appropriate.

 Risk management process
Peter Bingham,  
Chairman of Audit and Risk Committee
 “ Strong risk management processes 
are critical to our future success 
and are integral to our way of 
doing business.”
 Risk management process
Strengthening risk 
management to improve 
business performance
In 2013 we completed three major 
initiatives to further strengthen Afren’s 
risk management practices. First, Afren 
established an internal audit function to work 
closely with the Audit and Risk Committee, 
to provide assurance that we have established 
and implemented business controls in the 
key risk areas. In establishing audit plans, 
we will prioritise work by level of risk, and so 
the business risk and internal audit function 
will work closely, particularly in ensuring 
that effective controls are in place in areas 
of high risk. 
Continuing from 2012, the second initiative 
was a detailed examination of field delivery 
risk and exploration risk, the key operational 
risks. A small multi-disciplinary team carried 
out the work, which included internal audit 
and an assessment of the main components 
of field delivery risk – drilling, development 
projects and production operations. Within 
each area they looked in more detail at 
specific risk areas such as organisation 
and competence, planning, contracting 
and procurement, financial controls and 
operational execution. They did the same 
for exploration risk. For each specific risk 
they recorded the controls in place following 
industry best practice, and noted any KPIs 
used for monitoring performance. The review 
provided assurance to the Audit and Risk 
Committee that the business functions are 
adopting appropriate controls for the Group’s 
exposure in these areas. As a follow up they 
will be auditing specific controls to ensure 
they are implemented to suitable breadth 
and depth.
The third key initiative was to conduct 
an internal audit on the business risk 
management function within Afren. This 
compared Afren’s risk management process 
with recognised national and international 
standards and then checked if the system 
was implemented by the documented 
procedure. The audit concluded that the 
existing procedure compared favourably 
with the most prominent risk management 
standards (UK Institute of Risk Management 
and the International Risk Management 
Standard ISO 31000:2009). The audit made 
several recommendations for consistent 
implementation of the business risk 
management system. We are currently 
addressing these with help and advice 
from KPMG’s Enterprise Risk Management 
team. We intend to have completed the 
recommendations by mid 2014. 
We continued to monitor the risks to the 
business closely during 2013, with the 
main focus remaining on the effective 
execution of exploration and production 
operations. This will carry on into 2014 with 
the installation and commissioning of new 
facilities in Ebok and Okwok, development 
work at Okoro, consolidation of our 
operations in Kurdistan, and the start of 
exploration drilling in East Africa. In 2014, 
we will continue to monitor and assess the 
emerging risk landscape including the critical 
areas of business conduct, anti-bribery  
and corruption.

Risk management roles and responsibilities
Board The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk management. This responsibility encapsulates an understanding of the key 
risks, recognition and oversight of the measures in place to manage risks and acceptance of the residual risks. Any areas 
where the Board is uncomfortable with the risk exposure are investigated further, to ensure that either additional controls 
are implemented to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, or if not possible, that the activities giving rise to the risk are 
curtailed. 
Audit and Risk 
Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee oversees the business risk management system and regularly reviews the corporate risk 
register, to ensure it reflects the key risk areas of the business and that controls are in place to mitigate risks. The other 
important role of the Committee is to ensure we audit key controls as necessary, to provide assurance that they are 
effective in mitigating risk.
Executive 
Directors
The Executive Directors are responsible for ensuring they fully understand the key risks within their remit and that 
mitigating measures are in place. The Chief Executive is generally responsible for strategic risks, with the Chief Operating 
Officer overseeing the majority of the field delivery and exploration risks and those associated with environment, safety, 
community and security. The Group Financial Director is responsible for finance-related risks including treasury 
management, taxation and hedging.
Business unit 
and asset 
managers
Within Afren’s operating business units, risk management is everyone’s responsibility, but particular responsibilities 
lie with the business unit and asset managers. They should ensure the specific country and asset risks are communicated 
effectively to both the local workforce, who then implement the mitigating measures, and to senior management, 
to ensure risks are appropriate for the corporate strategy and risk appetite. 
Risk manager The Risk manager is responsible for maintaining and implementing the business risk management system. The role involves 
reviewing and updating the risk management procedures and supporting the business to refresh and review their risks 
regularly. The manager works with the risk owners to ensure new and emerging risks are identified and reported to the 
Audit and Risk Committee in regular updates on business risks.
Audit manager The Audit manager is responsible for the independent monitoring and assessment of internal controls based on the 
business risk profile. This involves preparation of a risk based Annual Plan, providing an independent review of business 
activities making recommendations to improve the internal control framework, and contributing to the development of risk 
and controls awareness throughout the organisation. The Audit manager reports directly to the Audit and Risk Committee.

During 2013 we have continued to monitor and review 
the following principal risks and uncertainties relating 
to the Group’s business performance.
Key risk Description and impact How we manage it
KPI/Performance 
metric Strategic priorities Responsibility See also Change Assessment
Operational risk
Field delivery risk 
•  Field delivery risk applies to all phases of the E&P cycle from seismic 
acquisition through to production operations. At each phase the 
mitigating measures will be different. However, failure to control risks 
will lead to project delays, cost over-runs, high production costs, early 
field decommissioning and, ultimately, lower than expected reserves.
•  In 2013, development continued at our producing assets in Nigeria and 
Kurdistan, with significant drilling campaigns in Ebok and Barda Rash, 
and the engineering and fabrication of the new Ebok Central Fault Block 
extension platform.
•  During 2014, we will closely manage the installation, hook-up and 
commissioning of the new Ebok facilities, to ensure safe operations and 
to minimise any impact on production.
•  All operations are subject to risk reviews, to identify as early as possible 
any potential risks to success. 
•  Our engineers analyse results from appraisal and development 
wells, and determine the appropriate course of action for the drilling 
programme and facility design. 
•  We closely monitor all projects to ensure they go to plan and so we can 
take action to maintain progress. 
•  We monitor project finances alongside their budget to minimise 
over-runs. 
•  We monitor production operations closely to ensure we minimise 
unplanned downtime and control operating costs tightly.
•  We compare actual production regularly to forecast production.
•  Net effective working

•  Capital expenditure
•  Operating cost per barrel

Field delivery risks in 
2014 will remain high 
as a consequence of 
the installation and 
commissioning of the new 
Ebok and Okwok facilities.
High
Exploration failure
•  Exploration activities can be capital intensive and may involve a high 
degree of risk. Sustained exploration failure will affect the Group’s 
growth potential.
•  In 2013, we achieved world-class exploration success. The highlight of 
the year was the discovery at Ogo, offshore Nigeria, the third largest 
discovery in 2013.
•  Exploration assets are subject to a rigorous peer review process.
•  We evaluate exploration risk for each prospect by looking in detail 
at how to de-risk the key elements of the subsurface data, source 
rock, reservoir, trapping and seal mechanisms. We subsequently rank 
prospects and approve budgets.
•  Reserves replacement ratio

Medium
Environmental or  
safety incidents 
•  As Afren’s activities continue to expand there is a continuing focus 
on preventing major pollution or loss of life due to failure of systems, 
equipment or human action. 
•  We have implemented comprehensive EHSS management systems 
based on best industry practice, at both corporate and country 
level, with an annual independent audit programme to ensure 
effective implementation.

socio-economic and legal uncertainties.
•  2013 has seen political tensions in all of the areas in which we operate 
and these continue to be closely monitored to minimise the impact 
on our operations.
•  Disputes between the Iraqi and Kurdistan authorities over licences 
and oil exports continue to pose uncertainties for all E&P companies 
operating in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
•  Through close liaison in each relevant country, we monitor the situation 
from the perspective of our safety and security.
• Contingency plans in place and tested regularly.
•  Through our contacts in governments and industry, as well as

The timing of liftings led to a decrease in 
crude oil stock at the year end, therefore 
resulting in a charge for stock adjustment 
of US$9 million, compared with a credit 
of US$7 million at 31 December 2012. 
Movements in overlift and underlift 
balances resulted in a credit to cost of 
sales of US$33 million, compared to a 
charge of US$26 million in 2012, reflecting 
the movement from an overlift to 
underlift position. 
The Group achieved a normalised operating 
cost of US$14.0/boe. The decrease from 
2012 (US$15.6/boe) reflects efficiencies 
generated from increased production at 
Ebok and Okoro. Normalised cost per barrel 
excludes costs and production from the 
Barda Rash field and certain one-off expenses 
(including fees in respect of certain licence 
arrangements and the costs of projects 
which are not directly related to production 
operations) and DD&A. All other field costs 
are included on an annualised basis. 
Tax
An income tax credit for the year of 
US$157 million (2012: income tax charge 
of US$380 million) includes changes arising 
from the award of a five-year tax exemption 
obtained by the company holding the Ebok 
asset. The tax credit includes reversal of prior 
year current tax and deferred tax provisions 
of US$381 million, following the receipt of 
confirmation that the tax exemption will 
apply from mid-2011 to mid-2016.
The effective tax rate for the Group’s other 
producing assets remained consistent with 2012. 
1. Result for the year  
Strategic alignment
    
Revenues
Revenue for 2013 was US$1,644 million, 
an increase of 4.6% from 2012 (2012: 
US$1,571 million). The increase arises 
principally from increased production from 
the Ebok field, which contributed US$1,320 
million compared to US$1,154 million in 2012. 
Working interest production for the year was 
approximately 47,112 boepd, compared to 
43,830 boepd in 2012, principally driven by 
the year-on-year increase in net production 
from the Ebok and Okoro fields. 
In 2013, the Group realised an average 
oil price of US$106/bbl (2012: US$108/
bbl), before all royalties. The average Brent 
price for the period was US$108/bbl (2012: 
US$111/bbl).
Gross profit
Gross profit from continuing operations for 
the year was US$643 million, a decrease of 
19% on the prior year (2012: US$791 million), 
the decrease principally reflecting provisions 
made for residual net profit interest due on 
our fields.
The DD&A charge for oil and gas assets, 
which reflects levels of production and 
estimates of future capital commitments, was 
US$404 million, an increase of 7% on the 
prior year (2012: US$377 million).

Profit for the year
Profit before tax from continuing operations 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 
was US$318 million (2012: US$569 million). 
Normalised profit before tax from continuing 
operations was US$483 million (2012: 
US$637 million). Normalised profit before tax 
is reconciled to statutory profit before tax in 
note 2.4 of the financial statements. 
The impairment charge on oil and gas assets 
of US$61 million (2012: US$15 million) relates 
to the write-off of costs of Kenya Block 10A, 
which is to be relinquished, and the Group’s 
share of the cost of Kola-1 and Kola-2 wells 
at La Noumbi, which were drilled during 
the year and assessed as commercially 
unsuccessful. A further impairment has been 
charged in relation to La Noumbi following 
the partnership’s agreement to a 50% 
relinquishment on the block.
Profit for the year is also stated after the 
recognition of US$27 million loss from 
joint ventures, which principally relates to 
the impairment of Afren’s interest in JDZ 
following the decision to withdraw our 
participation from the JDZ Block 1.
In addition, the Group pays other taxes, in 
the form of royalties, withholding taxes and 
non-recoverable VAT, locally in the areas in 
which it operates. In 2013, these amounted 
to US$419 million (2012: US$249 million), 
as detailed in the table on page 36.
Finance charges and financial instruments
Finance costs for 2013 were US$157 million 
(2012: US$91 million). US$49 million of the 
increase in finance charges relates to the 
cost of the partial repurchase of the 2016 
and 2019 Bonds which was completed in 
December 2013. The repurchase was funded 
by the issue of US$360 million 2020 Bonds, 
with a coupon of 6.625%, which reduces 
the expected future Group borrowing costs. 
The Group capitalised US$42 million of 
finance charges in the year, largely relating 
to the development of the Barda Rash field 
which has been financed using part of the 
Group’s Bond proceeds (2012: US$59 million).
During the year the Group recognised a 
loss from derivative financial instruments 
of US$47 million (2012: US$60 million). 
US$31 million of the loss related to crude oil 
hedging contracts, which comprises a realised 
loss of US$42 million relating to the premiums 
paid on the hedging instruments and 
unrealised gains of US$11 million reflecting 
the position on these hedging instruments 
compared with the oil price outlook as 
at 31 December 2013 (2012: realised 
loss of US$40 million, unrealised loss of 
US$20 million). A further mark to market loss 
of US$15 million was recorded, relating to an 
interest rate swap which swaps a proportion 
of our fixed rate debt into floating rate by 
linking interest payments to the performance 
of certain indices.

3. Development, appraisal  
and exploration activities
Strategic alignment
    
Exploration and appraisal
The Group’s investment in exploration and 
appraisal activities has continued during 
2013, with expenditure of US$260 million in 
the period (2012: US$189 million, excluding 
amounts relating to the Okoro Further Field 
Development which were transferred to 
development assets in the year).
As shown in the chart below, the main areas 
of expenditure were Nigeria (mainly US$62 
million on Okwok, and US$72 million on 
OPL310 where the Ogo-1 well was drilled), 
and Ain Sifni in the Kurdistan region of Iraq 
(US$44 million). Exploration outside of these 
areas related to ongoing seismic and pre-
drilling studies across the Group’s East African 
exploration portfolio. 
As noted previously, write-offs in respect 
of unsuccessful exploration costs were 
incurred in respect of two wells drilled on 
the La Noumbi licence in Congo Brazzaville. 
Cumulative costs incurred on Kenya Block 
10A were also written-off, along with the 
Group’s investment in the JDZ Block 1 joint 
venture, following the decision to relinquish 
the Group’s interest in these blocks. 
Development expenditure 
Expenditure on oil and gas assets was 
US$457 million (2012: US$276 million), 
comprising the continuing development 
of the Ebok and Okoro fields and Barda Rash. 
An additional US$108 million of payments 
due to Partners were capitalised relating to 
securing agreement for the Okoro Further 
Field Development and a package of related 
benefits to be spread over the life of the 
project. Payments for these costs will be 
spread over a number of years, starting 
late 2014.
Financing
In December 2013, the Group successfully 
completed a third Bond issue, facilitating an 
extension of the maturity of its liabilities and 
reducing the cost of its debt. The proceeds 
from the new issue were US$360 million, 
before issue costs, and were used to repay 
US$246.6 million of the 2016 Bonds and 
US$50 million of the 2019 bonds. The 
coupon on the new 2020 Bond is 6.625%, a 
significantly lower rate than on the 2016 and 
2019 Bonds. All three Bonds in issue are listed 
on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. 
Gross debt at 31 December 2013 was 
US$1,129 million which includes the 2016, 
2019, and 2020 Bonds, the Ebok reserve-
based lending facility, and other corporate 
facilities, excluding finance leases (2012: 
US$1,160 million).
Loan repayments in the period, excluding 
payments in respect of finance leases, were 
US$510.4 million reflecting part settlement 
of the 2016 and 2019 Bonds, early 
redemption of the FHN convertible loan 
note (US$62.5 million), repayment of the 
FHN acquisition and development facility 
(US$101.3 million), and repayment of the 
Group corporate facility (US$50.0 million). 
Cash at bank at 31 December 2013 was 
US$389.9 million, resulting in net debt 
(excluding finance leases) of US$739.2 million 
(2012: cash of US$598.7 million; net debt 
of US$561.3 million). 
Financing outlook
In February 2014, the Group refinanced its 
OML 26 facility and replaced it with a new 
US$100 million facility.
2. Financing and  
capital structure 
Strategic alignment
    
Operating cash flow
Operating cash flow before movements 
in working capital was US$1,005 million 
(2012: US$1,108million). After movements 
in working capital, which included advances 
and payments to Partners, and tax payments 
of US$58 million (2012: US$12 million), net 
cash generated by operating activities was 
US$1,216 million (2012: US$974 million).
The Group’s strong operating cash flow is 
driven by annual production from Ebok and 
Okoro. This cash has principally been used 
to fund the Group’s continued investment 
in its development, exploration and appraisal 
activities, and the acquisition of additional 
equity in FHN. 
On achievement of the five-year tax exemption 
relating to the Ebok field, we agreed to make 
a payment of US$300 million in order to 
amend the structure of our partnership on the 
asset. This payment helped to secure additional 
cost recovery and future tax benefits relating 
to the rights to available capital allowances.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013 39
4. Our commitments 
Strategic alignment
    
The Group has operating and capital 
commitments as at 31 December 2013 of 
US$781 million (2012: US$716 million), largely 
in respect of rig and field equipment leases, 
and the Group’s ongoing exploration and 
evaluation programmes. 
6. Outlook
 
Strategic alignment
    
After taking into account the effect of cost 
recovery at Ebok in 2014, which will result in 
a decreased net equity share of production 
from the field, the Group will continue to 
look to fund its exploration, appraisal and 
development activities through its operational 
cash flows, prioritising capital to the highest 
cash return projects. 
5. Review of our  
hedging arrangements
Strategic alignment
    
The Group’s current hedging strategy was 
put in place in the context of volatile oil 
prices during early 2011. The Group holds put 
options which provide minimum floor prices 
whilst allowing the Group to benefit from the 
upside in oil price movements. The premiums 
on the options are deferred until maturity. 
At 31 December 2013, the Group held 
hedges covering approximately 5.2 million 
barrels of production between the period 
1 January 2014 and 30 June 2015, with the 
majority of minimum floor prices on these 
volumes of between US$90 and US$95/bbl 
before premiums.
The policy of the Group is to protect its 
minimum cash flow requirement in a 
period of a sustained downturn in oil prices. 
As such, the minimum amount of our net 
entitlement we would seek to protect with 
these arrangements is between 25-35% of 
estimated production for a rolling period 
of 18 to 24 months forward. Based on our 
current outlook, the hedges above cover 
approximately 26% of production for 2014 
and the first half of 2015.

Notably during the year, we continued our 
industry-leading exploration success with 
the play-opening Ogo discovery at OPL 310, 
offshore Nigeria, one of the largest global 
discoveries in the year, with P50  
gross recoverable resources of 774 mmboe.
Our exploration record in Nigeria over the 
past two years has enabled us to successfully 
appraise and de-risk our portfolio as we 
undertake an exciting programme of 
development at the Okoro Further Field 
Development, Ebok North Fault Block and 
Okwok, all of which will generate high-margin 
cash flow. These new developments should 
ensure that Afren achieves double-digit 
growth over the next five years. 
With proved plus probable recoverable 
reserves of 286 mmbbls, we have a stable 
platform for growth and continue to de-risk 
our material resource base.

Optimising production and 
maximising oil recovery
Production operations continue to run smoothly 
at the Okoro field. Following the successful 
discovery in early 2012, Afren and Partner, 
Amni International Petroleum Development 
Company Ltd. (Amni), commenced early 
development drilling at the Okoro Further Field 
Development. The early development well – 
the Okoro 14 well – continues to produce at 
stabilised rates of approximately 4,700 bopd. 
Total gross production at the Okoro field in 
2013 was 6.5 mmbbls of oil, representing a 
gross average daily rate of 18,041 bopd (year-
on-year increase of circa 7%), and a process 
uptime of 98.6%. Since the start of production

aggregate gross production volumes to end 
December 2013 of c.32.4 mmbbls, significantly 
above the original 2P scenario of 26.2 mmbbls, 
a remarkable achievement for our first green 
field development project. 
During the year, the Partners commenced 
the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) and 
development plans for the fabrication of a new 
wellhead platform and production unit required 
for the full Okoro Further Field Development. 
The Okoro Further Field Development Well 
Head Platform (WHP) will be a conventional 
four-pile platform, with a single piece jacket 
and deck capable of accommodating wireline 
and coil tubing units. The WHP will have 
12 well slots capable of holding dual trees, 
which would enable the platform to host up to 
24 wells. The Okoro Further Field Development 
platform will be located close to the existing 
Okoro Main wellhead platform and the two 
will be linked by a bridge. The Partners have 
decided after careful deliberation to install a 
new Mobile Offshore Production Unit (MOPU), 
as close as possible to the Okoro Further Field 
Development WHP , which will also be linked  
by a bridge. 
2014 outlook
The Partners expect the FEED to be completed 
and for the project to be sanctioned in 
H1 2014. The wellhead platform will be in 
place by Q1 2015 with development drilling 
commencing in Q2 2015.  Afren plc

Continued strong production 
performance at the Ebok field
In 2013, the Ebok field produced 12.74 mmbbls 
of oil, representing a gross average daily rate of 
34,910 bopd and a process uptime of 97 .8%, 
in line with expectations. 
Following the discovery in 2012, the Partners 
successfully drilled three production wells and 
one water injector well into the Ebok North 
Fault Block (NFB) in 2013. These wells have 
been tied back to the existing West Fault 
Block (WFB) infrastructure. The Partners also 
successfully drilled and brought on stream an 
additional production well in the WFB. The 
wells are currently producing at an aggregate 
rate of approximately 12,000 bopd.

Creating a production hub 
offshore south-east Nigeria
Our development strategy is to systematically 
bring each proven area of the Ebok field 
onstream and, through ongoing drilling, 
continue to increase reserves from the field 
over the coming months and years. We plan 
for the MOPU and Floating Storage Offloading 
vessel (FSO) to become a central facility, not just 
for the immediately surrounding Ebok structure, 
but also for the broader Ebok/Okwok/OML 
1 15 area. This will facilitate low cost and rapid 
tie-back of production from future potential 
developments on the acreage.
Beneficial tax terms
During the year, the Partners significantly 
improved their forward cash tax position 
following the award of a five-year tax 
exemption from mid-201 1 to mid-2016. The 
award was given in recognition of the positive 
contribution that independents such as Afren 
have made working with local indigenous 
operators to bring marginal offshore fields such 
as Ebok successfully into production.
2014 outlook
In 2014, the Partners plan to install the 
Central Fault Block Extension platform and 
to subsequently drill five production wells 
and two injection wells from the platform. 
The Partners are also looking at additional 
development drilling for the NFB, which will 
involve drilling development wells from an 
extended WFB platform with production 
through to the existing MOPU. Our forward 
development capex programme at Ebok reflects 
cost recovery being achieved in 2014 and has 
been accelerated in lieu of the tax award, and 
is expected to generate further high margin 
returns for the Group. Report of the Directors

Partners successfully drilled one side-track 
well, the Okwok-11ST in 2013. The well was 
drilled to a total measured depth of 3,997 ft 
and successfully encountered 95 ft of net oil 
pay in the D-2 reservoir. The data acquired, 
together with the results of the Okwok-10 
well (encountering 72 ft of net oil pay in 
the D-1 reservoir) and Okwok-10 side-track

been reclassified as a reserve, a strong 
endorsement of the successful appraisal work 
undertaken by the Partners since acquisition.
The development plan for Okwok comprises 
the installation of a separate dedicated 
production processing facility and Well Head 
Platform (WHP) with an export pipeline for 
stabilised crude oil tied back to, and sharing, 
the Ebok FSO located approximately 13 km 
to the west. The work programme for 2014 
includes the finalisation of detailed reservoir 
models and detailed development well 
planning and optimisation. The partnership 
is looking at the option of pre-drilling at least 
two production wells during the second 
half of the year, once the wellhead jacket 
installation has been completed. This wellhead 
jacket has been fabricated and is currently 
in transit to the Okwok field area. Report of the Directors

Overview
OML 115 surrounds the Ebok and Okwok 
development area, where Afren is also 
partnered with Oriental, and is close to the 
giant Zafiro Complex in Equatorial Guinea. 
The block offers an attractive opportunity 
to further capitalise on our extensive 
knowledge of the area, exploring the same 
reservoirs that have already proved oil-bearing 
and productive at Ebok and Okwok. The 
southern portion of the Okwok structure 
(Okwok South) extends into OML 115 and 
additional prospectivity has already been 
defined within the deeper Qua Iboe, Biafra 
and Isongo formations. With production 
processing, storage and export infrastructure 
in place at the Ebok field, we have a readily 
available export route for any potential future 
development in the area. At the same time, 
we expect to benefit from cost synergies, 
lowering the economic threshold for potential 
new barrels.
2014 outlook
Following the completion of Ocean Bottom 
Cable 3D Seismic over the whole Ebok/
Okwok/OML 1 15 area, Afren and its Partner, 
Oriental, are looking to spud the first 
exploration well during the latter part of 2014. 
The Ufon and Ameena East structures are 
both drill-ready opportunities and additional 
leads are being pursued with new seismic and 
advanced reprocessing projects underway.

Following shareholder approval on 20 May 
2013, Afren announced on 29 May that it 
had completed the acquisition of an 
additional 10.4% beneficial interest in 
First Hydrocarbon Nigeria (FHN) for a total 
consideration of US$37 million in cash. 
Afren now consolidates its holding of FHN’s 
reserves and production as a subsidiary 
(including prior year comparatives). Its position 
onshore Nigeria was further strengthened 
in July 2013, when Afren increased its holding 
in FHN further by acquiring a beneficial 
interest in an additional 23.3% taking 
its total holding to 78%. 
During the year, gross average production 
from the Ogini and Isoko fields was 
3,472 bopd. Production in 2013 was affected 
by periodic repairs on the Trans-Forcados 
Pipeline and delivery lines, as well as start-up 
issues with the newly installed compressor. 
Another 5.2 mmscfd compressor was 
installed and commissioned in December, 
while the installation of two new 30 kbbls 
export pumps is in progress. The Lease 
Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) unit has 
been tied-in to the Eriemu manifold and 
commissioning is ongoing.
The Partners submitted the Ogini FDP on 
29 July 2013, and are currently awaiting 
approvals from the Department of Petroleum 
Resources. The Ogini FDP consists of the 
drilling of 37 production wells, executing 
13 short-to-medium-term work-overs, 
installing a new 18” delivery line, two 50,000 
bbl/d 3-phase separators, as well as water 
treatment and disposal facilities. 
2014 outlook
The proposed work programme following 
approval of the FDP consists of drilling up 
to two new horizontal wells and one water 
injector well in 2014. In March 2014, the 
operator of the Forcados Terminal, Shell 
declared force majeure due to the challenges 
being experienced in carrying out repairs  
on the 48” Export Line leak. Report of the Directors

programme included a planned side-track, 
testing a new play of stratigraphically trapped 
sediments that pinch-out onto the basement 
high targeting 124 mmboe of gross P50 
prospective resources. In total, the Partners 
were targeting 202 mmboe of gross P50 
prospective resources.
On 26 June 2013, the Partners announced that 
the Ogo-1 well was drilled to a total measured 
depth of 10,518 ft (10,402 ft true vertical 
depth subsea), and encountered a gross 
hydrocarbon section of 524 ft, with 216 ft 
of net stacked pay. Following the conclusion 
of drilling operations at Ogo -1, the Partners 
spudded the planned side-track, the Ogo-1ST 
well. The well reached a total measured depth 
of 17,987 ft (12,050 ft true vertical depth) and 
encountered hydrocarbon intervals in the same 
Turonian, Cenomanian and Albian reservoirs 
that were successfully drilled and logged at 
the Ogo-1 well. In addition, the syn-rift section 
encountered a 280 ft true vertical thickness 
gross hydrocarbon interval.
Based on the well and 3D seismic data, 
the Partners estimate the P50 to P10 gross 
recoverable resources range to be significantly 
ahead of pre-drill expectations, at 774 to 
1,180 mmboe respectively across the Ogo 
four-way dip-closed and syn-rift structures. 
Additional upside potential is expected in the 
syn-rift play. The Partners expect the syn-rift to 
contain a light oil or a condensate rich gas. 
Whilst circulating bottoms up at TD, the 
drill string parted at 3,390 ft and during 
good progress towards recovery of the drill 
string from the well bore, the well took a 
hydrocarbon kick. After the kick was safely 
controlled, the Partners considered it prudent 
to move to permanently secure the well.
2014 outlook
Afren and its Partners commenced an 
extensive 2,716 km² marine 3D seismic 
programme across OPL 310 and the 
neighbouring OML 1 13 licence in March 2014 
to complement the existing coverage on the 
two licences. The seismic programme will 
establish the full extent of the syn-rift play and 
further dip-closed structures to the north and 
east of the Ogo discovery. The Partners expect 
to commence appraisal drilling following the 
completion of the seismic programme.
Nigeria 
OPL 310
Overview
OPL 310 is located in the Upper Cretaceous 
fairway that runs along the West African 
Transform Margin. Extending from the shallow 
water continental shelf to deep water, the 
block lies in an under-explored basin with 
a proven working hydrocarbon system. It is 
also in close proximity to the West African 
Gas Pipeline (WAGP) which allows gas 
discoveries to be readily developed. Detailed 
pre-drill evaluation of the block identified 
several prospects lying in the same Turonian, 
Cenomanian and Albian sandstone intervals 
that have yielded significant discoveries in 
Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire.
On 14 May 2013, Afren announced the 
completion of a farm-out agreement with 
Lekoil Limited, subject to Nigerian Ministerial 
Consent, in the OPL 310 licence. Under the 
terms of the farm-out, Afren received a total 
carry of up to US$50 million in respect of 
the drilling campaign at the Ogo prospect. 
Post farm-out, Afren’s economic interest in 
the licence is 40% once Afren and Optimum 
Petroleum Development Ltd, the operator, 
achieves cost recovery. Afren provides 
technical assistance to Optimum in respect 
of Optimum’s obligations under a Technical 
Assistance Agreement.

Report of the Directors
Overview
On 17 July 2013, FHN, a subsidiary of Afren, 
completed the acquisition of a 16.9% 
economic interest in OML 113 for a total 
consideration of US$40 million. OML 113 is  
in the Dahomey-Benin Basin, offshore Nigeria, 
and is contiguous to the OPL 310 block. 
Background to the  
Aje discovery
The Aje oil and gas field was discovered in 
1996 and is 24 kilometres offshore Nigeria 
on block OML 113 in water depths up 
to 1,476 ft. Pending ongoing exploration 
and appraisal work at OPL 310, the field is 
estimated to be one of the largest oil fields in 
Nigeria outside the Niger Delta basin. 
Three (Aje-1, Aje-2 and Aje-4) of the four 
wells drilled on the field have encountered 
oil and gas in various intervals across the 
Turonian, Cenomanian and Albian sands, 
and two (Aje-1 and Aje-2) of the wells have 
comprehensively tested at commercial rates.
The JV Partners estimate the Pmean 
contingent resources to be 167 mmboe, 
principally related to the Aje field, with an 
additional 205 mmboe of mean prospective 
resources on the block.
2014 outlook
Post period end, the JV Partners submitted 
the Field Development Plan (FDP) for the Aje 
field to the Nigerian Department of Petroleum 
Resources (DPR). The FDP was approved in 
March 2014 and is primarily focused on the 
development of the Cenomanian oil reservoir. 
The first phase of development includes 
two subsea production wells, tied back to 
a leased FPSO. These wells will most likely 
comprise the recompletion of the existing 
Aje-4 well, and a new well drilled to the Aje-2 
subsurface location. The FDP envisages first 
oil commencing in late 2015 with mid-case 
reserves of 32.4 mmbbls, a Final Investment 
Decision (FID) is expected to be taken by the  
JV Partners shortly. 
In parallel with the seismic programme at 
OPL 310, Afren has commenced an extensive 
2,716 km² 3D seismic across the two licence 
areas to better define prospectivity in both 
licences and in particular the full extent of 
the syn rift structure encountered at the Ogo 
discovery. The seismic programme will also 
assist in the future development of OML 1 13.

Reallocation of Block CI-01 
into CI-523 and CI-525
In Q3 2013, Afren reached an agreement 
with the Côte d’Ivoire Government regarding 
the reallocation of the CI-01 Block in which 
Afren held a 65% interest. 
The agreement involves the CI-01 Block 
(gross area of 1,208 km
2
) being divided into 
two new larger blocks, CI-523 (gross area 
of 1,494 km
2
) and CI-525 (gross area of 
1,221 km
2
). The new CI-523 Block includes 
the legacy CI-523 acreage as well as the 
southern portion of the legacy CI-01 Block, 
thereby extending our acreage to the south. 
The new CI-525 Block includes the legacy 
CI-505 Block and the northern portion of the 
legacy CI-01 Block, thereby extending our 
acreage to the north. The new CI-523 Block 
will be operated by Taleveras Group. The new 
CI-525 Block will be operated by Afren. 
Located along a proven petroleum system 
along the prolific West African Transform 
Margin adjacent to the borders of Ghana in 
the Tano-Ivorian basin, the new CI-523 and 
CI-525 blocks significantly increase Afren’s 
existing exploration acreage and upside 
potential in the region.

Overview
The Keta Block is in the Volta River Basin in 
Eastern Ghana, next to the maritime border 
with Togo. The block has both Tertiary and 
Cretaceous prospectivity, with the principal 
exploration focus being the Cretaceous 
Albian to Campanian sections. The block 
offers multiple prospects and leads, with a 
variety of trapping and depositional settings. 
A number of these show potential for 
significant stratigraphic trapping and  
giant fields.
On 6 February 2012, Afren announced that 
Eni had commenced drilling of the Nunya-1x 
(formerly named Cuda-2) exploration well, 
in the Keta Block, with the Marianas semi-
submersible drilling rig. The objective of the 
Nunya-1x exploration well was to explore 
a large four-way dip closed Upper Cretaceous 
structure. On 25 April 2012, Afren announced 
that the well intersected 502 ft of very good 
quality sandstone reservoirs. However, they 
were interpreted as water bearing. The 
well, which was drilled to a total depth of 
14,928 ft in a water depth of 5,535 ft, has 
provided important information with which 
to calibrate and further enhance the Group’s 
understanding of this under-explored block in 
what remains a high-potential basin. 
As part of the extended two-year exploration 
phase, the Partners completed the acquisition of 
1,582 km
2
 3D seismic survey in December 2012, 
which is currently being interpreted, and will be 
integrated with data from the Ophir Starfish-1 
well and the Nunya-1x exploration well.

area of approximately 5,000 km
2
, with water 
depths ranging from shore line to 820 ft. The 
main reservoir objectives are the fluvial and 
lacustrine sands of Lower Cretaceous age, 
which occur in three sequences. The A-J1 
exploration well, drilled in 1989, successfully 
encountered oil in these sequences and 
tested good quality 36º API oil. Reprocessing 
of 2D seismic data has since defined several 
other Lower Cretaceous rift graben prospects, 
analogous to the prolific Lake Albert play 
in Uganda. Further prospectivity has also 
been identified within a fractured basement 
(analogous to Yemen), which could form a 
secondary exploration play on the acreage.
2014 outlook

Kenya 
Block 1
Overview
Block 1 is on the western margin of the 
Mandera-Lugh Basin in north-eastern Kenya, 
bordering both Somalia and Ethiopia, where 
it is connected to the Ogaden Basin. The 
Upper Triassic and Jurassic formations that 
have been identified are considered to be 
the primary zones of oil prospectivity. An 
oil seep discovered by the Tarbaj well in the 
south-west corner of the block confirms the 
presence of hydrocarbons. Analogous data 
with the Ogaden Basin also suggests there 
may be other potential source rocks and 
reservoirs. The Bur Mayo and the Kalicha-
Seir formations in the Mandera-Lugh basin 
appear comparable to the Lower and Upper 
Hamanlei (Jurassic) formations in the Ogaden 
Basin. If analogous, these formations should 
have high total organic content (TOC) source 
rocks and good quality reservoirs.
In 2013, we concluded the interpretation 
of 1,900 km of 2D seismic, which identified 
leads and prospects and a number of new 
play concepts. Many of these prospects have 
successful analogues in the Ethiopian sector 
of the basin immediately north of Block 1. 
The new data set has also enhanced our view 
of the oil prospectivity in the south of this 
large frontier block.
2014 outlook
The forward plan for the acreage includes 
shooting 150-250 km additional 2D seismic 
in the first half of 2014 followed by an

Overview
Block 10A is in the Anza Basin onshore 
northern Kenya, part of the Central African 
Mesozoic rift system that includes the 
Muglad Graben in Southern Sudan, and the 
Lamu Graben in Kenya. The block covers 
a total of 14,747 km
2
. Three exploration 
wells were drilled by Amoco in Block 10A 
(Sirius-1, Bellatrix-1 and Chalbi-3) throughout 
1988 and 1989, in the southern part of the 
block. The presence of oil and gas shows 
and the high maturity level of organic rocks 
in wells Bellatrix-1 and Sirius-1 are evidence 
of a working hydrocarbon system on the 
block. The latter well notably established the 
presence of an Upper Cretaceous lacustrine 
source rock that may have generated low-
sulphur/paraffinic oil. 
Having satisfied all seismic work 
commitments with the acquisition of 750 km 
of 2D seismic over the block in 2011, the 
operator commenced exploration drilling 
at the Paipai prospect in September 2012. 
On 1 March 2013, the operator, Tullow 
Oil, announced the temporary suspension 
of the Paipai-1 exploration well. The well, 
which was drilled to a total depth of 
13,960 ft, encountered light hydrocarbon 
shows across a 180 ft thick gross sandstone 
interval. Following a period of evaluation,

Overview
Blocks L17 and L18 are in the Lamu Coastal 
Basin, south-east Kenya, covering an area of 
approximately 4,881 km
2
. There is an onshore 
component to L17 and water depths vary 
from a few feet along the shoreline to up 
to around 2,625 ft in the Pemba Channel 
in the offshore portions.
There are several potential source rocks 
for the Tertiary and Cretaceous plays in the 
southern areas of the basin including the 
Permo-Triassic Karoo interval, the Middle 
Jurassic and high Total Organic Carbon 
(TOCs) are recorded within the Eocene 
section in the Pemba-5 well. There are oil 
seeps in the Lamu Basin and Pemba Island 
linked to a Jurassic source which implies 
that the structures in Blocks L17 and L18 are 
most likely oil bearing. The hydrocarbons are 
expected to have been generated in the deep 
Pemba trough south of Block L18 and in the 
Tembo Trough to the east.
In January 2012, Afren completed the 
acquisition of 1,207 km of additional 
2D seismic data targeting the deeper 
water portion of the blocks. Interpretation 
of the data has identified four new highly

Tanga Block
Overview
The Tanga Block is located offshore and 
onshore north-east Tanzania. The block lies 
south of, and is contiguous with, Afren’s 
100% owned and operated Blocks L17 
and L18 in Kenya. It contains a southerly 
extension of the same coastal high and basin 
trough plays, allowing us to use our regional 
expertise and knowledge.
Interpretation of previously acquired 2D 
seismic data reinforced the Partners’ view  
that the prospectivity in the deeper water 
parts of the acreage represents a potentially 
lower geological risk exploration opportunity.
In early July 2013, Afren initiated seismic 
interpretation on the 620 km
2
 3D seismic 
survey. Afren and its Partners have been 
simultaneously working up both a shallow-
water (Chungwa-1, previously Orpheus) 
and deeper water prospect (Mkonge-1, 
previously Calliope). EIA surveys and drilling 
prognosis have been completed for both 
the Chungwa-1 and Mkonge-1 wells, which 
are both ready to drill. In addition the 3D 
has led to the recognition of an additional 
deepwater prospect named Nanasi that sits 
between Chungwa and Mkonge. This is 
being fast-tracked to provide a third potential 
well location.
2014 outlook
The Partners are now in the process of 
securing a suitable rig for the shallow water 
Chungwa-1 prospect with exploration 
drilling scheduled for the second half of 
2014. The Chungwa-1 well will test Tertiary, 
Cretaceous and Jurassic reservoirs, targeting 
Pmean resources of 300 mmbbls of oil. 
Mean prospective resources on the block 
are currently 1.9 bnbbls.

Seychelles 
Areas A & B
Overview
Areas A and B are in the Seychelles micro-
continent, in shallow to deep water in the 
northern half of the Seychelles plateau and 
cover a combined area of approximately 
14,319 km
2
.
The main exploration targets are the Permo-
Triassic Karoo interval, which comprises 
non-marine sands inter-bedded with shales 
and a Cretaceous marine rift basin underlain 
by Jurassic platform source rocks. The Karoo 
formation contains both the source rock and 
the reservoir. Between 1980 and 1981, three 
exploration wells were drilled, all of which 
encountered oil shows and confirmed the 
presence of a working hydrocarbon system.

* EAX is a wholly owned subsidiary of Afren plc.
Seismic data previously acquired by the 
Partners revealed the presence of several 
large-scale structures in the two licence 
areas that are located in shallow to deep 
water in the northern half of the Seychelles 
plateau. A major new 2D survey in Q4 2011 
(3,733 km) focused on these areas to better 
define their true prospectivity. 
In 2013, Afren completed a major 3D 
seismic programme, the first 3D survey to be 
conducted in the Seychelles, of two surveys in 
Afren’s licence areas. The first 3D survey was 
in the southern portion of the licence over 
the Bonit prospect and covered 600 km
2
. 
The second survey was in the northern 
section of the licence area and covered an 
area of 2,775 km
2
. Interpretation of this 
new 3D seismic is underway. Early results 
have confirmed pre-3D prospectivity in the 
southern deep water portion of Area A1.
2014 outlook
Results from the northern deep water 3D are 
expected imminently and will be evaluated in 
conjunction with the southern deep water 3D 
ahead of planned exploration drilling.
Gross un-risked prospective resources for the 
two areas are estimated at 2,994 mmboe. Report of the Directors

Blocks 7 & 8
Overview
Blocks 7 and 8 are in the Ogaden Basin and are 
both part of the same PSC, covering an overall 
area of 23,162 km
2
. Exploration in Ethiopia 
began in the 1970s with Tenneco discovering 
the Calub and Hilal gas fields approximately 
200 km to the east of Block 6. Exploration 
continued throughout the 1980s. Three wells, 
El Kuran-1, El Kuran-2 and Bodle-1, have been 
drilled on the blocks. Both of the El Kuran 
wells encountered hydrocarbons and oil was 
recovered from the Jurassic Hamanlei formation. 
The main potential reservoirs in the basin are 
carbonates in the Jurassic Hamanlei formation 
and clastic sediments of the Triassic age Adigrat 
formation and Carboniferous age Calub 
formation. In addition, some permeable Jurassic 
carbonate rocks in the Hamanlei formation can 
be considered potential reservoirs.
2014 outlook
The Partners spudded the El Kuran-3 well 
on 13 October 2013 using the Sakson 501 
drilling rig.
The drilling programme was expected to 
test the reservoir productivity in the Adigrat 
and Hamanlei zones, targeting 100 mmbbls 
of gross prospective resources. Following 
hydrocarbon shows, the well was extended 
below the initial target depth to a new 
total depth of 1 1,574 ft to evaluate the 
deeper Gumboro zone. The well is currently 
undergoing logging and evaluation to 
determine the quality of the reservoir and 
to assess the potential commerciality given 
the remote location.

Overview
Block 1 101 is on the eastern flank of 
the Ambilobe Basin, onshore northern 
Madagascar. The block encompasses an 
area of approximately 1 1,175 km
2
. The 
main exploration targets are sands of the 
Isalo formation. There are proven heavy oil 
accumulations in the Isalo formation in Central 
Madagascar such as Bemolanga and Tsimiroro, 
indicating good reservoir conditions. 
In June 2013, Afren ran a successful field trip 
across the block with OMNIS, the state oil 
and gas company, viewing exposures of the 
probable reservoir targets.
2014 outlook
Additional 2D seismic acquisition and a shallow 
borehole coring programme are planned for 
Q2 2014 after the rainy season to enhance our 
subsurface understanding ahead of exploration 
drilling. The planned work programme will 
focus on the Mantalay prospect and the

The Barda Rash PSC is 55 km north-west 
of Erbil, and holds the 14,015 mmbbls STOIIP 
and 1,433 mmbbls gross recoverable Barda 
Rash oil field. The field is defined as an 
elongated anticline with surface expression 
of 20 km length and up to 7 km width. 
The reservoirs are fractured carbonates 
of various depositional settings. 
In 2009, the BR-1 discovery well was drilled 
to 12,290 ft and successfully encountered oil 
in Cretaceous to Jurassic reservoirs. Well tests 
were carried out on the Jurassic Mus and 
Adaiyah formations, each yielding rates 
of around 3,200 bopd, with a subsequent 
extended test of the BR-1 well producing 
440,000 barrels of 30° to 32° API oil over 
a three-month period. During this time, oil 
was trucked from onsite storage and sent to 
local refineries. Two further wells were drilled 
at the field in 2010, BR-2 and BR-3, both 
encountering oil full-to-base in all reservoirs. 
The field is defined by 326 km
2
 of good 
quality 3D seismic data. 
In 2012, we commenced the phased 
development of the field, initially targeting 
the development of light oil reserves. Having 
begun an extensive testing programme at 
the BR-1 well in July 2012, and establishing 
oil rates in excess of 6,000 bopd of 28° 
to 32° API oil, as well as obtaining valuable 
information on the production characteristics 
of the Mus/Adaiyah reservoir, we initiated 
production operations in August 2012. In July 
2013, we commenced preliminary crude 
oil sales from the Barda Rash PSC to the 
local market. Gross production at the field 
averaged 639 bopd during 2013.
Barda Rash 2014 outlook
Afren has now moved to the second phase 
of development on the field, which involves 
drilling new wells to increase production 
capacity and acquiring modern log and core 
data to better understand and delineate 
the field.
The Partners commenced drilling on the BR-5 
well in Q1 2013 using the Romfor-23 drilling rig 
which is currently operating at circa 14,436 ft. 
They also commenced drilling the BR-4 well 
in May 2013, using the Viking I-10 rig. The 
well reached a total depth of 13,800 ft. 
As part of an ongoing programme BR-4 has 
tested two horizons in the Triassic Kurra Chine 
formation at 6,100 bopd and 1,750 bopd 
respectively. The BR-5 well has intersected 
a similar hydrocarbon-bearing sequence in 
the Kurra Chine formation and will be tested 
in due course. Flow lines and facilities will 
be updated to bring BR-4 and BR-5 into 
production during 2014.

northern part of the Ain Sifni PSC. Analysis 
of data collected over the deepened section 
of well indicated the continual presence of 
light oil shows, and extended the estimated 
oil shows encountered by the well to 1,509 ft 
throughout Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic 
age reservoirs. 
Following the conclusion of drilling operations 
at Simrit-2, a comprehensive well test 
programme was undertaken. Operator 
Hunt Oil completed the Simrit-2 Extended 
Well Test (EWT) programme during the 
second half of 2013. Produced crude was 
trucked to local markets. The Simrit-3 well, 
exploring the eastern extent of the large scale 
Simrit anticline, tested a cumulative rate of 
6,293 bopd. The well has been configured 
as a produced water disposal well. 
2014 outlook
In June 2013, operator Hunt Oil spudded 
the Maqlub-1 well testing the high potential 
Maqlub structure to the south of the block 
and is currently drilling ahead in the Jurassic 
reservoirs. To date hydrocarbons have been 
encountered in the Cretaceous and Jurassic 
reservoirs as confirmed by wireline, Logging 
While Drilling (LWD), cuttings and gas data.
Operator Hunt has submitted a declaration 
of commerciality on the block. Simrit-4 was 
spudded in early 2014. This well will target the 
Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs.
Following the success at Simrit, the Partners 
expect further growth in reserves and 
resources at Ain Sifni in 2014.

On 17 April 2012, the Group announced that 
the Simrit-2 exploration well had successfully 
encountered an estimated 1,342 ft of net 
oil in Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic age 
reservoirs. The well was initially drilled to 
its prognosed total measured depth of 
12,139 ft but was subsequently deepened 
to a revised total depth of 12,467 ft to 
test additional zones of prospectivity. The 
Partners completed drilling on the Simrit-2 
exploration well in July 2012. The objective 
of the well was to test the western extent

 The Afren approach to corporate responsibility
Report of the Directors
One of the five strategic priorities that  
we have identified to achieve our vision  
is ensuring that our corporate responsibility 
performance achieves the highest standards.
In 2013 we altered how we describe our 
corporate responsibility areas of focus. We 
have adapted the IPIECA industry guidelines  
so that they are aligned with the information 
requirements of our key stakeholders. We  
now refer to environment and climate change, 
health and safety, people, communities and 
business conduct as our key areas of focus.
Our overall approach to corporate 
responsibility is governed by the IPIECA 
guidelines, the relevant legal and regulatory 
frameworks and materiality. For each of  
the five focus areas we have:
•  Designed policies that reference the 
appropriate international accords;
•  Put in place management systems that  
are in line with industry best practice and 
the appropriate international standards;
•  Developed KPIs (key performance 
indicators) and regularly monitored our 
performance by comparing these 
measures to targets and industry 
benchmarks; and
•  Communicated and entered into  
dialogue with our stakeholders about  
this important aspect of our business.  
We have then applied this feedback  
to enhance our policies, systems  
and performance.

2013 highlights 
Transparency and reporting 
During 2013 we undertook a number  
of activities to improve the levels of 
clarity, transparency and quality of our 
CR communications and reporting. These 
included changing the way we describe  
our approach to CR and adapting the 
industry IPIECA guidelines concerning  
our areas of focus to achieve greater  
clarity for a wide group of stakeholders.  
This new approach is recorded on pages  
64 and 65 of this Annual Report.
We met the new requirements concerning 
the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
by conducting a review exercise of our 
measurement and data collection systems 
and ensuring that they met the new 
requirements. This process also involved 
an examination of the classification of our 
emissions taking into account their origin, 
our level of responsibility for them and other 
related matters.
We intend to continue this process in 2014 
by, in particular, producing our first online 
corporate responsibility report in line with 
the Global Reporting Initiative and IPIECA 
reporting guidelines. We are also placing 
greater emphasis on reporting this aspect  
of our activities to our current and  
potential shareholders.
Environment and climate change 
In 2013 the Company aimed to improve the 
monitoring of its environmental performance 
by designing and commencing a programme 
of environmental audits. This was performed 
with the support of an experienced third 
party service provider. A periodic programme 
has been set up to assess all the Company’s 
sites against ISO14001 standards, policies  
and procedures.
Progress was also made with establishing 
systems that will assist the Company with 
monitoring and recording quantities of oil 
in produced water and tonnages of cuttings 
and muds discharged and hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste that is produced.
 
Health and Safety 
The Company’s health and safety systems 
were improved in 2013 following the rollout 
of a new incident notification system to 
all business units. The purpose of these 
improvements was so that we could make 
absolutely sure that events are being 
reported promptly and accurately to the 
appropriate levels of management. We have 
also implemented an Operations Integrity 
Maintenance System to improve our process 
safety systems.
People 
We continued our process to achieve a uniform 
approach towards employees and contractors 
by incorporating our environmental, health and 
safety and security requirements into all of our 
contractor contracts.
Communities 
Our teams in the countries where we operate 
developed a number of projects that are 
focused on our key areas of education, skills, 
employability and health. A list of current 
examples, conducted in partnership with local 
and international NGOs, our business Partners 
and the local authorities, are recorded within 
the corporate responsibility section on our 
website. Of particular note is the work we 
are doing with the education sector in Nigeria 
to improve the employability skills within 
the local workforce.
Business conduct 
Our anti-bribery and corruption processes are 
the subject of regular management review. 
During 2013 we monitored compliance 
through the operation of the Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Register. This lists transactions 
such as gifts and entertaining and separately 
identifies those involving government officials. 
The Code of Business Conduct is due to be 
revised and updated in 2014. Afren plc

Environment and climate change 
Developing the Company’s  
climate change strategy
Tackling climate change means addressing the greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions associated with our operations. These arise primarily from energy 
use (i.e. generation of electricity from the burning of hydrocarbons either 
in our own facilities or in power stations) and from venting or flaring 
of excess gas. 
Energy use will tend to grow as our business develops, however we take 
steps to ensure that we utilise energy as efficiently as possible, thereby 
minimising the associated GHG emissions.
Our current focus however is the flaring of excess gas in our production 
operations. In the absence of any local infrastructure to get gas to market  
we have limited options for dealing with gas within our facilities. In the first 
instance maximum use is made of gas for power generation to avoid the use  
of diesel or other fuels. We also use gas to assist with the production of oil 
through gas-lift technology. Beyond this, the options for gas are limited 
to flaring or re-injection underground.
We have been developing a number of technical solutions for reducing our  
level of flaring. This led in 2013 to the conduct of our first flaring reduction 
programme at the Ebok field in Nigeria where we have commenced 
re-injecting gas back into the ground as part of the production process. 
We are also assessing the feasibility of dedicated gas disposal wells at Ebok 
and extending flaring reduction to our other operations. 
We have been reporting on GHG emissions for the past two years in our 
Annual Reports and as part of our 2013 commitments we have taken a 
more detailed look at our emission sources and the way in which we are 
monitoring and reporting emissions. We commissioned PwC’s sustainability 
team to conduct an independent review of our GHG emissions at 
Ebok with a view to confirming the accuracy of reporting and making 
recommendations on how to better manage the data in order to meet the 
new UK reporting requirements. By understanding the measurement and 
reporting of emissions we also hope to be able to better manage our efforts 
on emissions reduction. 
The recommendations made by PwC include more frequent monitoring 
and measurement and suggestions about improving emissions accuracy 
(in particular relating to flaring). The team’s advice also covered the scope 
of Afren’s reporting of emissions (for instance what to include and exclude), 
classification (Scope 1, 2 or 3) and defining boundaries that reflect the nature 
of the Company’s operations and structure. The project’s outcomes are 
reflected in our reporting of this information within this Annual Report and 
will be applied in our reporting of this information going forward on our 
website and within other disclosures (for example our annual submission 
of information to CDP).
In the course of conducting this work we have also reviewed our historical 
emissions and present the amended data, together with the data for 2014, 
in the graph below.

 Key objective
We will minimise the effects of our activities  
on the environment and meet the climate 
change challenge.
 Policy highlights
•  We will comply with the relevant local and 
national regulations, frameworks, guidelines 
and best practice at all times.
•  We will conserve resources and protect 
the environment where we operate and 
minimise any adverse impacts resulting 
from our operations.
•  We will apply re-use and re-cycling methods  
wherever possible throughout our operations.
•  We will endeavour to meet the challenges 
presented by climate change.
•  We will minimise waste generation  
and dispose of waste responsibly.
•  We will conserve and protect local 
biodiversity in the areas where we operate.
•  We will minimise our use of water and 
carefully control our discharges to water.
 System highlights
•  All our exploration and production projects 
are the subject of a detailed environmental 
impact assessment process before 
they proceed.
•  We have a detailed environmental 
management system that applies to all 
of our operations.
•  We engage a third party specialist to conduct 
periodic environmental audits against 
ISO14001 standards, policies and procedures.
•  We have weekly (for senior operations 
management), monthly (for senior operations 
management and Executive Directors) 
and quarterly reporting (for the Board of 
Directors) mechanisms for our environmental 
performance. Incident reports are completed 
immediately and distributed to senior 
operations management and the  
Executive Directors.
•  The Company has comprehensive assessment 
procedures concerning all of its suppliers and 
contractors that are conducted as part of the 
contract and procurement process. Report of the Directors

We then calculate carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO
2
e) based on the relative global warming 
potential of each gas; for example methane 
is 21 times more effective as a greenhouse 
gas than carbon dioxide and has a global 
warming potential of 21. In this way the 
carbon footprint for the business can be 
expressed as a single number.
The other greenhouse gases, 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons 
(PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride, are not 
closely associated with oil and gas exploration 
and production. The total emissions of these 
gases are therefore expected to be small and 
have not been calculated. 
Offshore emission factors for greenhouse 
gas calculations were derived from the UK 
Department of Energy and Climate Change 
(DECC) Environmental Emissions Monitoring 
System (EEMS) calculation tools used by the UK 
offshore industry to report on greenhouse gases.
Onshore emissions were calculated using 
emission factors derived from the American 
Petroleum Industry Compendium of 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies 
for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2009).
This methodology has been used to derive 
emissions data from 2009 to 2013.
Intensity ratio
The nature of oil and gas exploration and 
production is such that there is no clear 
intensity metric that covers all situations. 
In particular, using oil production or revenue 
as the intensity ratio does not take into 
account the fact that exploration activities 
may not be successful in delivering increases 
to production. Despite this limitation 
we have opted to report an intensity ratio 
of tonnes of CO
2
e against 1000 tonnes 
of hydrocarbon production.
As a measure of the efficiency of our 
production operations we have also 
decided to investigate the value of reporting 
production emissions from energy, processing 
and any flaring against the volume of 
fluids being produced. This metric is much 
more closely associated with the efficiency 
of individual production operations and 
may provide a means for comparing our 
different facilities.
Data on intensity ratios is shown in the 
graph opposite.
Greenhouse gas  
emissions reporting
In previous years we have voluntarily reported 
on greenhouse gas emissions. Under the new 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 there 
is now a statutory requirement to disclose 
emissions information in a prescribed format.
Baseline and reporting year
We have been collecting data on our greenhouse 
gas emissions since 2009 (see graph on page 68). 
Consequently we have chosen this year as the 
baseline year for our emissions reporting. 
Our reporting period for our emissions 
data continues to be consistent with the 
Company’s financial reporting period, being 
the calendar year ending 31 December 2013.
Organisation and  
operating boundaries
In line with the guidance issued with the 
new UK legal reporting requirement, we 
report all of the emissions from the assets 
where we are the operator and therefore 
have operational control. We do not report 
emissions from our joint venture operations 
where one of our Partners is the operator 
as in these instances we do not have 
operational control.
In terms of our operating boundaries we have 
continued to report emissions associated with 
all field activities, whether they be related 
to production, drilling or seismic activities, 
transportation or logistics; this includes all 
contracted services associated with the 
running of the field.
We have captured data on both Scope 1, direct 
emissions and Scope 2, indirect emissions. 
Scope 2 emissions are currently limited to those 
associated with electricity use in our offices and 
make up less than 0.1% of our emissions.
Methodology
Our direct emissions are generally calculated 
from fuel use data, either gas used to power 
turbines and other equipment, gas flared 
or diesel used in generators. Calculations 
are made for carbon dioxide, methane 
and nitrous oxide being the main gases 
produced through the combustion process.  Afren plc

safety standards across all of our businesses 
according to industry best practice and 
ensure that they are communicated 
to all of our employees and contractors.
•  We will encourage and promote knowledge 
sharing around the business and within our 
peer group to ensure that the causes of 
incidents are fully understood and health 
and safety risks are minimised.
•  We will ensure that all of our employees 
and contractors have the necessary health 
and safety skills and expertise by applying 
regular training and education methods 
in line with industry best practice.
 System highlights
•  All our exploration and production projects 
are the subject of a detailed health and safety 
assessment process before they proceed.

management system that applies to all 
of our operations.
•  All staff receive regular training on health 
and safety matters.
•  Our health and safety policies and systems 
extend to our contractors as well as 
our employees.
•  We have weekly (for senior operations 
management), monthly (for senior operations 
management and Executive Directors) 
and quarterly (for the Board of Directors) 
reporting mechanisms for our health and 
safety performance. Incident reports are 
completed immediately and distributed 
to senior operations management and the 
Executive Directors.
Use of HAZIDS and HAZOPS
A feature of our health and safety management process is our use of risk 
management techniques across all of our activities. These range from job 
risk assessments to particular risk assessment tools such as HAZIDS (Hazard 
Identification Study) and HAZOPS (Hazard and Operability Study). HAZOPS 
involve the prior examination of a process, usually by a team of experienced 
people, before it is constructed in order to identify and evaluate potential 
problems that may present risks to personnel or equipment or prevent 
efficient operation. HAZIDS involve the conduct of prior assessment 
procedures (such as health and safety impact studies) as part of the design 
of projects and processes to ensure that potential risks have been 
identified, assessed and mitigated.
Many of our activities are performed by external contractors. We have 
close relationships with them to ensure that our procedures are aligned and 
that knowledge is shared. Our contractors are required to adopt the same 
standards of health and safety as Afren.

and conduct periodic audits and assessments  
to ensure that our aims are being achieved.
•  Regular dialogue and communications  
with local stakeholders are key features 
of our approach.
Education in Nigeria
We aim to ensure that our local community investment provides 
sustainable benefits in partnership with local authorities and leaders.  
In Nigeria we do this by developing education programmes that build  
skill levels and develop employment for young people. Since 2009 we  
have, in conjunction with our business Partners, supported the creation  
of education opportunities for people in the host communities at Effiat  
and Eastern Obolo. 
Scholarships 
Our projects include the award of scholarships to existing, tertiary, 
secondary and post-graduate students to support a variety of learning 
and skill acquisition activities. 
The grants provide an allowance per annum and last for the period of  
the course being undertaken. By the end of 2013 there were over 400 local 
participating students. An awards ceremony was held in October that was 
attended by community leaders, representatives of the State Ministry of 
Environment and Petroleum Resources, beneficiaries and their families and  
a representative of the Commissioner for Education in Akwa-Ibom State.
Developing science education 
We have worked with the local authorities to support the construction  
of nine science laboratories in three secondary schools in Eastern Obolo. 
We also supported the transfer of nine science teachers to these schools 
by the State Ministry of Education and the local education board. Our 
contribution included supporting the payment of special allowances to 
the staff to encourage them to move to and stay in the area. This activity 
was carried out to increase the numbers of local students studying 
scientific subjects (physics, biology and chemistry).
Vocational skills development and local business start-up support 
Our activities also support local education for people who are unable 
to benefit from the Scholarship Scheme or who do not have access 
to other educational facilities. For example, we have supported a 
Technical Skill Acquisition Program (TSAP) in collaboration with seven 
local skills acquisition centres. This allows 120 students each year to 
acquire a variety of vocational abilities including welding and fabrication, 
electrical installation, instrumentation and maintenance, and hospitality.
At the end of a year of intensive training, the students move to the 
University of Uyo and acquire business skills. Upon graduation they 
are supplied with a financial grant and equipment to support small  
business start-ups.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) register
Our operations include activities in several countries that have a score  
of below 40 in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. 
We recognise that our stakeholders perceive that there is a significant 
potential of business conduct issues affecting our activities unless 
we have put in place robust systems and controls to prevent such 
an event occurring.
One important element of our management systems is the ABC Register. 
This facility ensures that there is a permanent record of all Company gifts, 
hospitality, entertainment and charitable donations (except for very small 
expenditure items). The Register is maintained on the Company intranet. 
All staff members are required to record these types of transactions 
when they are made. Compliance with this procedure is supported by 
examination of Company expenses claims. Other features of the Register 
are the inclusion of mandatory authorisation procedures (larger 
transactions require Executive Director approval, for example) and 
a facility that highlights where events involve government officials.
The Register is reviewed every three months by an internal Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Committee comprising senior staff members from our 
legal and finance departments. A report is prepared following the conduct 
of this review. This is examined as a regular part of the Company’s Audit 
Committee meeting process.  Report of the Directors

Board structure
Dear Shareholder
Conducting business in line with our values 
is vital to our continued growth and success 
as a premium-listed independent upstream 
E&P company. So I acknowledge and 
welcome the Board’s obligation to ensure 
we have the right people, culture and 
structures in place to make the right decisions 
for our business and for our shareholders. 
Such a culture expresses our principles 
of respect, honesty and transparency, and 
we strive to demonstrate ethical leadership. 
As Chairman, my role is to lead the Board 
so it may fulfil its role effectively, under a 
governance structure which is designed to be 
flexible and efficient in creating sustainable 
long-term growth in shareholder value. 
The Board plays an important role in working 
with management to ensure our business 
is well governed and financially strong, 
that we mitigate any risks identified, and that 
we maintain an appropriate balance between 
promoting long-term growth and achieving 
short-term objectives. The Board’s role is to 
provide clear direction for the organisation, 
while the management’s is to meet the 
strategic goals of the Company.
We have formalised our focus on high ethical 
standards in our Group Code of Business 
Conduct, which is in place across the business 
and sets out clearly our expectations of how 
our employees and those who work on behalf 
of Afren should behave. Through this code, 
we strive to uphold the standards we have 
set, and so operate with integrity with all 
external parties such as governments, business 
partners, shareholders, contractors and local 
communities. The code makes it clear that 
we consider it unacceptable for our companies 
and employees to be involved or implicated 
in any way in corrupt practices. Any individual 
working for us has the power to challenge 
or stop any activity that conflicts with our 
business ethics, and this commitment is 
documented in our human resources policies 
and procedures. We continue to keep our 
anti-corruption policies and practices under 
review to ensure they maintain this approach. 
The Code of Business Conduct defines and 
documents our objectives for:
•  our corporate governance
•  our environment, health, safety and  
social management
•  the role of our employees and their 
responsibilities
•  our interaction with business Partners and 
local governments
•  the treatment of Company assets, such as 
confidential materials and equity holdings.
The code highlights the commitment we have 
made to acting positively and responsibly 
towards the people, the physical environments 
and the host communities our business may 
affect. We communicate and monitor our 
environmental, health, safety and social issues 
through our Environment, Health & Safety 
and Social (EHSS) management system. 
Similarly, we have a structured approach 
to the management of security issues through 
a documented security management system. 
In addition, we ensure we treat all members 
of staff fairly, and we encourage diversity 
within our team. We offer our people equal 
opportunities, training and career progression. 
Furthermore, we have provided guidelines

continues to serve as a Director. Prior to SPG, 
Ms Bryant worked with the Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts and The Department of 
Government at Harvard University. Ms Bryant 
was a postgraduate Fellow of both the 
King’s Institute for the Study of Public Policy 
at King’s College, London and Harvard 
University. She has a BA from the University 
of Texas at Austin. 
This year’s evaluation of the Board, which 
was facilitated externally, confirmed that 
the Board continues to meet its obligations. 
Following the annual performance evaluation 
process, I am pleased to confirm that each of 
the Directors’, particularly the Non-Executive 
Directors’, performance and contribution 
continues to be objective, timely, thoughtful, 
challenging and relevant. In addition, each 
Director has demonstrated, and continues 
to demonstrate, excellent commitment to 
the role, ensuring sufficient time is available 
to prepare for meetings or attend non-
scheduled meetings. 
At our AGM in June 2013, we adopted new 
articles that established the UK Corporate 
Governance Code recommendation for all 
directors to submit themselves for re-election 
every year.
This section of the Afren Annual Report 
describes how the Company has applied 
the main principles and complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the year. 
In this report we discuss the key features 
of the governance structures, processes 
and people we have set up to achieve 
our objectives. We have also outlined key 
elements of the activities of the Board and its 
committees during the year. We continue to 
embrace the provisions and principles of the 
Code and the Board will continue to attach 
the highest priority to its compliance with 
the Code’s principles. Our statement below 
explains how we have applied those principles 
in 2013 and, where specific provisions may 
not appear to have been met, provides a 
detailed explanation. 
I am proud of Afren’s commitment to doing 
the right thing for our staff, shareholders 
and the wider community, and of the efforts 
our Directors and staff have made during 
2013 to adopt the spirit of good corporate 
governance. If any shareholder wishes to 
contact me in relation to any of the content 
in this section of the Annual Report, please 
contact me through the Company Secretary 
at the Company’s address.

set out in the Operations review. The financial 
position of the Group at the year end, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial review 
on pages 34 to 39. In addition, section 3 of 
the Notes to the Group financial statements 
includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its financial 
risk management objectives and details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities. 
Note 5.3 describes its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
Afren’s production outlook for 2014 and 
beyond, together with its existing funding 
facilities, provide confidence that the Group 
will continue to generate sufficient working 
capital for the foreseeable future to enable 
it to fund its ongoing exploration and 
development activities.
On the basis of the above, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. They therefore continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the annual financial statements.
Results and dividends
The Group’s profit attributable to 
shareholders for the year was US$516 million 
(restated 2012: US$198 million). The Directors 
have not recommended the payment 
of a dividend (2012: US$nil).
The Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year, 
and subsequently, together with their and 
their families’ beneficial interests in shares 
in the Company, were as shown below. 
Details of Directors’ share options are 
provided in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 99 to 100. 
Political donations
No political donations were made in either 
2013 or 2012.
Directors’ report
The Directors submit their Annual Report on 
the affairs of the Group together with the 
financial statements and audit report of Afren 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2013.  
The Corporate governance statement on pages 
74 to 104 forms part of this Directors’ report.

Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of the Group’s emissions of carbon 
dioxide equivalent from the activities which 
the Group is responsible are provided on 
pages 68 and 69. 
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued 
share capital, together with details of the 
movements in the Company’s issued share 
capital during the year, are shown in note 3.5 
of the financial statements. The Company 
has one class of ordinary shares, which carries 
no right to fixed income. Each share carries 
the right to one vote at general meetings 
of the Company. The ordinary shares reflect 
100% of the total issued nominal value of 
all share capital.
There are no specific restrictions on the size 
of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, 
which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. The Directors are not 
aware of any agreements between holders 
of the Company’s shares that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set 
out in note 5.8.
No person has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital, and 
all issued shares are fully paid. Details of 
significant shareholdings are set out below. 
With regard to the appointment and 
replacement of Directors, the Company 
is governed by its Articles of Association, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Companies Act and related legislation. The 
Articles themselves may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders. The 
powers of Directors are described in the Main 
Board Terms of Reference, copies of which 
are available on request, and the Corporate 
Governance Statement on pages 82 to 87.
In respect of the Group’s assets in Ghana, 
Block 10A in Kenya, the Seychelles and 
Ethiopia, our Partners may have a right of 
first refusal to acquire the Company’s interest 
should a competitor directly or indirectly take 
control of the Company. In relation to the 
Ebok asset, our Partner Oriental would have 
a right to take the role of technical adviser on 
a change of control. In addition, under the 
terms on which the 2016, 2019, and 2020 
Senior Secured Notes were issued, upon a 
change of control, each holder of the notes 
has the right to require Afren to repurchase 
all or any part of its holding.
There are a number of agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company such as commercial 
contracts, bank loan agreements, property 
lease arrangements and employee share 
plans. None of these is considered to be 
significant in terms of their likely impact 
on the business of the Group as a whole. 
Furthermore, there are no agreements 
between the Company and its Directors or 
employees that provide for compensation 
for loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid. 
Substantial shareholdings
As of 25 March 2014 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of the 
Annual Report), interests notified to the 
Company in accordance with Chapter 5

Acquisition of the Company’s  
own shares
At the end of the year the Directors had 
authority, under the shareholders’ resolutions 
of 11 June 2013, to purchase through the 
market 108,906,569 of the Company’s 
ordinary shares at prices, per share, ranging 
between one penny and the higher of (i) the 
amount equal to 105% of the average of 
the closing middle market quotations for an 
ordinary share (as derived from the London 
Stock Exchange Daily Official List) for the five 
business days immediately preceding the day 
on which the ordinary share is purchased and 
(ii) the amount stipulated by article 5(1) of the 
Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulations 2003 
(in each case exclusive of expenses). This 
authority expires on 30 June 2014. 
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at 
the date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
–  so far as the Director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
–  the Director has taken all the steps that  
he ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness 
to continue in office as auditors and a 
resolution to reappoint them will be proposed 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Directors note the revisions to the 2012 
UK Corporate Governance Code introduced 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
in September 2012 and intend to put the 
external audit contract out to tender at least 
every ten years. The timing of the next tender 
will be aligned with the cycle for rotating the 
audit engagement partner. Further details are 
provided in the report of the Audit and Risk 
Committee on page 89.
Annual General Meeting
At the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company, resolutions will be proposed to 
receive these accounts and the Directors’ 
and auditors’ reports. Resolutions will be 
proposed to re-elect all Directors at the

the Company’s Articles of Association and 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
Resolutions will also be proposed to:
–  reappoint Deloitte LLP as the  
Company’s auditors
–  authorise the Directors to fix Deloitte LLP’s 
remuneration as auditors
–  grant the Directors authority to allot

Corporate governance
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Board is responsible for providing 
leadership, setting the Group’s strategic 
objectives and key policies, ensuring 
appropriate resources are in place to enable 
the Group to meet its objectives, reviewing 
the Group’s performance and overseeing 
the Group’s internal control systems, and is 
responsible to shareholders for the proper 
management of the Group. At the end of the 
period of this report, the Board comprised 
a Non-Executive chairman, three Executive 
Directors and six Non-Executive Directors.
Afren benefits from an experienced Board 
which has extensive experience and 
relationships alongside a broad range of 
commercial, financial and other relevant 
expertise. Brief biographies are included on 
pages 78 to 79. The Nomination Committee 
periodically reviews the composition of 
the Board including the balance between 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors and 
considers succession planning for both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and 
the Group’s senior management. It is also 
responsible for the process for new Board 
appointments and makes recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment of new 
Directors, and is responsible for ensuring 
appointments are made on merit and against 
objective criteria. 
In making appointments to the Board, the 
Nomination Committee considers the skills, 
experience and knowledge of the existing 
Directors and assesses which of the potential 
candidates would bring the most benefit 
to the Board. It considers the potential 
candidate’s knowledge and experience of 
the territories in which we operate, the oil 
and gas industry, capital markets and the 
regulatory environment, and, in the case 
of Non-Executive Director appointments, 
that they have sufficient time to devote to 
the role. The Chairman ensures any new 
Directors are provided with a full induction 
on joining the Board. Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial term 
of three years, which may be extended by 
mutual agreement subject to satisfactory 
performance. The letters of appointment of 
each Non-Executive Director are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Non-Executive Directors
Our Non-Executive Directors contribute 
international operational know-how and 
were chosen for their wide range of skills 
and experience. They understand the sectors 
we operate in, and have valuable knowledge 
of international capital markets. In addition 
they bring in-depth understanding of the 
health, safety, environmental, political and 
community challenges we face. 
Each Non-Executive Director is appointed for 
a three-year fixed term, renewable by mutual 
agreement. All Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointment letters are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office.
The Non-Executive Directors:
–  scrutinise, measure and review the 
performance of management
–  assist in strategy development
–  review the Group’s financial information
–  ensure appropriate and effective systems 
of internal control and risk management
–  review the relationship with the  
external auditors through the Audit  
and Risk Committee
–  review the remuneration of, and 
succession planning for, the Board.
Senior Independent Director
Mr Toby Hayward is the Senior Independent 
Director. Mr Hayward was selected for the 
role because of his experience and expertise. 
Mr Hayward is available to shareholders who 
have concerns that cannot be addressed 
through normal channels. 
Independence of 
Non-Executive Directors
The independence of each of the Non-
Executive Directors is considered upon 
appointment, annually and at any other time 
a Director’s circumstances change in a way 
that warrants reconsideration. Following a 
review of Board composition, the Company 
has reassessed the independence of all 
its Non-Executive Directors. It regards all 
as independent within the meaning of 
the term as defined in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Corporate governance statement Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 83
Corporate governance
to exercise objective, unfettered and 
independent judgement or their ability 
to act in the best interests of our business.
In the case of Mr St. John, the Board has 
considered the fact that he is a shareholder 
in St. John Advisors Ltd and a partner in 
STJ Advisors LLP, two companies in the 
financial advisory sector with which Afren has 
had commercial dealings. It is Mr St. John’s 
breadth of expertise, experience, knowledge 
and connections gained while providing 
capital markets advice to companies that 
brings significant value to the Board. Prior 
to Mr St. John’s appointment, the Board 
assessed the relationships between Afren and 
St. John Advisors Ltd and STJ Advisors LLP. 
It remains satisfied that Mr St. John is able to 
apply objective, unfettered and independent 
judgement and act in the best interests of the 
Company, regardless of these relationships.
In addition, any commercial dealings with 
these companies have been approved by 
the independent Non-Executive Directors, 
and will be re-assessed should they continue 
in the future. Mr St.John and the Executive 
Directors absent themselves fully from 
these deliberations.
Transactions during the year that amounted 
to related party transactions under the 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) are outlined in note 5.11 to the 
financial statements. The Company does not 
consider the level of fees paid to St. John 
Advisors Ltd and STJ Advisors LLP to be 
material to either business. All transactions 
with Directors, including Mr St. John, qualify 
under the exemption for smaller related party 
transactions in respect of the Related Party 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. 
Board composition
The Board considers that there is an 
appropriate balance between Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors for governing 
the business effectively and promoting 
shareholder interests. It also considers that 
both Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
have the necessary skills, knowledge and 
experience to enable them to govern the 
business effectively. The Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors met twice during the 
financial year without the Executive Directors 
being present. 
A summary of the skills and experience of the 
Board is shown in the diagram on page 77.
The Board has a policy it uses to determine 
the independence of its Directors. This states 
that the test of independence is whether 
the Director is independent of management 
and any business or other relationship that 
could materially interfere with their exercise 
of objective, unfettered and independent 
judgement or their ability to act in the best 
interests of the shareholders. 
Where a Director is considered by the 
Board to be independent, but is affected 
by circumstances that may give rise to a 
perception that they are not, the Board 
will explain the reasons it has reached its 
conclusion. The Board considers relationships 
with management, major shareholders, 
associated companies and other parties with 
whom the Group transacts business against 
predetermined materiality thresholds, all of 
which are set out in the policy.
Tested against this policy, the Board considers 
that each of the Non-Executive Directors 
has retained independence of character 
and judgement and has not formed 
associations with management or others that 
might compromise their ability to exercise 
independent judgement or act in the best 
interests of the Company.
The Board gave particular consideration 
to the independence of Mr Peter Bingham 
and Mr John St. John. This is because, 
historically, Non-Executive Directors were 
eligible for share option awards prior to the 
Company’s admission to the Official List 
of the United Kingdom Listing Authority in 
December 2009. Mr Bingham exercised all 
his options in September 2013. Mr Bingham 
has been a Director of the Company for 
approximately nine years and will step down 
as Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee 
after the next AGM. Mr St. John is the only 
independent Non-Executive Director who still 
has unexercised options. The Share Option 
Scheme Rules were amended in November 
2009 to prohibit the award of share options 
to Non-Executive Directors. Since Afren’s 
admission to the Official List, no share options 
have been granted to any Non-Executive 
Director. We take the view that this does 
not affect the independence of the Non-
Executive Directors. For more information see 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Some of the Directors hold, or previously 
held, positions in companies we have 
commercial relationships with. The Board 
has assessed all of these relationships and 
concluded that, in all cases, the relationships 
do not interfere with the Directors’ ability

Succession: Board and 
committee membership
Since the beginning of 2013, the following 
changes have taken place to the composition 
of the Board:
–  Ms Sheree Bryant joined the Board as 
Non-Executive Director in October 2013
–  Ms Sheree Bryant joined the Nomination 
Committee in October 2013.
Mr Bingham has been a Director of the 
Company for approximately nine years and 
will step down as Chairman of the Audit 
& Risk Committee after the next AGM, 
as the Board is mindful of the need to 
ensure appropriate succession planning is 
in place, and of the potential impairment 
to independence that can occur when a 
Non-Executive Director has held tenure for a 
significant length of time. This has been part 
of the Board’s agenda for 2014.
Meetings of the Board
The Directors have collective responsibility 
for the conduct of the Group’s business. It is 
expected that all Directors attend scheduled 
Board and relevant committee meetings, 
unless they are prevented from doing so by 
prior commitments, and that all Directors will 
attend the AGM. Where Directors are unable 
to attend meetings, they receive the papers 
scheduled for discussion at the relevant 
meetings, giving them the opportunity 
to raise any issues and give any comments 
to the Chairman in advance of the meeting. 
A table detailing the Directors’ attendance 
at each of the Company’s scheduled Board 
and committee meetings during 2013 is 
included below. 
Board meeting attendance  
in 2013 
During the year the Board held five scheduled 
Board meetings. In addition to the five 
scheduled meetings, the Board also met on 
a quorate basis on five occasions to address 
specific matters. 
Key activities of the  
Board in 2013
Performance
A summary of the Board’s key activities 
during 2013 is shown on page 85. As well 
as the consideration of performance and 
strategic matters, the Board received detailed 
briefings on specific aspects of compliance 
and corporate governance which affect the 
Company and the Group, the Board and their 
respective obligations. 
The Board received a briefing on the Group’s 
anti-corruption policies and procedures and 
the recommended enhancements following 
an internal review to ensure continued best 
practice, and the UK Bribery Act and its 
associated guidance, and will look to approve 
a revised version of the Afren Code of 
Business Conduct to take effect in 2014.
The Board reviewed succession planning 
in consultation with the Nomination 
Committee. It considered in detail the skills 
which will be desirable for non-executive 
appointments, and it kept under review 
the steps being taken to identify further 
non-executive appointments. The Board 
considered the issue of Board diversity, 
the recommendations made by Lord Davies 
in his report entitled Women on Boards, 
and the FRC’s consultation on proposed 
consequential changes to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Board considers that, during 2013, 
an appropriate mix of its time was allocated 
between strategic and operational matters 
and governance-related issues, including 
remuneration strategy.

Corporate governance
Board diversity
The Board recognises that effective 
management of a London-listed African 
and Middle-East focused business involves 
full consideration of diversity matters in our 
appointment procedures for staff at all levels 
of the business. These include factors such as 
socio-economic background, culture and creed, 
nationality, age and gender (the number of 
persons of each sex who were employed by the 
Group at 31 December 2013 is shown on the 
chart opposite). The current Board, for example, 
consists of nationals from the United Kingdom, 
Africa and beyond with a variety of personal 
attributes. We believe this representation 
provides a strong mix of views and experience 
to support our decision-making processes and 
leadership activities.
During our search for additional Non-Executive 
Directors during the year, we ensured that the 
consultancies that we used fully considered 
diversity matters as part of their activities. 
We also made it clear that we would not accept 
male-only candidate shortlists and we eventually 
appointed Ms Sheree Bryant, the Company’s 
first female Director, during the year.
We hope to develop our representation of 
diversity at senior management and Board 
level in the coming years. Clearly this aim will 
be conducted in tandem with the need to 
make appointments on merit and with regard 
to an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge on the Board. 
The Board is pleased, however, to note the 
increasing numbers of women amongst its 
senior management team. These include Anne 
Vallely, our General Counsel, and Jane Barker, 
our Head of Human Resources. Both regularly 
attend Board meetings in an advisory capacity.
Conflicts of interest
The Board has formal procedures for 
managing compliance with the conflicts 
of interest provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. We have procedures for disclosing 
and reviewing any conflicts of interest, actual 
or potential, the Directors may have, and 
the Company’s Articles of Association allow 
the Board to authorise situational conflicts. 
Directors must give advance notice of any 
conflict issues to the Company Secretary, 
and these are considered at the following 
Board meeting. The Board conducts an 
annual review of all previously authorised 
situational conflicts, considering each one 
afresh. Directors are excluded from the 
quorum and the vote on any matters they 
have an interest in. The Board may review 
the authorisation of a conflict matter, 
and the terms of authorisation, at any time. 
In deciding whether to authorise a conflict or 
potential conflict, the Directors must consider 
their general duties under the Companies Act 
2006. The procedure operates to ensure the 
disclosure of conflicts, and for non-conflicted 
Directors to consider and, if appropriate, 
authorise them. The Nomination Committee 
supports the Board in this process, both by 
reviewing requests from Directors, and by 
making recommendations to the Board. 
It can also review any situations of actual 
or potential conflict the Board has previously 
authorised, and make recommendations 
as to whether they remain appropriate. 
Information and  
professional development
All Directors receive an induction on joining 
the Board, tailored to their experience, 
background and areas of focus. Non-
Executive Directors also receive a full briefing 
on all areas of the Company’s business 
from the Executive Directors, the Company 
Secretary and other senior executives, and 
they may request any further information 
they feel is necessary. The Chairman agrees 
the induction plan for each new Director 
and ensures it is appropriate. All Directors 
receive regular briefings to update their skills 
and knowledge, for example on legal and 
regulatory requirements.
Following her appointment to the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director, Ms Sheree Bryant 
attended induction briefings covering the 
Group’s strategy, its organisational structure 
and its business functions and activities, 
including its statutory reporting cycle and 
financing principles, operational activities, 
information technology strategy and legal 
and regulatory issues. She also attended 
sessions addressing corporate governance, 
in compliance with the terms of our Premium 
Listing status.

Evaluation of Board 
performance
The Board undertakes a rigorous review of 
its performance and that of its committees 
each financial year. In March 2014, Armstrong 
Bonham Carter LLP (ABC) conducted a Board 
review which took the form of a facilitated 
self-evaluation by the Board. The review 
included the completion of confidential, 
unattributed questionnaires by each Board 
member, the Company Secretary and Head 
of HR which covered corporate governance, 
Board effectiveness, strategy development, 
risk management and Board and Committee 
organisation, composition, operation and 
dynamics. Each Director assessed themselves, 
and all the other Directors against a number 
of personal effectiveness criteria. The Chairman 
was also assessed on his ability to create the 
conditions for overall Board effectiveness and 
for setting the tone at the top
The facilitators collated and analysed the 
results from each element of the evaluation 
and prepared separate reports, summarising 
key points and including unattributed 
comments given in individual responses. 
The Board and Director reports were initially 
discussed with the Chairman.
The Board report was then presented by 
Armstrong Bonham Carter LLP at a Board 
meeting. Directors received a copy of the 
report on their own effectiveness and these 
were discussed by the Chairman with each 
Director as appropriate. The Chairman received 
feedback on his performance from the Senior 
Independent Director.
Communications with shareholders 
regarding business strategy and financial 
performance are co-ordinated by the Investor 
Relations department, which reports to the 
Acquisitions and Investor Relations Director. 
Communications regarding the general 
administration of shareholdings are co-
ordinated by the Company Secretary.
The Group conducts an investor relations 
programme with institutional investors, 
analysts and the media. This includes 
presentations and roadshows, as well as 
a regular series of one-to-one and group 
meetings and, twice a year, an ‘Investor 
event’ involving detailed presentations on 
the Company’s strategy and performance. 
We publish investor presentations on 
www.afren.com and results presentations 
are available by webcast during the year. 
Additionally, this Annual Report and our 
Half Year Results Announcement, which 
are sent to all registered shareholders, 
contain extensive information about the 
Group’s activities. 
The Board welcomes enquiries from individual 
shareholders, both on matters relating to their 
shareholdings and the business of the Group. 
It also encourages shareholders to attend the 
AGM to discuss the Group’s progress, make 
their views known and to raise any matters 
of concern directly. The Company reports 
formally to shareholders twice a year with 
its half-year and full-year results.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM provides all shareholders 
with the opportunity to develop further their 
understanding of the Company. Shareholders 
can ask questions of the full Board on the 
matters put to the meeting, including the 
Annual Report and the running of the 
Company generally. The Company intends 
to send to shareholders the Notice of AGM 
and any related papers at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. All Directors are 
invited to attend each AGM. At the AGM, 
the Chairman presents a review of the 
Group’s business.
Key conclusions of the 2013 
evaluation
The Board had continued to make progress 
both year on year and since the first review 
conducted by ABC in May 201 1 and continues 
to be effective. The review suggested further 
improvement in the development of strategy, 
Board composition in relation to diversity and 
succession plans, independent benchmarking 
of the EHSS function and understanding 
employee attitudes.
The review also reported that the Group’s 
Committees had continued to improve 
their effectiveness. 
Shareholder communication
The Board maintains a dialogue with 
investors, aimed at ensuring a mutual 
understanding of objectives. Its primary 
contact is through the Executive Directors, 
but the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
also contact major shareholders periodically 
and in advance of the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) each year, to understand 
their views on the Company and to ensure 
their views are communicated to the Board 
as a whole. Similarly, the Senior Independent 
Director and the other Non-Executive 
Directors are available to meet with 
major shareholders.
At least twice a year, the Acquisitions 
and Investor Relations Director presents 
a report to the Board on investor relations 
generally, identifying the key issues raised 
by institutional shareholders. In addition, 
the Board receives a report at each of its 
meetings on any changes to the holdings 
of the Company’s main institutional 
shareholders. Specific issues raised by 
individual institutions are also reported 
to the Board, as appropriate.

Dear Shareholder
This year proved to be another busy one for 
the Nomination Committee. Following the 
decision by the Board to appoint a further 
Non-Executive Director, the Committee 
initiated an extensive selection process to 
identify suitable candidates to join the Board. 
With the assistance of specialist recruitment 
consultants, Odgers Berndtson, it undertook 
a planned recruitment exercise to agreed 
criteria for the role, shortlisting two 
candidates from an initial long list. Each 
Committee member met the final candidates 
and the Committee recommended 
Ms Sheree Bryant’s appointment.
We remain committed to our aspiration that 
a significant proportion of our Board should 
be female by 2015. In the case of Ms Sheree 
Bryant’s appointment as Non-Executive 
Director in 2013, we asked our search 
consultants to ensure that female candidates 
were included on our long and short lists for 
the role, and ultimately concluded that Sheree 
was the best candidate. We are currently 
considering a number of candidates for 
appointment to the Board. Mr Peter Bingham 
will step down from his role as Chairman of 
the Audit and Risk Committee after the AGM 
in June 2014, and we hope to recommend 
a candidate to the Board to replace him 
in this role. We will continue to ask our search 
consultants to include female candidates 
in searches. We are committed to appointing 
new Directors on merit, while seeking 
to strengthen the diversity of the Board. 
The Committee will continue to monitor 
diversity for the Group as a whole.

Dear Shareholder
I will be stepping down as Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee, having held the 
role for the last two years and having been 
a member for the last nine years. 
The Committee’s role is to provide support 
to the Board on areas of risk which have 
grown substantially as the business has 
expanded and on the communication of 
these through the Group’s financial reporting 
and audit processes, and the impact 
Corporate Governance has added to the 
work of the Committee. 
We continue to work closely with senior 
management and our external auditors 
and a detailed resumé of our discussions at 
meetings during 2013 form part of this report. 
We derive considerable comfort from the 
appointment of a Senior Internal Audit 
Manager which has improved our knowledge 
of, and provided comfort in, the area of 
controls throughout the Group.
We reviewed the Company’s current controls 
for anti-bribery legislation and the treatment 
of EHSS issues and were satisfied that they 
are compliant with guidelines but are an 
ongoing area of focus for improvement 
in 2014.
The main audit and risk item considered 
in the year was that related to the valuation 
of intangible exploration and evaluation 
assets. These are accounted for using 
the “successful efforts” method and the 
Committee scrutinised the judgements made 
in assessing whether any impairment was 
necessary. We concluded, after discussion 
with the external auditors, that the balances 
are appropriately stated in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policy and, where 
required, impairments have been recorded 
appropriately in the year. 
Finally, I would like to record my appreciation 
for all the support that I have received during 
these exciting early years of Afren’s existence.

Corporate governance
Internal control and  
risk management
The Board has applied principle C.2 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
by establishing a continuous process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks the Group faces. The Audit 
and Risk Committee assists the Board 
in discharging its review responsibilities.
The Directors conduct reviews of Afren’s 
overall system of risk management and 
internal control through reports from 
management and the external auditors, and 
through the findings of internal audit reviews, 
in accordance with the requirements of the 
revised Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control, 
published by the FRC, and the Code. These 
systems have been operating throughout 
2013 and to the date of this report.
The Group also maintains a Risk Register, 
which contains the key risks the Group faces, 
including their likelihood and impact, as well 
as the controls and procedures implemented 
to mitigate these risks. Regular discussions 
with senior management determine the 
content of the Register, which the Audit 
and Risk Committee reviews. These key risks 
are summarised on pages 30 to 33 of the 
Strategic report section of this Annual Report.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control, and for the 
ongoing review of its effectiveness. Such 
a system is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. It can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Internal audit procedures
Throughout 2013, we have made significant 
progress in developing a formal internal audit 
department for the Group. A Senior Internal 
Audit Manager was appointed in February 
2013 to oversee this function.
The Senior Internal Audit Manager has 
direct access and responsibility to the 
Audit and Risk Committee, and his main 
responsibilities include:
–  carrying out internal audit and 
compliance monitoring work, supported 
by independent specialist consultants 
as required, addressing financial and 
operational risk management objectives 
across the Group.
–  evaluating and developing the Group’s 
overall internal control environment and 
its processes for risk identification  
and management.
These responsibilities were presented 
to, and approved by, the Audit and Risk 
Committee at its meeting on 18 March 2013. 
At its meeting on 3 December 2013, the 
Committee approved the Group’s internal 
audit charter, internal audit strategy and 
internal audit plan for 2014.
Key areas of focus in 2013 were:
–  implementing a formal risk-based internal 
audit programme, aligned to professional 
standards and guidelines.
–  developing the annual risk-based audit 
plan to review and assess the effectiveness 
of business controls.
–  reviewing a range of asset processes 
to assess the adequacy and effectiveness 
of key process controls.
–  supporting the development of the 
Business Risk Management System.
Financial management  
and reporting
During the year, the Audit and Risk Committee 
reviewed, before publication, the half-year 
and annual financial statements, and other 
major statements affecting the Group that 
concerned price-sensitive information. 
In monitoring the financial reporting practices, 
the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the 
accounting policies, areas of judgement, 
going concern assumption, and compliance 
with accounting standards, the Disclosure 
and Transparency rules, and the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. These 
matters were discussed with management 
and reviewed alongside reports presented 
by the Group’s external auditors. The key 
matters reviewed by the Committee through 
the year and as part of the year-end 
process were:
 Early adoption of IFRS 10 and the 
resulting consolidation of FHN, and the 
acquisition of additional interests in FHN 
During the year, the Audit and Risk 
Committee paid particular attention to the 
adoption of IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial 
Statements” and the resulting consolidation 
of FHN. It reviewed a comprehensive paper 
prepared by management on the adoption 
of IFRS 10, which covered the matters 
considered in reaching the different control 
conclusion under IFRS 10 compared to 
IAS 27, as well as other related effects of the 
change in accounting policy. Further details 
are included in note 1.6 to the attached 
financial statements. Management prepared 
this in conjunction with advice provided by 
an independent accounting advisory firm, 
KPMG, who were engaged on the matter. 
The Audit and Risk Committee discussed the 
adoption of IFRS 10 with the Group auditors, 
who were satisfied that the judgements 
made were appropriate, and that changes 
to accounting were applied accurately.
Following a review of the papers presented, 
and discussion with management and the 
Group auditors, the Committee was satisfied 
that all relevant matters had been considered 
before the early adoption of IFRS 10, and that 
the judgements made in reaching the control 
conclusion for the consolidation of FHN were 
balanced and appropriate. Further details of 
the impact of this change in accounting policy 
are included in notes 1.4, 1.6 and 5.15 of the 
financial statements.  Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 92
Corporate governance
 Corporate governance statement continued
Furthermore, the Committee considered the 
accounting for the acquisition of additional 
interests in FHN during the year, which, under 
IFRS 10, represented a transaction with non-
controlling shareholders. Having considered 
and questioned explanations provided by 
management, the Committee concluded that 
the approach adopted was in accordance 
with the relevant requirements. Further 
details of the increase in Afren’s shareholding 
in FHN are provided in note 5.10 of the 
financial statements.
Valuation of intangible exploration 
and evaluation assets
During the year, the Group continued to 
conduct exploration and evaluation (E&E) 
work on its portfolio of exploration licences. 
We follow the successful efforts method of 
accounting for E&E assets, which prescribes 
capitalising costs incurred on E&E activities 
until commerciality is determined, or if 
deemed unsuccessful, costs are expensed.
The Committee examined the judgements 
management made in assessing whether 
there were any indicators of impairment 
of E&E assets. Where such indicators existed, 
it considered the evidence to support 
whether or not an impairment existed. 
The Committee challenged management 
on the application of the Group accounting 
policy in respect of individual assets, and, 
after due consideration, concluded that E&E 
balances and impairment charges recorded 
in the year were appropriately stated in 
accordance with the Group accounting policy. 
Review of oil and gas assets  
for impairment
The requirements to assess non-current assets 
for indicators of impairment are described 
in note 4.4 (d) of the attached financial 
statements. At each reporting date, the 
Committee considers a report provided by 
management which explains the internal and 
external factors which could be indicative of 
impairment and their relevance to the Group’s 
assets in the period. Factors considered 
include changes in the oil price, increases in 
actual or expected operating costs or capital 
costs required to access reserves, significant 
variations in the field performance compared 
to expectations, and any adverse geopolitical 
events. During the year, no indicators of 
impairment were noted which would require 
a full impairment test to be undertaken. 
In respect of OML 26, where an impairment 
test is required each year due to associated 
goodwill, we received a paper prepared 
by management summarising their 
impairment review and associated inputs 
and assumptions, and the conclusion that 
no impairment was required.
Taxation and royalty liabilities 
The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions 
in which the Group operates can be uncertain 
and subject to interpretation. The Committee 
reviews management’s judgements at least 
twice a year. 
As part of the review of the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 
2013, the Committee considered a 
paper prepared by management, which 
documented all significant judgements and 
interpretations relating to tax and royalty 
accounting and, in particular, the accounting 
adjustments made to recognise the effect 
of qualifying for a five-year tax exemption 
for the Group’s Ebok asset in Nigeria. 
In arriving at its conclusion that the 
judgements made are appropriate, the 
Committee noted that management’s 
judgements had been formed having 
consulted internal and external tax 
advisors, and the Group auditors. 
Interpretation of licence terms
The Group’s licence terms are complex and 
are subject to interpretation and negotiation. 
The Committee has received accounting 
papers prepared by management regarding 
amendments which were made to the Ebok 
and Okoro licence terms during 2013. Based 
on these papers, as well as discussions by the 
Board of Directors on the commercial rationale 
for the amendments, and discussions with our 
external auditors, the Committee concluded 
that the accounting treatments adopted by 
the Group were appropriate.
Where licences include residual profit interest 
in fields, we discussed the calculation of these 
with management and with the Group’s 
external auditors. The Committee is satisfied 
that the amounts accrued in relation to these 
liabilities reflect a balanced assessment of the 
Group’s potential exposure, and notes the 
estimate uncertainty as described in note 1.6 
of the Group’s financial statements.  Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 93
Corporate governance
External audit
The Audit and Risk Committee has 
recommended to the Board that 
the current auditors, Deloitte LLP, be 
reappointed as external auditors. In making 
the recommendation, it has taken into 
consideration the independence matters 
noted below and the past service of 
the auditors, who were first appointed 
in 2005 following a full tender process. 
The Committee has also noted the revisions 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code 
introduced by the Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) in September 2012 and, in particular, 
the recommendation to put the external audit 
out to tender at least every ten years. The 
FRC has proposed non-binding transitional 
arrangements with respect to tendering, 
including a recommendation that tendering 
should ordinarily fit the five-yearly cycle of 
audit partner rotation. Under the proposed 
guidelines, the Committee would recommend 
an external audit tender by 2019 or earlier 
if it has cause to do so. 
The Committee has also concluded that there 
are no contractual obligations to restrict the 
choice of external auditors. It has a policy 
for assessing whether to employ the external 
auditors to supply services other than audit 
services, and closely monitors the level of 
audit and non-audit services the external 
auditors provide to the Group. Non-audit 
services are normally limited to assignments 
closely related to the annual audit, or where 
the work requires a detailed understanding 
of the Group.
The external auditors are specifically excluded 
from providing internal audit services, 
litigation support, remuneration advice 
and legal advice services. The Committee 
assesses every other piece of non-audit work 
separately, and awards it depending on 
which professional services firm it considers 
best suited. In addition, the Chairman of the 
Audit and Risk Committee must approve 
any non-audit work with a total fee greater 
than 25% of the annual audit fee before the 
appointment is made.
The Board is satisfied that this policy 
is conducive to maintaining auditor 
independence and objectivity. During the 
year, external auditors performed a significant 
amount of non-audit work in relation to the 
Circular to Shareholders dealing with the 
acquisition of a beneficial interest of 10.4% 
in FHN and the issuing of Senior Secured 
Notes in December 2013. This is work 
external auditors would ordinarily perform 
for companies involved in such projects. 
The Committee is satisfied that carrying out 
this work has not impaired the independence 
of the external auditors.
A breakdown of the fees paid to the external 
auditors in respect of audit and non-audit 
work is included in note 5.2 to the  
financial statements.
Control framework  
and activities
The Board has established a management 
structure with defined lines of responsibility 
and clear delegation of authority. The various 
committees are key elements of the overall 
control structure. These include the Executive 
Committee, which is responsible for all 
strategic and operational activities day-to-day. 
The Group has developed a formal structured 
business planning process, which operates 
on an annual cycle. The Board approves the 
consolidated annual budget, and performance 
against budget is monitored and reported to 
the Board. 
The Group’s risk management process is 
described on pages 28 to 29. The Audit and 
Risk Committee and senior executives of the 
Company regularly review significant risks, 
their potential impact on the Group’s financial 
position, and actions taken to manage those 
risks during the year. Afren plc

 Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration 
Committee 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you, on behalf of 
the Board, the Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
2013 was another year of extraordinary 
operational achievement and record results 
as a result of strong performance by your 
management team. The Group achieved record 
revenues of circa US$1.64 billion and operating 
cash flow of US$1.2 billion on the back of a 
7 .5% increase in our production to over 47 ,000 
boepd net to Afren. We continue to build an 
outstanding exploration and appraisal track 
record, including the world-class Ogo discovery 
on OPL 310 in Nigeria and the Simrit discovery 
in Kurdistan. Notably, according to Wood 
Mackenzie, Ogo was the third largest global 
discovery in 2013, a remarkable accolade for 
a company of our size. These achievements, 
along with our 2P reserves replacement ratio 
reaching 201%, position us well ahead of our 
peer group. We are now well positioned for 
future success across the whole E&P lifecycle 
with a rich opportunity set of production, 
near term development and high-impact 
exploration. Supporting our cash generative 
production base is a robust capital structure 
and we successfully extended the maturity of 
a component of our debt obligations over the 
period. Our share price performance at the end 
of 2013 was again outstanding, with our TSR 
at 23%, outperforming the FTSE All Share, the 
FTSE 100 and FTSE 350 oil and gas indices. 
We have continued to grow our organisation 
with the recruitment of over 50 talented and 
skilled employees last year across all locations, 
despite strong competition for human capital 
in  the sector. A description of how our KPIs 
relate to our strategy is covered on page 22.
Our remuneration philosophy is clear. We reward 
exceptional achievement in order to retain the 
most able people in a highly competitive talent 
market. We believe this will lead to a sustained 
increase in the value of the Company for the 
benefit of all its stakeholders. In pursuit of this 
philosophy, we offer a basic package which 
is above average in the markets in which the 
Company competes for executive talent.
The graph below shows how, in line with this 
philosophy, the Government-defined “single 
total figure of remuneration” for the Chief 
Executive has developed over the past five 
years compared with Company performance 
– expressed both as total shareholder return 
performance compared to that of companies 
in the FTSE 250 index and through the 
Key Performance Indicators of Reserves 
Replacement Ratio Percentage and Net Effective 
Working Interest Production boepd. The drop 
in total remuneration shown in the graph for 
2013 is due to the fact that the Directors did 
not receive the annual Performance Share Plan 
grants in 2010 and this has a knock on effect 
in terms of shares vesting in 2013.

Corporate governance
However, despite positive comments from 
institutional investors, 80% of the votes 
cast were not in favour of the resolution 
to approve last year’s report. This hugely 
disappointing outcome was due in large part 
to the payment of an additional exceptional 
performance award to Executive Directors for 
enhanced project delivery in addition to their 
annual bonus payment. 
In response to this, Afren has implemented a 
new annual bonus plan for senior executives, 
which is described in the future policy table 
on pages 101 and 102 and in respect of 
which you will have a binding vote at the 
Annual General Meeting in June. This new 
plan removes the possibility of any future 
additional exceptional performance awards 
for Executive Directors whilst recognising 
and rewarding them for the achievement of 
challenging KPIs. There is also a requirement 
that 50% of any bonus award must be 
deferred for three years in  
the form of Afren shares. In addition,  
bonus awards may be clawed back under  
certain circumstances. 
Further, to help meet investors’ concerns  
we have:
•  Reduced the level of vesting of awards 
made under the Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) for achieving median TSR 
performance relative to the peer groups 
from 30% to 25% of the award. The 
maximum award remains at shares to the 
value of 200% of salary. 
•  Restricted base salary increases for 
Executive Directors to RPI inflation in 2014 
(2.6% in the UK and 1.1% in the USA). 
The average increase for employees across 
the Group was 6.5% for 2014.
•  Revised the Company’s shareholding policy 
for Executive Directors to require the CEO 
to achieve a shareholding (not including 
unexercised share options and outstanding 
PSP awards) equivalent to at least five 
times annual salary. The corresponding 
requirement for other Executive Directors 
has been increased to twice their salary. 
In addition, each of the Executive Directors 
has committed to retain any shares received in 
2014 through their participation in the PSP for 
a period of not less than six months following 
the vesting date, excluding sales to cover tax 
(the PSP rules provide that the vesting period 
cannot be less than three years). 
The following pages of this report explain 
Afren’s remuneration arrangements for the 
past year, describe our forward remuneration 
policy for the next three years, and explain 
how we intend to implement it for the 
coming year. If you wish to contact me 
in relation to any aspect of the Company’s 
Director and senior executive remuneration 
arrangements, please do so through the 
Company Secretary at the Company’s 
address. I should be pleased to hear 
from you.
Toby Hayward 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  
26 March 2014
In 2013, the UK Executive Directors received 
salary increases of 2.7% and the US Executive 
Director an increase of 2.2% (2012: zero). 
The performance of Executive Directors in 
respect of corporate and project-related 
KPIs on which annual bonus awards are 
based was rated as “Exceptional” as defined 
within the terms of the annual bonus plan. 
Accordingly, and in line with the newly 
approved Executive Bonus Scheme, annual 
bonuses have been awarded in respect 
of 2013 performance equivalent to 190% 
of base salary for the Chief Executive and 
152% of base salary for the other Executive 
Directors (95% of maximum potential in both 
cases). Under the terms of the new scheme, 
50% of the annual bonus award is deferred 
for three years and will be paid in the form 
of Afren shares. In addition, Executive 
Directors received an award under the rules 
of the Performance Share Plan of conditional 
shares to the value of 200% of salary. 
Our remuneration philosophy had previously 
given rise to some concerns among investors 
and we have taken these seriously and 
have consulted extensively with institutional 
investors to understand their views. Since 
June last year, we have taken a number of 
steps to address the issues raised and we feel 
that the changes made overall will deliver 
a remuneration policy which fully supports 
the achievement of our business objectives 
and strategy and the interests of our long- 
term shareholders. Generally speaking, the 
changes made to the schemes that were set 
out in last year’s report were well-received 
by institutional investors, who recognised 
the steps being taken by the Company in 
relation to both the design and reporting 
of remuneration. I should like to express my 
appreciation of the time and consideration 
afforded to me and my colleagues by 
our institutions and of their willingness 
to engage in a constructive and continuing 
consultation process. 
I am delighted to share with you that Afren 
won two prestigious awards in 2013:
–   The Investor Relations Society’s Most 
Effective Overall Annual Report in the 
FTSE 250 at the 2013 Best Practice 
Awards in November 2013, and
–   The Institute of Chartered Secretaries 
and Administrators’ Best Strategy and 
Risk Disclosure – FTSE 250 at the 2013 
Transparency in Governance Awards 
in November 2013. Afren plc

1. Introduction
Report preparation 
The Remuneration Committee has prepared 
this report in accordance with the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendments) 
Regulations 2013 (the Regulations) which came 
into force on 1 October 2013. It is divided into 
the following sections:
•  Our annual report on remuneration  
for the year to 31 December 2013;
•  The Company’s forward  
remuneration policy; and 
•  A statement about the way in which 
the Company intends to implement 
its remuneration policy in 2014.
In accordance with the Regulations and 
the Companies Act 2006(a), our forward 
remuneration policy will be subject to a 
separate binding shareholder vote at the 
Annual General Meeting in June. Subject to 
shareholders’ approval, it is intended that 
this policy will remain in place for three years 
starting on the day after the AGM. In addition, 
as has been the case in previous years, we 
will also be asking for an advisory vote on the 
remainder of this report at the AGM.
Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code
The Remuneration Committee believes 
that the Company complies with the Main 
Principles and Provisions of Section D of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. Earlier 
variances from the Provisions dating from 
before the Company’s main market listing  
have all now been addressed. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities 
have been set by the Board and are set out 
in its terms of reference which are available 
in the Corporate Governance section of 
the Company’s website. In summary, it is 
responsible for determining remuneration for 
the Executive Directors and additionally the 
Executive Team in consultation with the Chief 
Executive. The Committee takes into account 
the need to recruit and retain executives 
in a challenging market environment. 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee 
received advice internally from the Human 
Resources Director and Company Secretary. 
The Committee’s principal external advisers 
were MM&K Limited, who provided services 
both to the Committee and to Company 
management in connection with Directors’ 
and executives’ remuneration policy, incentive 
plan design, performance measures and 
market practice. MM&K’s fees for assisting 
the Committee during the year amounted 
to approximately £40,000. The Committee is 
satisfied that any potential conflicts of interest 
that arose in MM&K’s advising both the 
Committee and management were avoided 
by the advisory and reporting procedures 
followed. MM&K is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants’ Group and adheres 
to its code of conduct. Longnecker and 
Associates provided additional compensation 
benchmarking services.

The Executive Directors do not have any interest in any Afren Group defined benefit plan. In 2013 they participated in defined contribution 
plans according to the policy described on page 101.
Directors’ share and share scheme interests
The Company has a policy requiring Executive Directors to retain shares acquired through the share option scheme, performance share plan 
and deferred bonus plans until a target shareholding is achieved. The target level is a holding of value equal to five times current annual basic 
salary for the Chief Executive (he currently holds in excess of five times salary) and twice salary for other Executive Directors (both currently 
hold in excess of twice salary). Unvested performance shares and un-exercised share options do not count towards this total. However, 
the Director may sell sufficient shares to cover any personal tax payable at vesting and the exercise price of share options.

to execute the Company’s business strategy. 
Operation Salary only. No separate Directors’ fees. Reviewed annually with changes effective 1 January 
if appropriate.
Opportunity Reviews based on market comparisons and increases to other Group staff. Details of salaries for 2014 
are shown in the implementation statement on page 104. Increases in Executive Director salaries will 
not exceed the average staff increase in the Group. 
Performance metrics None

Performance metrics None
Benefits
Purpose/Link to corporate strategy Insured benefits are included to provide employee protection for the benefit of the employee 
and Company.
Operation Entitlement contained in service agreements. Insured benefits provided as part of Group schemes. 
Should it be appropriate to recruit a Director from overseas, flexibility is retained to provide benefits 
that take account of those typically provided in their country of residence.
Opportunity Private medical insurance 
Life assurance
Critical illness cover
Income protection policy 
Car allowance 
Club membership for business and personal use
Performance metrics None
Annual bonus plan
Purpose/Link to corporate strategy To incentivise and focus attention on Company KPIs; to reward the achievement of EHSS, financial, 
operational and individual targets and provide a competitive performance-related annual earnings 
opportunity; compulsory deferral element into shares provides alignment with investors.
Operation Targets and KPIs set at start of year. 80% of opportunity is based on corporate achievement and 
20% on individual performance. 50% of the award is paid in cash soon after the year-end and 
50% is deferred into Company shares for three years with no further performance conditions. 
Delivery of shares depends on continued employment. Clawback applied for material mis-statement 
or serious misconduct.
Opportunity Maximum bonus for exceptional achievement (including deferred amounts) is 200% salary for 
the Chief Executive and 160% of salary for other Executive Directors. For excellent achievement, 
125% and 110% of salary respectively and for good achievement (threshold) 80% of salary 
for all Executive Directors. Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 102
Corporate governance
Performance metrics Company element based on challenging corporate, operational, EHSS and financial KPIs; measures, 
targets and weightings are set in respect of each financial year. Personal element based on 
performance measures set each financial year relevant to the individual’s role and accountabilities; 
details of the corporate performance measures applicable in the current financial year are contained 
in the policy implementation statement on page 104. All bonus payments are at the discretion 
of the Committee. 
2008 Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Purpose/Link to corporate strategy Aligns executives with long-term interests of shareholders by rewarding sustained increase 
in shareholder value and longer-term execution of business strategy. 
Operation Annual grant of contingent shares or nil-price options. Vesting based on performance measured 
over not less than three years from grant; discretion to provide equivalent of dividends on the vested 
shares in cash or shares. No further retention period but the current Directors have committed 
to hold shares for at least six months after transfer. (See page 98 for general shareholding policy.)
Opportunity Face value of award up to the value of 200% of salary per annum, with Remuneration Committee 
discretion to award up to 300% in exceptional circumstances (for example, to compensate 
a Director for loss of awards made under a plan operated by a previous employer (see Recruitment 
policy on page 103).
Performance metrics A combination of market and non-market related performance measures are set prior to each 
award. Market-related performance may be measured relative to comparable companies and/or 
a relevant index; non-market related measures reflect one or more strategic KPIs. Vesting is zero 
for below threshold performance, 25% at threshold and 100% at stretch with ‘straight line’ vesting 
between these levels. Where performance is measured relative to a market benchmark or index, 
threshold performance is median and stretch performance upper quartile. Targets for other types 
of measures will be set at a similar level of challenge. Under the rules of the plan, as approved 
by shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to amend performance conditions 
in exceptional circumstances to maintain the level of challenge. Any such changes will be reported 
in the following Remuneration Report. The Committee will take into account the underlying financial 
performance of the Company. Details of the performance measures and targets applicable to PSP 
awards made or to be made in the current financial year are contained in the policy implementation 
statement on page 104.
2005 Executive share option plan
Purpose/Link to corporate strategy Introduced during Afren’s original AIM listing. Currently employed Executive Directors no longer 
participate. The plan is now used as part of a recruitment strategy to attract top quality talent at 
a senior level below the Board with the objective of providing equivalent long-term interest and 
competitive opportunity to joiners as compensation for amounts lost at a previous employer. 
Operation Operates within approved dilution limits; exercise price is market value at grant date, with exercise 
up to 20% after one year; a further 20% after two years; and remaining 60% after three years, 
subject to performance metrics. Options eligible for exercise up to ten years from grant.
Opportunity Grant levels reflect the Remuneration Committee’s view of what represents reasonable compensation 
for amounts lost at previous employer (see Recruitment policy on page 103).
Performance metrics Options not exercisable until share price has remained more than 40% above market price at grant, 
on average, for three continuous months.
Non-Executive Directors
Annual fee
Purpose/Link to corporate strategy Competitive fee to recruit and retain.
Operation Fixed element currently paid in cash. Supplementary fees are paid for additional 
Board responsibilities. 
Opportunity Fees are determined in accordance with market practice; the Remuneration Committee recommends 
the Chairman’s fees to the Board and the Board decides on fees for other NEDs, including the Senior 
Independent Director; committee fees are not identified separately; increases to the Chairman’s and 
NED fees will not exceed the average increase to staff over a three year period. Current fees for the 
Chairman and the other NEDs are contained in the policy implementation statement on page 104.
Performance metrics None
Directors’ remuneration report continued
3. Directors’ remuneration policy continued Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 103
Corporate governance
Recruitment policy
The Company’s philosophy is that all Directors 
should be remunerated at an appropriate level 
based on Afren’s remuneration policy and 
taking into account the experience and calibre 
of the individual. The remuneration policy set 
out on pages 101 and 102 will therefore apply 
equally to new and existing Directors. 
However, a new Director recruited from outside 
the Company may be offered relocation or 
housing allowances and the Company may 
agree to compensate such a Director to a value 
not exceeding the amount of remuneration 
foregone for loss of earnings or the accrued 
value of incentive plans from his or her previous 
employer. A new Director appointed from 
within the Company, whose remuneration 
arrangements fall outside the Company’s 
remuneration policy for Directors, will continue 
to be entitled to receive any remuneration 
to which he or she was previously entitled.
Policy on payment for loss 
of office
Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for 
a maximum of 12 months’ notice. The letters 
of appointment for Non-Executive Directors 
provide for three months’ notice. 
On termination of an Executive Director’s service 
contract, the Company’s policy is to pay the salary 
and benefits to which the executive is contractually 
entitled. There is no contractual entitlement to 
receive any bonus or the value of any unexercised 
share options or unvested awards under the PSP . 
Depending on the circumstances, the Company 
may decide to make a bonus payment in respect 
of the period up to the termination date and to 
permit the exercise of share options or the vesting 
of PSP awards in accordance with the relevant plan 
rules as approved by shareholders on adoption. It 
is not the Company’s policy to make any payments 
in respect of bonus or to permit the exercise 
of options or the vesting of share awards if the 
Company is entitled to dismiss a Director for cause. 
Obligations in service contracts
There are no obligations to individuals in service 
contracts or letters of appointment which 
will give rise to an entitlement beyond that 
described in the policy table and the Policy  
on payment for loss of office.
Discretions retained by the 
Remuneration Committee
Within the future remuneration policy and 
recruitment policy as described, the areas of 
discretion for the Board and/or Remuneration 
Committee lie principally in the operation of the 
2005 Share Option Plan and 2008 Performance 
Share Plan, the rules of both of which have been 
approved by members in General Meeting. 
Both plans place a normal limit on the face value 
of individual grants to 200% of salary in any 
one year, but allow a higher level in exceptional 
circumstances. The 2005 plan sets no limit on the 
exceptional amount but restricts the circumstance 
to the recruitment of a top executive. The 
Committee is unlikely to award in excess of 
300% of salary in such a case. The 2008 plan 
sets a limit of 300% but does not specify the 
nature of the exceptional circumstance. The 
Board considers that this is also only likely to  
arise in the case of external recruitment.
Both plans allow the Board to set performance 
vesting conditions at the time of grant. Such 
conditions will, in future, be disclosed to 
shareholders in the coming year’s implementation 
statement (unless the Board considers that such 
disclosure has commercial sensitivity). In both 
plans the Remuneration Committee has discretion 
to vary the performance conditions to reflect 
changed circumstances, but such discretion has to 
be exercised fairly and reasonably and must ensure 
that the amended conditions are no more or less 
difficult to satisfy than when they were originally 
imposed. A similar discretion covers adjustments 
to scheme interests to avoid any advantage 
or disadvantage to a plan participant following 
changes in the capital structure of the Company.
Both plans allow the Board or Remuneration 
Committee to determine that a leaver is to 
be treated as a ‘good leaver’ for the purposes 
of option exercise although they do not come 
within the normal plan definition of a good 
leaver. In the 2008 plan, the Committee may 
waive the normal requirement for pro-rating 
a good leaver award vesting for time and may 
waive the normal requirement for pro-rating for 
both performance and time that apply in the 
case of a change in control. With any material 
changes, where possible, the Committee 
consults with shareholders beforehand.
Illustration of the application 
of remuneration policy.
The charts to the right show the level of reward 
that each of the Executive Directors can expect 
in the three scenarios of (1) low performance 
– where no performance related remuneration 
is earned, (2) performance in line with target 
and (3) high performance where the maximum 
annual bonus and LTI vesting are earned. 
In compliance with the Regulations, no account 
is taken of possible share price increases.
Consideration of conditions 
elsewhere in Group
Afren has a diverse working population across 
the Group operating out of six countries/region 
(UK, USA, Nigeria, Kenya, Madagascar and the 
Kurdistan region of Iraq). Our reward structures 
have been designed to meet local requirements 
whilst reflecting our Group-wide remuneration 
policies and philosophy.
The major objective of the Group remuneration 
policy is to ensure that there is a clear link between 
each employee’s individual level of performance 
and their reward. Afren’s aim is to achieve an 
integrated approach to reward, linking Company 
strategy in the form of the achievement of 
corporate objectives and individual performance to 
salary increases and bonus awards. These, along 
with other factors such as market positioning and 
the overall reward budget, go into the annual 
salary and bonus review process for all employees 
including the Executive team.
This ensures that a co-ordinated and consistent 
approach is taken – encouraging and supporting 
a high-performance culture whilst ensuring 
fairness and transparency across the Group.
Statement of consideration 
of shareholders’ views
The concerns of shareholders and actions 
taken to address them are discussed in the 
statement of the Remuneration Committee 
chairman on pages 94 and 95.

implementation
The total bonus available to be awarded 
(including the 50% that is deferred) is based 
80% on the achievement of corporate targets 
and 20% on individual performance. 
The corporate targets are split between 
strategic KPIs and project goals.
There are four corporate KPIs and a series 
of project KPIs which are taken into account 
in setting the bonus. The corporate KPIs are: 
KPI Measure
Growth in reserves Reserves replacement 
ratio
Average production 
for the year
Working interest 
production
Improvement in 
operating efficiency
Normalised operating 
cost per barrel
Improvement 
in CSR and 
EHSS performance
Balanced scorecard of 
EHSS and CSR projects
The project elements reward performance 
against a series of development, exploration/
appraisal and M&A projects. The weighting 
varies between projects. 
Points for each project are awarded for 
achievement of the work programme with 
additional points for achievement of the 
programme within budget.
The corporate and project related targets 
will not be disclosed at this stage for reasons 
of commercial sensitivity. In the remuneration 
report for 2014, to be presented in 2015, 
the Board will consider whether it can present 
these targets and will report accordingly.

2014 grants
The Remuneration Committee expects 
to grant performance shares to Executive 
Directors in line with the normal maximum 
under the policy (see Policy Table on pages 
101 and 102. Vesting of these shares will 
be dependent on three year corporate 
performance as follows:
30% dependent on Total Shareholder Return 
relative to FTSE 250
70% dependent on Total Shareholder Return 
relative to the following peer group of 26

There is an underpinning performance 
measure, namely the Reserves Replacement 
Ratio (RRR). RRR is the ratio of number of 
barrels of oil equivalent (proved and probable) 
discovered or acquired to the number 
produced over the three-year period. Any 
shares due to vest under the TSR measure 
will be reduced if the Group fails to meet its 
three-year target for RRR. The vesting level 
will be reduced by a percentage of maximum 
vesting which is the same as the percentage 
of the production barrels by which the RRR 
fall short of target. RRR is the critical indicator 
of sustainability and growth leading to long-
term profitability. Both the minimum TSR and 
RRR targets have to be achieved before any 
PSP shares vest. This means the performance 
challenge is considerably higher than that 
implied by relative TSR performance alone 
and the performance for minimum vesting 
represents substantially more than median 
overall performance.

 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also 
chosen to prepare the Parent Company financial statements under 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit and loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
–  properly select and apply accounting policies; 
–  present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; 
–  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
–  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
I confirm to the best of my knowledge:
1.  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
2.  The strategic report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
3.  The annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Afren plc
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•  the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Company Balance Sheets, 
the Group and Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group and Company Cash Flow Statements and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ report on page 80 that the Group is a going concern.  
We confirm that:
•  we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements 
is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Recoverability of intangible exploration and evaluation  
(E&E) assets
IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources” requires 
management to consider whether there are facts and circumstances 
indicating that the entity should test E&E assets for impairment. 
This involves the use of significant judgment both in the review 
of impairment indicators and in any subsequent impairment test, 
the consideration of estimates which are dependent on assumptions 
about the future.  
We evaluated management’s assessment of whether there were any 
indicators of impairment for any of the Group’s E&E assets, taking  
into consideration the impairment indicators outlined in IFRS 6 and 
industry practice.
Our work included discussion of the latest status and future appraisal 
plans on each licence with operational staff and Group management, 
confirming that the E&E assets are included in capital expenditure plans 
and budgets, and verifying whether the current phase of the Group’s 
licence to explore is at, or close to, expiry. 
Our procedures included obtaining and reviewing documentary 
evidence, such as budgets, field development plans, contracts for 
future drilling and geological and geophysical (G&G) activities, 
correspondence with joint venture partners and other third parties,  
and licence documents. In addition, we obtained written 
representation from management with regard to their overall 
assessment and their intentions to continue E&E activities. 
Details of the Group’s policy on E&E assets are disclosed in note 4.3 
together with details of impairments to exploration and evaluation 
assets recorded by the Group in the year. Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 108
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Recoverability of development and producing oil and gas properties 
within property, plant and equipment, together with associated 
goodwill balances.
Management is required to assess whether there are any indications 
of impairment, and if so test for impairment by measuring the 
recoverable amount of the asset. Goodwill must be tested for 
impairment at least annually, irrespective of whether there are 
indicators of impairment.
In forming their judgements as to whether indications of impairment 
are present and carrying out any necessary impairment reviews, 
management considers estimates involving oil and gas reserves, 
future oil and gas prices, future costs, and discount rates.
We have challenged management’s assessment of potential 
impairment indicators in light of the performance of each asset 
and external factors such as the outlook for oil and gas prices.
Management has engaged independent experts to provide an 
updated estimate of the majority of the Group’s commercial oil and 
gas reserves. We have obtained and considered a draft report from 
management’s expert and discussed their work and findings with 
them. We have considered whether the latest estimates are indicative 
of impairment.
Where management has carried out an impairment review and 
calculated a recoverable amount (being in respect of the OML26 
CGU including the related goodwill – see note 5.13), we have 
compared the assumptions adopted in management’s recoverable 
amount calculations with the latest independent estimates. This 
included consideration of oil price assumptions and discount rates 
for reasonableness by reference to publicly available market data, 
comparison of future cost estimates with actual cost levels and 
budgets, checking for consistency with the assumptions underlying 
the related reserves estimates. 
Details of impairment reviews undertaken by the Group during the 
year and related assumptions are provided in notes 4.4 and 5.13.
Depletion, depreciation and amortisation
The calculation of depletion, depreciation and amortisation 
(“DD&A”) involves estimation of the remaining commercial  
oil and gas reserves and future development costs required  
to extract those reserves.
This charge is highly material and involves complex estimates.  
These estimates involve the use of judgement as to the point  
during the reporting period from which revised estimates or  
changes in development plans should be reflected in the Group’s 
DD&A calculations. DD&A calculations also need to be revised  
to reflect changes in contractual terms which affect cost and  
production sharing.
We agreed the reserves and future development cost estimates used 
in the DD&A calculations to the most recent reserves report available 
throughout the period. We also checked the latest draft reserves report 
for any indication that reserves estimates used throughout the year 
may have been based on erroneous information.
Where DD&A calculations were revised during the year to take 
into account further development approvals granted in the year 
and amendments to contractual terms governing production and 
cost sharing arrangements with Afren’s partners, we assessed 
whether these changes had been reflected in the DD&A calculations 
appropriately and applied from an appropriate point.
We checked the calculations for mathematical accuracy and agreed 
production quantities to stock take results. 
Details of the Group’s policy on DD&A calculation are disclosed 
in note 4.4.
Accounting for deferred and current taxation
Measurement of the Group’s income tax obligations can be 
judgemental and/or complex, reflecting inherent uncertainty in local 
tax regulation and tax rates and resultant uncertainties over the tax 
treatment of certain aspects of the Group’s business. 
In the current year, material remeasurements of deferred and current 
income tax were made following the Group securing entitlement 
to a five-year ‘tax exemption’ in respect of Ebok and an agreement 
clarifying certain tax matters with one of Afren’s partners. 
We checked the Group’s taxation computations in respect of current 
and deferred income tax and assessed for consistency with local 
tax legislation and accounting standards with the assistance of local 
and Group tax specialists. We evaluated judgements taken relating 
to management’s provisioning for tax by reference to local tax 
requirements and review of correspondence with tax authorities.
We checked that the requirement to account for tax assets and 
liabilities at the relevant enacted or substantively enacted rates had 
been properly applied.
We checked documentary support for the Group’s entitlement 
to the Ebok tax exemption.
We assessed the reasonableness of management’s judgement 
to account for US$298 million out of the US$300 million paid in 
the year as the cost of acquisition of deferred tax benefits relating 
to the Ebok project.
Details of the Group’s policy on deferred and current income tax are 
disclosed in note 2.3 together with details of income tax recorded 
by the Group in the year.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Application of production, cost and profit sharing contractual terms  
to the Group’s production operations.
The Group participates in each of its producing projects through 
multiple agreements which have been executed and amended  
over a number of years. 
The application of these agreements to some aspects of the Group’s 
business can be open to interpretation and negotiation, and the 
application of IFRS to aspects of these arrangements involves 
significant judgement.
During 2013, expenses of US$300 million and US$108 million were 
incurred in order to secure amendments to agreements governing 
the Group’s Ebok and Okoro assets, including to clarify certain 
ambiguities and uncertainties in the existing arrangements. Also in 
2013, cost recovery on Ebok has been achieved with the result that 
certain production, profit and costs sharing terms became effective 
for the first time.
This is considered a key risk because of the degree of judgement 
involved in interpreting contractual terms and associated amounts 
due, and because the consequential estimation uncertainties 
are material.
We reviewed the changes made in the amended agreements 
and considered management’s assessment of their effect and the 
accounting treatment for the consideration paid and payable in light  
of the benefits secured. 
We also assessed whether the revisions affected management’s 
previous conclusions as to the overall accounting for the Group’s 
participation in these projects under IFRS, having regard to normal 
practice in the industry whereby IFRS is not prescriptive, with particular 
regard to the adoption of IFRS11 in the year.
Following achievement of cost recovery on Ebok in December 2013, 
we considered the newly effective terms and assessed whether these 
have been appropriately reflected in the 2013 financial statements.
We considered the level of estimation uncertainty involved in 
measuring the Group’s production, cost and profit sharing liabilities 
at the year end, and management’s assessment that this uncertainty 
could lead to material revisions to currently recorded amounts in future 
periods. We considered whether the disclosures made in note 1.6 in 
relation to this material estimation uncertainty are appropriate.
The Audit and Risk Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on pages 91 to 92.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the 
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of  
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and  
in evaluating the results of our work.
When setting materiality, among other factors we considered the Group’s pre-tax profit and net assets in the current year as well as in recent 
years; the occurrence of any non-recurring or fluctuating gains and losses (such as exploration and evaluation assets impairments, costs of 
extinguishment of bonds, and fair valuation of hedges) and the level of consolidated shareholders equity. We determined materiality for the 
Group to be US$31,000,000, which is below 7.5% of adjusted pre-tax profit, and below 2% of equity. 
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$600,000, as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope included full audit of all key business units of the Group, including Nigeria, Kurdistan region of Iraq and East Africa 
operations together with the head office function in London. These locations account for all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit 
before tax. Our audit work used levels of materiality applicable to each individual business unit which were lower than Group materiality. 
Component auditors were involved in Nigeria as the majority of developed and producing oil and gas assets are located there and in-depth 
knowledge of local legislation and tax regulations is required. In the current year, in addition to regular interaction and review through 
correspondence, telephone and other electronic media, the Senior Statutory Auditor visited the Nigerian component during the audit 
concluding phase.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements. Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 110
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received  
from subsidiaries not visited by us; or
•  the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. Under the 
Listing Rules we are required to review certain elements of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We have nothing to report arising from these 
matters or our review.
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

 Notes to the Group financial statements
In preparing the 2013 financial statements, we have grouped notes into sections under six key categories which are considered to be most 
relevant for shareholders and other users:
1. Basis of preparation
2. Result for the year
3. Financing the Group’s activities
4. Oil and gas activities
5. Other disclosures
6. Company financial statements
The key accounting policies have been incorporated throughout the notes to the financial statements adjacent to the disclosure to which they 
relate. All accounting policies are included within an outlined box.
Where possible, wording has been simplified to provide clearer commentary on the financial performance of the Group.
1.0 Basis of preparation
1.1 General information
Afren plc (the Company, and together with its subsidiaries, the Group) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies 
Act. The address of the registered office is Kinnaird House, 1 Pall Mall East, London SW1Y 5AU, England. The nature of the Group’s operations 
and its principal activities are set out in note 2.2 and in the Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive’s review and Operations review on pages 
10, 16 and 40. These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 1.5.
1.2 Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and oil 
inventory which is subject to certain commodity swap arrangements that have been measured at fair value.
1.3 Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting. The use of this basis of accounting 
takes into consideration the Group’s current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern 
section of the Directors’ Report.
1.4 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. During the year, the Group adopted a suite of new accounting standards, including 
IFRS 10, IFRS 11, and IFRS 12. The adoption of these standards resulted in a change in accounting policy for determining when control exists and 
consolidation should take place, which in turn resulted in a change in the control conclusion for the Group’s interest in First Hydrocarbon Nigeria 
Company Limited (FHN) which led to the consolidation of FHN in the Group financial statements. The Group’s financial statements for 2012 have 
been restated to reflect this change in accounting policy, further details are provided in note 5.15. The new accounting policy is as follows:
Control is achieved where the Company has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns. The determination of whether control exists includes de facto circumstances 
that give the Company power over the investee irrespective of the Group’s shareholding.
Where the Group has an interest in a joint operation, those interests are accounted for using proportionate consolidation, under which the 
Group records its share of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of the acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
1.5 Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are maintained in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in US dollars which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency for the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of each Group company are translated as required 
into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period. Exchange differences (if any) arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. Such 
translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of. At present the Group has 
no subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars.

1.6 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above and in Sections 2 to 5, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key assumptions made by the Directors, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
balance sheet date, that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Carrying value of oil and gas assets and goodwill
Management assesses the Group’s oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment at least annually, with reference to indicators in IAS 36 
and tests goodwill for impairment at least annually irrespective of whether or not there are any indicators of impairment. Note 4.4 discloses 
the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets and details of the key assumptions used, which include a production profile based on 
management’s best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets, an internal oil price profile benchmarked to mean analysts’ 
consensus and a 10% pre-tax discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be 
reflective of the risks.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets
Management assesses impairment in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets with reference to indicators in IFRS 6 and the specific 
facts and circumstances of each asset. Note 4.3 discloses the carrying value of such assets. In making the assessment, management is required to 
make judgements on the status of each project and the future plans towards finding commercial reserves. The nature of exploration and evaluation 
activity is such that only a proportion of projects are ultimately successful and some assets are likely to become impaired in future periods.
Amounts due to participants in fields
Included within Trade and other payables described in note 5.5 to the financial statements is a balance at 31 December 2013 of 
US$366.0 million of ‘Other creditors and operating Partners’ due under the contractual agreements through which the Group participates 
in its fields (31 December 2012: US$193.1 million).
In calculating certain amounts included within this balance, aspects of these agreements can be unclear and potentially open to interpretation 
and negotiation, for example, the levels of costs which will be agreed as recoverable capital expenditure, levels of allowable overhead 
or financing charges allocable to individual assets. Management has recorded such amounts at its best estimate, having considered a range 
of reasonably possible outcomes. However, this estimation uncertainty could potentially lead to a material gain or loss in future periods, as and 
when the interpretation of the underlying agreements is confirmed with the relevant counterparties. 
Share-based payments 
Management is required to make assumptions in respect of the fair value of share-based payments in issue, in respect of the inputs used 
to calculate the fair values of these contracts. Details of these can be found in note 5.8.
Decommissioning
Provision for environmental clean-up and associated costs depend on the legal requirements at the date of decommissioning, the costs and 
timing of work and the discount rate to be applied. Decommissioning provisions are updated each year to reflect management’s best estimates 
of future cost estimates and timings.
Taxation and royalties
The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates can be uncertain and subject to interpretation. Afren calculates 
the tax charge for the period using the latest information available, taking external advice where necessary, in order to arrive at our best 
estimate of the final tax position. 
During the year, key judgements were made by management related to the assumptions used in accounting for the effects of a tax exemption 
for the Ebok asset in Nigeria. Judgements are required when estimating the future unwinding of temporary differences and the relevant tax 
rates at which temporary differences will unwind for the purposes of valuing deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates will be updated 
at each reporting period. 
Revisions to our tax liabilities (either upward or downward) may occur as the Group’s tax filings and royalties are agreed with the relevant 
authorities in future periods. Our tax charge and estimate of our tax liabilities is disclosed in note 2.3. 
Adoption of IFRS 10
As explained in notes 1.4 and 5.1, the Group adopted IFRS 10 during 2013. The most significant test in determining whether a control 
relationship exists under the Group’s previous accounting policy (under IAS 27), was whether the Group had a shareholding of over 50%. 
One key change in IFRS 10 is a new requirement for an investor to consider whether it has de facto power over an investee; this is relevant 
for the decision regarding the treatment of FHN. Although Afren had a minority shareholding of FHN, the other shareholders were relatively 
widely dispersed and there was no evidence of them organising their interests in such a way that they could exercise more votes than Afren as 
minority shareholder. Therefore under IFRS 10 this was one of the indicators, when forming a consolidation conclusion, that Afren controlled 
FHN when the shareholding was below 50%. Under IAS 27 a holding of over 50% was a more significant test.  Afren plc

2.0 Result for the year
This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group. On the following pages are disclosures explaining the Group’s results 
for the year, segmental information, taxation, normalised profit before tax and earnings per share.
2.1 Revenues
Revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT and royalties paid in kind or where the financial obligation does not fall directly to Afren, 
of the Group’s share of oil liftings in the year. Oil revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Following the 
Group’s reclassification of its interest in the CI-11 block and Lion Gas Plant as a discontinued operation, and its subsequent disposal 
(note 5.14), the Group revenue no longer includes gas revenue.
Oil revenue for the year are set out in the table below:

2.2 Segmental reporting
(a) Geographical segments
The Group operates in three geographical markets which form the basis of the information evaluated by the Group’s chief operating decision-
maker: Nigeria and other West Africa, East Africa and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. This is the basis on which the Group records its primary 
segment information. Unallocated operating expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the general management, financing and administration 
of the Group. 
Comparative information for 2012 has been restated to reflect the consolidation of FHN on adoption of IFRS 10. FHN is included in the 
Nigeria and other West Africa segment. Assets in Côte d’Ivoire, which were sold during 2013 (note 5.14), are included in the Nigeria and other 
West Africa segment for management purposes but have been deducted in a separate column in the analysis below to enable a reconciliation 
to the income statement. The results of these assets are disclosed as discontinued operations in the income statement.

(b) Business segments
The operations of the Group comprise one class of business, being oil and gas exploration, development and production.
2.3 Taxation
The Group is subject to various forms of taxation in the countries in which it operates. These include income tax on profits, royalties on 
production, sales taxes on revenues generated, and payroll taxes on benefits to employees.
(a) Income tax credit/expense
The income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax, and includes a credit in respect of the reversal of prior 
year taxes no longer expected to be payable, and recognition of deferred tax assets described further below. The tax currently payable is based 
on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date.

During 2013, the Group received clarification of the tax position in respect of its Ebok asset in Nigeria. Afren Resources Limited, the 
subsidiary which holds Afren’s interest in the Ebok asset, will benefit from the award of a five-year tax exemption which is effective from 
the commencement of commercial production until May 2016. As a result, no income tax will be payable in respect of the 2011-2016 period 
and therefore the provision for all current tax provided for up to the point of confirming the five-year tax exemption has been reversed in the 
current period resulting in a current tax credit of US$254.3 million and a deferred tax credit of US$192.7 million. The Group has recognised 
a deferred tax asset of US$97.5 million, representing the expected future tax benefit of depreciation charged in excess of capital allowances 
claimed to date.
During 2013, the Group agreed to make payments of US$300.0 million in relation to amending the structure of its partnerships, one of the 
principal benefits of which is securing future tax benefits relating to the rights to capital allowances available for future utilisation.

(b) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.

At the balance sheet date the Group also had tax losses (primarily arising in the UK) of US$297.5 million (2012: US$141.3 million) in respect 
of which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits against which these tax losses 
could be recovered. Such losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 122
The Group had temporary differences of US$23.3 million (2012: US$12.5 million) in respect of share-based payments, property, plant and 
equipment and pensions in respect of which deferred tax assets have not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable 
profits against which these tax losses could be recovered.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the largest proportion of dividends would be from 
subsidiaries where no additional tax would be applied on dividend income.
2.4 Reconciliation of profit before tax to normalised profit before tax
Normalised profit before tax is a non-IFRS measure of financial performance of the Group, which in management’s view provides a better 
understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by 
other companies.
The table below reconciles the IFRS profit before tax from continuing operations to the normalised profit before tax:

2.5 Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per share (EPS) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share. Where a profit or loss in the period from a discontinued 
operation has occurred, this profit or loss is factored into the EPS calculation in order to present a Group result from continuing operations. 
Basic EPS from continuing operations is calculated on the Group’s profit for the year from continuing operations attributable to equity 
shareholders of US$478.3 million (2012: US$200.5 million) divided by 1,090.8 million (2012: 1,080.8 million) being the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of all share options and warrants being exercised.

3.0 Financing the Group’s activities
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of Afren; specifically, how much is raised from shareholders (equity) and how much 
is borrowed from financial institutions (debt) in order to finance the Group’s business strategy, both now and in the future and to maximise 
shareholder value.
The Directors consider that debt and equity are both capital, and managing net debt (as disclosed below) is the key strategy for managing 
capital. The Directors consider the Group’s capital structure and funding requirements a minimum of twice a year ahead of announcing results 
in the context of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business strategy. The Group’s funding requirements are met 
through a combination of debt, equity and operational cash flow.
3.1 Net debt and cash flow commitments
Key cash flow activity in the year
The Group invested US$765.0 million in exploration and evaluation activities, and in developing its oil and gas assets, funded from operating 
cashflow.
US$109.0 million was invested in acquiring additional equity in FHN, bringing the Group’s interest to 78% by 31 December 2013 
(further details are provided in note 5.10).
In December 2013, the Group raised US$360.0 million from the issue of senior secured notes, with a seven-year term. The proceeds were used 
to repurchase US$246.6 million of the 2016 senior secured notes and US$50.0 million of the 2019 senior secured notes.
During the year the Group also repaid the US$50.0 million corporate facility and US$101.3 million FHN acquisition and development facility.
Net debt
Net debt is the key measure by which the Group monitors its funding. Net debt is defined as borrowings, less finance lease liabilities and cash 
and cash equivalents.

(a) Ebok facility
In March 2013, Afren signed a new US$300.0 million Ebok facility which is secured against Ebok field reserves. The facility has a three-year 
term and bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.25%. The new facility replaces the previous facility. The new extended facility will be used to fund 
ongoing capital expenditure and general corporate requirements, including Group loans.
(b) Socar facility
In August 2011, the Group entered into a US$50.0 million facility agreement (the Socar facility) with Socar Trading S.A. The Socar facility 
had a term of the earlier of (i) 23 months from the date of the agreement (July 2013) or (ii) 90 days from the date that Afren’s Ebok Crude 
Oil Purchase Contract with Socar terminates (the later of 4 September 2012 or the cumulative lifting of 18.5 mmbbl of crude oil from the 
Ebok field). The facility was repaid in full on 5 July 2013.
(c) 2016 Notes
In January and February 2011, the Group completed its first bond issue and raised US$500.0 million before issue costs. The Notes, which are 
listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of Afren plc and on a senior subordinated 
basis by Afren Resources Limited. In December 2013, the Group repurchased US$247.0 million of the 2016 notes, funded by the issue of 2020 
Senior Secured loan notes.
(d) 2019 Notes
In March 2012, the Group completed its second bond issue raising US$300.0 million before issue costs. The Notes, which are listed on 
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of Afren plc and on a senior subordinated basis 
by Afren Resources Limited. In December 2013, the Group repurchased US$50.0 million of the 2019 notes, funded by the issue of 2020 
Senior Secured loan notes. Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 124
(e) 2020 Notes
In December 2013, the Group completed its third bond issue raising US$360.0 million before issue costs. The Notes, which are listed on the 
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of Afren plc and on a senior subordinated basis by Afren 
Resources Limited. 
(f) Convertible loan notes
On 5 July 2013, the Group redeemed convertible loan notes issued by First Hydrocarbon Nigeria Company Limited (FHN) in 2011. 
US$50.0 million of senior unsecured unsubordinated convertible notes were issued by FHN in September 2011 to fund ongoing development 
activities. The loan notes could have been converted to shares in FHN at any time from the date of issue until maturity (2017) in minimum 
tranches of US$5.0 million, at a conversion price of US$1.85 per share, which equated to approximately 27 million FHN shares. If not previously 
repaid or redeemed, the notes would have been redeemed by FHN at maturity at a premium of 200% of the par value of the notes. The notes 
were redeemed for US$62.5 million resulting in an accounting gain of US$0.3 million, which is included in finance income.
(g) Cash and cash equivalents
The cash flow statement on page 114 gives a breakdown of cash movements in the year.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group in the form of short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less and earn interest at respective short-term deposit rates. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2013 includes US$19.7 million (2012: US$28.5 million) that is restricted.
Contracted cash flow commitments
The Group uses both short- and long-term projected cash flows to monitor funding requirements for the Group’s activities. Cash flow 
projections take into consideration the Group’s debt financing plans and covenant compliance.
The table below analyses the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities (borrowings, finance lease liabilities, trade and other payables and 
deferred consideration) by when they fall due for payment. The values in the table are based on undiscounted cash flows on the earliest date 
on which the Group can be required to pay. The values are greater than the values in the net debt table (note 3.1) as they include contractual 
forecast interest payments.
The non-interest bearing category in the table below comprises trade and other payables and deferred consideration on acquisitions.

3.2 Borrowings and loan notes
The Group borrows money in the form of bonds and other financial instruments. These typically have a fixed interest rate and are for a fixed 
term. The interest and other costs payable on these borrowings are shown in note 3.6.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings (including senior loan notes) are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement over the period of the borrowings. Interest is calculated by applying the coupon rate to the redemption value.
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments consisting of a liability component and an equity component. At the date 
of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. 
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component represents 
the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the issuing entity and is included in equity. Issue costs are apportioned between 
the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion 
relating to the equity is charged directly against equity. The interest expense on the liability component is calculated based on the effective 
interest rate and is recognised in the income statement.

3.3 Derivative financial instruments
A derivative is a financial instrument used to manage risk. Its value changes over time in response to changes to the underlying variables such 
as crude oil price.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. If the Group does not apply hedge accounting to the derivatives, gains and losses 
arising out of changes in fair value of these instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for in other operating 
income/ (expense) in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
If the Group hedge accounts for the derivatives, each period the portion of the gains and losses on the cash flow hedging instruments that 
is determined to be an effective hedge is taken to equity (other comprehensive income) and the ineffective portion, as well as any change 
in time value, is recognised in the income statement.
Third-party valuations are used to value the Group’s derivatives.
The Group has the following derivatives:
Purpose Hedge accounting
Commodity deferred put options (cash flow hedges) (a) Hedge against the price of crude oil falling Yes
Interest rate swap (b) To link interest payments to the performance of certain indices 
that look to take advantage of a theoretical bias in the 
forward curve 
No
Foreign exchange hedge (c) Hedge against changes in the USD/GBP exchange rate No
(a) Commodity deferred put options
The Group will receive a minimum amount if the market price of crude oil falls. These instruments have been classified as cash flow hedges, 
with a portion of the gains and losses on the instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge taken to equity and the ineffective 
portion, as well as any change in time value, recognised in the income statement for each period. During the year, a loss of US$30.8 million 
(2012: US$49.1 million loss) was charged to the income statement in relation to these instruments.  Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 126
(b) Interest rate swap
The Group entered into interest rate swap contracts whereby it receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate with a downside cap up to a 
maximum of 2% above the fixed rate coupon. During the year the Group recognised a loss in its income statement of US$15.7 million (2012: 
US$nil) in respect of these contracts. 
(c) Foreign exchange rate contracts
To manage its exposure to changes in the U.S. Dollar / Sterling exchange rate, from time to time the Group will enter into forward contracts. 
During the year the Group recognised a loss in its income statement of US$0.1 million (2012: US$nil) in respect of these contracts.
(d) Options contracts for FHN shares
Following the adoption of IFRS 10, the IFRS classification of these instruments changed. In the restated 2012 period presented, the put/call 
options are classed as options over own equity. Further details are provided in note 5.10.

For a finance lease, an asset and corresponding liability is recognised on the balance sheet. No asset or liability is recognised for an operating lease.
Finance lease assets are recognised at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined 
at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the leasor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where 
another more systematic basis, such as a unit of production method, is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits 
from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more 
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Obligations under finance lease 
The Group has a seven-year lease of a Mobile Offshore Production Unit (MOPU) and a Floating Storage Offloading Vessel (FSO) from Mercator 
Offshore (Nigeria) Limited in respect of the production operations of the Ebok field, offshore Nigeria. The carrying amount of the Group’s lease 
obligations approximates its fair value. For the year ended 31 December 2013, the effective interest rate was 6% (2012: 6%).
The amounts reported in the balance sheet relating to finance leases mature as follows:

3.6 Finance costs and income
Financial costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Arrangement 
fees and issue costs are deducted from the debt proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised and charged to the income 
statement as finance costs over the term of the debt.
Borrowing costs, including interest on loans, which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying 
assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost 
of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalised borrowing costs are amortised in line with the underlying asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which they are incurred.

4.0 Oil and gas activities
This section shows the assets used to generate the Group’s trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result. Liabilities relating to the 
Group’s financing activities are addressed in Section 3. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in note 2.3.
On the following pages there are disclosures showing intangible and tangible oil and gas assets, capital commitments, inventories, interests 
in other entities and contingent liabilities. Other working capital balances are shown in Section 5.
4.1 Licences summary
The Group has interests in oil and gas licences at the three different stages of the operational work programme cycle – exploration, appraisal 
and development, and production. Further details on each licence and the stage of the work programme can be found on pages 40 to 61 
and on page 152.
The classifications reflect the stage of each work programme from an operational perspective as explained further in the Operations review. 
The classification within the financial statements may be different due to the criteria for determining when the work programme has moved 
from exploration (intangible oil and gas assets) to development and then to production (both categories tangible oil and gas assets) being 
different under accounting standards.
4.2 Oil and gas reserves
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves (also commonly referred to as 2P reserves), which are defined as the 
estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with 
a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible. 
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated 
as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
The Group’s commercial reserves as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 are detailed in the table on page 154 of this Annual Report 
and Accounts. These commercial reserves are stated on a working interest basis, and have been prepared in accordance with the definitions 
and guidelines set forth in the 2007 PRMS approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The commercial reserves are unaudited.
The commercial reserves are used in a number of ways in the financial statements; in particular:
1)  to assess whether a prospect is commercially viable, and therefore support that the recoverable amount of oil and gas assets (both 
intangible and property, plant and equipment) continue to exceed the carrying amount of the assets; and
2)  in the calculation of depletion of the property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets.
4.3 Intangible exploration and evaluation assets
The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for intangible exploration and evaluation costs. All licence acquisition, 
exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets in cost centres by field or exploration area, as appropriate, 
pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property. Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they 
relate to specific exploration activities. Pre-licence costs and general exploration costs not specific to any particular licence or prospect are 
expensed as incurred.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets:

licence in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, drilling Ogo-1 well on OPL 310 offshore Nigeria, and further drilling and testing of Okwok in advance 
of the submission of the field development plan. 
Additions during 2012 included US$68.0 million in respect of the Okoro East Field Extension in Nigeria, all of which was transferred from 
intangible exploration and evaluation assets to tangible oil and gas assets. Afren plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 130
(b) Transfer to property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets
Non-current assets are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the recoverable 
amount. Such triggering events are defined in IFRS 6 in respect of exploration and evaluation assets and include the point at which 
determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist.
If prospects are deemed to be commercially viable on completion of the evaluation, the attributable costs are transferred to property, 
plant and equipment in single field cost centres.
Prospects deemed to be commercially viable, and transferred to property, plant and equipment during 2012, primarily related to the Okoro 
Field Extension as disclosed in (a) above. As part of this assessment in 2012, management performed an impairment test upon its Okoro asset, 
on transfer from intangible exploration and evaluation assets. This test compared the carrying value of the assets at the balance sheet date 
with the expected discounted cash flows from each project. For the discounted cash flows to be calculated, management used a production 
profile based on its best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil price 
profile benchmarked to mean analysts’ consensus and a 10% pre-tax discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the 
calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
(c) Exploration costs written off
If prospects are deemed to be impaired (‘unsuccessful’) on making the above determination as to whether commercial reserves exist, 
the associated costs are charged to the income statement.

Exploration costs written off 60.5 15.0
Amounts written off in 2013 relate to the cumulative costs of Block 10A in Kenya, following the decision to relinquish the block, and the 
Group’s cumulative costs on the La Noumbi licence in Congo Brazzaville. Kola 1 and Kola 2 were drilled in the year and, following conclusion 
that the wells were unsuccessful, they were plugged and abandoned. 
4.4 Property, plant and equipment
Oil and gas assets
Development assets are costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering 
and storing oil and gas. Examples include costs incurred to gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling; drill development wells, 
including cost of platforms and well equipment; acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as ease flow lines, separators, 
treaters, and heaters; and other items as appropriate. Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are transferred into development 
assets once the property has proved reserves and a development plan approved by all relevant parties including, where applicable, 
the government.
Production assets are those properties which have begun producing. These assets are typically development properties which are 
transferred into the production portfolio or through acquisition of a subsidiary. Once commercial production starts on a development asset, 
the property is reclassified as a production asset and depletion of the property commences.
Other property, plant and equipment assets
Other property, plant and equipment comprises the Group’s investment in leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment and computer 
hardware and software, and is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.

The gross capitalised interest included in the oil and gas assets amounted to US$190.9 million as at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$148.5 million).
(a) Additions
Additions during the year included capital expenditure in respect of the Ebok field of US$274.1 million, Okoro development of US$104.1 
million, OML 26 field of US$7.9 million and Barda Rash field of US$224.1 million.
Additions during 2012 included capital expenditure in respect of the Ebok field of US$204.4 million and Barda Rash field of US$121.1 million. 
In addition, US$68.0 million relating to the Okoro Field Extension was transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets to 
development during the year.
(b) Provision for decommissioning
A provision for decommissioning the oil and gas assets is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed. The extent to which 
a provision is required depends on the legal requirements for decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate 
to be applied.
The provision represents the present value of the decommissioning costs relating to Ebok, Okoro and OML 26 fields that are expected to be 
incurred up to 2033. Following the disposal of the Group’s interest in CI-11, the related provision was released. The table below details the 
movements in the provision.

A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment 
(within additions). The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value, and is reassessed 
each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements, reflecting management’s best estimates.
Additions during the year relate to provisions for abandonment of additional wells drilled at the Ebok field. Management believe the estimates 
continue to form a reasonable basis for the expected future costs of decommissioning, which are expected to be incurred up to 2033.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording 
an adjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included as a finance cost.
(c) Transfer from development to production
Transfers from development to production in 2012 include a portion of the Okoro Field Extension of US$45.1 million.
(d) Depreciation, depletion and amortisation
Oil and gas assets
Oil and gas assets are amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas 
production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves, generally on a field by field basis. Costs used in the unit of 
production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs. Changes in the 
estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
The gas plant was being depreciated straight line over six and a quarter years but was sold in the year.
Included in the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charge during the year is US$28.8 million (2012: US$32.4 million) attributable to the 
assets under finance lease in respect of the Ebok field.
Other property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the property, plant and equipment, less anticipated disposal proceeds, 
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life as follows:
Leasehold improvements  life of lease
Fixtures and equipment  over three years (all artwork/paintings depreciated over 15 years)
Computer hardware and software  over three years
Impairment
Non-current assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its 
recoverable amount. 
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by 
comparison with the estimated discounted future net cash flows based on management’s expectation of future production, oil prices and costs.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation. Where conditions giving rise to 
impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that 
would have been charged since the impairment.
As part of this assessment, management carried out a review of all property, plant and equipment and oil and gas assets. No impairment 
indicators were noted (2012: no impairment indicators noted).
4.5 Capital commitments
As at 31 December, the Group has committed to the following capital expenditure, but as the related assets have not been received as at that 
date, no liability is recognised in the financial statements.

4.6 Inventories
Oil and gas inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value other than certain oil inventory in Côte d’Ivoire, which is settled 
via a reduction in the amount recoverable in respect of realised gas sales from the Lion Gas Plant. The inventory subject to this swap is recorded 
at its fair value.
Spare parts and materials inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs comprise direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
The cash flows associated with the purchase of spare parts and materials are classified in investment activities with the oil and gas assets. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain of the Group’s jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not 
receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period. The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and cumulative 
production is “underlift” or “overlift” . Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within debtors and creditors respectively. 
Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through cost of sales such that gross profit is recognised on an entitlements basis.

4.7 Interests in other entities
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant 
influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 
Joint arrangements are those arrangements where the Group shares joint control. Such arrangements may be classified as either a joint venture 
(the Group has an interest in the net assets of the jointly controlled entity), or a joint operation (the Group has joint rights to the assets and joint 
obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement). The Group applies equity accounting for joint ventures and proportional consolidation 
for joint operations. 
(a) Subsidiaries
A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation, and proportion of ownership interest is given 
in note 6.2 to the Company’s separate financial statements. Details of the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries which are not wholly-owned 
are provided in note 5.10.
(b) Joint ventures
The Group has an interest in two joint ventures. During the year, the Group recognised a loss from its share in joint ventures of US$26.6 million. 
The loss comprises the write-off of the Group’s interest in joint ventures of US$8.4 million and impairment of amounts receivable from the joint 
venture of US$18.2 million. This predominantly relates to the impairment of exploration and evaluation assets in respect of JDZ Block 1.
During the year, as a result of adopting IFRS 11, the Group changed the accounting for these interests from proportional consolidation 
to equity accounting. The effects of this change are described further in note 5.15. 
4.8 Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is a liability that is not sufficiently certain to qualify for recognition as a provision. Uncertainty may exist regarding the 
outcome of future events.

During the year, external auditors performed a significant amount of non-audit work on projects such as the acquisition of a beneficial interest 
of 10.4% in FHN and the issuing of Senior Secured Notes. This is work external auditors would ordinarily perform for companies involved 
in such projects.
5.3 Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty (most commonly a customer) will default on its contractual obligations (for example default 
on invoice payment) resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the credit risk of the entities that it sells its products to or that it enters into contractual arrangements with and will obtain 
guarantees and commercial letters of credit as may be considered necessary where risks are significant to the Group.
The Group’s sales are diversified in terms of both region and the number of counterparties and, other than transactions with major oil 
companies with high credit rating and balances due from its partners, the Group does not have significant exposure to any single counterparty 
or group of counterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk on cash is limited because the majority is deposited with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating 
agencies or with governmental guarantee. The Group’s total maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2013 was US$545.7 million 
(2012: US$909.3 million) made up of cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments).

5.4 Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable 
(amortised cost). When there is evidence that the receivable is not recoverable, it is impaired with a corresponding charge to the income statement.
Trade and other debtors includes underlift amounts – refer to note 4.6 Inventories for further details.

5.6 Fair values
The financial instruments on the Afren balance sheet are measured at either fair value or amortised cost. The following table provides an 
analysis of carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments. 
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade creditors, other creditors, finance leases and accruals and deferred consideration 
and payables on acquisitions have been excluded from this analysis as their fair values are equal to the carrying values.
The financial instruments in the table are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the inputs used to calculate the fair value 
are observable: 
•  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
•  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

1,226.6 1,074.7 1,334.2 1,206.8
Notes:
(i)  Bank borrowings: Fair values have been determined by reference to LIBOR forward curves and by discounting future cash outflows at 10%.
(ii)  Transfer between levels: As at 31 December 2012 the fair value of the Loan notes was determined using discounted future cash flows 
and stated at US$988.6 million. As the Loan notes are actively traded on the Luxembourg Bourse stock exchange, it is considered more 
appropriate to disclose the fair value at the prevailing market price as at the close of business on the reporting date. The Loan notes have 
therefore been reclassified from Level 2 to Level 1. The impact of this reclassification has been to reduce the fair value at 31 December 2012 
by US$61.1 million from US$988.6 million to US$927.5 million. There is no effect on the amount reported in the balance sheet.
(iii)  Relates to FHN options which are classified at Level 3. As such their valuation requires assumptions regarding FHN’s share price which is not 
readily available. These options were valued using a Black Scholes model for which changing certain inputs to reflect reasonable possible 
alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly. 
5.7 Sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk
The risk of the Group being adversely affected by a 1% change in interest rates was not material in 2013 or 2012.
Oil price risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in oil price relates primarily to the Group’s derivative financial instruments. The terms of the 
derivative financial instruments are such that the Group will receive a minimum amount if the market falls, but will receive a set discount from 
the market price if the oil price is above that minimum. The effect on Group result and equity of changes in the oil price on the fair value 
of the derivative financial instruments is as follows:
Positive/(adverse) 2013

Positive/(adverse) 2012

Decrease in oil price by 10% (6.2) (14.8)
Foreign exchange risk
The impact of a 10% change in the sterling or the Nigerian Naira to US dollar exchange rate was not material in 2013 or 2012.

A proportion of the Group’s staff costs shown above are recharged to the Group’s joint venture partners and a proportion is capitalised into 
the cost of intangible and tangible oil and gas assets under the Group’s accounting policy for exploration, evaluation and oil and gas assets. 
The amount ultimately remaining in the income statement was US$36.9 million (2012: US$28.6 million).
The 2012 numbers have been restated to reflect the Group’s consolidation of FHN and Côte d’Ivoire operations as discontinued.
Details of Directors’ remuneration are provided in the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.
(a) Share-based payments
A transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment where the Group receives services from employees, Directors (or other third parties) 
and pays for these in shares or similar equity instruments.
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and Directors. Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at 
fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant, measured by use of an appropriate valuation model. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period 
to exercise, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company is liable for Employer’s National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise and exercise price. 
This expense is accrued by reference to the share price of the Company at the balance sheet date. Share-based payments made to employees 
of subsidiaries of the Company are recharged to the relevant subsidiary when awarded.
The share-based payments expense comprises the following three schemes:

(i) Equity-settled share option scheme
The Group operates a share option scheme for employees. The Group’s policy is to award options to employees on appointment or 
completion of their probationary period and periodically thereafter. Options are issued at market price on the grant date and have vesting 
periods of up to three years. The options expire after ten years if they remain unexercised and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the options vest except at the discretion of the Board.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at 31 December 2013 was 5.3 years (2012: 6.1 years).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2013 was 148p (2012: 129p).
In 2013 options were granted on 3, 8 and 15 January, 27 March, 11 and 18 June, 28 August, 4 and 24 September and 1 October. 
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$1.3 million.
In 2012 options were granted on 3 January, 28 March, 2 and 23 April, 4, 12, 18 and 30 June, 22 August, 2, 23 and 30 October, 
6 and 27 November and 7 December. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$1.3 million.
The options granted during the year have been valued by reference to the Barrier option valuation model, consistent with the prior year. 
The inputs into the Barrier model were as follows:
2013 2012
Weighted average share price (pence) 141.9 129.9
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 141.9 181.0

The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data. The volatility was measured utilising 
several formulae, including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH (Generalised Autoregressive Conditional 
Heteroscedasticity) model, and over several time periods. These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility which is in line with the 
prior year.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the form of options in 2013 of 
US$1.0 million, all of which related to employees, including Executive Directors, of the Group (2012: US$5.0 million, all of which related 
to employees, including Executive Directors, of the Group).
(ii) Long Term Incentive Plan: Afren Performance Share Plan (equity-settled share award scheme)
Under the Afren Performance Share Plan, the Group also gives awards to Directors and staff subject to outperforming a comparator group 
of similarly focused oil and gas exploration and production companies in terms of shareholder return over a three-year period and based upon 
a multiple of salary. However, these shares only vest after a three-year period and the full award is made only if Afren has performed in the 
top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas companies, which for the 2012 award was as follows: 
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Cairn Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, DNO, Dragon Oil, Genel Energy, Gulfsands 
Petroleum, Hess Corporation, Heritage Oil, JKX Oil & Gas, Lundin Petroleum, Marathon Oil Corporation, Maurel et Prom, Melrose Resources, 
Nexen, Niko Resources, Noble Energy, PA Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources, Premier Oil, Salamander Energy, SOCO International, Talisman 
Energy, Tullow Oil, Vaalco Energy and Woodside Petroleum. If Afren does not achieve at least median performance in the peer group, 
no shares will be awarded. At the median level, 30% of the shares will vest and there is a sliding scale between median and top quartile 
performance where only a percentage of the total award will vest. A second performance target was applied to the 2012 award relating to the 
Group’s Reserves Replacement Ratio (RRR), setting a target RRR of 105% over the three-year vesting period of the awards. In the event that 
a ratio of less than 105% is achieved then the overall award amount is reduced pro-rata.

an exercise price of £0.01 (2012: £0.01).
The aggregate of the fair value of the options granted during the year ended 31 December 2013 was US$13.1 million (2012: US$12.8 million).
The fair values were calculated using a stochastic model. The inputs used for fair valuing awards granted during the two periods were 
as follows:
2013 2012
Weighted average share price (pence) 123.6 98.0

several formulae, including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH (Generalised Autoregressive Conditional 
Heteroscedasticity) model, and over several time periods. These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility which is in line with the 
prior year. Therefore the volatility assumption has remained consistent with the prior year, but will remain under review going forwards.
The Group recognised total expenses related to the above equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the form of options during the 
year ended 31 December 2013 of US$12.0 million (2012: US$10.0 million).
(iii) Share Award Scheme – equity-settled share award scheme
As part of the incentives to attract the Jefferies, Randall & Dewey technical team, a number of shares were awarded in 2008, subject to 
continuing employment in the most part, to the team. None of this team was eligible to an award under the Long Term Incentive Plan. 
The timing of the shares issued range from six months to three years over which the fair value was spread. The share award scheme was 
closed in 2011.
(b) Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal 
or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution plan are recognised as staff costs 
and are expensed to the income statement in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees. Afren plc

The share-based payment reserve represents the fair value of the options, share awards, warrants, and LTIP granted under the Company’s 
share-based payment schemes. 
(b) Put option over own equity
During 2012, the Group held three put and/or call option contracts in relation to FHN. In the 2012 financial statements, these contracts were 
treated as derivative financial instruments. Following the adoption of IFRS 10, the IFRS classification of these instruments changed and under 
the guidance of IAS 39, they are treated as options over own equity in the restated 2012 financial statements and measured at amortised cost. 
During 2013, one option expired and one was exercised as part of Afren’s increase in equity ownership of FHN.
In July 2013, Afren entered into a put and call agreement with Earl Act Global Investments in respect of 18,299,993 million FHN shares, 
representing approximately 12.5% of FHN’s share capital, at a price of US$3.32 per share. These options may only be exercised after 
24 months and for a period of six months thereafter. In accordance with IAS 39, the options are accounted for as options over own equity, 
where a liability for the present value of the obligation is recognised within other financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge in other 
equity. Further details are provided in note 5.6.
(c) Convertible loan note 
In July 2013, the Group redeemed the convertible loan note in full. Further details are provided in note 3.1.

As described in notes 1.4 and 5.15, following the adoption of IFRS 10, Afren has consolidated the FHN Group. FHN is the Group’s only 
subsidiary that is not wholly controlled. FHN has a 45% interest in the OML 26 licence onshore Nigeria and a 9% interest in OML 113 offshore 
Nigeria, via its own subsidiaries. 
During 2013, Afren increased its beneficial interest in FHN from approximately 46.7% to 78%. As at 31 December 2013, 22% of FHN was 
owned by non-controlling shareholders. The analysis above shows the effect of the change in ownership on the equity attributable to the 
non-controlling interest in FHN.

Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of

held equity interest (if any) in the entity, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.

Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
Goodwill recognised in the Group balance sheet relates solely to goodwill arising in FHN on the acquisition of OML 26, which is considered 
to be a cash generating unit (CGU). The recoverable amount of CGU has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation for 
the duration of the licence which expires in 2044. For the discounted cash flows to be calculated, management has made the following key 
assumptions: 
–  Production volumes: Estimates are based on detailed independent forecasts for the field and take into account a development plan agreed 
by management as part of the long-term planning process. 
–  Discount rate: A 10% pre-tax discount rate has been used which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, 
management considers to be reflective of the risks. The present value of future cash flows remains above the carrying value of the 
CGU’s net assets at 10% and 12.5% but not at 15%.
–  Crude oil price: Management uses long-term US$100 per barrel price forecast for calculation of future cash flows.
5.14 Discontinued operations
On 16 May 2013, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of Afren Côte d’Ivoire Limited and Lion GPL SA, which held Afren’s 
interest in the CI-11 Block and Lion Gas Plant respectively. The disposal was completed on 31 August 2013, on which date control of these 
two entities passed to the acquirer.
A provisional profit on disposal of US$25.3 million has been recognised in the year. This remains subject to finalisation on agreement 
of working capital adjustments.
The results of the discontinued operations, which have been included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
were as follows: Afren plc

5.15 Effect of change in accounting policies 
As discussed in note 1, the financial performance and position of the Group has been restated for the year ended 31 December 2012 
and the balance sheet restated as at 31 December 2011 to reflect the adoption of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. The quantitative impact on the 
31 December 2012 financial statements of adopting these standards is set out in the following tables. The adoption of IFRS 10 has resulted in 
the consolidation of FHN as a subsidiary in all comparative periods restated. The adoption of IFRS 11 has had an effect on the accounting for 
Afren’s two joint ventures held through Afren Global Energy Resources Limited and Dangote Energy Equity Resources Limited. Under IFRS 11, 
the accounting for these two joint ventures has changed from the proportional consolidation method to the equity accounting method.

6.1 Accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union and therefore the Company financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to both Afren Group and Company financial statements, refer to the Group financial 
statements for disclosure of the accounting policy.
Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the Company, transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency (foreign 
currencies) are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising are included in the 
profit and loss for the period.
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is US dollars.
6.2 Subsidiaries and associated undertakings

6.3 Investment in trust
Afren’s ownership in FHN is structured in order to meet the criteria generally understood and sometimes required under Nigerian oil and 
gas industry policies for FHN to be classified as an indigenous Nigerian company, with the majority of its equity interest held by Nigerian 
owners. Afren split its legal and beneficial holdings in FHN such that it is the legal owner of not more than 45% of the issued ordinary 
shares in FHN. The remaining portion of Afren’s legal interest in FHN is held in trust for the benefit of Afren by Adcax Investments Limited, 
a Nigerian-formed trust company. Accordingly, only the beneficial title to the Option Shares was acquired by Afren, with the legal title acquired 
by Adcax Investments Limited while Afren is the beneficiary of all the benefits accruing to the Option Shares.

The above are shown at fair value and, with the exception of the FHN options, are classified at Level 2 (see note 5.6 of the Group financial

The FHN options are classified at Level 3. As such their valuation requires assumptions regarding FHN’s share price which is not readily 
available. These options were valued using a Black Scholes model (inputs used are detailed below). Changing certain inputs to reasonable 
possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly.

Notes:
–  Reserves and resources above are stated on a working interest basis (i.e. for the Nigerian contracts our net effective ultimate working interest based on working interest to payback (50% to 100%) 
and WI post payback (50%)).
–  Proved plus Probable (2P) reserves have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and guidelines set forth in the 2007 PRMS approved by the SPE.
–  Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum that are estimated to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations but for which the projects are not yet considered mature enough 
for commercial development due to one or more contingencies.
–  2013 production excludes NGL output from the Lion Gas Plant.
–  Quantities of oil equivalent are calculated using a gas-to-oil conversion factor of 5,800 scf of gas per barrel of oil equivalent.
–  The oil price used by NSAI and RPS Energy for their independent reserve and resource assessments at 31 December 2013 was US$100/bbl flat.
–  The Group provides for depletion and amortisation of tangible fixed assets on a net entitlement basis, which reflects the terms of the licences and agreements relating to each field.  
Total net entitlement reserves were 208.4 mmbbls at 31 December 2013. 
–  Excludes management estimates of contingent resources at OML 113 (gross 167 mmboe) and additional upside at OML 26 (gross 144 mmboe). Afren plc

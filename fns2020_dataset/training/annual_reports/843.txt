Shaping a more focused group
Adjusted pre-tax profit in 2005 
was up 7 per cent to £124.1 million
(2004: £115.6 million), with pre-tax
profit* for the year being
£25.4 million (2004: £91.2 million).
During 2005, we saw strong
performance in our Engineering
and Technical Services activities 
and in our Oil and Gas business.
Results overall were depressed 
by our UK construction activities.
We have taken action in the UK and
as a result have incurred costs to
exit several unattractive activities.
Strong performance in our other
activities enabled us to report good
progress and proposed dividends
for the year are increased by 
4.5 per cent to 11.5 pence per share
(2004: 11.0 pence). The outlook for
overall progress** in 2006 remains 
in line with our earlier expectations.
These results reflect, and support,
our strategy of focusing on
attractive energy and process
markets, while continuing to 
build an increasingly attractive
portfolio of equity investments.

Energy markets hold 
real promise
International energy markets hold
real promise as we look ahead. 
As I write, AMEC is contributing 
to the UK Government’s important
review of energy policy – which
looks at the serious question of
investment in the energy assets 
of the future. Worldwide,
governments anticipate rapidly
rising energy demand, which will
drive investment in new energy
assets and benefit companies 
like AMEC that design, deliver 
and support these assets. 
In this context, the energy
acquisitions we completed during
2005 are particularly significant.
We acquired the oil and gas services
company Paragon, gaining a
position in the important Houston
market. We strengthened our
position in the UK, Canadian and
international nuclear markets 
with the acquisition of NNC, 
the UK’s leading private sector
nuclear services business. Both
businesses are performing well.
Maturing portfolio 
of investments
In recent years, we have built an
attractive portfolio of investments
in PPP and property developments
and a strong position in wind energy,
all of which are expected to become
increasingly valuable over the 
next few years.
During 2005, we took important
steps to improve our performance 
in UK construction, not just 
exiting markets but restructuring
the business, putting in a new
management team and addressing
the cost base. As a result of these
actions, we can look forward 
to a better year in 2006.
Scale of opportunity
The scale of opportunity open 
to AMEC is substantial. Energy
markets are growing apace, major
investments in UK infrastructure
are anticipated over the next 
few years and we expect further
profits from our longer term
investments activities.
We must now ensure that we
exploit these opportunities to 
the full. On pages four and five 
of this report, we describe the
strategic changes announced 
in 2005 to enable us to do so.
By restructuring the group, 
we will overcome the investment
challenges we have recently 
faced as a large business with
competing priorities.
We hope to complete the
restructuring by the end of 2006.
While Sir Peter Mason, our chief
executive, is due to retire in
September, he is committed 
to assisting in this strategy and 
is working with the board to 
ensure a smooth transition 
to his successor .
15 March 2006 4 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Reshaping for growth
Sir Peter Mason KBE
Chief executive 
Restructuring will result in two separate entities
with greater operational and financial flexibility 
During 2005, AMEC embarked on
major strategic changes designed
to enable us to deliver increasing
value to investors. We have
decided to reshape the group,
selling our European business
AMEC SPIE, and to separate the
remaining group into two. In this
section of the report, we explain
the rationale for this change and
what we believe it will achieve. AMEC plc annual report 2005 5
Why change?
Over the last decade, we
successfully transformed AMEC
from a largely UK building
business into an international,
diversified group. By 2004, AMEC
had developed three distinct core
businesses: in global oil and gas,
engineering services, and projects,
such as PPP . By 2005, these
businesses were noticeably
diverging. Their different
management and investment
needs meant we could no longer
optimise their potential within 
the group and early in the year, 
we started the work that evolved
into the strategy we announced 
in November and which we 
are pursuing today.
Proposed sale of 
AMEC SPIE
The first phase of this strategy will
be the sale of AMEC SPIE. This has
been an excellent investment for
AMEC, but it needs substantial
resources to thrive in the
consolidating European market.
We see opportunities for higher
growth in our core energy and
process markets, together with
continuing opportunities to invest in
our portfolio of equity investments.
There is a good appetite for this
type of business and we have
already received many expressions
of interest from trade and private
equity buyers. We expect to realise
an attractive profit on the sale,
allowing us to strengthen the
AMEC balance sheet.
Restructuring into two
distinct businesses
Following the sale of AMEC SPIE,
we will restructure our remaining
businesses into two separate
entities:
Energy and Process
An international business
serving companies in the
natural resources, power and
process sectors and including
AMEC’s Oil and Gas, Mining,
Nuclear, Industrial and
Environmental businesses.
UK Infrastructure
A UK business, serving public
and private sector organisations
in the UK infrastructure market
and including AMEC’s
Construction, Mechanical and
Electrical, PPP, Property
Developments, Wind and UK
Rail businesses.
This strategy will achieve focus in
the fast-growing natural resources
and energy markets on the 
one hand, and a UK focused
investments and construction
portfolio on the other . We believe 
it is the right route to release 
the considerable value in the
AMEC group.
The next section of this report, 
the layout of which follows our
segmental analysis, gives you
more detail on our activities
(excluding AMEC SPIE) and covers
the prospects for each of our
major markets, after which follows
a review of our performance 
in 2005. 6 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Oil and Gas
Overview
Our services to clients in the oil 
and gas sector divide into three 
key areas: our global oil and 
gas services business, mining 
and pipelines.
AMEC provides a broad range of
services to the oil and gas industry
worldwide, creating and supporting
oil and gas assets. We offer
consultancy and design services,
project management, commissioning,
and asset support for our clients’
production facilities, particularly
offshore platforms.
In the mining sector, our activities
include our market leading oil
sands operations in Canada,
together with engineering and
project management services 
for clients producing minerals 
and metals.
A global market leader
in oil and gas services
Advanced computer
modelling is one 
of our strengths 
in oil and gas
services AMEC plc annual report 2005 7
Our global oil and gas services
business has a leading market
position in developing complex
facilities and in maintaining 
and extending the life of
hydrocarbon facilities. 
We work for a broad range 
of clients, including major
international oil and gas companies
and smaller independent operators.
In addition, we are working for 
an increasing number of national
oil companies in key areas such 
as the Middle East and the former
Soviet Union.
Oil and gas engineering work is
highly specialised, requiring a deep
understanding of both the industry
and its requirements, together 
with the ability to manage the local
environment in which oil and gas
extraction takes place. Health 
and safety and environmental
concerns, as well as excellent
programme or project
management, are critical to the
success of major oil and gas
projects. The assurance of local
content is also a key differentiator
for AMEC. Through local
partnerships, supply chain
management and training
services, we can offer a unique
solution to evolving “frontier”
markets. For these reasons,
barriers to entry in this market 
are high and AMEC is one of 
a few major players in the field. 
Although the roots of the business
originated over 30 years ago in the
UK North Sea, we have successfully
pursued a strategy of international
growth in recent years, working
closely with long-term clients in
the development and operational
support of their facilities around
the world. As a result, over 
50 per cent of our revenues today
are generated outside of the UK.
Our exit from lump-sum upstream
fabrication activities has reduced
risk and improved the quality of
earnings, with the substantial
majority of our oil and gas revenues
now coming from services activities,
often in the form of long-term 
cost reimbursable contracts with
performance related upside. 
Demand for our oil and gas
services is linked to the level 
of spending on new production
facilities, together with extending
the life and increasing production
from existing infrastructure. With
oil and gas expected to remain the
dominant source of global energy
supply for the foreseeable future,
we expect to see continued growth
in demand for hydrocarbons, which
will require further investment 
in new facilities, especially as our
clients move into more challenging
operating environments. 8 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Oil and Gas
continued
Global services
Our oil and gas global services
business offers value adding
services to both major players 
and the new breed of smaller
independents operating out 
of the North Sea. Now with 
an international reach far beyond 
its origins, it operates in six key
regions: the Americas, Europe 
and Africa, Russia and the CIS, 
the Middle East, Asia Pacific 
and China. The acquisition of the
Houston-based company Paragon
during 2005 gave us a strong new
base and access to key customers
in the Gulf of Mexico region 
and beyond. 
Strong client relationships
We have worked with a number of
major international oil companies,
such as BP, Exxon, Shell and Total,
for several decades. More recently,
we have successfully expanded 
to work with newer customers like
Talisman and Nexen in the UK,
Woodside Petroleum in Australia
and the Kuwait Oil Company. We
see real potential to support both
smaller independent and national
oil companies, as they expand.
Broad portfolio of contracts
Our upstream work includes
contracts for the design, project
management and commissioning
of major offshore oil facilities, the
provision of brownfield services,
the hook-up and commissioning 
of platforms, project and
programme management and
operations support and
maintenance.
Downstream, we provide a range of
engineering, project management,
operations and maintenance
services for refining, petrochemicals
and gas processing facilities. 
We have recently secured a number
We provide oil and
gas services to
clients in locations
from the UK North
Sea to Australia AMEC plc annual report 2005 9
of important contracts for new 
gas infrastructure in the UK, 
which will be a key part in the
expansion of the national gas
transmission system. 
Long-term growth
opportunities
Oil and gas remains a strong
market, as producers strive to
increase their proven reserves and
accelerate their development. Our
expertise in complex projects and
often hostile environments, together
with our thorough approach to
environmental and local content
issues position us to help our
clients achieve these goals.
A key area for growth is in
brownfield developments – where
new facilities are developed
alongside existing ones to extend
their operating lives. Brownfield
contracts must be delivered with
minimum downtime, to maintain
the existing supply, and so the
rewards for success can be high.
With over 250 fields with
brownfield potential in the North
Sea alone, we see this line of work
as particularly promising. During
2005, we have been working on the
design of the Britannia Satellites
brownfield development for
ConocoPhillips, which should
become operational in 2006.
At the same time, new markets
are now opening up as national oil
companies, which historically held
monopolies, increasingly outsource
services. Our industry knowledge,
combined with leadership in
training and working with local
workforces is a real advantage 
in these markets, where these
factors are often a requirement.
Companies providing services
during the exploration phase of the
oil and gas value chain are already
seeing the benefit from increased
oil and gas spending. Because we
provide services to the production
and support phases of the value
chain, these benefits should flow
through to our business in turn.

Pipelines
We are a leader in the international
pipeline industry, working on some
of the most challenging projects 
in climates ranging from tropical
rainforests to frozen tundra. 
Our services range from planning
and regulatory permitting 
through to consulting and design,
financial planning, engineering,
procurement, construction
management, commissioning,
operation and maintenance. 
In 2005, we completed our section
of the BTC oil pipeline in Georgia,
and, in 2006, will be working in
Yemen on 350km of gas pipeline
together with ancillary structures.
There are a number of international
pipeline projects scheduled beyond
2006 which are expected to provide
significant opportunities for this
area of our activities.

Mining
In the mining sector, our activities
include our market leading oil
sands operations in Canada,
together with engineering and
project management services 
for clients producing minerals 
and metals.
Minerals and metals
Here, we provide consulting
services, design and manage the
construction of mines for clients
producing base metals, gold,
diamonds, potash and uranium,
predominantly in North America.
High commodity prices have
produced strong demand for 
our services and future prospects
are good. 
Our clients in the mining sector
include DeBeers, who awarded 
us contracts during 2005 to provide
detailed engineering, procurement
and construction management
services for their first two diamond
mines in Canada: Snap Lake 
and Victor .
Canadian oil sands 
Oil sands are deposits of bitumen
that can be extracted either through
surface mining or in-situ techniques.
With estimated reserves of around
177 billion barrels, the Canadian 
oil sands in Alberta are the largest
source of oil outside of the 
Middle East. 
Based in Calgary, our oil sands
business is the market leader in
engineering services in the surface
mining sector . We have built our
position through knowledge and
experience with leading edge
extraction technologies. 
At today’s oil prices, oil sands
extraction produces good returns
on capital investment and has led
to unprecedented demand for our
services. And we expect growth 
in capital expenditure to continue,
with clients planning significant
new projects.

Nuclear
AMEC has many decades of
experience in the nuclear sector,
and, having acquired the UK nuclear
services business NNC during
2005, is now the UK’s largest private
sector supplier of engineering
solutions and safety consultancy
services to the nuclear sector . 
We provide services throughout 
the life of nuclear assets, with our
focus being on the three key areas
of conceptual design and design
development for new build,
operations support for existing
assets and decommissioning 
and waste management. We also
provide specialist research and
consultancy services to both public
and private sector clients. 
One of the most exciting
opportunities we see today
Engineering and
T echnical Services
We are the UK’s
largest private 
sector supplier of
engineering services
to the nuclear sector AMEC plc annual report 2005 13
Clients
AMEC’s nuclear business has
operated in the UK for some
decades and also works in 
the Americas, South Africa,
Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union. 
In the UK, we work for British
Nuclear Group (BNG, formerly
BNFL) British Energy, the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
(“UKAEA”) and AWE Aldermaston,
while in the Americas, the US
Department of Energy is a key
client. AMEC has an established
track record in Canada, where it
has been awarded a major contract
with Bruce Power, worth up to
Cdn$510 million (£245 million), 
to manage the restart of reactors
one and two, at Bruce A Power
Station in Ontario.
In the US, we have a proprietary
waste vitrification technology,
GeoMelt
®
, which uses an electric
current to convert waste into a safe
and durable glass-like material
that is ten times stronger than
concrete, resistant to weathering
and is expected to maintain its
physical and chemical integrity
over tens of thousands of years.
GeoMelt
®
is being used by the 
US Department of Energy to treat
nuclear waste and could be used
in the clean-up of nuclear facilities
around the world.
Long-term opportunities
Worldwide, the clean-up of nuclear
waste and the decommissioning 
of nuclear facilities represents 
a major opportunity for AMEC.
Over the next 40 years, more 
than 440 nuclear power plants
across the world will require
decommissioning. Beyond that,
there are likely to be new build
opportunities as concerns about
fossil fuel emissions prompt
countries around the world 
to revisit nuclear power as 
an energy source for the future. 
Restructuring of the 
UK industry
The UK nuclear industry offers real
potential, as the newly-created
Nuclear Decommissioning Authority
or “NDA”, starts to decommission
and clean up UK sites and
associated waste. The budget 
for this work will initially be 
£2 billion a year – with a total 
of around £60 billion over the next
40 years or so. The NDA’s stated
intention of opening the market to
private sector competitors presents
AMEC with a major opportunity.
Working in partnership with UKAEA
and the US company CH2M HILL,
we will compete vigorously for the
new contracts and believe we are
well placed to take a substantial
share of the market. 
Our project management skills
and track record in the industry 
put us in a strong position to target
major new opportunities on both
sides of the Atlantic. 14 AMEC plc annual report 2005

UK power utilities
In power, we design, deliver and
support infrastructure assets for
gas and electricity utilities across
the UK, where we are a leading
supplier to National Grid. 
In gas distribution, our activities
include design and installation,
renewal and extension together
with maintenance and repair
services. Over the last five years,
we have carried out substantial
network renewal work in North
London, East Anglia, South Wales,
the South West and the West
Midlands and are currently
renewing gas mains along the M1
corridor between Sheffield and
Leicester .
In the electricity sector, we are
refurbishing overhead power
transmission lines as part of the
upgrade and improvement of the
national grid to meet increased
demand from generators 
and consumers. 
The UK power utilities market
should offer good growth
opportunities as infrastructure 
is renewed and upgraded to cater 
for increasing demand. National
Grid is planning to invest over
£400 million over the next five
years on the gas transmission
network, whilst total spend on 
the electric transmission network
is expected to be between £1.4
and £2.1 billion.
UK building and
facilities services
We work for selected private 
sector clients with specialised
requirements for highly engineered
facilities, including BAA plc
(“BAA”). During 2005 we provided
engineering services and support
at all seven BAA airports in the 
UK under long-term frameworks,
together with a separate, major
contract for work at Heathrow’s
Terminal 5. 
We provide total life 
of asset support to
clients in the power 
and process
industries AMEC plc annual report 2005 15
Another of our clients with exacting
standards is the McLaren Group,
parent company of Team McLaren
Mercedes, for whom we helped
deliver their technology centre 
and are providing long-term asset
support services as building
services partner .
North American 
process industry
Our North American industrial
business designs and delivers
plant for process industries such
as forest products, pharmaceuticals,
food and cement.
We have a leading market position
in the North American market for
forest products, where we provide
total life of asset support for 
pulp and paper making facilities
for clients including Bowater .
Meanwhile, in the food and
beverage and cement sectors
clients for our engineering services
include Kraft, General Mills and TXI.
Capital investment in new plant,
which drives our revenue in this
market sector, fell sharply in 2001.
Since then, our business in the 
US saw a much-reduced flow of
orders, until 2005, when we saw 
a good recovery. The anticipated
upturn in our markets has been
slow to arrive, but we are now
finally seeing orders, after at 
least four years of poor demand.
We should now be well-placed 
to profit from the upturn, as we
substantially restructured our 
US cost base in response to the
downturn, improving our efficiency
and cutting our costs. Now that the
market shows signs of a broader-
based recovery, this leaner
structure gives us a good foundation
from which to deliver growth.
Recovery in US industrial markets 
is expected to continue 16 AMEC plc annual report 2005

Environmental
Our environmental business
provides a range of specialist
services such as environmental
assessments, materials testing,
specialist water, geo-technical and
clean-up services for public and
private sector clients across a wide
range of end markets, particularly 
in the natural resources and power
and process sectors. 
We have a highly qualified workforce
of 2,500 consultants and engineers
and operate from over 100 offices
across the Americas and
internationally . 
Our experience in advising on 
the restoration and protection 
of sensitive environments has
enabled us to establish strong
relationships with customers 
for whom corporate responsibility
and sustainability are a priority. 
Our specialist environmental
services include noise
pollution testing AMEC plc annual report 2005 17
Security
AMEC offers services in crisis
situations, such as the aftermath
of accidents, natural disasters,
war, or terrorist incidents. Our
experience includes clean-up after
9/11 at the World Trade Center,
rebuilding the Pentagon, our work
in Iraq – and we were recently
asked to lead the recovery at
Buncefield, the oil depot in the 
UK which was destroyed by a
major explosion. Our reputation 
for rapid mobilisation in these
situations is increasing. 
Natural resources
We see good opportunities 
in Canada’s mining and energy
sectors. Many significant new
pipeline projects, such as the
proposed 1,150 kilometre pipeline
from Edmonton, Alberta to Kitimat,
British Columbia, require our
specialised regulatory and
stakeholder knowledge. Mining
environmental assessments 
are also in demand, such as that
for De Beers’ new Victor diamond
mine in Northern Ontario during
2005. In the oil sands region 
of Northern Alberta, we provide
environmental and geotechnical
consulting, including mining
services at Syncrude and 
Suncor mine sites.
Partly due to increasing demand
for natural resources, our clients 
are expanding internationally. 
In 2005, we conducted significant
environmental assessments for 
our mining and energy clients 
in Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Romania,
Bulgaria and Libya, and expect 
this trend to grow.
Opportunities for 
long-term growth
Higher commodity prices are
producing good growth
opportunities. Companies are
increasingly seeking advice on
environmental, regulatory and
legal matters, “green” design,
sustainable site or project
management. 
Increased federal spending will
also drive demand. In particular,
the US Department of Defence
Base Realignment and Closure
initiative is expected to lead to
US$20 billion of additional spending.
As a leading supplier to the US
Department of Defence, AMEC 
is well placed to compete for 
this work. 
In addition to these opportunities
for organic growth, the market for
environmental services is large
and fragmented, offering scope 
for growth through consolidation. 
Higher commodity prices and tighter
regulation are driving growth 18 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Project Solutions
UK infrastructure
AMEC has a long history in the 
UK infrastructure market, originally 
as a civil engineer builder and
mechanical contractor and today 
as an investor, developer, designer,
project manager and provider 
of a range of specialist support
services. We offer a package of
services, from equity investment, 
to designing, delivering and
maintaining over the long term
hospitals, schools, transport
infrastructure and commercial 
and government buildings.
Public and private 
sector clients
The UK Government is a key
customer, for whom we work across
the defence, education, transport
and health markets. Our work in
the defence sector includes design
and delivery of the new submarine
berthing facility at Her Majesty’s
Naval Base Clyde, together with
property management services 
at approximately 400 Ministry 
of Defence establishments across
Scotland under a seven-year joint
venture contract. 
Our rail projects business
provides specialised
engineering in signalling,
electrification and
communications AMEC plc annual report 2005 19
In education, healthcare and
transport, we invest in, deliver 
and provide support services to 
our clients, often on a PPP basis.
During 2005, construction was
successfully completed on the 
first phase of the new University
College London Hospital and the
Docklands Light Railway extension
to London City Airport, and both
these projects have now moved
into the operational phase. 
We have particular strength 
in delivering large and complex
infrastructure projects such as
hospitals and urban regeneration
projects, where our integrated
approach and project management
skills add value for our clients. 
We have a strong record as 
a developer of mixed use urban
redevelopment schemes, usually
working in partnership with 
the public sector, and a growing
reputation as a developer 
of renewable energy projects,
especially in the wind sector .
We also have one of the leading
rail projects businesses in the 
UK, which provides specialised
engineering in signalling,
electrification and communications,
together with project management
and delivery services. This business
has worked on projects including
the new high speed Channel
Tunnel line between Folkestone
and Swanley, Kent; the West Anglia
Route Modernisation and West
Coast Mainline. It also provides
asset support services on the
London Underground. 
Future prospects
We have long standing and
successful relationships with the
UK Government and other public
sector agencies and see significant
opportunities arising from their
commitment to sustained spending
on infrastructure, whether through
traditional contracting, long-term
framework contracts, development-
type projects or PPP . 
Close long-term relationships with
our clients in the private sector 
are a key determinant of activity
levels and growth in the business.
We will continue to differentiate
our services in our chosen markets
through integrated engineering
design and management skills,
coupled with innovations in
systems and modularisation. 
Our focus will continue to be 
on large, complex projects, for 
both public and private sector
clients, that require a high level 
of technical skill.

Private Partnerships (“PPP”)
market since the introduction 
of the Private Finance Initiative 
and has a specialist team of
professionals engaged in the
complete PPP delivery structure,
from front end bidding to long-term
management of the investment. 
We apply strict selection criteria 
to the work we do in PPP and
focus on projects where there 
is the opportunity for us to invest,
deliver and maintain – in other
words, where we can secure
multiple income streams.

investment in the next extension 
to the Docklands Light Railway
through to Woolwich Arsenal, 
and for the project management,
operation and investment in 
the Incheon Bridge project 
in South Korea. 
We are preferred bidder on South
Lanarkshire Schools, the largest
PPP schools project undertaken to
date in the UK, and on Colchester
Hospital, both of which are due 
to reach financial close in the 
first half of 2006. We are also
shortlisted for two more hospital
projects, Fife in Scotland and
St Luke’s in Middlesbrough and
two further school projects, East
Dunbartonshire in Scotland and
the Knowsley Building Schools 
for the Future project.
With our total equity investments 
in PPP projects currently valued 
at £109 million – significantly
in excess of the book value of
£66 million – investment in 
South Lanarkshire Schools and
Colchester Hospital imminent and
further investment opportunities
expected, we see this area of the
business generating substantial
value in the future.
Growth
In the UK, PPP remains a major
government procurement route for
capital projects, with hospitals and
schools representing key growth
areas. The NHS is planning to
continue its multi billion pound
capital investment programme
with a substantial part of this to 
be delivered via PPP . Significant
opportunities are also expected in
education, where the government
is aiming to improve all secondary
school buildings in England under
the Building Schools for the Future
programme within 10-15 years. 22 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Property developments
We offer property development
services from land assembly,
remediation and planning through
to financing and project
management, and have particular
expertise in mixed use urban
regeneration projects (including
retail, commercial, residential and
leisure). We take developments
through the planning, funding 
and regulatory hurdles they face 
in the early stages, and have built
strong relationships working in
partnership with both public and
private sector landowners. 
We have two particularly important
joint ventures in the regeneration
area – ISIS Waterside Regeneration,
with British Waterways and Morley
Fund Management, to redevelop
British Waterways’ large portfolio
of surplus land, and English Cities
Fund, with English Partnerships
and Legal & General, to
regenerate inner city locations. 
Elsewhere, our portfolio includes
the following schemes, which are
currently in development:
Business Parks at Cheadle
Royal and Lingley Mere
Distribution facilities in Glasgow
and Wakefield Europort 
Mixed use facilities in Durham
and Manchester

Project Solutions
continued AMEC plc annual report 2005 23
Our future developments, which 
we would generally expect to 
take forward on a pre-let/pre-sold
basis, include mixed use schemes 
at Chatham Place, Reading, 
(1.25m sq.ft.) and Lewisham
Gateway (1.1m sq.ft.) and a 
1.6m sq.ft. industrial development
on the Lord Halifax Estate in Leeds.
We have also been selected as joint-
venture developer of the North
Shore, Stockton-on-T ees mixed use
regeneration scheme and are
shortlisted on a number of others.
The strength of the current portfolio
and the focus on sustainable mixed
use development means that we are
well placed to generate a substantial
earnings stream for the future.
Wind energy
AMEC is a leading player in the 
UK wind farm development
market, both onshore and offshore.
Our business model is to identify
sites, gather and interpret wind
data, handle the planning process,
raise finance, design, build and
manage the wind farm through to
operation – or sale to a third party. 
Our onshore portfolio of around
1,400MW (including third party
shares) includes the following sites
of 50MW or more:
Kyle Forest, East Ayrshire/
Dumfries and Galloway 285MW   
Lewis, Western Isles 
(in Joint Venture with 
British Energy) 700MW   
Clashindarroch,
Aberdeenshire/Moray 100MW   
Ray, Northumberland 60MW
Aultmore, Moray 60MW   
Edinbane, Isle of Skye 50MW 
In the offshore sector, we are
leading the development of 
a 75MW development near
Aberdeen, and are providing
development and environmental
services to Centrica on projects
with a potential output exceeding
1,000MW. 
The UK wind energy market is
being driven by government policy
to achieve overall renewable
energy targets of 10 per cent of
electricity generation by 2010 
and 15 per cent by 2015. While
progress is being made towards
achieving these targets, projects
still face delays caused by
planning, environmental 
and electricity transmission
capacity issues. 
The relative shortage of new
capacity in the market, coupled
with investors keen to participate
in the sector for both economic
and environmental reasons, gives
AMEC the confidence to continue
to build its position in what we
anticipate will be a very valuable
market for us over the next 
few years.

Sustainability 
stepping up in AMEC
Generating a profit at any cost 
is neither morally nor socially
acceptable. AMEC has
acknowledged, for many years, 
that in order to provide our
shareholders with a long-term
sustainable profit we need 
to manage our non-financial
responsibilities, which take 
into account our wider societal
obligations, including our social
and environmental responsibilities,
sometimes referred to as corporate
social responsibilities. In short,
sustainability is about good
business practice and promoting
improvement in how we manage
the business in a way that delivers
value to our stakeholders. 
Embedding sustainability 
in our business
In February 2005, we appointed 
a dedicated sustainability
programme manager reporting 
to a senior director who has 
overall responsibility for
sustainability issues.
Guiding Principles
During the year, we took steps 
to place more emphasis on
sustainability as a central aspect 
of the way we manage. Specifically,
Sustainability
people, planet 
and prosperity
In 2005 we
discontinued hard
copy sustainability
reporting and
introduced a detailed
report on-line at 
our website
www.amec.com AMEC plc annual report 2005 25
we revised the Guiding Principles
which govern the way we run the
company, so that working in a
sustainable way is now explicitly
part of these – previously, we had
separate sustainability principles.
Our Guiding Principles, which can
be found on our website, commit
us to work ethically, safely, and 
in a way that respects other people
and the environment.
Board commitment
The board continued to receive
regular briefings on significant
elements of the sustainability
programme, through board
meetings. Sir Peter Mason, chief
executive, continued to chair the
sustainability programme and 
is actively involved in setting the
direction and supporting the
programme. In addition, individual
performance assessments,
including sustainability related
objectives (e.g. safety and
organisational issues) were
considered as part of the executive
directors’ bonus plan during 2005.
Continual improvement
Using the risk management
process to inform our Guiding

performance
During 2005, AMEC participated 
in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index (“DJSI”) and the Business 
in the Community (“BitC”)
Corporate Responsibility and
Environmental indices.
Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
We were listed as the industry
leader for the Support Services
sector in both the Dow Jones
World and Pan European
Sustainability indices for 2005. 
The annual review of the DJSI
group is based on a thorough
assessment of corporate economic,
environmental and social
performance. Its results influence
the investment decisions of asset
managers in 14 countries. 
Business in the Community 
We were ranked in the top 100 in both
the BitC Corporate Responsibility
and Environmental indices during
2004. Results for 2005 will soon 
be published and will be made
available in our on-line
sustainability performance report.
Future priorities
We have instigated a number of
changes during 2005 relating to 
our core sustainability programme.
We will ensure that these changes
are implemented throughout the
business during 2006. 
Using information gained from 
our stakeholder engagement
throughout the year and
management survey results we
have identified three key objectives
to build on through 2006:
Leadership engagement –
strengthening support and
ownership of the new “Shaping
AMEC” working sustainably
programme
Business alignment – improving
the link between business 
value and our sustainability
responsibilities as identified 
in the new Guiding Principles
Communication – clear 
and simple messaging of
sustainability issues and linking
to the new Guiding Principles

Chief executive’ s review
Our continuing businesses present
substantial but different opportunities
Sir Peter Mason KBE
Chief executive 
2005 was a good year across 
most of our main businesses, 
with profits in Oil and Gas up 
by 25 per cent and Engineering and
Technical Services by 18 per cent.
However, whilst our PPP activities
performed well, the overall
outcome for the year was heavily
influenced by poor performance 
in UK Construction. Full details 
of our results for 2005 are given 
in the business and financial 
review that follows this section. AMEC plc annual report 2005 31
Future growth 
Looking ahead, confirmation of 
our strategy of the proposed sale 
of AMEC SPIE, followed by the
separation of remaining activities,
will allow us to capitalise on growth
opportunities in our core energy
and process markets and to
continue to build our portfolio 
of equity investments.
Engineering and T echnical
Services (“ETS”) 
All of our major ETS markets, with
the exception of Iraq, are either in
recovery, already growing, or have
real prospects for growth.
In Continental Europe, AMEC SPIE
continues to grow with increasing
levels of economic activity, and
further improvement in margin 
is expected.
Iraq is now declining, as US funding
tails off. While we will need to
replace this income, our recognition
as a leading contractor in Iraq has
helped build our reputation as a
natural choice to manage complex
“disaster recovery” projects.
Recently, for instance, we were
asked to lead the recovery at
Buncefield, the oil depot in the 
UK which was destroyed by a
major explosion.
Meanwhile, we see real recovery 
in US industrial markets and our
environmental business is benefiting
from the trend to greater regulation,
and strength in energy markets.
In the UK, our industrial business
is developing a range of power and
gas storage and distribution assets.
This is a rapidly expanding market
as ageing infrastructure and
concerns over security of supply
drive demand. Spending in this
market is set to grow substantially
over the next five to ten years.
Meanwhile, we are beginning 
to benefit from the global
reassessment of nuclear power
and are well placed to win a good
share of the UK decommissioning 
market and, beyond that, other
international contracts.
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas markets remain strong
and our particular skill set and
experience means we are well
positioned to benefit from market
drivers. In the mature North Sea
market, we are the market leader
in upgrading and extending existing
assets (brownfield work) and we
are the leading engineering player
in the fast-growing oil sands
investments in Canada – winning
new work with our major
customers. Beyond that, we have 
a strong position in fast emerging
regions such as Azerbaijan and
Sakhalin in Russia, where our
experience of partnering with 
local suppliers makes us a 
natural choice.  32 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Chief executive’ s review
continued
Project Solutions 
In our Construction Services
business, the main growth
opportunity is recovery – following
our exit from unattractive markets
and our substantial restructuring
of the business. 
In the Investments segment, 
we have assembled a high quality
portfolio of assets, having invested
selectively for a number of years.
And the value of these investments
is increasing as discount rates
have been improving. We are
continuing to invest in quality
opportunities and both our PPP
and Property Developments
businesses are targeting several
new schemes each year .
Investment opportunities
As we look to the future, and to 
the restructuring of our continuing
businesses following the
prospective sale of AMEC SPIE, 
the nature of the opportunity 
is different in each of the 
Energy and Process and UK
Infrastructure businesses.
In our Energy and Process
businesses, notably oil and gas,
mining, and downstream gas and
power, we are in markets that are
enjoying quite dramatic growth,
and in some cases this will be
sustained for some years. AMEC 
is already a strong player in these
markets, but we need more
resources to meet the demand. 
By making selective, quality
acquisitions, we can gain scale,
and achieve growth more quickly,
from 2007 and beyond. 
In the UK Infrastructure business,
we see rather different engines 
for growth. Recovery in the
Construction Services business
will be one, and continuing to
release value from the investments
portfolio will be another . Beyond
that, we must maintain the pipeline
of investments. However, there 
is also room here for selective
acquisition, for instance in the
facilities management and building
services areas where we have 
a good base but can scale up.
Across our markets, therefore,
there is considerable opportunity 
to accelerate growth, and the
prospective sale of AMEC SPIE will
give us the balance sheet strength
to pursue selected opportunities, 
in a planned way, with real focus
on building our position in our
target markets. AMEC plc annual report 2005 33
Sustainability
During 2005, we took steps to place
more emphasis on sustainability 
as a central aspect of the way we
manage the business. We made
further progress in our overall
performance in health and safety,
environment, community and
employment. However, it saddens
me personally and remains
unacceptable that we suffered eight
fatalities at work and I remain
committed to promoting increased
vigilance in the workplace to
ensure a safer year in 2006. 
An overview of 2005 appears 
on pages 24 to 27 of this report 
and our sustainability report is
available on-line at our website
www.amec.com
Outlook
We continue to see generally
strong market conditions in our
European Multitechnical and
Environmental businesses and
recovery in North American
industrial markets is expected 
to continue. Our activities which
contributed to the rebuilding 
of infrastructure in Iraq will
continue throughout 2006, but 
at a much reduced level. This will
lead to a smaller contribution to
profits than in 2005.
Oil and gas markets are 
expected to remain robust and 
our order book is strong. Overall
performance for the Oil and Gas
segment in 2006 is expected to 
be offset by a lower contribution
from mining activity in North
America following an outstanding
year in 2005.
With construction activities now
stabilised and another strong
performance expected from the
PPP business, we expect to see
Project Solutions make satisfactory
progress during 2006. 
Taking these factors into account,
the board maintains its earlier
expectations for overall progress*
in 2006.

Adjusted pre-tax profit* for the year ended
31 December 2005 increased by 7.4 per cent to 
£124.1 million, a performance that was at the upper
end of market expectations**. There was a pre-tax
exceptional charge of £89.5 million, and intangible
amortisation of £6.0 million, resulting in pre-tax profit
of £25.4 million (2004: £91.2 million).
The following is based on a review of the year ended

Engineering and Technical Services produced strong
results in 2005, with the 18 per cent growth in profit
reflecting improved performance in Iraq, increased
activity and margin in the Continental European
Multitechnical Services business and another record
year in the Environmental business. 
The Continental European Multitechnical Services
business benefited from strong demand in the Paris
region during 2005. The business is embarked on 
a margin improvement programme that contributed
to margin increase during the year and which is
expected to result in further improvement during
2006. Growth in that business is driven by organic
growth together with small acquisitions that extend
the local services network. During the course 
of 2005, a series of five small businesses were 
acquired (2004: eight).
The Environmental Services business continues 
to report record levels of performance, largely due 
to increased US Federal Government work, including
contracts in Iraq, the US and elsewhere around 
the world.
AMEC’s share of 2005 revenue under the Nash water
and power contracts in Iraq was £180 million. Levels
of activity in Iraq are expected to decline significantly
beyond the first quarter of 2006. 
In the important market for nuclear services, we 
have been awarded a major contract by Bruce Power, 
with a value up to Cdn$510 million (£245 million), 
to manage the restart of two nuclear reactors 
at the Bruce A power station in Ontario, Canada. 
The contract was the first major award for AMEC
Nuclear, which was created in July 2005 following the
acquisition of the UK’s leading private sector nuclear
services company, NNC Holdings Limited (“NNC”). 
In January 2006, AMEC Nuclear formed a major
alliance with UKAEA and the US company CH2M HILL
to target opportunities in the UK market for nuclear
decommissioning and clean-up, estimated to be worth
around £60 billion over the next 40 years. The alliance
complements our own nuclear, commercial and
programme management skills with UKAEA’s deep
knowledge of operating UK nuclear facilities and
CH2M HILL ’s track record in many of the largest and
most complex decommissioning projects in the US.
We believe that through this alliance we are well
placed to secure a substantial share of this market.
During the year we worked on a number of important
contracts in the UK power utility market, including
refurbishing overhead power transmission lines 
for National Grid in the south-west of England and 
in Nottinghamshire.

We were also busy at Heathrow Airport, London,

and electrical services (schematic shown left) at 
BAA’s Terminal 5.
ETS order intake has been strong during 2005.
Excluding Iraq, order intake was 10 per cent ahead 
of sales during the period.
The Continental European Multitechnical Services
business is expected to make further progress in
2006. In the largely North American Environmental
Services business, higher commodity prices,
increasing environmental regulation and federal
spending continue to drive growth. 
Following a prolonged period of weakness, our US
industrial markets showed some recovery during the
second half of 2005 and further recovery is anticipated
in 2006. Given the long-term nature of the projects 
in this market, the full benefit to earnings of recent
contract awards will not be felt until 2007. 
Positive developments in ETS will be offset by a
significant reduction in our Iraq activities during 2006

Revenue increased by 20 per cent to £1,405.6 million,
including over £240 million (2004: £140 million) in
respect of lump-sum fabrication activity on which 
we are not earning any margin. After adjusting 
for this activity, which is now completed, revenue 
for the year increased by 12 per cent, with the margin
for the year improving by 0.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent
compared with 2004. 
With the business no longer performing upstream
lump-sum fabrication, risk has been reduced 
and the quality of future earnings improved. 
Profit was 25 per cent ahead of 2004 and reflected 
a good performance across our UK upstream asset
services business, an outstanding year in Canada 
and a first contribution from Paragon Engineering
Services Inc (“Paragon”), which has been successfully
integrated and has performed in line with 
our expectations. 
Adjusted net assets of £123.8 million (2004: 
£129.0 million) remain above normal levels and 
reflect capital employed on several projects. Positive
progress is being made towards final contract
settlement on these projects and we should see 
a reduction in capital employed during 2006.
The market for oil and gas services is growing in all
areas, with increases in both capital expenditure and
operating expenditure as oil and gas companies seek
new resources, especially in emerging markets. 
This is reflected in the Oil and Gas order book, 
which was up by 46 per cent to £1.9 billion at the 
year-end (2004: £1.3 billion).
Recent contract awards include engineering/project
management services for BP Harding and brownfield
services for BG Group, both in the UK North Sea, 
asset support services for Woodside in Australia and 
an extension of our asset support contract with Shell 
at their Malampaya facility in the Philippines.
Investment in new capacity to extract oil from the
Canadian oil sands is currently undergoing rapid
growth and recent joint venture contracts for new
facilities include asset development services for Petro
Canada and for Shell Canada. In the UK gas utilities
market, we secured contracts for gas importing,
storage and distribution, including an eight year
alliance contract worth approximately £280 million
from National Grid to replace gas mains along the 
M1 corridor .

Whilst the Canadian oil sands and mining businesses
had an outstanding year in 2005 and we expect the oil
sands market to remain strong, activity levels in our
mining operations are expected to moderate in 2006.
The order book is strong, increasingly services-based
and well diversified geographically. This remains a very
strong market, with significant long-term opportunities
in brownfield developments, new areas of production 
and an expanding client base, now including smaller
private and national oil companies around the world. 
In the oil and gas supply chain, we work primarily in
the production and operations areas of activity and so
tend to follow those businesses engaged in the earlier
exploration phase that are currently seeing very strong
demand for their services. We should be next in the
cycle and, additionally, we will have long-term follow
through with our asset support services activities.

Revenue for the period declined by 24 per cent 
to £976.5 million, largely reflecting our exit from
unattractive activities in the US (civil engineering and
construction management) and reduced rail activity 
in the UK and France. Profit before net financing costs
for the year declined by 58 per cent to £11.2 million 
(2004: £26.7 million), reflecting weakness in UK
Construction Services, particularly roads, partly offset
by a strong performance from our PPP activities.
Following weak performance in certain of our
construction markets in the UK and the US, steps
have been taken to exit unattractive market segments
and to restructure the business, costs for which were
provided during 2005. The UK Construction Services
business has exited road building on a lump-sum
basis and certain building and refurbishment activities,
which have been loss-making for the last two years.
All ongoing contracts in these areas are nearing
completion. This business is being refocused to
concentrate on design and build activities in the
education, healthcare and infrastructure sectors 
for PPP clients, together with design and build in
sectors including defence, rail, airport and industrial.
In the US, we continue to wind down our remaining
construction management activities and have 
decided to exit our road building activities. 
The PPP business performed strongly in 2005. 
During the year the Docklands Light Railway extension
to London City Airport was opened, having been
completed ahead of schedule. Contracts were also
entered into for the design, construction, operation
and investment in the next extension to Woolwich
Arsenal and for the project management of, and
investment in, the Incheon Bridge project in South
Korea. In addition to our portfolio of 11 PPP projects,
we are preferred bidder on South Lanarkshire Schools,
the largest PPP schools project undertaken to date 
in the UK, and on Colchester Hospital, both of 
which are due to reach financial close in the first 
half of 2006. We are also shortlisted for two more
hospital projects, Fife in Scotland and St Luke’s 
in Middlesbrough and two more school projects, 
East Dunbartonshire in Scotland and the Knowsley
Building Schools for the Future project.
In Property Developments, we continue to make 
good progress on our two major multi-project joint
ventures with ISIS Waterside Regeneration (British
Waterways and Morley) and English Cities Fund
(English Partnerships and Legal & General).

In the Wind Energy business we continue to invest 
in the development of our onshore portfolio of around
1,400MW (including third party shares). Offshore, 
we are leading a 75MW development near Aberdeen
and are providing services to Centrica on projects 
with a potential output exceeding 1,000MW. 
The large Isle of Lewis project received local authority
support at the end of June 2005 but this, and other
proposed developments, remain subject to planning
consents. Continued investment in this business
resulted in a small loss in 2005. However, once
planning consents are secured, we expect to be 
able to realise substantial value quite quickly. 
The order book in Project Solutions was £1.0 billion 
at the year end, down slightly on the previous year 
(2004: £1.1 billion) and reflecting the changed focus 
of this segment.
In 2006, performance will benefit from stabilisation of
UK Construction Services. We have created a pipeline
of investment opportunities in Project Solutions 
which should continue to generate good returns.

Financial review
Changes arising from corporate activity
In January 2005 we acquired Paragon, the 
US-based oil and gas engineering services company
for £22.3 million. Paragon provides AMEC with a
major presence in Houston, the home of many of the
world’s major oil and gas companies. This business
generates annual revenues of about £45 million.
In July 2005, AMEC acquired NNC, the UK’s leading
private sector nuclear services business for £26.1 million
plus net debt of £13.7 million and created AMEC
Nuclear . This business generates annual revenues 
of about £100 million. The new business combines
NNC’s heritage of nuclear engineering services with
AMEC’s project management expertise, thereby
strengthening AMEC’s position to support the design,
operations, maintenance and decommissioning of civil
nuclear infrastructure in the UK, Canada and other
international markets.
During the year ended 31 December 2005, AMEC
SPIE acquired a 49 per cent interest in the French
nuclear engineering business GAME Nucleaire SAS
and also made five small acquisitions extending the
Multitechnical Services branch network. These in
aggregate have annual revenues of about £48 million.
Preparation of the accounts 
The 2005 annual report and accounts have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Details of how the
group’s results and financial position are affected 
by the change to IFRS are set out in note 31 to the
consolidated accounts. This includes reconciliations
from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“UK GAAP”) to IFRS for 2004.
The directors have identified the policies for accounting
for construction contracts and retirement benefits 
as the most critical because they involve high levels 
of judgement and estimation. This is discussed in
more detail in note 1 to the consolidated accounts.
Results of operations 
Revenue for the year increased by £285.0 million 
to £4,942.5 million, (2004: £4,657.5 million) principally
as a result of strong growth in Iraq and Oil and Gas,
partly offset by weakness in construction activities.
Adjusted pre-tax profit was £124.1 million, an 
increase of 7.4 per cent on the previous year 
(2004: £115.6 million).
Pre-tax profit before intangible amortisation and
exceptional items for the year was £120.9 million
(2004: £113.2 million). 
There was a pre-tax exceptional charge of £89.5 million
and intangible amortisation of £6.0 million, resulting 
in pre-tax profit of £25.4 million (2004: £91.2 million). 
The effective tax rate at 32.0 per cent has declined
from last year (2004: 35.0 per cent) as a result of
stronger performance in North America where 
tax losses have been utilised. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year
increased to 25.4 pence (2004: 24.5 pence), with the
growth of 3.7 per cent reflecting the dilutive impact 
in the first year of the share placing in January 2005.
Diluted earnings per share were 1.2 pence (2004:
16.8 pence). Proposed dividends for the year are
increased by 4.5 per cent to 11.5 pence per share.
Revenues and gross margin 
The principal areas of revenue growth were in 
AMEC SPIE, Iraq, the North American Environmental
business and Oil and Gas, offset in part by reduced
rail activity. 46 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Revenues and gross margin continued
The gross and operating margin before net financing
costs, exceptional items and intangible amortisation
were similar to those in 2004.
AMEC’s return on capital employed is reasonably
good compared to other service companies. This was
17 per cent* in 2005 (2004: 15 per cent) and with the
expected margin increases and reduction in net debt
in 2006, this measure should improve.
Administrative expenses 
Administrative expenses increased by £23 million 
to £503 million, with the increase reflecting
acquisitions and growth during the course of 
the year . Overall these costs remain at about 
10 per cent of group revenue. 
Corporate costs, which represent the costs of
operating the head office of AMEC and certain
regional overheads were slightly higher than in 2004,
with costs rising in line with inflation.
Share of joint venture results 
The share of results of joint ventures increased,
reflecting increased contributions from Developments
and Urban Regeneration activities and the Project
Equity Investments business, with one further project
becoming operational during the year . 
Net financing costs 
The group interest charge for the year (excluding 
the impact of IAS 39) increased to £21.4 million 
(2004: £18.8 million), largely due to increased
borrowing costs and the inclusion in 2004 of 
the £4.0 million gain on the disposal of PPP
subordinated debt as a credit to interest.
Net interest payable was covered 6.2 times 
(2004: 6.6 times) on what AMEC regards as the 
most meaningful basis. This is before intangible
amortisation and exceptional items and excluding
AMEC’s share of the results of joint ventures. 
The ratio of average weekly net debt to earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(“EBITDA”) was 2.5 times (2004: 2.8 times).
Taxation 
The tax charge in 2005 before exceptional items
(including AMEC’s share of pre-tax joint venture
profits) of £39.5 million (2004: £40.5 million) represents
an effective rate of 32.0 per cent as compared to
35.0 per cent in 2004. The decrease in rate is due 
to changes in the geographical origins of our profits
which has led to the utilisation of overseas tax losses. 
A tax credit of £15.0 million is attributable to the
exceptional items (2004: tax charge of £1.4 million). 
Deferred tax is recognised on certain temporary
timing differences between the accounts and the 
tax base. A deferred tax asset is recognised for
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable
that they will be utilised in the foreseeable future. At
31 December 2005, the group has deferred tax assets
of £71 million (2004: £45 million) mainly arising from
overseas tax losses, retirement provisions and fair
value losses on derivatives (under IAS 39). The group
also has deferred tax liabilities of £47 million (2004:
£46 million) mainly arising from pension surpluses
and liabilities provided in respect of future payments
for use of consortium relief losses. Deferred taxation
is not provided in respect of liabilities associated with
the distribution of accumulated reserves of overseas
subsidiaries and joint ventures.

return on capital employed
Intangible amortisation and exceptional items
Intangible amortisation increased in the year to 
£6.0 million (2004: £0.5 million). The increased 
charge principally reflects the acquisition of Paragon 
and NNC. 
In line with IAS 36 “Impairment of assets” annual
impairment reviews have been performed on the
goodwill carried on the balance sheet. The results 
of these reviews confirmed that the carrying value 
of the assets was reasonably stated. 
Aggregate post-tax exceptional costs in 2005 were
£74.5 million (2004: £22.9 million). These costs, the
substantial majority of which were non-cash items,
relate to AMEC’s withdrawal from certain construction
markets in the UK and US, oil and gas upstream
lump-sum fabrication and a provision against 
an old legal dispute in the US, as announced 
in November 2005.
The UK Construction Services business has exited
road building on a lump-sum basis and certain
building/refurbishment activities, which have been
loss-making for the last two years. All ongoing
contracts in these areas are nearing completion. 
The UK Construction Services business is being
refocused to concentrate on design and build activities
in the education, healthcare and infrastructure
sectors for PPP clients, together with design and
build in sectors including defence, rail, airport and
industrial. In the US, AMEC has decided to exit its
road building activities. 
AMEC announced in May 2004 that it was to exit the
US Construction Management market. Actions to
close the US Construction Management business are
now well advanced. AMEC continues to be involved 
in protracted litigation in respect of certain US
Construction Management contracts, some of which
date back a decade. In view of the slow progress 
in resolution of these disputes and following a review
of the costs of exiting this business, AMEC is making
a post-tax provision of approximately £26 million.
The post-tax cost of exiting UK and US contracting
activities, which in the past too often lead to
contractual disputes and therefore uncertain financial
outcome, is expected to be approximately £35 million.
As previously reported, the Oil and Gas business is 
no longer pursuing lump-sum fabrication projects in
upstream and certain other areas. As a result of both
this and delays in the settlement of final accounts on
several major projects, the board believes that it is
prudent to make a post-tax provision of approximately
£13 million.
Earnings per share
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year
increased to 25.4 pence (2004: 24.5 pence). Growth of
3.7 per cent largely reflected the dilutive impact of the
issue of approximately 30 million new shares via the
placing in January 2005. 
Dividends per share 
The board is recommending a final dividend of
7.5 pence per share (2004: 7.2 pence) which, together
with the interim dividend of 4.0 pence per share 
(2004: 3.8 pence), results in a total dividend of
11.5 pence per share (2004: 11.0 pence), an increase of
4.5 per cent. Dividend cover* is maintained at 2.2 times.

Balance sheet highlights
Tangible fixed assets increased by £9.3 million,
primarily as a result of acquisitions during the year .
AMEC acquired NNC and Paragon during the year .
These acquisitions have been accounted for under
IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” which requires
certain intangible assets to be identified 
and valued as part of the acquisition accounting. 
This has resulted in intangible assets with a value 
of £12 million being included on the balance sheet;
goodwill of £44 million was also recognised as part 
of these acquisitions.
Investments increased as a result of increased
investment in PPP concessions partially offset by 
the disposal of AMEC’s interest in The Cross Israel
highway concession. 
The balance sheet analysis shown opposite highlights
a reduction in payments on account to more 
normal levels.
Debtor levels benefited from the securitisation
programme in AMEC SPIE offset by increased activity.
In other areas, relationships were similar to 2004.
Distributable reserves
In January 2005, the group raised £89 million by 
way of a share placing to finance the acquisition 
of Paragon and to support its increased equity
investments programme. The funds were raised
using a cashbox structure. The cashbox is a company
established specifically for the purpose of the placing.
A cashbox placing is structured in such a way as to
enable a company to obtain merger relief on the issue
of the placing shares in accordance with section 131
of the Companies Act 1985. The effect of this is to
relieve the company of a requirement to credit any 
amount paid up on the shares in excess of their
nominal value to a share premium account. 
Amounts credited to share premium account are 
not distributable to shareholders and can be used
only for very limited purposes.
At the time of the placing, an opinion was obtained
from leading counsel that, provided that the
transactions set out in the agreements documenting
the cashbox structure were carried out in accordance
with their terms, an amount equal to the proceeds of
the placing less the nominal value of the shares
issued would as a matter of law constitute a profit in
the hands of AMEC and, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting practice, a realised profit for the
purposes of section 263 of the Companies Act 1985.
The result of implementing the cashbox structure
would therefore be to increase the level of profits
available for distribution to shareholders.
The transactions have been duly carried out and
accordingly an amount of £74 million has been
credited to a distributable reserve in the accounts 
of the company. As a result the company’s
distributable reserves as at 31 December 2005 
stood at £110 million.

Pensions 
The IAS19 pre-tax surplus of our principal UK pension
schemes at the end of 2005 of £74.7 million was lower
than in 2004 due to changes in financial conditions
and mortality assumptions. At the end of 2005 there
was a liability of £56.2 million in respect of an
unfunded defined benefit scheme for certain
employees in France. 
During the year, a regular triennial valuation of 
the UK schemes took place and updated mortality
assumptions have been agreed with those 
schemes’ trustees.
These assumptions have been chosen with regard to
the latest available tables, adjusted where appropriate
to reflect the experience of the company. For the main
UK pension plans, these tables lead to a life expectancy
for a male/female currently aged 60 of 23/26 years. 
The principal financial assumptions are set out in 
note 14 of the accounts.
In order to maintain the relatively strong funding
position of the schemes, AMEC has increased its cash
contribution and provided employees with a choice of
either paying higher contributions to maintain current
benefits or accepting a lower benefit scale. The total
cash contribution funds both the future accrual of
pension benefits and includes additional contributions
of about £6 million per annum to provide additional
security for past benefits.
PPP portfolio valuation 
The portfolio valuation has increased by 42 per cent 
in the year from £76.9 million at the end of 2004 to
£109.5 million at 31 December 2005, based on a
weighted average discount rate of 10.6 per cent (2004
10.5 per cent). During the same period the book value
has increased to £66.0 million (2004: £42.0 million).
The main reasons for the increase in value of the
portfolio are the addition of two new projects –
Incheon Bridge in Korea, where we hold a 23 per cent
interest in the project company and the Woolwich
Arsenal Rail Extension in London’s Docklands,
together with the completion of construction on 
the City Airport Rail Extension. AMEC is currently
preferred bidder for two further projects and short-
listed for four more, but no value is ascribed to these
positions in the valuation.
Our principal UK pension schemes
remain in surplus 50 AMEC plc annual report 2005
As the chart above right demonstrates, the valuation 
is sensitive to discount rates.
The long-term cash flows used as the basis for the
valuation are summarised in the chart above left:
The portfolio can be categorised on a sector basis 
as follows:
Valuation
Sector No. of projects £m
Transport 7 63.5
Health/Accommodation 3 43.1
Waste 1 2.9
Total 11 109.5
Of the eleven projects in the portfolio, four are
currently under construction and seven are
operational. Of the operational projects, three are in
the first two years of operations (the ramp up phase).
Portfolio valuation
A valuation of the PPP portfolio has been carried out
on a consistent semi-annual basis in December 2004,
June 2005 and December 2005. Through the
application of consistent methodology we seek to
illustrate movements in the value of the portfolio
between periods and the impact of intervening
transactions. 
Methodology
The valuation is derived by applying discounted cash
flow analysis to future forecast cash flows to which
AMEC is entitled either as shareholder or holder of
subordinated debt for each project in the portfolio.
The forecast cash flows are derived from the detailed
financial models for each of the 11 projects in the
portfolio. The models are approved and updated 
by the project company in line with operational

The discount rate utilised is arrived at by adding 
risk premia to a discount rate of 9.5 per cent for
availability-based projects and 10.5 per cent for
volume risk-based projects. A premium of 4 per cent
is added to project cash flows in the construction
phase and a premium of 2 per cent is added for the
ramp-up phase, being two years from the start of
operations. An additional risk premium of 1 per cent
has been added for overseas projects. The weighted
average discount rate for the portfolio is 10.6 per cent
(2004: 10.5 per cent). In June 2005, we engaged Ernst 
& Young LLP to carry out a review of our portfolio
valuation. The scope of Ernst & Young’s work is set
out in the footnote below. AMEC has used the same
methodology in calculating the portfolio valuation 
in December 2005 as it did in June 2005 and
December 2004.
experience and lenders’ requirements. Copies of the
models are given by the project companies on a six-
monthly basis to lenders and investors. Typically, the
project models are audited on behalf of the funders 
at financial close and also when there are major
changes to the scope of each project such as a
refinancing. The models have been analysed to
determine forecast future cash flows to AMEC. A
discounted cash flow exercise is then applied to cash
flows which are post-tax to the project company but
pre-tax to AMEC. No value is attributed to preferred
bidder positions in the portfolio valuation, neither is
any recognition made for additional future cash flows
that are not contractually certain, for example
potential refinancings. The portfolio valuations include
the benefit of UK consortium relief where applicable
discounted at 9 per cent. 
“The calculations that underpin the portfolio valuation have been
made by, and are the sole responsibility of, AMEC plc. Ernst & Young
LLP has performed agreed-upon procedures to confirm that the
aspects of the calculations have been performed correctly and the
methodology set out by AMEC plc has been correctly applied. Ernst
& Young LLP has not given an opinion as to value. Ernst & Young LLP
performed the work exclusively for AMEC plc and has reported its
findings to AMEC plc. Ernst & Young LLP accepts responsibility for
its work solely to AMEC plc and to no other party.
Ernst & Young LLP has not reviewed the financial forecasts approved
at Project Company level by the relevant Project Company entities.”

Investments in joint ventures 
Most of AMEC’s interests in PPP concession
companies and several property development 
projects are accounted for using the equity method.
These joint ventures are all stand-alone businesses,
where AMEC is in partnership with others, and are
independently funded with only limited support 
from the shareholders. 
AMEC’s share of net bank debt in PPP companies
was £541.2 million as at 31 December 2005 
(2004: £543.6 million).
The debt in PPP joint ventures is without recourse 
to AMEC. As at 31 December 2005, financial support
was limited to equity commitments of £25.1 million
(2004: £12.8 million) and contingent equity of 
£34.2 million (2004: £16.4 million). AMEC believes 
that the circumstances under which it will be called
upon to invest the contingent equity are remote.
Cash flow and current liquidity 
At 31 December 2005 net debt was £246 million
(2004: £284 million). This was better than AMEC’s
previous expectations.
Average weekly net debt in 2005 was £420 million
(2004: £450 million). As previously reported, average
weekly net debt for the year reflected capital
employed on several large oil and gas contracts 
and on funding our activities in Iraq.
Average net debt for 2006 is expected to reduce to
around £400 million (excluding proceeds from the
prospective sale of SPIE) as our activities in Iraq run
down and we achieve final account settlements on 
the oil and gas fabrication projects mentioned above. 
On 20 January 2005, the company successfully
completed a placing of new ordinary shares, which
resulted in net proceeds of £89 million. These were
used mainly to acquire Paragon, the oil and gas

The group’s cash conversion chart for the ten years
from 1996 is shown on the right. In 2005, there was a
modest improvement in the profit to cash conversion.
The shortfall of £61 million relates to the absorption in
2004 in Iraq (which is cost reimbursable) and several
oil and gas projects. With the reduced activity in Iraq
and following recent positive developments relating 
to the oil and gas projects, debt is expected to fall 
in 2006 and profit and cash should broadly match 
over an extended period.

Group treasury operations 
The group’s treasury department manages funding,
liquidity and the risks arising from interest rate and
foreign currency movements within a framework 
of policies and guidelines approved by the board.
Derivatives and conventional financial instruments 
are used with the aim of preventing an increase in
financial risk above the levels inherent in underlying
commercial activity. The treasury department does
not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking 
of speculative transactions is not permitted.
Funding and liquidity risk 
The group finances its operations from retained
profits and borrowing facilities. Borrowing facilities
comprise long-term debt obligations from the capital
markets and committed bank facilities (together 
“long-term facilities”), supplemented by cash, liquid
instruments and uncommitted bank facilities. The
group’s policy aims to ensure the constant availability
of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced
funding to meet both current and future requirements
consistent with the group’s budget and strategic
plans. Accordingly, a level of long-term facilities
equivalent to around 125 per cent of gross debt is
targeted and any fall below this level is reported to 
the board. Borrowings under the long-term facilities
can be used for general corporate purposes and 
are unsecured. 
AMEC had long-term facilities of £867 million as 
at 31 December 2005 of which £295 million were
undrawn. The average maturity of AMEC’s long-term
facilities amounted to 40 months (2004: 47 months),
compared to an internal target of a minimum of
18 months.
Post year end, the company terminated early a
£330 million Revolving Credit Facility that was due 
to expire in January 2007 and replaced this with 
a 3-year, £255 million Revolving Credit Facility. As a
consequence of the adoption of IFRS, the new facility
agreement includes changes to certain terms and
definitions and increases the ratios in two financial
covenants. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA is increased
from 3 times to 3.5 times and the interest cover ratio is
increased from 2.5 times to 3 times. The revised terms
are currently being updated throughout all material
long-term facilities.
Interest rate risk
The group is exposed to movements in the interest
rates of the currencies in which it has borrowings,
namely Sterling, US dollar, Euro and Canadian dollar
and this risk is controlled by managing the proportion
of fixed to variable rates within limits approved by the
board. Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the
desired mix. During 2005, approximately 60 per cent 
of the group’s average net debt was at a fixed rate for
more than one year through a combination of fixed
rate debt and swaps, achieving a blended average
interest rate of approximately 5.4 per cent. With
average net debt of around £420 million, a one per
cent change in variable interest rates would have 
an impact of around £1.7 million on reported profit.

continued AMEC plc annual report 2005 55
Foreign exchange risk 
The group publishes its consolidated financial
statements in Sterling and conducts business in 
a range of foreign currencies, including Euro and
US dollar or currencies linked to the US dollar . As a
result, the group is exposed to foreign exchange risks, 
which will affect transaction costs and the translation
of the results and the value of underlying assets 
of its foreign subsidiaries. 
Transaction exposures 
A significant proportion of the group’s trading income
is denominated in the local currency of the business
operations and therefore provides a natural match
with the currency of its cost base. Where commercial
contracts are undertaken, which result in costs or
income in non local currency above a de minimis
level, the group seeks to mitigate the foreign
exchange risk through the use of forward currency
arrangements, which may include the purchase 
of currency options.
Translation exposures 
A significant part of the group’s earnings are
denominated in Euro. In 2005 AMEC hedged around
50 per cent of profits against a fall in the Euro. Such
hedging has not been undertaken for 2006, given the
intended disposal of AMEC SPIE. 
In addition, the group has various assets denominated
in foreign currencies, principally US dollars, Canadian
dollars, and Euro. Consistent with the group’s policy, 
a proportion of these assets, including unamortised
goodwill, have been hedged by using foreign 
exchange swaps and foreign currency borrowings. 
At 31 December 2005, these net investment hedges
totalled £293 million covering approximately 60 per
cent of overseas assets.
For 2005, AMEC introduced additional processes to
determine, monitor and document the effectiveness 
of all hedging in the context of the underlying
exposure. The group expects its significant hedging
transactions to be effective and consequently does 
not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the income
statement to be material.
Counterparty risk management 
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise 
to credit risk in the event that counterparties fail 
to perform under the contract. The group’s treasury
department regularly monitors the credit ratings 
of its counterparties and controls the amount of credit
risk by adhering to limits approved by the board. 
As a consequence of these controls the probability of
material loss is considered to be at an acceptable level.  Report of the directors
The directors have pleasure in presenting the annual report and
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Business review
Information on the businesses of AMEC, their development during
the year and on the future outlook is contained on pages 1 to 55.
An analysis of AMEC’s activities is given in note 2 on pages 75 and 76.
The profit on ordinary activities after taxation, which amounted to
£3.7 million (2004: £51.7 million), is shown in the consolidated
income statement on page 67. These are the group’s first accounts
prepared under adopted IFRS and IFRS 1, “First time adoption of
International Reporting Standards”, has been applied.
The directors have proposed a final ordinary dividend in respect of
the year ended 31 December 2005 of 7.5 pence per share. This has
not been included within creditors as it was not approved before 
the year end. This final dividend will be payable on 3 July 2006 to
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 12 May 2006.
Dividends paid during the year comprise a final dividend of 7.2 pence
per share in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004, together
with an interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December
2005 of 4.0 pence per share.
During the year AMEC successfully completed two major strategic
acquisitions in its oil and gas and nuclear businesses. In January
2005, AMEC acquired Paragon Engineering Services Inc, a US oil 
and gas engineering services business, for £22 million. This provides
AMEC with a major presence in Houston, the home of many of the
world’s major oil and gas companies.
In July 2005, AMEC acquired NNC Holdings Ltd, the UK’s leading
private sector nuclear services business, for £40 million. This
acquisition strengthens AMEC’s position in supporting the operations,
maintenance and decommissioning of civil nuclear infrastructure in
the UK and Canada and will allow the exploitation of new business
opportunities in other countries.
Share capital
The authorised and issued share capital of the company as at 
31 December 2005 and movements during the year are set out 
in note 23 on page 91.
Authority was granted to the directors at the 2002 annual general
meeting to allot up to £49,790,640 of ordinary share capital, of which
up to £7,204,249 could be allotted for cash other than by way of 
a rights issue. This authority extends until 8 May 2007.
The directors have no present intention of issuing any shares other
than in respect of the exercise of share options. No issue will be
made which will effectively alter the control of the company without
the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Resolution 10 will be proposed at the annual general meeting 
to grant authority to the directors to make market purchases 
of up to 10 per cent of the company’s shares within prescribed 
limits. No such purchases were made in 2005 or up to the date 
of this report pursuant to the authority granted at last year’s annual
general meeting.
The directors will only exercise such authority to purchase shares 
if circumstances arise in which they consider purchases would 
be of benefit to the company. No purchase would be made unless 
the directors are of the view that it would result in an increase 
in earnings per share. The directors will also take into account the
company’s cash resources, the effect on gearing and other possible
investment opportunities before exercising this authority.

directors’ remuneration report on pages 61 to 66, no director as at
31 December 2005 had any other interests, beneficial or otherwise,
in the share capital of the company or any of its subsidiaries. There
were no changes in the directors’ interests in the share capital 
of the company between 31 December 2005 and 15 March 2006.
No director was materially interested in any contract of significance
to AMEC’s businesses.
As at the date of this report, individual indemnities have been
provided to the directors, under which the company has agreed to
indemnify the directors to the extent permitted by law in respect of
all liabilities to third parties arising out of, or in connection with, the
execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities as directors of
the company, any of its associated companies or any other company
that the director serves as a director at the request of the company.
These indemnities are Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provisions as
defined in Section 309A-B of the Companies Act 1985 and copies are
available for inspection at the registered office of the company during
business hours on any weekday (except public holidays).
Employees
In 2005, AMEC employed on average 44,710 people worldwide. 
Details are given in note 6 on page 78.
The development of employees, to ensure that AMEC has the
necessary skills and behaviours to deliver its strategic business
objectives and to provide for management succession, is given high
priority. In addition, recognising the importance for the future of
bringing young people into the group, all businesses have well
established programmes for recruiting and developing graduates
and other trainees.
Respect for cultural diversity and equal opportunities are included
among AMEC’s Guiding Principles which are incorporated into
management policies and processes worldwide. AMEC’s policy is to
recruit from the widest labour market, determining the careers of all
employees solely on merit and making judgements about employees
free from the effects of bias and prejudice.
It is AMEC’s policy to consider for employment suitably qualified
disabled people and to assist them in overcoming handicaps at work.
AMEC recognises that special arrangements are necessary, in view
of the nature of its main activities, to ensure that disabled employees
are properly trained for the tasks they perform. AMEC endeavours 
to retrain any employee who develops a disability during employment,
wherever practicable.
Internal communication is a priority for AMEC, as employees carry
forward AMEC’s knowledge, brand and reputation. AMEC provides
numerous direct or electronic opportunities for employees to raise
issues and discuss matters of concern with management.
Employees share knowledge and are kept informed of developments
within AMEC through various means, including its intranet AMECnet,
internal publications, best practice groups, news bulletins and
announcements. A global conference of senior managers is held
each year to discuss developing issues.
The company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings related
share option scheme open to all eligible UK employees. Shareholders’
approval was given at the 2002 annual general meeting to make the
scheme available to overseas employees and the first launch of the
scheme took place in North America and certain European countries
during 2005, in addition to the UK.
Annual general meeting
Resolution 11 will be proposed at the annual general meeting to
amend the memorandum and articles of association of the company
which relate to the indemnity provided to the directors of the company
and to increase the aggregate annual amount which may be paid to
the directors by way of ordinary remuneration.
Resolution 12 will be proposed at the annual general meeting 
to further amend the articles of association which relate to the
company’s borrowing powers.
Further explanatory notes to the above two resolutions and 
the proposed amendments to the memorandum and articles can 
be found in the circular which accompanies this annual report 
and accounts.
The annual general meeting will be held on 17 May 2006.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 57 Corporate governance
The board is responsible to shareholders for the management 
of the company and for the protection of its assets. As such, it is
ultimately responsible for implementing AMEC’s systems of internal
control and for reviewing their effectiveness. These systems are
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and consequently can provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material mis-
statement or loss. In 2005 changes were made to the management
of the UK Construction business following both internal and external
reviews which indicated that certain established control processes
were not being followed.
Combined Code compliance
AMEC complied with the Combined Code (July 2003 revision)
throughout 2005 except as follows:
The revised code requires there to be a “balance of executive and
non-executive directors (and in particular independent non-executive
directors) such that no individual or small group of individuals 
can dominate the board’s decision taking”. There was an imbalance
of executive and non-executive directors on the board, with five
executives and four non-executives, from 1 January 2005 until 
10 February 2005 when two further independent non-executive
directors were appointed to the board. The board does not consider
that this imbalance impaired its effectiveness in any way. One of the
executive directors resigned from the board in April 2005.
With respect to acquisitions made during the year, due diligence
work was performed prior to acquisition and subsequently the
companies have been adopting AMEC’s key policies and procedures
outlined in the AMEC Management and Policy Framework. Internal
controls are reviewed by management and by internal audit as part
of the normal audit process.
The company has interests in a number of joint ventures, associates
and joint arrangements. Controls within these entities may not be
reviewed as part of AMEC’s formal corporate governance process
because of the joint management responsibilities but are reviewed
as part of the normal internal audit process.
Management and Policy Framework
AMEC’s businesses are managed on a decentralised basis. Whilst
the board has retained reserve powers, the day-to-day management
has been passed to the business leaders within defined authority
limits. The management philosophy is to empower the business
leaders to take the actions necessary to deliver the company’s
operational business objectives within the AMEC Management 
and Policy Framework, which establishes the standards AMEC
employees and contracting staff are expected to meet.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
Mr J M Green-Armytage, chairman, wrote to all major shareholders
in April 2005 informing them that he and the senior independent
director, Ms E P Airey, were available for meetings or telephone 
calls with them if required. He also advised that Messrs Byrom and
Faithfull, as new independent non-executive directors, would also 
be available for an introductory meeting with them. The chairman
attends preliminary and interim results presentations. Ms Airey 
is available to attend, if requested, one-on-one meetings with 
major shareholders. The chairman had a number of such meetings
with three major shareholders during 2005. No meetings were
requested with Ms Airey or Messrs Byrom and Faithfull.
An in-depth annual perception study of investors’ views, prepared 
by an independent third party, is presented to all board members,
who also receive unexpurgated feedback reports following shareholder
meetings or events together with all material brokers’ research
notes on the company.
The board
For the majority of 2005, the board comprised the non-executive
chairman, four executive directors and six independent non-executive
directors. Mr P J Byrom and Mr T W Faithfull were appointed to the
board in February 2005 as independent non-executive directors and
Mr C A Riva resigned as an executive director in April 2005.
The company does not combine the role of chairman and chief
executive. The chairman is responsible for the running of the board,
with the chief executive being responsible for running the group 
and implementing board strategy and policy. This ensures a clear
division of responsibilities at the head of the company, so that 
no individual has unfettered powers of decision. The independent 
non-executive directors review the relationship between the chairman
and chief executive each year to ensure that the relationship is
working effectively.
The non-executive directors are all considered to be independent 
by the board. They are not employed by the company in any capacity,
nor have they been in the past. Ms E P Airey has acted as the board’s
senior independent director since 21 January 2004. 
The company secretary is responsible for ensuring that board
procedures are followed and all directors have access to his advice
and services.
The board has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval,
covering areas such as company strategy, the appointment 
of key executives, approval of accounts, approval of the business
plan, budget and financial policies, review of operating results, 
risk management strategy, ensuring the effectiveness of governance
practices, succession planning and significant capital expenditure.
The board is supplied in a timely manner with information which
enables it to discharge its duties.
An external review of the effectiveness of the board and its
committees was carried out during the year by Spencer Stuart by
way of interviews with individual directors. Findings were considered
by the board as part of its review of both collective and individual
board member performance. No material changes were identified 
as being necessary as a result of this exercise. The independent 
non-executive directors also met privately both with and without 
the chairman present and also with both the chairman and chief
executive together to consider management performance and
succession issues. A formal process exists for the directors to take
independent professional advice and receive appropriate training 
in the course of their duties, at the company’s expense, organised 
by the company secretary.
58 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Report of the directors
continued Board committees
Under AMEC’s Management and Policy Framework, the board has
formally delegated specific responsibilities to various committees, 
all of which have written terms of reference. 
The remit of each committee is set out below. The quorum is
generally three directors. Full details of the constitution and remit 
of the audit, nominations and remuneration committees can be
found under “corporate governance” on www.amec.com.
The committees chaired by non-executive directors are as follows:
Audit committee – Reviews the integrity, including the material
financial reporting judgements, of the company’s accounts, including
the annual and interim results, related report and accounts and
Stock Exchange announcements and any other formal announcements
in connection with the company’s financial performance, and
recommends their approval to the board.
It also reviews the company’s internal financial controls and, 
in conjunction with the risk review committee, the internal control 
and risk management systems. 
The committee has unrestricted access to company documents 
and meets with the internal and external auditors, and any other
member of staff, without the executive directors being present, 
as required. The head of internal audit formally reports to the
committee chairman.
It reviews the head of internal audit’s regular reports and, during
2005, commissioned an independent review of the internal audit
function by PricewaterhouseCoopers. No material changes were
identified as being necessary as a result of this exercise.
The committee considers the appointment, re-appointment, removal,
remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor and
makes recommendations to the board. It discusses the scope and
planning of the external audit and reviews the outcome of the
external audit and any formal communications from the external
auditors, including internal control reports.
The committee also formally reviews and monitors the external
auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the
audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional 
and regulatory requirements and makes recommendations 
to the board. During 2005 a review, co-ordinated on behalf of the
committee by the head of internal audit, was carried out. The audit
committee has also monitored the implementation of the policy on
the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services,
which was reconfirmed in 2005. This policy follows the guidelines 
set out by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales (“ICAEW”) and clearly defines what work can and cannot be
performed by any group company’s statutory auditor . It also sets 
out the necessary approval process for those non-audit services 
that are acceptable.
All non-statutory audit or non-compliance tax services provided 
by the auditor are reported to the audit committee. During 2005, 
the fees paid to the company’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc and its
associates, for non-audit work were £1.3 million (2004: £0.8 million),
which comprised £0.7 million primarily relating to taxation and 
£0.6 million for other work (2004: £0.6 million and £0.2 million).
In addition to the above amounts, fees of £0.2 million (2004: 
£0.2 million) were paid to KPMG Audit Plc in connection with 
due diligence undertaken on acquisitions.
Nominations committee – Makes recommendations to the board
concerning the appointment or termination of a director or the
company secretary and, in the case of a non-executive director 
and the chairman, the extension of an existing appointment. 
The committee also regularly reviews board succession planning, 
in conjunction with reports from the chief executive and corporate
human resources director on senior management succession
planning, so as to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills 
is maintained both within AMEC and on the board.
Remuneration committee – Sets, and reviews as necessary, 
the overall contractual and remuneration framework for the chairman,
the executive directors and the company secretary, including pension
rights and annual bonus incentives. 
It considers and determines such other matters relating to the
engagement of the chief executive and other executive directors
(including matters relating to the enforcement of their service
contracts and payments on termination) as the chairman and 
chief executive respectively refer to the committee.
It agrees the terms to be offered to a proposed new chairman 
or executive director .
It reviews the salaries of executive directors annually and the
chairman biennially, or more frequently as is deemed necessary 
by the committee chairman. It agrees the performance targets 
of executive directors and the levels of bonus to be paid to them
under the annual bonus incentive scheme.
It determines and agrees with the chief executive the remuneration
policy and structure, including annual bonus, for corporate functional
executives and operational executives immediately below board level.
It approves performance targets, participation and level of awards 
for any executive share-based incentive scheme.
The following table is a record of the directors’ attendance at board
and principal board committee meetings during the year ended 
31 December 2005.

permission to relevant employees to deal in AMEC plc shares.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 59 The committees chaired by executive directors are as follows:
Banking committee – Reviews and approves facilities for borrowing,
guarantees, bonds, indemnities and employee bridging loans and
also interest rate and foreign exchange hedging strategies within
authority limits set by the board.
Corporate transactions committee – Considers acquisitions and
disposals of businesses and provides guidelines in respect of such
transactions within authority limits set by the board.
Pensions and retirement benefits committee – Reviews proposals
relating to new arrangements, amendments, discontinuance, funding
or any other matters relating to pension and retirement benefits.
Risk review committee – Approves the AMEC plc risk register, the
AMEC plc risk transfer policy and proposals to enter into contractual
commitments that fall outside the delegated authority limits of the
executive directors.
Risk management processes
The board, through the committees described above and at its regular
meetings, has a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing significant risks faced by the company, including strategy,
major projects to be undertaken, significant acquisitions and
disposals, as well as entry to and exit from different markets. Where
appropriate, business decisions are reached following a structured
and documented review of potential opportunities and threats, taking
steps designed to manage or mitigate any residual risk exposure.
AMEC uses a seven-step Total Risk Management process and has
incorporated it into the AMEC Management and Policy Framework. 
The process involves the identification of risks at the gross and net
level by each business and each corporate function. The risks are
recorded in separate risk registers for each business unit and each
function to enable the net positions to be pro-actively managed. The
highest risks based on probability and impact are then consolidated
into an overall risk register for AMEC plc, which is reviewed in detail
by the board on an ongoing basis. The risk management process
accommodates mergers, acquisitions and disposals as well as entry
to and exit from different markets.
Risk management within AMEC is coordinated via the risk
management forum, which meets at least twice yearly. The forum
consists of risk managers/sponsors for the businesses and heads 
of corporate functions and has the remit to report to the risk 
review committee of the board at least annually. It also reviews
progress made in embedding risk management throughout the
company, dissemination of best practice and communication 
of lessons learned.
The risk management and internal control processes are
complemented by an annual control risk self-assessment exercise
carried out by the principal businesses. This covers major risks,
particularly safety, health and environment, legal, commercial and
contractual, financial, information technology and human resources.
The results are reviewed by the board, through both the audit
committee and the executive directors, and as part of the ongoing
internal audit process.
The risk management processes were in place for the whole 
of 2005, and up to the date of approval of the accounts, and 
satisfy the requirements of the Turnbull guidance.
Going concern
The directors, having made enquiries, consider that the company 
and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and, therefore, it is appropriate
to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Creditor payment policy
Businesses are responsible for agreeing terms and conditions under
which transactions with their suppliers are conducted. It is group
policy that payments to suppliers are generally made in accordance
with these terms and conditions, provided that the supplier complies
with all of its obligations in this regard. 
The company had 30 days’ purchases outstanding as at 31 December
2005 based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during
the year .
Donations
Donations to United Kingdom charities amounted to £108,000 for the 
year ended 31 December 2005.
Auditors
A resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting for 
the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the company.
By order of the board

60 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Report of the directors
continued This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive
directors and related matters, including long-term incentive awards.
Remuneration committee membership and advisers
During the year, the members of the remuneration committee, 
any three of whom may form a quorum, comprised Mr J A Dallas
(chairman), Ms E P Airey, Ms M O Hesse, Mr J-P Jacamon and,
following their appointments as directors, Mr P J Byrom and 
Mr T W Faithfull. In accordance with the Combined Code regulations,
the chairman of the board, Mr J M Green-Armytage, attends
meetings by invitation but is not a member of the remuneration
committee. The committee’s terms of reference are available on 
the company’s website and on request from the company secretary.
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee takes
account of recommendations from the chairman in respect of the
chief executive and from the chief executive in respect of other
executives and is advised by the group human resources director .
During 2005, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (“New Bridge Street”)
continued to provide standing advice to the committee in connection
with its responsibilities. New Bridge Street does not carry out material
additional work for the company. The terms of engagement between
the company and New Bridge Street are available from the company
secretary. Monks Partnership, in relation to the UK, and Towers
Perrin, particularly in relation to France and the US, provided market
remuneration and benefits reports covering various levels of
management which, in respect of the executive directors, were
reviewed by New Bridge Street.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the executive
directors and other senior executives, is to offer remuneration
packages that are competitive in the markets in which the executives
are based and which:
allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high 
calibre; and
incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term
performance and increase the medium and long-term value 
of AMEC for its shareholders and encourage executives to build 
and retain a significant shareholding in AMEC.
Remuneration packages comprise:
base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary
practices of a relevant group of support services, engineering and
construction comparator companies and other companies regarded
as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, revenue, employee
numbers, market capitalisation and/or geographic coverage;
annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching
business and individual performance targets and offer the opportunity
to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if these targets are
achieved; and
medium and long-term incentives which align the interests 
of shareholders and senior executives by offering the latter the
opportunity to accumulate significant capital over a period but 
only if stretching shareholder value targets are met.
More than half of the overall remuneration package is therefore
performance related.
Executive directors’ base salaries and annual bonuses
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually,
having regard to personal performance, company performance,
competitive market practice as determined by external research 
and pay levels more broadly within the company. The following
salaries have been approved from 1 January 2006, representing 
an increase of 5 per cent:
Sir Peter Mason £640,500
J D Early £291,375
J A Monville (£393,900 equivalent) €573,300
S J Siddall £378,000
All executive directors participate in the AMEC executive annual
bonus plan which generates bonus payments calculated by reference
to each of the following:
the profit achievement of the group, with a target level of bonus
payable for achieving budget and the maximum pay-out requiring
achievement of a more stretching target;
the achievement of other specific business targets, including 
cash flow and business unit profit; and
individual performance objectives (for example, in relation to
safety, strategy, business development and organisational issues).
A separate amount of bonus attaches to each of these components.
The proportions vary between individuals depending on their specific
executive roles. In addition, 10 per cent may be allocated to allow
recognition of how participants have responded to changing
circumstances during the year which cannot necessarily be addressed
by pre-defined targets. The maximum potential annual bonus is 80
per cent of base salary. In every case the profit and other business
target components represent more than half of the potential total.
For Mr J A Monville, in the event that the sale of AMEC SPIE is
completed during 2006, and recognising his key role in achieving 
a successful transaction, it is intended to replace the normal annual
bonus with a special incentive linked to the sale proceeds on a sliding
scale above a minimum threshold and subject to the achievement 
in the business being divested of at least budgeted profit in the period
prior to the sale. While there will be no absolute maximum, the
structure of this incentive is designed to pay 2 x normal maximum
annual bonus at a plausible top-end proceeds level. A number 
of other senior AMEC SPIE executives are also included in this
arrangement but with lower potential payments.
No elements of remuneration other than base salary are pensionable
other than for Mr Monville, who is 61, and whose base salary and
ordinary annual bonus, up to a maximum of 60 per cent of base
salary, are pensionable. Mr Monville’s pension arrangements are
covered on page 66 of this report. These arrangements are common
for senior executives in France and are a contractual obligation that
AMEC inherited with the acquisition of SPIE S.A.
In the senior management group, no executive has a base salary 
or total remuneration higher than any executive director .
AMEC plc annual report 2005 61
Directors’ remuneration
report Executive directors’ long-term incentives
AMEC’s principal long-term incentive arrangement is the
Performance Share Plan 2002. Following approval by shareholders 
at the annual general meeting in May 2005, AMEC’s policy is to make
annual awards to executive directors, and to a small number of other
senior executives just below board level, of restricted shares with 
a value at the time of award of up to 175 per cent of base salary. 
In addition, participants are offered a further award, up to a maximum
of 25 per cent of base salary, of five restricted shares for every three
purchased from their previous year’s post-tax bonus and held on
their behalf as investment shares for the full three year performance
period. Awards are also made to a wider group of executives, with
lower levels of face value to reflect seniority and contribution. Awards
are not normally made to those within one year of retirement and,
where the individual is within three years of retirement, the size of
award has regard to the executive’s ability to contribute to the
achievement of the performance conditions.
These restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined performance
conditions are met. For full vesting, the requirement is for AMEC 
to be ranked in the top quartile of total shareholder return, measured
over a three year period, of a comparator group. This currently
comprises the companies (approximately 40 in number) that, at 
the time of grant of each award, are in the FTSE All Share Business
Support, Environmental Control, Other Construction and Oil Services
sub-sectors, and whose market capitalisations lie between 
£250 million and £3,000 million (or such other range spanning that 
of AMEC as may be agreed from time to time). If AMEC’s performance
is at the median, 25 per cent of the award will vest. 100 per cent 
of the award will vest at upper quartile. Between the median and 
the upper quartile, the award will vest on a straight-line basis. 
No awards will vest if AMEC’s performance is below median. As a
further threshold condition, to ensure that the company’s underlying
performance is properly reflected, no awards will vest if AMEC’s
earnings per share have grown by less than the rate of inflation 
plus six percentage points over the three year period.
These performance conditions are intended to focus executives’
attention on the return that AMEC is delivering to its shareholders
over the medium term relative to broadly comparable alternative
companies in which shareholders could have invested. Lists of the
comparator companies for the awards that lapsed during the year
and those awards currently subsisting can be obtained on request
from the company secretary.
For 2005, awards were made in two tranches – in April, under 
the previous limits, and in September to reflect the revised limits
approved by shareholders. For subsequent years it is envisaged 
that awards will normally be made in a single tranche in April.
The present economic value of performance share awards made 
in 2005 has been assessed by Watson Wyatt LLP as 40 per cent 
of face value.
The company has a second scheme in place – the Executive Share
Option Scheme 2002. AMEC’s policy is now only to grant share
options under this scheme selectively and in exceptional
circumstances such as recruitment. No awards were made 
under this scheme during 2005.
During the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards,
the remuneration committee will aim to ensure that performance
measurement for remuneration purposes will be consistent year on year .
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all employee
share plans which provide options, without performance conditions,
related to savings contracts with an aggregate limit of £250 savings
per month.
Executive directors’ pension entitlements and benefits
The executive directors, except for Mr J A Monville and, with effect
from 31 October 2005, Mr J D Early, are members of the AMEC Staff
Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits provided through the
AMEC Executive Pension Scheme. The schemes are both approved
defined benefit schemes and also provide for life assurance cover
and dependants’ pensions. These executive directors have a normal
retirement age of 60 and accrue pension rights which are linked 
to the length of pensionable service and to final pensionable salary.
The benefits of Sir Peter Mason and Mr S J Siddall are restricted 
to take account of the statutory earnings cap and they receive a
taxable supplement to their salaries in relation to earnings above 
the cap. There are no funded or unfunded unapproved arrangements
in force for executive directors. These arrangements also applied 
to Mr C A Riva. 
As referred to above, Mr J D Early ceased to be an active member of
the AMEC Staff and Executive pension schemes on 31 October 2005
and consequently is not accruing further benefits under either scheme.
Since 1 November 2005, he has been paid a salary supplement in
lieu of further pension accrual. 
A review of policy on UK executive pensions has been undertaken 
in the light of the new tax regime that comes into force in April 2006.
All decisions on this matter were delegated by the board to the
remuneration committee to avoid executive directors’ conflicts 
of interest. The following are the key features, which will apply 
from April 2006:
There will be a new scheme-specific pensionable earnings cap
applicable to all members, set initially at £112,500 p.a. The scheme
specific cap of £112,500 is marginally higher than the pensions cap
applicable under current legislation (the “Current Cap”). The Current
Cap is normally increased annually in line with price inflation and
would therefore have been expected to rise from the current figure 
of £105,600 to approximately £109,000 in 2006. This difference will
result in some 25 capped members, including Sir Peter Mason 
and Mr S J Siddall, receiving a small increase to the value of their
pension accrued to date.
The scheme design is aimed at achieving a benefit equivalent 
to the statutory Life Time Allowance over 20 years service for those
executives who have a 1/30ths accrual rate, which would include 
all participating executive directors, and 30 years for those with 
a 1/45ths accrual rate.
Non-bonusable salary supplements of 20 per cent in respect 
of basic salary in excess of the scheme-specific cap will be paid 
to all participating executive directors and may be paid selectively 
to other senior executives.
Participants will be able to opt-out of further pension accrual,
particularly if this would provide benefits in excess of the Life Time
Allowance, in which case they will receive a non-bonusable salary
supplement of 20 per cent of basic salary up to the scheme-specific
cap in lieu of further pension accrual. Where the supplement referred
to above in respect of the earnings cap was also being paid, this
would continue in addition.
62 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Directors’ remuneration report
continued If individuals do accrue benefits in excess of the Life Time
Allowance, the payment of the additional tax liability will be 
the responsibility of the individual and not AMEC.
The company is paying for selected senior executives whose benefits
may exceed the Life Time Allowance, including Sir Peter Mason 
and Mr S J Siddall, to receive independent financial advice on the
implications of the new pensions tax regime, in particular whether
they should opt for primary and/or enhanced protection. This will 
be disclosed as a benefit in kind. 
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up scheme for senior
executives, which provides additional pension of up to 20 per cent 
of pensionable salary on top of the French compulsory social 
security and industry arrangements, subject to an aggregate limit 
of 50 per cent of pensionable pay at retirement. Due to French tax
rules, this additional pension does not vest until the point of retirement.
Mr Monville has a normal retirement age of 65. 
Employment related benefits, principally the provision of a company
car or car allowance, life assurance and private medical expenses
insurance, are also provided to executive directors.
Executive directors’ employment contracts
AMEC’s policy is that on appointment, executive directors will
normally be employed with a notice period of one year . In the event 
of employment being terminated with less notice than this, damages
will be determined at the time taking account of the circumstances
leading up to the termination and the individual’s duty to mitigate 
his loss. 
Mr C A Riva who was appointed in August 2003 had a contract 
on this basis. This was terminated by the company from 31 July 2005,
following notice given on 11 April 2005.
Sir Peter Mason and Mr S J Siddall have employment contracts 
with notice periods of one year but with provision that if the company
terminates employment (other than for gross misconduct), rather
than receiving notice, the individual will be entitled to one year’s
remuneration (less tax) as liquidated damages in full and final
settlement. For this purpose and, as a reasonable estimate of loss,
remuneration is defined as 1.75 times basic annual salary to take
account of salary, bonus potential, pension arrangements, the value
of benefits and compensation for loss of office. This recognises that
both of these individuals previously had notice periods of two years
which were reduced by agreement to one year from 1 January 2003
without compensation, following the change in policy on notice periods.
Mr J D Early had a similar arrangement up to his normal retirement
age on 8 November 2005, at which stage his employment contract
was amended by agreement to provide for three months’ notice 
on either side.
Mr J A Monville is employed by SPIE S.A. as chairman. As a governing
executive (mandataire social) any compensation for loss of office 
is governed by his employment contract and French law. He is
entitled to three months’ notice and a termination indemnity which,
at the end of 2005, would have been the equivalent of 10.5 months’
base salary plus bonus.
Service contracts for executive directors do not provide for extended
notice periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the
remuneration committee’s intention to introduce such provisions.
External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships
without the prior approval of the board. 
Sir Peter Mason is a non-executive director of BAE Systems plc. 
He retains the fee of £63,000 per annum which he receives in relation 
to this appointment.
Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for determining the
remuneration and other terms of employment of the chairman 
of the board. The contract of the chairman, Mr J M Green-Armytage,
contains provision for six months’ written notice of resignation prior
to the expiry date and payment of six months’ fees if the board
withdraw their agreement to his continuing to serve as chairman,
other than for gross misconduct. The chairman’s current fee is £200,000
per annum and he is provided with life assurance cover of four times
the pensions earnings cap. 
Non-executive directors
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by 
the chairman and the executive directors under delegated authority 
from the board. The non-executive directors receive fees for their
services and do not participate in any of the incentive or benefit
schemes of the group. The fee structure was revised with effect 
from 1 January 2005.
The current fee is £40,000 per annum plus a further £5,000 per annum
in respect of chairing committees of the board other than audit,
where the additional fee is £10,000 per annum, and remuneration,
where the additional fee is £7,500 per annum. There is an additional
fee of £5,000 per annum paid to the senior independent director . 
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees for other
duties undertaken on behalf of the company. In 2005, Ms E P Airey
received £10,000 for chairing the trustee boards of the main UK
pension schemes. She resigned from that role on 1 March 2006 
and was replaced by an independent trustee chairman. Ms M O Hesse
received US$10,000 for chairing the North America advisory board. 
The board’s policy is that non-executive director appointments 
are normally for three consecutive three year terms, subject 
to review after the end of each term. The non-executive directors 
as at 31 December 2005 have fixed term contracts which run until
the dates set out below:
Date of contract Service review date
E P Airey 26 May 1999 25 May 2008
J A Dallas 28 October 1999 27 October 2008

P J Byrom 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
T W Faithfull 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by 
the individual at any time and there are no specific provisions for
compensation in the event of early termination by the company.
In accordance with the articles of association of AMEC, all directors
are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years.

Notes
(i) Sir Peter Mason, Mr Siddall and Mr Riva received a taxable supplement of 20 per cent of salary above the pension earnings cap. 
Mr Early has received a supplement of 20 per cent of total salary since 1 November 2005 in lieu of further pension accrual.
(ii) The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year against a maximum potential of
80 per cent: Sir Peter Mason 23.0 per cent, Mr Early 35.4 per cent, Mr Monville 41.6 per cent and Mr Siddall 30.0 per cent. No bonus 
has been paid this year in respect of AMEC plc profit performance. The awards made reflect varying achievement against other specific
business targets and personal objectives. 
(iii) The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling
expenses and private medical expenses insurance. Unemployment insurance is also made available to Mr Monville in accordance with
French practice. During 2004, Mr Riva received relocation expenses of £255,000 relating to when he originally joined AMEC. None of these
benefits are pensionable. 
(iv) Mr Monville’s salary comprised €503,000 paid by SPIE S.A. and £30,000 paid by AMEC plc.
(v) Mr Riva received a compensation payment of £571,000 under the terms of a compromise agreement, reached through negotiations with 
Mr Riva and his legal advisers, in lieu of the balance of his notice and as compensation for loss of office, with a reduction to take account 
of mitigation. In addition, all Mr Riva’s share option and performance share awards lapsed on leaving.

Notes
The additional awards made in September 2005 were to give effect to the policy approved by the 2005 annual general meeting to increase
performance share awards and to cease annual option awards. The timing of the awards was delayed due to close period restrictions.
For the performance share awards made in April 2002, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, 
the awards lapsed in April 2005.
The terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan have not been varied during the year other than in the composition of the
comparator group for 2005 awards compared to those for previous years’ awards. This change reflects the changed FTSE sector listing 
of the company’s shares from Construction and Building Materials to Support Services. 
The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2005 was 343.50 pence (2004: 297.75 pence).
The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 300.00 pence to 372.00 pence.
The register of directors’ interests, which is open to inspection at the company’s registered office, contains full details of directors’
shareholdings, share options and awards under the Performance Share Plan.
Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2005 the approximate latent value before appropriate 
taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, £2,670,000; Mr Early, £942,000; Mr Siddall, £1,425,000; 
and Mr Monville, £1,377,000. These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which 
in practice may not transpire.

(ii) Gain on exercise £90,250 (2004: £1,659).
(iii) All awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 are subject to performance conditions which require a minimum level 
of earnings per share growth for any vesting and a higher level of growth for full vesting. The minimum performance condition which
applies to the awards made in 2002 was not met at the first time of testing. These awards are subject to two further retests in 2006 
and 2007. Executive Share Option Scheme awards made from 2004 onwards are not subject to retest.
(iv) Remaining awards made under the former Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and not exercised during the year were capable 
of being exercised at 31 December 2005. If these options had been exercised on that date the approximate gain before appropriate 
taxes for Sir Peter Mason would have been £901,000.
(v) Had the remainder of the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full as at 31 December 2005, the approximate latent gain

(i) Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year .
(ii) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
(iii) The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption
service terminated at the year end. It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the director’s contribution. Note that 
Mr Riva’s pensionable service ended on 31 July 2005 and Mr Early’s pensionable service ended on 31 October 2005.
(iv) The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company
and directors, such as stockmarket movements. It is calculated after deducting the director’s contribution. 
(v) Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up pension scheme for senior executives. Although the scheme, arranged through an insurance
company, is a defined benefit scheme, it is not possible to disclose his pension benefits in the above format. A pension is payable by SPIE only 
in the event of Mr Monville reaching his normal retirement age of 65 or, following the attainment of age 60, by agreement with AMEC. No pension
is due or payable in other circumstances and Mr Monville currently has no accrued right to a pension payment. His pension at the normal
retirement age, or as agreed by AMEC, would be based on the average of his last three years’ base salary and bonus, up to a maximum of 
20 per cent of this figure. As at 31 December 2005, this would equate to £110,000 (€160,000 (2004: £106,000 (€149,000)) per annum. It is not
possible to attribute a value to the accrued funds as these are not separately identified by the insurance company.

Consolidated cash flow statement
For the year ended 31 December 2005 AMEC plc annual report 2005 71
1 Significant accounting policies
AMEC plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
Statement of compliance
The group accounts include the accounts of AMEC plc (“AMEC”) and all of its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year, and the group’s
share of the profit after interest and tax, and net assets of joint ventures and associates, based on the equity method of accounting.
In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the EU as at 31 December 2005 (“adopted IFRS”), International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting
under IFRS. The company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(“UK GAAP”); these are presented on pages 104 to 111.
These are the group’s first accounts prepared under adopted IFRS and, IFRS 1 “First time adoption of International Reporting Standards” , 
has been applied. Details of how the group’s results and financial position are affected by the change to adopted IFRS are set out in note 31.
IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosure” was available for early application but has not been applied by the group in their consolidated
accounts. The application of IFRS 7 in 2005 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement as the standard is concerned 
only with disclosure. The group plans to adopt it in 2007.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated
accounts and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 for the purposes of the transition to adopted IFRS.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that 
derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects
both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of
judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 “Employee benefits” and for long-term
contracts under IAS 11 “Construction contracts”.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements
are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity that
underpin their valuations.
A significant amount of the group’s activities are undertaken via long-term contracts. These contracts are accounted for in accordance 
with IAS 11 which requires estimates to be made for contract costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and revenues on the latest available information, which includes detailed contract
valuations. In many cases the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual obligations which span more than one reporting
period. Contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events and often need to be
revised as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved. The estimates are updated regularly and significant changes are highlighted through
established internal review procedures. The impact of the changes in accounting estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
Accounting for PPP contracts
In determining the appropriate accounting policy for AMEC’s PPP activities, the directors have considered the current status of the draft IFRIC
interpretations on service concession arrangements. The draft interpretations were issued in 2005 and IFRIC is currently reviewing the
responses it has received. However, the final form of the interpretations and the timetable for their finalisation by IFRIC and adoption by the EU
remains uncertain. In view of this uncertainty, adopted IFRS contains no accounting requirements that specifically apply to service concession
arrangements and the directors consider that it remains appropriate to apply the approach set out in Application Note F of the UK Financial
Reporting Standard 5 “Reporting the substance of transactions” in determining the accounting model to be applied to AMEC’s PPP activities.
This involves applying a “risks and rewards” test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed. 
Once the accounting model has been determined, the assets and liabilities of the service concession arrangements will be accounted for 
in accordance with adopted IFRS. This accounting policy does not differ significantly from that applied under UK GAAP .
Notes to the consolidated accounts 72 AMEC plc annual report 2005
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by AMEC. Control is achieved where AMEC has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
A joint venture entity is an entity over whose activities AMEC has joint control, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated accounts
include the group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis.
An associate is an entity in which AMEC has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Losses of a joint venture or an associate are recognised only to the extent of the group’s interest in the joint venture or associate, unless the group
has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Jointly controlled operations and assets where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for 
by including the attributable share of the assets it controls, liabilities and cash flows it incurs and its share of the income measured according
to the terms of the arrangement.
Bid costs
Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group is appointed as the preferred bidder . Subsequent to appointment as preferred bidder, 
bid costs are capitalised and held on the balance sheet provided the award of the contract is virtually certain and it is expected to generate
sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the bid costs. Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are applied first
against the balance of costs included in the balance sheet, with any additional amounts treated as deferred income and released to profit 
over the period of the contract.
Business combinations and goodwill
The purchase method is used to account for all business combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are
indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been written-off to reserves. Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” 
this goodwill will now remain eliminated against reserves. Goodwill arising on acquisitions made in the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003
was amortised under UK GAAP . This goodwill is carried at the UK GAAP carrying value at the date of transition and is subject to impairment reviews 
as described above.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part
of AMEC’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Construction and other long-term contracts
As soon as the outcome of a construction or other long-term contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised
in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys 
of work performed. When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs
incurred that it is probable will be recovered, and contract costs are expensed as incurred. An expected loss on a contract is recognised
immediately in the income statement.
The gross amounts due from customers under construction and other long-term contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits, 
less provision for recognised losses and progress billings. These amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due from customers are included in trade and other payables.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discount to determine its present
value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on 
AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed 
by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses were recognised in full in equity on transition to adopted IFRS on 1 January 2004. Actuarial gains and
losses that arise subsequent to 1 January 2004 are recognised directly in equity in the year in which they arise.

1 Significant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, AMEC elected not to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 in its financial information for the year ended 
31 December 2004 and as a result, UK GAAP has been applied in accounting for financial instruments in the year ended 31 December 2004. 
In the comparative period, other than as noted below, all financial assets and financial liabilities were carried at cost (amortised as appropriate)
less, in the case of financial assets, provisions for any permanent diminution in value. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts
treated as hedging instruments were not recognised in the income statement. On recognition of the hedged transaction the unrecognised gains
and losses arising on the instrument were recognised, either in the income statement or combined into the carrying value of the associated
asset or liability. Interest differentials arising from the interest rate swaps were recognised by adjusting net interest payable or receivable over
the period of the contract.
On 1 January 2005, AMEC adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39, and applied the following policy in accounting for financial instruments.
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instrument.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet
date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange
contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
All of AMEC’s hedging activities are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly
probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging
reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative
gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gain 
or loss that was recognised directly in equity is reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired 
or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from
equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity discontinues hedge accounting but the hedged forecast
transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above
policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss
recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability 
or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally
carried at cost or amortised cost) and any gains or losses on re-measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement (even 
if those gains would normally be recognised directly in reserves). 
On the discontinuance of hedge accounting, any adjustment made to the carrying amount of the hedged item as a consequence of the fair 
value hedge relationship, is recognised in the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item.
Foreign currencies
Trading results are translated at transaction rates for the year . Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of trading results
and monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward contracts used
to hedge those investments, are taken to a translation reserve. They are recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the disposal or closure 
of a business. The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to adopted IFRS. 74 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Notes to the consolidated accounts

1 Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment
The carrying values of all of the group’s assets other than inventories, balances on construction contracts and deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying
value then the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. For goodwill and assets not yet available for use, the
recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Goodwill was tested for impairment as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, even though no indication of impairment existed.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by the group, which include software, customer relationships, trademarks and order backlogs are stated at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value 
at the acquisition date.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, from the date 
they are available for use.
The estimated lives used range from less than one year to ten years.
Interest
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income 
and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the cost of purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment, until the relevant
assets are brought into operational use. The only material projects where this has occurred are in the group’s investments in joint ventures
which are involved in PPP projects to finance, design and build assets and operate them on behalf of the client.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leases 
Operating lease costs are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost, 
less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life. Reviews are made annually of the 
estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual assets.
The estimated lives used are:
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings The shorter of the lease term or 50 years
Plant and equipment Mainly three to five years
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied 
to external customers. It includes the group’s share of revenue from work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract, as set out in the
accounting policy for construction and other long-term contracts. Revenue from developments activities is recognised on completion of 
a signed sale agreement.
Share-based payments
There is a share option programme which allows AMEC employees to acquire options over shares of AMEC; these option awards are granted 
by AMEC. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value 
of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were
granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where non-vesting 
is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recognised in the accounts and the
amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable
profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. AMEC plc annual report 2005 75

The group’s primary segment reporting format is geographic, as the group’s management and internal reporting are structured geographically.
The analysis of total revenue by geographical market is not materially different from that by geographical origin. There is no revenue from
transactions between geographic segments.
Corporate costs comprise the costs of operating the head office of AMEC and also certain regional overheads. These are not directly related 
to the activities of the segments.
The financing of the group’s activities is undertaken at a head office level and consequently net financing costs cannot be analysed segmentally.
The unallocated net assets principally comprise assets relating to the pension schemes, and liabilities relating to dividends and taxation and
are not directly related to the activities of the segments. 76 AMEC plc annual report 2005

Provision has been made for the costs of withdrawing from certain loss-making construction markets in the UK and US.
The exit from US construction management activities was announced in May 2004 and actions to close this business are well advanced.
However, AMEC continues to be involved in protracted, long standing, litigation in respect of certain contracts. In view of the slow progress 
in resolution of these disputes, and following a review of the costs of exiting this business, a further provision has been raised. 78 AMEC plc annual report 2005

The principal elements of unamortised goodwill relate to two separate cash generating units, one in the Americas (£154.0 million) and one 
in the Rest of Europe (£224.2 million). The recoverable amounts of both income generating units have been based on value in use calculations. 
The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and a pre-tax
discount rate of 12.8 per cent. For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount the cash flows projections beyond the two year
period include no growth.

12 Interest in joint ventures and other investments continued
An analysis of the group’s interests in the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of joint ventures was as follows:
Total Total
2005 2004
£ million £ million
Current assets 591.6 464.1
Long-term assets 274.7 245.6
Current liabilities (158.5) (69.1)

Group share of net assets 85.0 75.6

Share of profits before tax 13.3 10.4
Tax (2.8) (2.4)
Share of post-tax results of joint ventures 10.5 8.0
The joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities to which the group is exposed. AMEC has provided guarantees in respect of
committed bank facilities to certain property joint ventures and there are commitments to invest equity in certain joint venture projects. 
These guarantees and commitments are set out in note 28.
PPP service concessions
Included within the above analysis are joint venture entities of the group which operate a number of UK Government PPP concession contracts.
There is a high degree of certainty on these project cash flows with revenue subject to inflation indexation. In all cases the concession requires
construction of an asset for the public sector client and, with one exception, residual rights remain with the client.
The concessions are in:
Transport, where the concessions operate on a shadow toll arrangement or an availability fee, with an unexpired concession period ranging
between 21 and 31 years. One project reached financial close in the year .
Accommodation, with contracts which are subject to an availability fee with unexpired concession periods ranging between 23 and 37 years.
One of these projects has a break clause exercisable in 22 years’ time and, in another, the residual rights to the asset revert to AMEC rather 
than the client.
Water treatment, where there is one project which is subject to an availability fee with an unexpired concession period of 25 years.
In Korea, the Incheon Bridge project, for which AMEC has a project management role, reached financial close during the year . This is a toll
project in partnership with the Korean Government and the concession term is 30 years.

14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities
The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees. Substantially all UK members are in funded defined
benefit schemes, the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme, the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme and the AMEC Rail Section
of the Railways Pension Scheme. The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes. Certain employees in France 
are members of an unfunded defined benefit scheme.
Defined benefit schemes
The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuations of the three major UK schemes as at 31 December 2004 and 1 April 2005,
and updated by the schemes’ actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2005.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December .
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows:
2005 2004
Per cent Per cent
Rate of discount 4.9 5.3
Rate of inflation 2.8 2.7
Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 3.8
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8 2.8
Expected rate of return on scheme assets:
Equities 7.6 7.5
Bonds 4.4 5.3
Property 6.1 6.5
Other 4.5 4.5
For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy for a male/female currently aged 60 is 23/26 years.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair values of the schemes’ assets by category, and the amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:
2005 2004
£ million £ million
Equity instruments 707.9 620.4
Debt instruments 449.6 422.6
Property 102.9 88.8

temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised 
in respect of these items because it is not probable that profit will be available in the near term against which the group can utilise the 
benefits therefrom.

Details of the group’s financial risk management objectives and policies, together with its policies for hedging are provided in the business 
and financial review on pages 34 to 55.
Designated hedging arrangements are described below. As explained in note 1, AMEC elected not to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 in its restated
financial information for the year ended 31 December 2004. Consequently, the fair values of derivative financial instruments as at 31 December
2004 as set out in note 31 are not recognised in the 2004 balance sheet.
Hedging of interest rate risk
The group uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its floating rate debt to fixed and vice versa. The notional contract amount, carrying
amount and fair values of swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges as at 31 December 2005 are as follows:
2005 2005

£ million £ million
Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges:
Non-current liabilities 226.0 (10.2)
Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:
Non-current liabilities 17.5 (1.9)
The swaps designated as cash flow hedges mature over the next six years following the maturity of the related loans and have fixed swap rates
ranging from 3.6 per cent to 5.4 per cent.
Hedging of foreign currency risk – forecast transactions
The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs in non-local currency.
Forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps are used for this purpose and designated as cash flow hedges. The notional contract
amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps and forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges as at 31 December 2005 are as follows:
2005 2005

The forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges mature predominantly over the next twelve months,
in line with the hedged cash flows.
Certain forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are
recognised through the income statement. The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these swaps and forward
contracts as at 31 December 2005 are as follows:

Current assets 46.6 0.4
Current liabilities 48.0 (1.3)

Hedging of foreign currency risk – net investment hedges
The group has Euro, Canadian dollar, and US dollar denominated borrowings which are designated as hedges of the net investments in its
subsidiaries in France, Canada and the US. The carrying amounts of these borrowings as at 31 December are as follows:
2005
£ million
Borrowings denominated in:
Euro 160.8
Canadian dollars 68.8
US dollars 67.0

Credit risk
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large publicly quoted companies and government backed organisations, and the credit ratings 
of these organisations are monitored. Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance
instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments
recorded in the balance sheet.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date.
Fair values
The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows:

Current trade and other payables (2,007.7) (2,007.7)
Non-current trade and other payables (73.7) (73.7)
Fair values are determined as follows:
Trade and other receivables and payables are valued at their notional amounts, which are deemed to reflect fair value.
Interest rate swaps are valued using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at the year end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued based on market spot rates at the year end and zero coupon valuation techniques.
Bank loans and bonds are valued based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Securitisation
AMEC SPIE operates a securitisation programme whereby a proportion of trade receivables, totalling £89.3 million as at 31 December 2005,
were sold to a special purpose vehicle. Under the terms of the scheme, the recourse to AMEC SPIE is capped at 10 per cent of the receivables
which have been sold and therefore AMEC SPIE’s continuing involvement of £8.9 million as at 31 December 2005 is included within bank loans.
The net impact of the securitisation programme has been to reduce net assets attributed to each of the ETS segment and the Rest of Europe 
by £89.3 million.

Floating rate financial liabilities comprise borrowings which primarily bear interest at a margin over the relevant inter-bank rate. The fixed rate
financial liabilities relate to certain bank and other loans. The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate loans as at 31 December 2004
was 5.4 per cent.
The maturity of the financial liabilities was as follows:
2004

Group:
Due:
In one year or less, or on demand 50.3
Between one and two years 70.6
Between two and five years 424.5
Over five years 146.1
691.5
There was no material difference between the book and fair value of financial assets and liabilities save for financial liabilities in the two to five
years category which had a book value of £424.5 million and a fair value of £343.8 million as at 31 December 2004 and those in the over five
years category which had a book value of £146.1 million and £116.0 million respectively as at 31 December 2004.
As at 31 December 2004, there were six outstanding interest rate swaps under which the group paid a fixed rate of interest and received 
a floating rate based on six months’ LIBOR. The instruments covered US dollars, Canadian dollars, Euro and Sterling, and had a Sterling
equivalent of £65.0 million. The expiry dates ranged from January 2005 to January 2008, with a weighted average period to maturity of 29 months 
as at 31 December 2004.
In addition, there were two outstanding interest rate swaps under which the group paid a floating rate of interest and received a fixed rate.
The instruments covered US dollars with a Sterling equivalent of £15.6 million and expire in July 2013. 
After taking into account the effects of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, there were no material currency exposures in respect
of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant business unit. 
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging purposes were not recognised until the exposure that was being hedged was recognised 
in either the income statement or via an adjustment to the carrying value of an asset on the balance sheet.
There were no material unrecognised gains or losses at the beginning or end of the year .
As permitted by FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above analyses.

In January 2005, the group raised £89 million by way of a placing. As discussed in the business and financial review on page 48 and in line with
counsel’s opinion, the excess of the proceeds of the placing over the nominal value of the shares issued created a merger reserve which was
subsequently transferred to retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign operations, as well 
as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
A qualifying share ownership trust (“the Quest”) was established on 26 August 1999. The Quest holds shares issued by the company in
connection with the savings related share option scheme. During the year the company allotted 126,524 (2004: 2,538,668) shares to the Quest
and the Quest transferred 191,662 (2004: 3,140,312) of these shares to employees exercising options.
As at 31 December 2005 the Quest held 941,555 (2004: 1,006,693) shares.
Share capital
The authorised share capital of the company is £350.0 million (2004: £350.0 million). This comprises 700 million (2004: 700 million) ordinary

Share-based payment
In 1985, the group established the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which entitles employees of the group to buy shares in the company.
Grants of share options under this scheme are offered to employees periodically, and options are exercisable at a 20 per cent discount 
to the market price of shares at the date of grant.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, directors and senior employees of the group have been granted share options, which carry 
a non-market based performance condition.
Until September 2004, the Performance Share Plan 2002 was operated alongside the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, but since then
awards have been made under the Performance Share Plan 2002 only. Under this plan, share awards are made to directors and senior
employees of the group, subject to both market and non-market based performance tests.
All of the share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are equity-settled. Options are granted with a maximum term of ten years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 and IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”, the recognition and measurement provisions 
of IFRS 2 have not been applied to options granted or shares awarded before 7 November 2002.

The expected share price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’s share price.
The performance conditions attaching to the Performance Share Plan 2002 involve a comparison of the total shareholder return of the company
with that of its comparators and achievement of targeted earnings per share growth. The former is a market based test and as such is
incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award.
Goodwill written-off against reserves
The cumulative goodwill (at historic exchange rates) written-off against reserves in respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, when FRS 10

(2004: £0.1 million).
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2005 of 7.5 pence per share, which will
absorb an estimated £24.3 million of equity. Subject to approval, it will be paid on 3 July 2006 to shareholders on the register of members 
on 12 May 2006. The dividends have not been provided for and there are no income tax consequences for the company. 24 Analysis of cash, cash equivalents and net debt

25 Acquisitions and disposals
All acquisitions in the year have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. An assessment of the fair value to the group 
of the assets and liabilities acquired on all acquisitions has been made.
On 20 January 2005, the group acquired all the shares in Paragon Engineering Services Inc. (“Paragon”) for £21.7 million. Paragon is an oil 
and gas engineering services company based in Houston, US.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Paragon were as follows:
Fair value Recognised
Book value adjustments value
£ million £ million £ million
Property, plant and equipment 1.2 (0.3) 0.9
Intangible assets – 4.9 4.9
Trade and other receivables 7.7 – 7.7
Cash and cash equivalents 4.2 – 4.2
Deferred tax liability – (0.7) (0.7)

Goodwill on acquisition 9.6
22.3

Cash 17.2
Deferred consideration 4.5
21.7
Cost of acquisition 0.6
22.3
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2005, Paragon contributed £45.5 million to the consolidated revenue. Its profit contribution was
not material to the results of the group.
Goodwill has been recognised on the acquisition of Paragon as a result of its skilled workforce and specialist engineering expertise that did not
meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.

On 3 July 2005, the group acquired all the shares in NNC Holdings Limited (“NNC”) for £25.3 million in cash and net debt of £13.7 million. 
NNC provides consultancy and engineering services across the life of nuclear facilities in the UK, Canada and across the former Soviet Union.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of NNC were as follows:
Fair value Recognised

In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2005, NNC contributed £50.6 million to the consolidated revenue. Its profit contribution was 
not material to the results of the group.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of NNC primarily because of its skilled workforce which did not meet the criteria for recognition 
as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
A number of smaller acquisitions were made in the year ended 31 December 2005 for an aggregate consideration net of cash acquired of 
£8.7 million (of which £4.3 million was paid in 2004). The aggregate book value of the identifiable assets and liabilities was £0.2 million and 
the aggregate goodwill arising on the acquisitions was £12.4 million.
The acquisition cost of joint ventures and other investments amounted to £25.0 million in 2005 and principally related to investments in public
private partnership projects.

As at 31 December 2005, there was a commitment to invest a total of £42.3 million (2003: £36.0 million) in various Public Private and 
regeneration partnership projects. In addition, there are commitments to purchase land for a developments project of up to £15 million

AMEC plc annual report 2005 95 28 Contingent liabilities
Guarantees and indemnities
The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC other than for normal performance obligations which are usually
given on a several basis. AMEC has provided guarantees in respect of committed bank facilities granted to certain property joint ventures. 
The borrowings drawn against these facilities amounted to £33.8 million at 31 December 2005 (2004: £35.0 million) and the current debt service
ratios for these joint ventures are all within the agreed levels.
The company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds issued, on behalf of group companies, 
in the normal course of business.
As at 31 December 2005, AMEC had a commitment to invest £47.4 million (2004: £36.0 million) in joint venture projects. It had also provided
guarantees on certain projects to invest further amounts of up to £34.2 million (2003: £16.4 million), AMEC believes that the circumstances
under which it will be called upon to invest the contingent equity are remote.
Legal claims and actions
AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified in this note. AMEC makes 
an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision 
for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
– During 1994 and 1995, AMEC Construction Management Inc. (“ACMI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, entered into various contracts
with the United States General Services Administration (“GSA”) for the construction of courthouses in Missouri and California and for the
refurbishment and seismic upgrade of a US Customs House in California. The total value of these contracts at point of signing was in the 
order of US$290 million. Due, inter alia, to unforeseen site conditions, client delays and numerous design and scope changes, ACMI 
suffered significant cost overruns and submitted substantial recovery claims.
In June 1999, GSA terminated the right of ACMI to complete one contract, which at that stage was 85 per cent complete. ACMI contested 
the termination and sued the GSA for recovery of all claims on this contract. Recently the GSA has submitted its claim against ACMI for
reprocurement and other costs totalling US$32 million.
The United States Department of Justice then filed a counterclaim alleging false claims on the GSA contracts and sought to argue that, 
as a result, ACMI had forfeited its rights to recovery of all claims.
ACMI, upon legal advice, pleaded guilty in December 2000 and November 2001 to two federal felonies and paid two fines totalling approximately
US$1.2 million. AMEC also agreed to introduce additional ethical processes and procedures, both for the North American workforce and 
for those staff employed by AMEC, whose responsibilities caused them to have regular business contact with AMEC Americas and thus, 
the US Government.
The GSA subsequently filed a motion for summary judgement seeking an order declaring that ACMI had forfeited its claims on all the projects. 
ACMI opposed the motion and oral argument was held in February 2004. 
During 2005 the US Court of Federal Claims ruled that ACMI had violated the US Anti-Kickback Act. The Court has stated that it intends 
to issue an order in respect of the Government’s counter claims and the issues relating to the Anti-Kickback Act in April 2006.
– In 2001, ACMI entered into a contract with a value of US$103 million to build a development in Miami, Florida, which was subject to significant
changes and design delays. In January 2006 the client terminated ACMI’s contract despite having taken possession of the majority of the facility
for many months. Both parties are now in litigation in pursuit of various claims and counter claims.
– In 2000, ACMI entered into a contract with a value of US$115 million to design and build a jail for the City and County of San Francisco
(“CCSF”). Due to unforeseen conditions, delays and interference with ACMI’s design, procurement and execution of the work, ACMI suffered
large cost overruns. In 2005, lawsuits were filed by both parties. CCSF further alleged that ACMI made false claims in connection with the
project and also failed to properly maintain its California contractor’s licence throughout the project term. The litigation is at the pleading 
stages with an initial trial date set for November 2007. 
– In 1999 AGRA Monenco Inc. (a predecessor company of AMEC Americas Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc), in joint venture,
entered into a contract with Jordan Magnesia Company Ltd. (“ Jormag”) to design and construct a magnesium plant in Jordan with a contract
value of US$80 million. The joint venture experienced delays in completing its work under the contract and Jormag terminated the contract
when work was approximately 95 per cent complete. The joint venture commenced an action against Jormag, who counter claimed for damages
it claims it suffered from the alleged default of the joint venture. The dispute has been referred to arbitration under the terms of the contract,
and the matter is scheduled to be heard by a panel in the UK in March 2006.

– After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, ACMI was one of four construction managers hired by the City of New York to carry out the 
clean up and debris removal work at the World Trade Center site. The client was responsible for procuring insurance to protect the construction
managers and various contractors from lawsuits arising out of the work. The World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company (the “WTC
Captive”) was formed and was funded with US$1 billion in Federal money to provide coverage for the City, the construction managers and 
the contractors who performed the work on site. Pursuant to the insurance policy that was issued, the WTC Captive is providing a minimum 
of US$1 billion in insurance coverage. This amount can increase depending upon investment returns on the US$1 billion. The WTC Captive 
is providing a defence and indemnification for claims against ACMI arising out of this work.
– AMEC Civil Engineering Limited was awarded a contract to refurbish the existing Thelwall viaduct which carries the M6 motorway over 
the Manchester Ship Canal. Shortly prior to the expiry of the six year latent defects liability period the Highways Agency advised AMEC that 
a number of bearings/bearing plates had failed. Subsequently the Highways Agency decided to replace all the 316 bearings and has raised 
a claim against AMEC for £48 million. The client has instigated a dispute under the contract which has been referred to arbitration. The hearing 
is not anticipated until 2007.
29 Related party transactions
During the year there were a number of transactions with the senior management group, joint venture entities and subsidiary companies.
Transactions with the senior management group
Directors of the company and their immediate relatives control 0.1 per cent of the voting rights of the company.
In addition to their salaries, the group and company also provide non-cash benefits to directors and executive officers, and contribute to a post-
employment defined benefit plan on their behalf. Directors and executive officers also receive share awards under the Performance Share Plan. 
Details of the senior management group compensation are as follows:

AMEC Developments Limited and AMEC Staff Pensions Trustee Limited entered into an agreement on 23 December 2005 for the sale of 
the long leasehold interests forming part of the Newcastle Estate, currently owned by AMEC Developments Limited, to AMEC Staff Pensions
Trustee Limited, for a price of £25 million. The agreement was conditional upon various consents being obtained and ancillary documentation
being entered into. It is envisaged that the conditions will be satisfied shortly. AMEC Developments Limited and AMEC Staff Pensions Trustee
Limited have each received separate legal and valuation advice in respect of the transaction.
30 Post balance sheet event
As previously announced, the group is continuing with the proposed sale of AMEC SPIE.
The assets to be disposed of include Continental European Rail, Multitechnical and Oil and Gas Services activities, excluding the pipeline
business. The UK Rail business will be subject to a joint venture and will be held 50 per cent by AMEC plc and 50 per cent will be disposed 
of along with AMEC SPIE.
The sales process has commenced and the Information Memorandum will be issued in March. The group is expecting to seek shareholder
approval for the sale process around the middle of the year .
Total profit before net finance costs relating to the business subject to the disposal process amounted to £49.7 million in 2005. The majority 
of this is included in the Engineering and Technical Services segment, although small elements also relate to Oil and Gas and Project Solutions.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 97 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS
As stated in note 1, these are the group’s first consolidated accounts prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2005, the comparative
information presented in these accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet 
at 1 January 2004, the group’s date of transition.
Transitional arrangements
The rules for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1. In general, a company is required to define its IFRS accounting policies and 
apply these retrospectively to determine its opening consolidated balance sheet as at 1 January 2004 under IFRS. To assist companies 
in their transition to reporting under IFRS, IFRS 1 sets out various exceptions and exemptions from this principle of full retrospective adoption.
The exemptions that AMEC has applied under IFRS 1 are discussed below.
As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, AMEC elected to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39, prospectively from 1 January 2005. The 2004
comparative figures have not been restated to comply with these standards. The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the balance sheet 
as at 1 January 2005 is set out on page 103.

The impacts of significant changes in policy, which have arisen from AMEC’s transition to IFRS, on the company’s results and financial position
are discussed below:
Balance sheet reclassifications
There are a number of reclassifications between balance sheet captions that arise from the application of various IFRS.
IFRS 2 Share-based payment
Under UK GAAP, there was no charge to the income statement in respect of Save As You Earn schemes that were offered on similar terms 
to all, or substantially all, UK employees. For other share option schemes, there was a charge only in respect of the difference between the
market price on the date of grant and the exercise price of the option i.e. there was no charge in respect of options issued at market price. 
For shares issued under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and Performance Share Plan 2002 (“PSP’), there was a charge to the profit 
and loss account equal to the market price of the shares on the date of the award, spread over the performance period.
IFRS 2 requires the fair value of all equity instruments granted to be charged to the income statement over the performance period of the
award. This results in a charge in respect of all share options issued, and a different basis for calculation of the charge in respect of the 
LTIP and PSP .
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has applied IFRS 2 only to those equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
by 1 January 2005.
The impact of this is to reduce profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by £1.8 million, together with an associated tax credit of £0.5 million.
IFRS 3 Business combinations
Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions made post 1 January 1998 was capitalised and amortised, on a straight line basis, over its
estimated useful economic life.
Under IFRS 3, positive goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and consequently is not amortised, but instead is subject to impairment
testing both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable in full.
Goodwill previously written-off to reserves is no longer recycled to the income statement on the disposal or closure of operations as it would
have been under UK GAAP .
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has applied IFRS 3 prospectively from the transition date, rather than restating all previous business combinations. 
The impact of IFRS 3 on AMEC is as follows:
the amortisation of goodwill is reversed increasing profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by £21.6 million.
the goodwill recycled to the income statement on the disposal or closure, of operations in 2004 is frozen in reserves. This increases profit 
for the year ended 31 December 2004 by £13.0 million. 31 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued
IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date
Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the period end are recognised as a liability of the company at the balance sheet date.
Under IAS 10, dividends declared after the period end represent a non-adjusting post balance sheet event and therefore no liability 
is recognised at the balance sheet date.
Consequently, there is an adjustment as at 31 December 2004 to remove the liability of £23.5 million in respect of the 2004 final dividend 
(2003: £20.2 million).
IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment
Under UK GAAP, AMEC’s policy was to revalue freehold and long leasehold property on a regular basis. 
Under IAS 16, AMEC has opted to carry property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has frozen the UK GAAP land and buildings revaluations as at 1 January 2004 by ascribing the carrying 
value as deemed cost.
The impact of this change in policy is as follows:
the revaluation reserve is reclassified into retained earnings as at the date of transition; 
the results of the external revaluation as at 31 December 2004 are reversed, reducing the value of property, plant and equipment 
as at 31 December 2004 by £9.6 million; and
as part of the 2004 external revaluation, certain properties were revalued downwards. Under UK GAAP, these deficits were charged against
previous revaluations held in the revaluation reserve. Under IFRS, these downward revaluations have been taken as indicators that the value 
of the relevant properties is impaired and as such, they have been charged to the income statement as impairment charges in 2004. This reduces 
the profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 and the value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2004 by £1.8 million.
IAS 19 Employee benefits
Under UK GAAP, AMEC accounted for pension costs by spreading the cost of providing the benefits, including any experience gains or losses,
over the estimated average service lives of the employees. 
Under IAS 19, AMEC’s policy is now to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised income and expense as they arise.
This is permitted by the amended version of IAS 19.
The impact of IAS 19 is to increase the pensions charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 by £2.6 million. There is a related tax credit 
of £0.7 million.
The implementation of IAS 19 results in an increase in the net assets of £7.2 million as at 31 December 2004 (2003: £15.9 million).
IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
IAS 21 requires that exchange differences arising on the re-translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings 
are taken to a separate component of equity. On the disposal of an operation, such gains or losses are recycled to the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
As permitted by IFRS 1, AMEC has deemed the cumulative translation differences to be zero at the date of transition.
IAS 38 Intangible assets
IAS 38 requires that certain expenditure relating to software be capitalised as an intangible asset.
Certain items that were capitalised, in accordance with UK GAAP, no longer qualify for capitalisation under IAS 38 and these items have been
written-off at the date of transition. This reduces the net assets as at 31 December 2003 by £1.4 million.
In addition, certain assets that were included within goodwill under UK GAAP are reclassified as other intangible assets and, consequently, 
are amortised at a different rate, reducing profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by £0.5 million.
Cash flow statement
Under IAS 7 “Cash flow statements”, movements in cash and cash equivalents are reconciled; under UK GAAP the statement reconciles cash
only. The change in presentation of the cash flow statement under IAS 7 makes no difference to the free cash generated by the group.

Application of IAS 32 and IAS 39 prospectively from 1 January 2005
Prior to the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the group did not recognise derivatives. In accordance with IAS 39, derivatives have been recorded 
at fair value with effect from 1 January 2005 and these principally relate to interest and inflation rate derivatives in the PPP projects.
The effect of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the group balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 is as follows:

Notes to the company balance sheet
1 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings and 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985.
In the year the company has adopted FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”, FRS 20 “Share-based payment”, FRS 21 “Events after the balance sheet 
date”, FRS 23 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”, the presentation requirements of FRS 25 “Financial instruments: disclosure 
and presentation”, FRS 26 “Financial instruments: measurement”, and FRS 28 “Corresponding amounts”. With the exception of the adoption 
of FRS 25 and FRS 26 (see financial instruments accounting policy below) changes in accounting policy have been accounted for as a prior
period adjustment, and the company balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 has been restated as detailed in note 13.
The company has not adopted the amendments to FRS 26 and FRS 12 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for the year
commencing on 1 January 2006.
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group, the company
considers these to be indemnity arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect the company treats the guarantee contract 
as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the accounts for the period commencing 1 January 2006.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost or valuation, less estimated
residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings the shorter of the lease term or 50 years
Plant and equipment mainly three to five years
Financial instruments
Under the transitional provisions of FRS 26 AMEC has elected not to adopt FRS 25 and FRS 26 in its restated financial information for the year
ended 31 December 2004 and, as a result, FRS 13 “Derivatives and other financial instruments – disclosures” has been applied in accounting 
for financial instruments in the year ended 31 December 2004.
On 1 January 2005, AMEC adopted FRS 25 and FRS 26 and adopted the following policy in accounting for financial instruments.
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instruments. Cash, deposits 
and short-term investments are held at amortised cost. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as described in note 1 to the
consolidated accounts.
The company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS 25 as the financial instruments disclosures of IAS 32 are included in the notes
to the consolidated accounts.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward
exchange contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken directly to reserves. Other exchange differences are taken to the profit 
and loss account in the year .
Interest 
Interest is written-off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Leases 
Operating lease costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pensions
Contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in respect of employees of AMEC plc are charged in the profit and loss account as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes are operated by the group but the company is unable to separately identify its share of the assets and
liabilities of those schemes or any details of the surplus or deficit in the scheme and the implications of that surplus or deficit for the company.
Details of the disclosures required under FRS 17 can be found in the accounts of AMEC Group Limited, a subsidiary company. 106 AMEC plc annual report 2005
Notes to the company balance sheet
continued
1 Accounting policies continued
Share option schemes
The fair value of equity instruments granted to employees of the company is charged to the income statement with a corresponding increase 
in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate valuation model and spread over the period during which the employee
becomes unconditionally entitled to the award. The charge is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or options that vest, except where
failure to vest is due to a market based criteria.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 “Deferred Tax”.

was subsequently transferred to retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders.

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the
group and parent company accounts, in accordance with applicable
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent
company accounts for each financial year . Under that law the directors
are required to prepare the group accounts in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent
company accounts in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
The group accounts are required by law and IFRS as adopted by 
the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of the
group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such accounts
that references in the relevant part of that Act to accounts giving 
a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company accounts are required by law to give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company. 
In preparing each of the group and parent company accounts, 
the directors are required to: 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
for the group accounts, state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; 
for the parent company accounts, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company accounts; and 
prepare the accounts on the going concern basis, unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company 
will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its
accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud
and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also
responsible for preparing a directors’ report, directors’ remuneration
report and corporate governance statement that comply with 
that law. 
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report 
and the accounts AMEC plc annual report 2005 113
We have audited the group and parent company accounts (the
“accounts”) of AMEC plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 which
comprise the group income statement, the group and parent company
balance sheets, the group cash flow statement, the group statement
of recognised income and expense and the related notes. These
accounts have been prepared under the accounting policies set 
out therein. We have also audited the information in the directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
group accounts in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU, and 
for preparing the parent company accounts and the directors’
remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and UK
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities on page 112. 
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true
and fair view and whether the accounts and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether, in addition,
the group accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the directors’ report is not consistent with the accounts, if the
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited accounts. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the accounts. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made 
by the directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
accounts and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the accounts and the part of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion:
the group accounts give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the state of the group’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2005 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
the group accounts have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; 
the parent company accounts give a true and fair view, in
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the
state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005; and 
the parent company accounts and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Electronic communications
Electronic shareholder communication
AMEC is working with The CarbonNeutral Company (formerly 
Future Forests) to reduce the impact of shareholder communications
on the environment – as well as cutting the cost of printing and
distribution. For every shareholder that elects to receive
communications electronically, AMEC will plant a tree on their behalf
at the Donkleywood Forest project in Northumberland. Further
information on The CarbonNeutral Company and the Donkleywood
project is available at www.carbonneutral.com/pdfs/projects/
forestryenglanddonkleywood.pdf
Choosing electronic shareholder information means you will receive
an e-mail every time any new shareholder information is published –
instead of paper documents in the post. E-mails will refer to AMEC
annual and interim reports, documents relating to our annual general
meeting and any other shareholder communications – and will 
normally be from our registrar, Capita Registrars. E-mails will 
contain links to the appropriate web site where the documents 
can be viewed.
Shareholders – how to register
If you are an AMEC shareholder and wish to receive electronic
communications, you will need your investor code, which is printed 
in the bottom right-hand corner of your AMEC share certificates 
and dividend tax vouchers.
You must register with Capita Registrars to receive electronic
shareholder communications as follows:
1 Go to www.amec.com/plantatree
2 Follow the “Shareholders – how to register” instructions
Once you confirm your details, Capita Registrars will e-mail you to
verify the change. Every time Capita Registrars receives a shareholder
request to switch from paper to e-communications, we will ask 
The CarbonNeutral Company to plant a tree.
You can opt to return to paper communications at any time by
amending your details with Capita Registrars. Shareholders who
decline to register for e-communications will continue to receive
paper documents.
If you have any questions about electronic shareholder communications,
contact Capita Registrars on +44 (0)870 162 3100, visit their web site 
at www.capitaregistrars.com or e-mail at ssd@capitaregistrars.com

dividend tax vouchers.

Investor relations report
Overview
AMEC investor relations is committed to improving the
understanding of AMEC and its business activities in the financial
community, enabling financial markets to place an appropriate
valuation on the company.
This report provides an overview of AMEC’s investor relations
strategy, the investor relations programme in 2005 and other
information of interest to shareholders.
AMEC’s investor relations strategy reflects the company’s guiding
principles (available at www.amec.com) and its responsibilities 
to shareholders, which are:
to seek to achieve the best returns on investment that markets
will allow and provide accurate and timely information on the
company’s performance; and 
to manage the affairs of the company through responsible and
effective corporate governance, identifying and managing the risks
inherent in our activities on an ongoing basis.
The strategy is focused on three key areas which are:
Compliance with all regulations relating to the conduct of
companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. This includes
ensuring that all market sensitive information is issued first through
the London Stock Exchange and as soon as possible thereafter is
made available to the financial community through various channels
including AMEC’s corporate website at www.amec.com; 
Understanding the shareholder base and market sentiment
towards AMEC. This is achieved through close working relationships
with advisers, regular share register analysis and non-attributable
feedback from analysts and investors; and 
Delivery of a comprehensive programme of investor relations
activity involving effective communication and consultation with
current and potential investors and analysts.
AMEC investor relations controls and coordinates the company’s
programme of investor relations activity in line with this strategy. 
In support of its objectives, AMEC has put in place a management
and policy framework for investor relations together with best
practice notes on contact with the financial community, stock
exchange announcements and published information. These
documents are available to employees on the company’s intranet.
Review of 2005
Key events in AMEC’s investor relations programme are the
company’s preliminary and interim results announcements, annual
general meeting and related trading updates. In the year ended 
15 March 2006, these events took place on the following dates:
Annual general meeting trading update 18 May 2005
Trading update 30 June 2005
Interim results announcement 1 September 2005
Trading update 12 January 2006
Preliminary results announcement 15 March 2006
On the days the preliminary and interim results were announced,
AMEC’s chairman, chief executive and finance director made
presentations to analysts, institutional investors and banks in
London, with their slides and speaking remarks being published 
at the time of delivery on AMEC’s website. Interviews were also 
given to journalists from leading newswires and the national and
regional press.
Following both the preliminary and interim results announcements,
major shareholders were offered one-on-one meetings with
management, with other institutional shareholders being
offered the opportunity to attend group meetings hosted by
the company’s brokers.
During the course of 2005, AMEC met with a total of 85 (2004: 72)
institutions from the UK, Europe and the US.
Analysts and investors value opportunities to meet operational
management and to undertake site visits. In May 2005, analysts 
and institutional investors visited Toulouse, where they received
presentations on the AMEC SPIE Multitechnical Services business
and visited Airbus. The event was announced in advance to the
London Stock Exchange, with all slides being published on
www.amec.com. 
In June 2005, AMEC’s leading banks received presentations on 
its activities at London Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 5, followed 
by a visit to the site. Feedback from both events was positive.
AMEC recognises the importance of the internet in financial
communications and closely follows developments in best practice 
in investor communications on the internet. During 2005, the site’s 
e-mail alerting service, which is a quick and efficient way to be 
kept appraised of company announcements, was enhanced to
provide improved access to news headlines for users of mobile
communications devices. New “AMEC at a glance” pages were also
added to the investors pages of the site. Following a major survey of
user needs carried out across all stakeholder groups during 2005,
further enhancements to the site are planned for 2006.
During 2005, usage of the investors pages of www.amec.com
increased by 30 per cent, continuing the strong growth trend 
seen in recent years.  AMEC plc annual report 2005 119

Process plant
The Sukari plant processed 11.6 million tonnes (“Mt”) of 
ore in 2016, a 9% increase on the prior year (2015: 10.6Mt). 
The total annual processed tonnes were 5% above our base 
case forecast plant throughput of 11.0 million tonnes per 
annum (“Mtpa”) and metallurgical recoveries of 89.4% were 
an increase on 88.8% in 2015. This performance reflected 
the ongoing improvements in productivity as the various 
areas of the operation were further optimised.
Open pit
The open pit delivered 62.2Mt of total material movement 
in 2016, an increase of 8% on the prior year (2015: 57.8Mt). 
This increase was related to improved mining productivity 
and equipment utilisation. The average mined grade of 
0.93g/t was below the reserve average of 1.03g/t.

Processing
Plant throughput: current forecast processing rates of 
11.75Mtpa, with potential to exceed a throughput of 
12Mtpa with ongoing process optimisation.
Plant recovery: current forecast metallurgical recoveries of 
89.75%, with potential to sustain circa 90% with ongoing 
process optimisation.
Open pit
Fleet capacity: the mining fleet has total capacity above 
current forecast rates of 66.5Mtpa and therefore offers the 
potential to further improve scheduling of open pit ore.
Underground
Infrastructure capacity: current forecast ore mining rates 
of 1.0Mtpa, with potential to reach circa 1.5Mtpa from the 
existing Amun/Ptah declines as development progresses.
Cleopatra decline: new decline within the north-eastern 
region of Sukari Hill, aimed at developing infrastructure 
with the capacity to support mining rates of up to 1Mtpa. 
Ultimate production rates will depend on results from the 
ongoing exploration drilling programme.

Sukari exploration
Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari 
exploration programme as ongoing development improves 
access to test the potential high-grade extensions of the 
deposit. The Sukari Hill ore body has not yet been closed 
off at depth and further underground drilling will take place 
during 2017 from the Amun and Ptah declines.
During the second half of 2016 we began development of a 
new exploration decline within the north-eastern Cleopatra 
zone of Sukari Hill. The initial project is aimed at developing 
infrastructure with the capacity to support mining rates of up 
to one million tonnes per annum from this area, which would 
be in addition to the current underground ore production 
from the Amun and Ptah declines. Ultimate production 
rates will depend on future results from the development 
and exploration drilling programme.
Within the wider 160km

 Sukari exploitation lease, 
a number of additional prospect areas have been 
identified by reconnaissance field work, including 
geophysical/geochemical surveys and first-pass drilling. 
These prospects offer the potential for satellite deposits 
to feed the existing processing plant with both high-grade 
and low-grade (bulk tonnage) ore. Exploration at these 
prospects is ongoing.

During 2016 Centamin’s flagship 
Sukari Gold Mine continued to deliver 
substantial free cash flows, driven 
by a seventh successive year of 
production growth and by substantial 
reductions in operating costs. This 
performance has allowed Centamin 
to maintain its strategic focus on 
generating shareholder returns and 
value-accretive growth. 
A significant milestone was achieved 
during the year, as the capital 
investment in the Sukari operation by 
Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary 
Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”) was 
recovered from cash flows to the extent 
that profit share commenced with 
the Egyptian government during the 
third quarter.
Centamin ended the year with 
US$428 million in cash, bullion on 
hand, gold sales receivables and 
available-for-sale financial assets. 
The increase of US$197 million during 
the twelve-month period highlights 
the continued potential of the business 
to self-fund its next stages of growth 
from cash flows, whilst at the same time 
sustaining industry-leading dividend 
returns to shareholders.
The board of directors approved an 
interim 2016 payment of 2.00 US cents 
per share (versus a 2015 interim 
payment of 0.97 US cents per share). 
I am now pleased to announce that, 
with the strong performance of our 
flagship asset and solid cash flows 
carrying through into the second half, a 
final dividend for 2016 of 13.5 US cents 
per share has been proposed for 
approval at the forthcoming AGM on 
21 March 2017. This represents a full 
year pay-out of US$178 million, which 
is equivalent to approximately 70% 
of our net free cash flow in 2016 and 
follows the update to our dividend 
policy which was announced on 
9 January 2017, as follows:
The Company’s dividend policy sets 
a minimum payout level relative 
to cash flow while considering the 
financial condition of, and outlook 
for, the Company. When determining 
the amount to be paid the board will 
take into consideration the underlying 
profitability of the Company and 
significant known or expected funding 
commitments. Specifically, the board 
will aim to approve an annual dividend 
of at least 30% of the Company’s net 
cash flow after sustaining capital costs 
and following the payment of profit 
share due to the government of Egypt.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We remain focused on delivering peer-leading returns, 
through our value-driven growth strategy and a 
commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Josef El‑Raghy  
Chairman Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
STRATEGIC REPORT
11
This dividend policy and the proposed 
full year payment for 2016 reflects our 
commitment to maintain strong fiscal 
discipline in managing our existing 
portfolio of assets, and to return 
to shareholders any cash reserves 
above those required to sustain our 
value driven growth strategy. We also 
remain committed to our policy of 
being 100% exposed to the gold price 
through an unhedged position and 
with a zero-debt balance sheet. 
During the year both the processing 
and underground mining operations at 
Sukari achieved levels of productivity 
that were above our base case 
annualised forecasts. As a result, 
full-year production of 551,036 ounces 
was above the revised guidance range 
of 520,000 to 540,000 ounces. 
The cash cost of production improved 
significantly to US$513 per ounce 
from US$713 per ounce in 2015, 
below our revised forecast of between 
US$530 and US$550 per ounce, due 
to the above-forecast gold production 
and an 8% reduction in mine 
production costs. The main positive 
impact on costs was from reductions 
in the price set by the government for 
fuel, which remained below originally 
forecast levels throughout the year in 
line with lower international oil prices. 
In addition, during the fourth quarter 
local costs in Egypt were reduced in 
US dollar terms following a devaluation 
of the Egyptian pound. In line with 
the reduction in operating costs, the 
AISC of US$694 per ounce marked an 
improvement on US$885 per ounce 
in 2015, and was below our revised 
forecast of between US$720 and 
US$750 per ounce. 
We expect the strong levels of 
productivity to be maintained in 2017, 
with forecast production of 540,000 
ounces at a cash cost of production 
of US$580 per ounce and an all-in 
sustaining cost of US$790 per ounce. 
Ongoing optimisation of the Sukari 
operation, in particular within the 
processing and underground mining 
functions, continues to offer scope 
for further production growth and 
reductions in cash costs and AISC.
2016 revenues of US$687.4 million 
were up 35% year-on-year, with an 8% 
increase in realised gold prices and a 
25% increase in gold sales. EBITDA 
increased by 145% to US$372.9 million, 
with an increase of gross operating 
margin resulting from the higher 
revenue and decreased mine 
production costs, discussed above.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT continued
Also in line with this increased margin, 
profit before tax of US$266.8 million 
was up 357% on 2015 and earnings 
per share (before profit share) for 
2016 was 23.05 US cents, compared 
with 4.51 US cents in 2015. Profit for 
the year following deduction of profit 
share was US$214.8 million, equating 
to 18.61 US cents basic earnings per 
share (compared with 4.51 US cents 
in 2015).
The underground operation at Sukari 
is an important value-driver for our 
business and we expect further growth 
of the reserve over the coming years 
as development and exploration 
continues. In August, we commenced 
development of a new exploration 
decline within the north-eastern 
Cleopatra zone of Sukari Hill. Whilst the 
infrastructure is being developed with 
the capacity to support mining rates of 
up to 1 million tonnes per annum from 
this area, ultimate production rates 
will depend on future results from the 
drilling programme and development.
Centamin remains in a strong position 
to continue investing in its long term 
growth throughout the cycle. Beyond 
Sukari we remain focused on our 
extensive licence holdings in West 
Africa. Momentum continues to build in 
Côte d’Ivoire, with further prospective 
licence holdings added to our portfolio 
and a new discovery at the Doropo 
project in the north-east of the country, 
where drilling to date has led to a 
maiden resource estimate of 0.3Moz 
indicated and 1.0Moz inferred. Further 
work in 2017 will aim to upgrade and 
expand on this positive start towards 
project development. In Burkina Faso, 
we continue to evaluate data from 
the extensive drilling programmes 
carried out to date and further work 
is being planned for the year ahead. 
I look forward to updating you further 
in due course with our progress 
towards unlocking the Company’s 
next stage of growth from these 
highly prospective regions.
Whilst disciplined and sustainable 
growth on our existing projects remains 
a key focus, we continue to evaluate 
opportunities to grow through the 
acquisition of projects that offer the 
potential for the Company to deliver 
on its strategic objectives.
Developments in the two litigation 
actions, Diesel Fuel Oil and Concession 
Agreement, are described in further 
detail in note 21 to the financial 
statements. In respect of the latter, the 
Company continues to believe that 
it has a strong legal position and, in 
addition, that it will ultimately benefit 
from Law no. 32 of 2014, which came 
into force in April 2014 and which 
restricts the capacity for third parties to 
challenge any contractual agreement 
between the Egyptian government 
and an investor. This law, whilst in force 
and ratified by the new parliament, is 
currently under review by the Supreme 
Constitutional Court of Egypt. After 
a series of delays and adjournments, 
the Concession Agreement appeal has 
now been stayed until the Supreme 
Constitutional Court has ruled on the 
validity of Law no. 32. 
We continue to evaluate opportunities to grow  
through the acquisition of projects which offer  
the potential for the Company to deliver on its  
strategic objectives. Centamin plc

STRATEGIC REPORT

A seventh successive year of 
growth in 2016 saw production of 
551,036 ounces increase by 26% 
over 2015 and exceed the top end 
of our revised annual guidance range 
of between 520,000 and 540,000 
ounces. Fourth quarter production 
was 136,787 ounces, an 8% reduction 
on the previous quarter, mainly due a 
lower average head grade of open pit 
ore of 0.85g/t (versus 1.14g/t in the 
third quarter), in line with the mining 
plan as a low-grade cutback in the east 
wall of the pit was developed. 
Safety is a critical area of Centamin’s 
performance and our aim is to ensure 
that every person returns safe at 
the end of each shift. Continued 
development of the onsite health and 
safety culture at Sukari has resulted 
in a low LTIFR for 2016 of 0.27 per 
200,000 man hours. Centamin remains 
committed to further improving health 
and safety during 2017 towards our 
‘zero-harm’ target.
The open pit total material movement 
in 2016 was 62.2Mt, an increase of 
8% on the prior year due to improved 
mining productivity and equipment 
utilisation, at an average mined grade 
of 0.93g/t. During the third quarter 
of 2016, open pit mining rates had 
achieved our annualised base case rate 
of approximately 65Mt of total material 
movement (ore plus waste) and mined 
grades had progressed towards the 
reserve average. During Q1 2017 
the open pit is scheduled to develop 
a low-grade east wall cutback and 
planned gold production will be lower 
than in Q4 2016. Grades are forecast 
to return towards the reserve average 
from Q2 2017 and the operation 
remains on a secure footing to deliver 
the scheduled material movements for 
the remaining mine life. 
The underground mine delivered 
1.02Mt of ore (a 12% decrease on 
2015) at a grade of 9.04g/t (up 40% on 
2015), achieving a sustained annualised 
rate in excess of our base case forecast 
of 1Mt per annum of ore at a grade of 
at least 6g/t. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT
Whilst the gold market conditions improved, Centamin 
remained focused on its drive for productivity and 
efficiency, and undertook a growth strategy aimed 
at enhancing shareholder returns.

The process plant also continued to 
operate at levels above our base case 
forecast rate of 11Mtpa, with 11.6Mt of 
ore processed in 2016 (a 9% increase 
on 2015). The average metallurgical 
recovery was 89.4%, an increase of 
0.6% on 2015. Work continues to 
develop the potential to improve and 
sustain recoveries at the 90% level with 
increasing throughput rates.
Sukari’s cost performance during 2016 
provides a strong indication for the 
potential of the operation to generate 
significant free cash flow over the 
coming years. There was a year-on-year 
decrease in operating costs per tonne 
in both the open pit mining and 
processing areas, principally driven 
by reductions in the local diesel price 
during the first half of 2016, driven by 
international fuel price movements. 
During the fourth quarter, a devaluation 
of the Egyptian pound versus 
US dollar also had a positive impact 
on local costs. 
As a result of these factors, 
the cash cost of production of 
US$513 was below guidance of 
between US$530 and $550 per 
ounce. The AISC of US$694 was 
similarly below guidance of between 
US$720 and $750 per ounce, 
despite an increase in sustaining 
capital expenditure of US$27 million 
(a 74% increase on 2015), mainly 
due to a planned increase in fleet 
maintenance costs.
Centamin had previously elected 
to make advance payments against 
future profit share from 2013 onwards, 
to demonstrate goodwill towards 
the Egyptian government. The total 
value of these payments, amounting 
to US$28.75 million, was recovered 
against entitlement to profit share 
by the Egyptian Mineral Resources 
Authority (“EMRA”). 
To the end of 2016, further 
distributions of profit share amounting 
to a total of US$18.5 million had 
subsequently been made to EMRA. 
Both EMRA and PGM will benefit from 
advance distributions of profit share 
on a proportionate basis in accordance 
with the terms of the Concession 
Agreement and considering ongoing 
cash flows, historic costs that are 
still to be recovered and any future 
capital expenditure.
Free cash flow generation from Sukari 
of approximately US$200 million 
has further strengthened Centamin’s 
financial position during 2016, 
a trend we expect to continue as 
we forecast 2017 production of 
540,000 ounces at a cash cost of 
production of US$580 per ounce and 
an all-in sustaining cost of US$790 
per ounce. This guidance is based on 
a plant throughput of 11.75Mt and 
approximately 1Mt of underground 
ore mined at a grade of 7.26g/t.

Ongoing optimisation of the 
processing and mining operations 
continues to offer scope for 
further increases in productivity 
and production growth. At the 
underground mine, we see potential 
for further increases in mined tonnages 
whilst retaining a priority on stable 
grade delivery. The additional 
shareholder value that can be gained 
through improving the delivery of 
high-grade underground ore has the 
potential to be significant and requires 
no material capital expenditure. 
At the process plant, further planned 
upgrades to the secondary crushing 
circuit with an estimated capital cost of 
circa US$6 million offer the potential for 
throughput rates to exceed 12Mtpa. 
In parallel with these productivity 
improvements, there remains scope 
for lower unit costs as the expanded 
operation continues to be optimised 
and further efficiency gains are realised.
We expect further growth of the 
Sukari reserve over the coming 
years as underground development 
and exploration continues, and the 
numerous regional prospects are 
evaluated. An updated resource and 
reserve estimate for Sukari is expected 
in 2017.
The objective of our producing asset, 
as always, is to generate substantial 
free cash flow even under challenging 
gold price assumptions. In line with 
our updated dividend policy, and 
supported by the board’s proposal 
for a final 2016 dividend of 13.5 US 
cents per share (equating to a full-year 
dividend of 15.5 US cents per share), 
we intend to return at least 30% of 
this cash flow to our shareholders. 
The remaining cash flows are allocated 
towards our medium and long term 
objective of organic growth, which 
is aimed at realising incremental 
shareholder value and returns.
We remain committed to our 
disciplined approach to capital 
allocation, as well as the potential 
for exploration to deliver significant 
shareholder value over the long 
term. Results from our programmes 
in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire 
continue to build momentum and 
warrant further investment, and we 
again exit the year with a robust 
financial and operating base on 
which to continue delivering our 
growth strategy.
Exploration at Sukari continues to 
prioritise extensions of the high-grade 
underground resource and reserve, 
as the development and drilling 
extends along strike and at depth. 
We expect to continue to deliver 
positive news in line with our strong 
results to date and a further resource 
and reserve update is planned 
during 2017.
During August, we began 
development of a new exploration 
decline within the north-eastern 
Cleopatra zone of Sukari Hill. The total 
project expenditure is expected to be 
US$11.5 million, of which US$3 million 
has been spent to date. A portal has 
been established and approximately 
900 metres of development was 
completed to the end of the year. Initial 
exploration drilling has commenced 
to target multiple zones of high-grade 
mineralisation, as interpreted from 
existing data. The initial project is 
aimed at developing infrastructure 
with the capacity to support mining 
rates of up to 1Mtpa from this area. 
Ultimate production rates will depend 
on future results from the programme 
and further development, and would 
be in addition to the current 1Mtpa 
underground ore production from the 
Amun and Ptah declines.
In Côte d’Ivoire, exploration drilling 
over targets defined by geochemical 
and geophysical surveys has led to a 
new discovery at the Doropo project 
in the north-east of the country, 
adjacent to our licence holding across 
the border in Burkina Faso. A maiden 
resource of 0.3Moz at 1.6g/t indicated 
and 1.0moz at 1.3g/t inferred has 
been estimated from drilling results 
over five prospects within a 5km radius 
area. Preliminary metallurgical test 
work has returned positive results, 
indicating mineralisation is amenable 
to conventional leaching. Mineralisation 
at these prospects remains open 
along strike and at depth and drilling 
in 2017 will focus on expanding and 
upgrading this initial resource in these 
areas. Regional exploration will also 
continue to test existing and new 
prospects for laterally extensive and 
near-surface mineralisation. We have 
continued to expanded our portfolio 
of highly prospective licence holdings 
in Côte d’Ivoire and, with licence 
applications pending, we expect to 
increase this further during 2017.

In Burkina Faso, exploration during 
2016 continued to test the potential 
for lateral and depth extensions 
of the more advanced targets, 
with priority on the Wadaradoo 
and Napelapera prospect areas. 
We continue to evaluate the results 
from these programmes, and the 
resulting interpretation will guide 
further drilling to be carried out in 
2017. There remains potential to add 
significant shareholder value from 
this district-scale licence holding as 
we continue to make progress towards 
developing our next stage of growth 
in West Africa.
We expect a total exploration 
expenditure of circa US$25 million 
in 2017, split between Côte d’Ivoire 
and Burkina Faso. In line with our 
overall exploration strategy, the 
actual expenditure on these projects 
is results driven and the current 
estimated expenditures are therefore 
subject to ongoing revisions.
We will continue to evaluate potential 
opportunities to grow the business 
through the acquisition of projects 
offering the potential for the Company 
to deliver on its strategic objectives. 
Maintaining good community relations 
is a core part of our operational 
strategy and corporate governance 
standards. As the first mining company 
in Egypt in modern times, we strive to 
set an example of a socially responsible 
industry through adopting a good 
neighbour policy. We take every action 
to ensure Sukari has the minimum 
impact on the social environment, 
as well as to deliver positive benefits to 
Egypt and the community as a result of 
our investment, and further details of 
our various initiatives can be found in 
the social responsibility report.
Our workforce is remunerated well 
above the average for Egypt and our 
career development programmes 
are highly valued. In general we 
enjoy a very positive and constructive 
relationship with our employees.
We welcome Ross Jerrard who was 
appointed as our new chief financial 
officer (“CFO”). Ross joined Centamin 
from Deloitte Australia. He has worked 
in Southern Africa and the Middle East, 
including a three-and-a-half-year period 
based in Egypt, servicing a range of 
multinational and natural resources 
companies. I am pleased to report that 
during his first year as CFO, Ross has 
overseen continued improvements in 
the Company’s financial control and 
reporting functions.
Finally, I would like to thank all my 
colleagues for their hard work over the 
years including the employees onsite 
at Sukari, those on the exploration 
sites in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire 
as well as those in the corporate and 
administration offices in Jersey and 
Australia. I would also like to thank your 
board of directors for their continued 
support and I am very much looking 
forward to another prosperous year for 
Centamin and its stakeholders in 2017.

STRATEGIC REPORT
23
During 2016, the Sukari operation delivered against its potential to generate 
substantial free cash flows, as the expanded operation met, and subsequently 
exceeded, its base case target levels of productivity. With the potential for 
ongoing process optimisation and exploration to drive further production growth 
over the coming years, Sukari enters 2017 on a strong and stable footing for its 
remaining circa 20-year life of mine. Centamin has no debt or hedging and has 
US$428.0 million of cash and liquid assets at the year end 2016. The Company is 
therefore financially robust, is well positioned to benefit from a further recovery 
in the gold price, and has the financial flexibility to grow both organically and 
through strategic acquisitions.
KPIs reported during the year: 
• cash cost of production of US$513 per ounce;
• all-in sustaining cost of US$694 per ounce; and
• revenue of US$687.4 million was an increase of 35% on 2015, driven by 
increased production and a higher average gold price of US$1,256 per ounce 
(US$1,159 per ounce in 2015).

In reflection of the free cash flow generation from Sukari, the 2016 full-year 
dividend of 15.5 US cents per share represents a significant increase on the 2015 
payment of 2.94 US cents per share. This is in line with the Company’ s recently 
revised dividend policy, to pay an amount of at least 30% of the Company’ s net 
cash flow after sustaining capital costs and following the payment of profit share 
due to the government of Egypt. Centamin is committed to its shareholder return 
policy and, to the extent that future cash reserves exceed that required to maintain 
a stable balance sheet and also provide capacity for potential future growth, 
the Company is committed to make further returns to shareholders. 
What we do for Egypt – stakeholder returns:
• direct payments to the government including:
• an entitlement of US$51 million profit share to 31 December 2016; and
• royalty payments of US$103 million to 31 December 2016. 
• approximately US$3 billion investment to date (including capital and 
operational expenditure); and
• an average of circa 1,300 Egyptian employees (70 expatriates) and over 
270 Egyptian companies supplying Sukari.
KPIs reported during the year: 
• total dividend 15.5 US cents per share for 2016 (totalling approximately 
US$178 million); and
• total payout above the dividend policy range of 15-30% of the Company’s 
free cash flow

RISK MANAGEMENT
The principal risks described in the 
report can have a serious impact on 
our ability to deliver on our strategic 
aims. The management of risks 
through identification, monitoring 
and mitigation allows the group to 
improve its decision making process, 
deliver on its objectives and improve 
its performance as a mining company.
The report below covers the board’s 
assessment of its risk appetite to 
key strategic decisions, our viability 
statement and details of our 
principal risks.
Risk appetite
Centamin accepts that the exploration 
for and development of metals and 
mineral resources, together with the 
construction and development of 
mining operations is an activity that 
involves a high degree of risk. The 
group therefore can only manage, 
rather than eliminate risk completely. 
In considering risk appetite, the board 
considered the level of acceptable risk 
(tolerance), the attitude and culture 
towards risk and the ways in which 
the board can influence risk appetite 
throughout the business.
In considering risk appetite, the board 
was clear that Centamin had zero 
tolerance to breaches in health and 
safety and environmental protection. 
The board was clear about their 
objectives and strategy which could 
be managed and mitigated to an 
acceptable level.
The group’s employees are paramount 
to the success of the organisation and 
therefore the group’s policies and 
procedures demand the lowest levels 
of risk appetite and risk tolerance for 
employee and contractor health, safety 
and wellbeing. The group has a higher 
risk appetite towards its strategic 
objectives, such that risks are reduced 
to reasonably practicable levels, 
in the pursuit of mineral exploration, 
development and gold production. 
Meeting environmental, regulatory 
and legal obligations takes priority over 
other business objectives. In summary 
the principal risks, objectives and risk 
appetite are summarised below:
The process for identifying and assessing risk is an integral 
and inseparable part of the group’s performance culture 
and processes and is therefore at the core of our business.
PRINCIPAL RISK STRATEGY MITIGATION/RISK APPETITE
Loss of revenue due to  
single project dependency 
Maintain redundancies within the operating 
cycle and develop a well-balanced 
project pipeline.
Risk appetite is at an acceptable level, with appropriate levels 
of mitigation in place to reduce the likelihood of significant 
loss of revenue due to single project dependency.
Sukari Gold Mine joint venture 
risk and relationship with EMRA
Maintaining good relations with EMRA  
(our joint venture partner in Egypt).
Risk appetite is at an acceptable level, with appropriate levels 
of mitigation in place.
Gold price and 
currency exposure
The Company does not currently hedge against 
the price of gold or exposure to currencies.
The strategy is aligned with the risk appetite  
of the Company. 
Jurisdictional taxation 
exposure
T o minimise the complexity of the corporate 
structure ensuring tax neutrality within the 
holding group entities.
Simplification of the structure is ongoing, however, the 
mitigation in place is at an acceptable level and therefore 
operating within the parameters of our current risk appetite. 
Political risk – Sukari Maintain a detailed understanding of the 
political environment in which we operate 
as well as constructive relationships with 
government. 
The Company operates within acceptable limits and the 
operation has continued to be unaffected despite a number 
of major political events occurring in Egypt. The Company 
supports Egypt’ s development of a modern mining code.
Political risk – West Africa Maintain a detailed understanding of the 
politcal environment and key relationships 
where we operate.
The Company operates within acceptable limits.
Exploration and 
development
T o ensure a progressive pipeline of greenfield 
and advance stage exploration projects to serve 
the next stage of growth for the Company.
The Company operates its exploration programmes within 
acceptable risk appetite parameters.
Reserve and resource 
estimate or failure to achieve 
production estimates
T o achieve reliable and consistent production, 
whilst optimising the potential of the operation.
The Company operates within acceptable risk 
appetite parameters. 
Litigation T o minimise exposure to litigation and reduce 
the impact of actions.
The Company is operating within its risk appetite parameters 
and the mitigation in place is at an acceptable level. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
STRATEGIC REPORT
31
The group’s risks may change over 
time, as will the group’s risk appetite 
statement, as the external environment 
changes and as operations are 
expanded into new geographical 
areas. The risk management and 
review process requires regular 
monitoring of the Company’s existing 
risks and the identification of any 
new and emerging risks facing the 
Company, including financial and 
non-financial matters. It also requires 
the ongoing management of the 
appropriateness of the risk mitigation 
in place.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, the directors have 
assessed the Company’s prospects 
over the longer term, addressing a 
period of five years. A key part of 
the directors’ assessment was the 
budget and forecast carried out in 
December 2016 which reviewed the 
longer term viability of the Company. 
The review assessed the Company’s 
position and progress against its 
four strategic focus areas including 
generating free cash flow, shareholder 
return, growth and social responsibility. 
The strategic focus areas are set out 
on page 20. In addition, the Company 
considered the potential impact on 
its principal risks, and also considered 
how its appetite for risk might affect 
the assessment. The review includes 
the Company’s strategic objectives, 
business model and its prospects 
over the coming five years to 
December 2021.
The review, which included the 
presentation and approval of the 
budget, received board approval 
and formed the basis of an investor 
presentation which was released 
on 1 February 2017. The financial 
forecasts used in the review included 
key assumptions about gold price, 
future production levels, operating 
and capital costs, cash flows and the 
group’s balance sheet and shareholder 
returns. The operational forecasts 
included mining and process plant 
throughput levels, grades and 
metallurgical recovery rates. 
The operation at Sukari has a low 
cost-per-ounce of production 
compared with other operating mines, 
which contributes to the Company’s 
longer term viability.
Integral to the long term viability 
of the Company is the Company’s 
resource and reserves (“R&R”) and 
details of Sukari’s R&R can be found 
on the Company’s website. The R&R 
statements are supported by technical 
reports (including the published 
TSX compliant NI 43-101) which are 
developed in consultation with external 
experts and combine geological, 
metallurgical and economic data.
The budget process, which pulls 
heavily on the R&R data, include key 
assumptions related directly to our 
significant risks, our strategy and risk 
appetite and are summarised below:
• gold price assumptions: 
management time and focus 
is applied to ensure a low cost 
operation, which helps Sukari remain 
profitable, even in a relatively 
low gold price environment. 
The strategic decision to remain 
un-hedged means the Company 
benefits fully in a strong gold price 
environment. In a weaker gold price 
environment, the commitment 
to cost control helps ensure 
business continuity; 
• commodity assumptions: based 
on forecast prices, fuel represents 
approximately 20% of our 
operational costs and is therefore a 
significant commodity assumption 
in both the budget process and 
development of the R&R. This can 
therefore materially affect the cost 
base of the business; and
• production assumptions: Sukari is 
a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week 
operation with an estimated plant 
throughput capacity is 11.75Mtpa 
(12Mtpa from 2018). The process 
plant recovery rates are estimated 
to average at 89.7% in 2017. 
Maintaining and improving 
productivity is fundamental to our 
business and long term strategy.
Although the business does prepare 
plans over a longer time horizon, 
notably in the Sukari life of mine 
models, the Company chose five years 
for its viability statement and carried 
out the review in December 2016 
based on this time horizon.
In preparing budgetary information 
and forecasts, the group considers 
the principal risks and wider corporate 
and operational risks. Of the principal 
risks identified on pages 32 to 35, 
those with the most potential to 
impact negatively upon the Company’s 
ongoing viability include the gold 
price, the relationship with its joint 
venture partner, political risk and the 
ongoing litigation in Egypt. A sensitivity 
analysis was carried out on the key 
inputs to the financial and operational 
forecasts, including sensitivity analysis 
on the average gold price.
The investor presentation, together 
with the latest presentations can be 
viewed on the Company’s website 
which contain the latest up-to-date 
operational and financial information.
The management team also considers 
strategic, operational and compliance 
risks throughout the year and produces 
the following reports and documents 
for the board and audit and risk 
committee review to support it in 
making the formal viability statement:
• operational risk assessment register 
and corporate risk matrix;
• annual impairment review;
• going concern review;
• life of mine model;
• business continuity planning; and
• monthly and annual budgets.
On the basis of all the procedures 
outlined above, the directors confirmed 
on the date of this report that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the five-year period of 
their assessment. Centamin plc

Principal risks
Centamin takes a number of measures to mitigate risks associated with its underlying operational and exploration activity 
which are monitored and evaluated regularly. Due to the nature of these inherent risks, it is not possible to give absolute 
assurance that mitigating actions will be wholly effective.

STRATEGIC RISK
Single project dependency
Neutral The Sukari Gold Mine currently constitutes Centamin’ s main mineral resource and 
sole mineral reserve and near term production and revenue. The resource in Burkina 
Faso is not currently of a sufficient size to convert into a reserve.
Until further production growth beyond Sukari is identified the potential impact 
remains high and safeguarding the project is paramount to the Company.
Sukari Gold Mine: the project at Sukari has two distinct ore 
sources (open pit and underground), the processing plant has 
two separate flotation circuits and two separate power stations. 
Whilst one project, the nature of the design of the plant provides 
adequate mitigation and reduces the relative likelihood of 
dependence compared to a single layer plant design. The second 
circuit of the process plant has been fully operational for over 
twelve months which shows the resilience of the project. 
In addition, the plant is fed by both the open pit and underground 
operation, providing high and lower grade ore to the processing 
plant. Operational activity and production is expected to continue 
at above nameplate capacity. Other mitigating factors, outside 
the single project at Sukari, include the continued focus on longer 
term growth and expansion through exploration and acquisition 
targets both inside and outside of Egypt.
T o develop a well-balanced project pipeline,  
with potential to add incremental shareholder 
value by increasing production across the group. 
The regional exploration of the licence portfolio 
in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire continues.

INTERNAL STRATEGIC RISK
Sukari Gold Mine joint venture risk 
and relationship with EMRA 
Neutral Whilst Centamin retains control over the project, the joint venture holding 
company, Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”), is jointly owned with EMRA with equal board 
representation from both parties. The board of SGM operates by way of simple 
majority. As such, should the board of SGM be unable to reach consensus on a 
matter requiring board level approval or in the event of any dispute that may arise 
which can’t otherwise be amicably resolved, arbitration or other proceedings may 
need to be employed to resolve any disputes.
The successful management of the Sukari Gold Mine is in part dependent on 
maintaining a good working relationship with EMRA. The group has regular 
meetings with officials from EMRA and invests time in liaising with relevant ministry 
and other governmental representatives.
Maintaining relations: a key milestone was achieved this 
year, with the commencement of profit sharing with EMRA. 
Managing timing and quantum of payment of regular profit share 
payments, as well as applying and interpreting certain provisions 
of the Concession Agreement, is important in ensuring a good 
relationship with EMRA. Future expenditure and recovery of 
qualifying capital expenditure will also need to be managed, to be 
appropriately cost recovered by the Company.
Maintaining good relations with EMRA is a key 
objective of the Company which is achieved 
through co-operation, regular meetings and 
correspondence with EMRA, as well as making 
sure that the terms and conditions of the 
Concession Agreement governing the mine 
are fully complied with.

EXTERNAL STRATEGIC RISK
Gold price and currency exposure 
Neutral The extent of the Company’ s financial performance is due in part to the price of 
gold, which the Company has no influence over. Revenues from gold sales are 
in US dollars and Centamin has exposure to costs in other currencies including 
Egyptian pounds, Australian dollars and sterling.
Centamin manages its exposure to gold price by keeping operating costs as low 
as possible. 
The group is 100% exposed to the gold price, however, the cash 
costs of the Sukari gold project remain low compared with the 
industry norm. 
The Company does not currently hedge against 
the price of gold or exposure to currencies.

Jurisdictional taxation exposure 
Neutral The group’ s corporate structure includes operational activity in Egypt and West 
Africa held through holding companies in Australia and the United Kingdom. 
Exposure to changing cross jurisdictional tax legislation could have an adverse effect 
of the Company’ s ability to repatriate revenues. 
Tax exposure: the group engages tax advisers to provide local 
advice at an operational level as well as corporate and structuring 
advice at a corporate level.
T o minimise the complexity of the corporate

EXTERNAL STRATEGIC RISK
Political risk – Sukari
Neutral The Company’ s operational activities are primarily in Egypt a country which has been 
subject to civil and military disturbance. Future political and economic conditions 
in Egypt could change with future governments adopting different policies that 
may impact the development and ownership of mineral resources. Policy changes 
and licensing may also impact the use of explosives, tenure of mineral concessions, 
taxation, royalties, exchange rates, environmental protection, labour relations, 
repatriation of income and capital. Changes may also impact the ability to import 
key supplies and export gold.
The potential for serious impact should be balanced against the Egyptian 
government’ s support of Centamin’ s investment and contribution to both revenue 
and development of the mining industry. New laws have been introduced to protect 
and therefore encourage foreign investment which is a positive step for the country. 
Law no. 32 has been confirmed by Parliament, although it remains subject to a 
challenge in the Supreme Court.
The Concession Agreement with EMRA and the Egyptian 
government, was declared into Egyptian Law no. 222 of 1994 
which further protects the Company’ s licence rights and sets the 
applicable tax regime for a number of years. This law received full 
parliamentary approval as required by Egyptian law.
Maintain a detailed understanding of the political 
environment in which we operate as well as a 
constructive relationships with government.

Failure to achieve  
production estimates
Improved Centamin prepares annual estimates for future gold production from the Sukari Gold 
Mine. There can be no assurance that Centamin will achieve its production estimates 
and such failure could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’ s future 
cash flows, profitability, results of operations and financial condition. It should be 
specifically noted that the potential quantity and grade from the Sukari underground 
mine is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient exploration to define a 
mineral resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target 
being delineated as a mineral resource.
The realisation of production estimates are dependent on, 
amongst other things: the accuracy of mineral reserve and 
resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding 
ore grades and recovery rates; the ore tonnes and grade 
mined from the underground operation which are outside the 
current reserve base; ground conditions, skilled and motivated 
labour force, processing capacity and maintenance policies 
and logistics for consumables and parts. Whilst there can be 
no certainties, production to date has provided confidence in 
management’ s estimation and mine planning methods and with 
the fully operational expanded processing plant, the prospect of 
improvements in reliable forecasting is increased.

EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK
Litigation
Neutral Centamin’ s finances, and its ability to operate in Egypt, may be severely adversely 
affected by current and any future litigation proceedings and it is possible that 
further litigation could be initiated against Centamin at any time. Centamin is 
currently involved in litigation that relates both to (a) the validity of its exploitation 
lease at Sukari and (b) the price at which it can purchase Diesel Fuel Oil.
In order to mitigate this risk Centamin has a) taken appropriate 
legal advice and continues actively to pursue its legal rights with 
respect to its existing cases (its legal advisers believe that Centamin 
will ultimately be successful in both of these cases); and b) actively 
monitors activity in both court and local media for signs of any 
legislative or similar developments that may threaten its operations, 
finances or prospects. The potential for serious impact should 
be balanced against Centamin’ s adherence to local laws and 
agreements; the Egyptian government’ s support of Centamin’ s 
investment; Law no. 32 of 2014 that should protect Centamin 
against litigation by third parties; and the fact that Egypt and 
Australia (PGM’ s place of incorporation) have in place a bilateral 
investment treaty.
T o minimise exposure to litigation and reduce 
the impact of actions by complying with all 
relevant laws and regulations and to defend 
and/or bring any actions necessary to protect  
the Company’ s assets, rights and reputation.

Dear shareholders
I am presenting this report in my 
capacity as chairman of the health, 
safety, environmental and sustainability 
(“HSES”) committee, a committee of 
the board of Centamin plc.
The committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the board 
on all matters in connection with issues 
of the environment, workplace health 
and safety, and the development 
of sustainable engagement with 
communities and stakeholders.
During the year, the HSES committee 
worked closely with management on 
the following matters:
• review of monthly and quarterly 
reporting on corporate sustainable 
development issues and initiatives;
• develop and implement HSES 
policies in Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire;
• complete existing community 
initiatives at Sukari and the 
neighbouring town, Marsa Alam;
• steer community initiatives in 
Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire; and
• review of environmental, 
health, safety and emergency 
planning issues.
The committee assisted in progressing 
the segregation and removal of 
material in the scrap yard at Sukari. 
The committee was also encouraged 
by the level of training undertaken at 
Sukari, with many employees achieving 
certification following tailored training 
programmes in the following areas:
• fire safety training;
• emergency response training; and
• hygiene standards.
The wellbeing of our employees 
is a priority for Centamin and the 
committee will continue to ensure 
that health and workplace safety 
remain at the top of the agenda. 
One of our main priorities is for each 
employee to return home safely at the 
end of each day having worked in a 
zero-harm environment. 
The greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting required by Schedule 7 of the 
Large and Medium-Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 as amended by the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 
2013, only applies to UK incorporated 
quoted companies. Centamin has, 
however, provided information 
relating to this legislation in this CSR 
report as part of its commitment to 
environmental issues.
The report below covers the key HSES 
issues for Sukari and concludes with 
information relating to the exploration 
activity in West Africa.

(chairman), Mark Bankes and Edward 
Haslam, all of whom are independent 
directors of the Company. Kevin 
Tomlinson previously served on the 
committee prior to his resignation in 
May 2016.
Health and safety
Centamin is committed to minimising 
health and safety risks to a reasonably 
practical level, while striving for a 
zero-harm and productive workplace. 
We have designed and implemented 
systems, procedures and measures to 
manage occupational health and safety 
risks. These systems are implemented 
in full conformity with local legislation, 
licence and permit conditions, as well 
as taking account of international best 
practice standards.
In 2016, we were able to reduce the 
MTIFR further and we continue to strive 
for an injury-free environment and 
maintained low LTIF rates.
Safety conscious culture
We believe that safety is the 
responsibility of all employees and 
thus pursue the development of a 
safety conscious culture in our sites 
where safety is fully embedded across 
all operations and activities. We do 
this by empowering employees, giving 
them responsibility for their wellbeing 
as well as the safety of the colleagues 
they work alongside. Through training, 
coaching and leading by example, our 
employees are fully aware of the safety 
requirements and standards expected.
CASE STUDY: INTERACTIVE 
COMMUNICATION MECHANISMS
Continuous communication is 
maintained with employees regarding 
HSES through several channels. The tool 
box talks are an effective and easy 
method of safety communication. 
The talk provides an environment for 
interactive discussion and promotes 
a safety conscious culture. This timely 
communication addresses numerous 
safety aspects and supplements formal 
training. Other forms of communication 
include safety meetings, daily pre-shift 
meetings as well as safety alerts.
The Company is committed to 
continuously training the employees 
through comprehensive safety training 
and coaching programmes, including:
• a tailored safety induction for new 
employees, contractors and visitors;
• incident investigation and hazard 
identification and job hazard analysis 
and risk assessments;
• safety-specific training modules 
addressing work permits and 
procedures involved, first aid, 
fire extinguishing, and
• technical competence tuition, 
such as isolation training, lifting 
procedures, confined space entry, 
hot work and working at height.
Training is repeated regularly through 
refresher courses and employees are 
all tested to ensure a high level of 
understanding and application. The 
training is undertaken by the onsite 
HSES department. Mandatory training 
is rolled out for all departments, 
encompassing area-specific training, 
field training and coaching. 
Proactive approach and 
emergency response planning
The HSES team onsite prepare 
and train to respond quickly to 
emergencies. We have developed 
a detailed emergency plan with full 
response and rescue procedures 
for different potential risk scenarios. 
The plan is coupled with emergency 
arrangements for different areas of 
the operation.
Risk assessment is integral to all 
operational activities onsite and we 
continuously evaluate potential and 
actual hazards, their probability and 
likely outcomes, to determine the level 
of risk and appropriate risk mitigation 
and safeguards. A variety of different 
procedures and systems have been 
developed and implemented including 
job hazard analysis for new and 
non-recurrent activities.
We undertake emergency drills to test 
our performance and our equipment. 
In 2016, we undertook 27 emergency 
drills covering different risk scenarios to 
test our emergency response, rescue 
and evacuation capabilities.
An inspection and maintenance 
programme is implemented to ensure 
all emergency response equipment is 
fit for use at all times.
CASE STUDY: BEING ALERT AND READY
Creating and maintaining a qualified 
emergency team is an essential 
element of emergency preparedness. 
At Sukari, we have structured a very 
competent response and rescue team 
to be immediately mobilised in case 
of emergency situations. The team 
has received ample training and was 
coached for twelve months by a resident 
emergency response expert. The 
capacity building programme includes 
theoretical and practical training as well 
as drills to simulate different emergency 
situations. The team is equipped with the 
required response equipment, supplies 
and rescue facilities. A training plan is 
implemented to ensure full competence 
of the team. The team implements a 
programme for routine inspection of 
emergency equipment and supplies and 
conducts random emergency drills to 
test the emergency response elements 
and check their effectiveness. 
Contractor management 
All contractors operating onsite are 
required to adhere to the implemented 
safety management system, whether 
they work for long periods of time or 
for short assignments. Currently there 
are around 519 permanent contractors 
at Sukari.
We provide and share information with 
our contracting teams, in support of 
our compliance and safety procedures. 
Contractors are provided with a 
standard health and safety induction 
pack upon their arrival at site and given 
full access to onsite health services. Centamin plc

Tracking safety performance and 
safety performance indicators 
A core element of our management 
system is to assess our safety 
performance and identify areas for 
improvement. The evaluation of 
our safety performance is essential 
to indicate the effectiveness of 
our systems and controls and to 
identify opportunities for continuous 
improvement. In that regard, we have 
monitoring systems in place for:
• workplace and occupational 
health parameters;
• occupational health parameters 
to detect health impacts due to 
work-related matters;
• fitness to work to detect personnel 
under the influence of alcohol or 
illegal drugs;
• implementation of safety procedures 
and standards to ensure they are 
assimilated and adhered to; and 
• stability of structures to detect 
any potential movement, cracks 
or other instabilities. 
Monitoring methodology includes 
measurements, medical surveillance, 
auditing and visual inspection, as well 
as systematic observation of the work 
and behaviour of staff. Measurements 
are performed through in-house 
capabilities as well as third-party 
entities. Reactive or responsive 
evaluation is also undertaken to 
investigate and analyse incidents 
and to identify root causes to help 
implement corrective measures. 
The information collated from these 
processes is reported to the committee 
on a monthly and quarterly basis.
All employees and contractors 
are required to report all hazards, 
near-misses and incidents for 
investigation and analysis. This 
embodies the principles adopted by 
the HSES policies and procedures that 
everyone shares and contributes in a 
responsible manner to creating a safe 
working environment.
CASE STUDY: EMPLOYEE  
WELLBEING AT SUKARI
Apart from all control measures adopted 
in operations, Sukari has a well-equipped 
clinic providing health and emergency 
related services 24 hours a day and 
seven days a week. A doctor and 
qualified nurse manage the clinic and 
provide professional services in normal 
and emergency conditions. A medical 
evacuation scheme MEDIVAC is in place 
supported by first aid facilities, as well 
as an ambulance for transportation to 
the nearest hospital. The clinic also 
provides guidance to employees for 
fatigue management. The clinic assesses 
and provides advice to help improve 
fitness levels. In addition, Sukari has a 
comprehensive health insurance scheme 
that covers almost all regions in Egypt. 
The scheme extends to members of the 
employee family.

Health and wellbeing
We pay the utmost attention to the 
wellbeing of our employees and 
their protection from exposure to 
occupational health risks. We provide 
protective measures and equipment 
for different operations ensuring the 
equipment is appropriate for the 
working conditions.
Medical tests, including blood analysis, 
are conducted regularly, particularly 
for laboratory personnel and those 
working with chemicals and metals. 
In 2016, the following tests and 
measurements were also carried out 
and the outcomes were as follows:
• internal health and hygiene audits 
confirmed the results were within 
acceptable limits;
• water quality sampling and analyses 
carried out by an external laboratory 
confirmed no major anomalies; and
• work environment monitoring and 
personal exposure levels recorded 
no anomalies and confirmed 
that Sukari was compliant with 
required standards.
Our health programme has a special 
focus on food safety and hygiene, 
given we have a large mess that 
provides meals to about 1,500 
employees and contractors per day. 
We employ in-house health and 
hygiene officers who supervise food 
safety and undertake inspection 
and auditing on all components of 
the system. Periodic external audits 
are also undertaken. In 2016, the 
programme yielded very satisfactory 
results and a higher level of hygiene 
was achieved and maintained. 
Our employees and contractors
Our people are core to the success 
of our business. We are committed 
to attracting, energising, developing 
and retaining a highly skilled and 
experienced workforce. 
The Company’s activities provide direct 
and indirect employment, training and 
work experience for many Egyptian 
employees. Our workforce has 
witnessed considerable growth since 
we started production in 2010, both 
in terms of the number of employees 
and the range of skills and expertise of 
our workforce.
In Egypt, we employ 1,341 people of 
whom 95% are Egyptian. The remaining 
5% are experienced expatriate 
mining professionals, which is well 
below the 10% maximum expatriate 
limit mandated by Egyptian law. 
Approximately 50% of our Egyptian 
nationals are from Upper Egypt, the 
area where Sukari is situated, which 
typically has less economic activity than 
the more prosperous areas around the 
Nile Delta.
Only 1% of our Egyptian workforce are 
women and they work in the group’s 
office in Alexandria. This is mainly 
because social conditions in Egypt 
and in the Middle East in general do 
not encourage the work of female 
employees in remote sites away from 
their families. 
Modern mining requires a highly 
skilled workforce. Egypt does not 
have a developed mining industry, 
therefore technical skills must be 
developed onsite. Centamin provides 
employees with the highest level of 
training on the latest technologies 
and international standards of best 
practice. By co-ordinating with the 
Egyptian Universities we are able to 
enhance the level of education in 
mining-related fields.
The table below sets out the number of people employed by the group  
(excluding contractors) by country, during the years stated:

Human resources principles
Our recruitment procedures and 
standards are innovative and target 
those who will have not only the 
relevant competence, skills and 
qualifications, but who have potential 
for growth and development and could 
integrate within a large team working 
in a remote area. Our human resources 
policy provides the framework within 
which we operate. It delineates the 
rights, obligations and benefits for 
employees. Our policies ensure:
• all employees have the same 
rights and obligations and there 
is no discrimination based on 
religious grounds, nationality or 
political views;
• employment decisions, such as 
hiring and promotion are based on 
the ability of a person to perform 
the job in question, without regard 
to personal characteristics that 
are unrelated to the inherent job 
requirements;
• harassment of employees by anyone 
and in any way is not tolerated;
• any practices of forced and 
compulsory labour are not allowed 
in any work related to our activities;
• all employees are entitled to a safe 
healthy work environment, and each 
employee is accountable for HSES 
performance in the Company;
• child or forced labour is prohibited, 
whether in our permanent 
employment or in contractors’ 
workforces; and
• we are committed to the highest 
ethical standards and behaviours 
as firmly rooted in our code of 
conduct. The code secures the 
adherence to set principles and 
promotes confidence in the integrity 
of the Company.
Contractors are required by their 
agreements to abide by these 
requirements, and follow-up checks 
are carried out to establish that our 
conditions are met.
We expect all employees to 
uphold our core values of honesty 
and integrity. All employees are 
encouraged to treat their fellow 
colleagues with respect, dignity and 
common courtesy. All employees 
are required to understand and act 
in accordance with the Company’s 
requirements and to fully integrate 
within the work team. 
Annual performance appraisals 
are undertaken for all employees. 
The appraisal covers several areas 
including the employee’s job 
knowledge, skills attained during the 
year, quality of work, initiative and 
innovation. The appraisal is undertaken 
by the immediate supervisor and the 
performance is agreed with the section 
head. The process also identifies 
the need for training or coaching, 
modification of responsibilities or 
opportunities to undertake more 
challenging roles and responsibilities.
Capacity building and development 
We actively invest in securing the full 
spectrum of skills and competencies 
needed for effective operations. 
We adopt a development plan for 
each position to enhance skills and 
qualifications for the Egyptian staff to 
become a workforce of international 
repute in the mining industry.
We work with all our employees closely 
and encourage those who show 
keenness and desire to develop new 
personal skills and experience. External 
training is arranged either onsite or 
abroad. Special training programmes 
are designed for database, software 
and surveying with distant learning 
and support opportunities. 
We value regular communication and 
feedback from employees which help 
enhance the efficiency, effectiveness 
and safety of everyday activities and 
overall operational performance.
Recreational facilities onsite
In addition to creating a positive 
work environment, the Company 
believes it is important that employees 
enjoy their time before and after 
work. The majority of our staff live in 
the Sukari camp, and thus we have 
invested in a variety of leisure facilities 
such as playing fields, a gymnasium, 
a library, internet access and satellite 
television. Special barbecue dinners are 
also held at the beach or around Sukari 
and sports tournaments are regularly 
organised. Sukari has also arranged 
accommodation complexes outside 
the site in Marsa Alam city centre. 
The environment
Our HSES policy outlines our 
commitment to environmental 
responsibility. One of Centamin’s core 
values is to minimise the environmental 
impact and risk of an incident 
from its operations to a reasonably 
practical level. We remain committed 
to maintaining, and whenever 
possible exceeding, the high level 
of environmental performance that 
we achieved in 2016.
An environmental and social impact 
assessment was prepared as part of 
the project feasibility study at Sukari. 
We strive to maintain high standards of 
environmental performance. We meet, 
and where possible, exceed relevant 
legal requirements. The system is 
supported by a robust documentation 
system that ensures the maintenance 
of required registers, documents 
and renewal of required permits. 
The environmental management 
scheme for the Sukari Gold Mine 
includes a monitoring programme 
designed to evaluate compliance 
with environmental laws, regulations, 
Company policies and international 
best practice. The system covers waste 
management; material, water and 
energy management; management of 
hazardous substances and chemicals 
and biodiversity management.

Maintaining an environmentally 
responsible culture
Employees are made aware of their 
environmental responsibilities and 
relevant procedures through a number 
of means. We maintain an established 
programme of environmental training 
and awareness. The programme 
addresses different environmental 
fields including chemical management; 
waste management; emissions 
and water conservation, as well as 
general environmental management 
practices. Other forms of awareness are 
undertaken through meetings and tool 
box talks.
Resource management
Systems and procedures are in place 
to ensure efficient and safe handling 
of material used at the mine including 
chemicals and hazardous materials.
Risk assessments are carried out for 
handling and usage of all chemicals 
and hazardous materials. Controls 
include containment, automatic alarms 
and shut-off systems. Preventative 
maintenance programmes for 
tanks and equipment are also in 
place. Our emergency response 
system includes spill prevention 
and response measures.
We fully acknowledge the importance 
of managing chemicals in a sound 
manner so as to minimise harm to 
the environment and the health of 
employees. Hazard communication 
and chemical management handling 
are a core components of our training 
programme and our continuous 
education system. The systems in place 
ensure safe transportation, storage, 
labelling and handling of chemicals.
Water management and 
groundwater protection
Water is a crucial input for our 
processes and therefore it is essential 
to secure and maintain a sustainable 
water supply for our operations. In an 
area with limited fresh water resources, 
we rely on a sea water intake and 
pipeline from the Red Sea to provide a 
sustainable water supply to the mine. 
As a secondary source of water, we 
have beach wells where sea water 
infiltrates through the soil. We have 
desalination plants for generating fresh 
water for the process plant and for 
domestic use.
The sea water pumped to site is used, 
and then recycled throughout the 
process plant ensuring optimum usage 
of this resource. This is undertaken 
through an internal recycling system 
where different water streams are 
deployed in closed-loop systems 
to reduce consumption as much as 
possible. We strictly monitor our water 
use and strive to adopt measures for 
efficient use of water.
In 2016, we used a total of 
8,742,685m
3
 with a reduction of 10% 
compared to 2015 (9,743,584m
3
). 
About 99.5% of the water consumed at 
Sukari is sea water, which has no impact 
on fresh water resources.
Desalinated water used in the camps 
and offices is tested for chemical and 
bacteriologic parameters. Bottled 
water (used for drinking) is also 
periodically tested to ensure supplier 
standards and storage procedures are 
maintained. All samples are compliant 
with Egyptian legal requirements.

Water management and 
groundwater protection continued
Groundwater protection measures 
have been incorporated in the design 
of the tailing storage facility and other 
components where a layer of gypsum 
and a HPDE liner are used to prevent 
seepage. Workshops have concrete 
working areas to prevent seepage. 
We monitor groundwater quality 
through monitoring bores downstream 
from the tailing storage facility to 
detect any potential contamination. 
In 2016, the monitoring of these 
bores showed no contamination.
CASE STUDY: RECOVERING  
VALUE FROM WASTE
At Sukari, we believe that waste has a 
value that must be recovered to the most 
practically feasible extent. In that respect:
• waste oil is recovered from oily filters 
before disposal, waste oil is recycled 
offsite within a national system; 
• food waste is transported offsite to 
our neighbouring Bedouins to use as 
animal fodder;
• spent chemical solutions are recycled 
in the process plant after appropriate 
treatment; 
• empty plastic containers are cleaned 
and used as waste baskets all over 
the site; and
• discarded timber is used to make 
benches at the site and in Marsa 
Alam streets. 
Energy
Marsa Alam, the region in which 
the Sukari Gold Mine is located, is a 
remote area with no direct connection 
to any power grid. The city has its 
own power plant whose capacity is 
only sufficient for residential use, not 
industrial needs.
Consequently, the project at 
Sukari powers the entire processing 
plant through its own onsite 
diesel power station.
In 2016, Sukari consumed a total of 
141,346,040 litres of diesel, an increase 
of 8% from 130,687,478 litres in 2015. 
About 65% of this quantity is used 
in power generation and the rest is 
used in operating mobile equipment 
and vehicles.
Calculation of the direct greenhouse 
gases (“GHG”) emissions is based 
on the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. 
In 2016, the Sukari Gold Mine 
consumed 397,568
(1)
 tonnes of CO
2
 
to produce 551,036 ounces of gold. 
The emissions intensity for 2016 was 
0.72 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent per 
ounce of gold produced. The figures 
show an increase in the efficiency of 
energy utilisation in 2016 compared 
to 2015, which in turn reduced the 
emissions intensity for 2016.
A review of alternative fuel sources to 
supply the processing plant is ongoing, 
but to date there have been no 
viable alternatives. Sukari has started 
to use solar energy in its new 
camp expansions.
Emissions, effluents and wastes
Systems and procedures are in place 
for the sound management of different 
environmental aspects including 
emissions, effluents, non-process 
waste, waste rock and tailings. 
The system is based on setting annual 
plans, development of documented 
procedures and standards, awareness 
and training of employees and 
monitoring of performance to 
achieve further improvement. 
All our industrial wastewater streams 
are recycled within the process. 
Sewage is treated in a tertiary 
wastewater treatment plant and the 
treated water is used in landscaping. 
Periodic inspections are conducted on 
the treated wastewater and monitoring 
is undertaken for its effluent.

Our monitoring activities in 2016 
confirmed that we remained within 
legal requirements and international 
best practice standards in respect of 
the following areas:
• ambient air quality in the camp area 
(in terms of dust and emissions);
• dust concentration in different 
work areas;
• noise and illumination;
• work environment emissions, 
including carbon monoxide, 
sulphur dioxide and ammonia;
• stack emissions due to 
fuel combustion;
• quality of treated wastewater; and
• quality of groundwater.
The waste management system in place 
at Sukari, Egypt includes procedures for 
the handling, storage and disposal of 
waste. The system is focused on:
• waste minimisation through 
different measures to reduce 
generation of waste;
• maximising onsite recycling and 
reuse of different types of wastes;
• recovery of valuable material from 
the waste;
• reuse of treated wastewater streams; 
and
• disposal of discarded material in an 
environmentally acceptable manner.
We maintain a salvage area where 
valuable waste is temporarily stored 
until transferred offsite or recycled in 
different areas onsite. A key focus for 
the committee has been improving 
the rate at which waste material is 
transferred offsite or recycled and 
this is an ongoing task.
Biodiversity
Centamin is committed to protecting 
the wildlife unique to the eastern 
desert by minimising the impact of our 
operations on the environment. We 
are conscious that the sea near Sukari 
is renowned for its crystal clear water, 
and includes a variety of coral reefs and 
marine biota. The desert environment 
is characterised by its scarce terrestrial 
biodiversity resources, and the area 
of Marsa Alam also includes the Wadi 
El-Gemal protectorate, one of Egypt’s 
largest environmental protectorates, 
with about 100km of pure beach and 
desert landscapes.
Biodiversity conservation principles 
were integrated into the project design 
for Sukari from the outset and are 
applied to all of our activities.
There were no incidents reported of 
negative impact on wildlife as a result 
of operations at Sukari during 2016.
Land management and rehabilitation
We are committed to transferring 
Sukari into a stable and self-sustaining 
condition after closure. Due 
consideration will be given to 
environmental and social impacts 
to avoid long term challenges for 
neighbouring parties.
The planning for the closure of the 
mine aims to ensure that a physically 
and chemically stable landform is 
maintained, with minimal erosion 
and minimal potential for dust 
generation and that the hazards are 
reduced to levels equal to or below 
those naturally existing within the 
surrounding environment.
Our restoration and rehabilitation plan 
is updated each year to account for 
all components and activities within 
the mine. A provision for restoration 
and rehabilitation is included in the 
annual budget. The provision for future 
restoration costs is the best estimate 
of the present value of the expenditure 
required to settle the restoration 
obligations at the reporting date.
In addition to the long term 
rehabilitation plan, we undertake short 
term rehabilitation activities, especially 
for construction sites and for cleaning 
up minor spills.

Community and society
Centamin recognises that it has a 
responsibility to support and enhance 
the community in which it operates, 
and to minimise its impact on the 
environment and local people at every 
stage of its activities. We consider 
good community relations as a key 
component of continued operational 
success as well as a corporate 
requirement. We are committed to 
acting in a socially responsible manner 
at all times.
Stakeholder engagement
We nurture dialogue and build relations 
with the local community in areas 
in which we operate. We maintain 
open channels of communication 
with all our stakeholders. A public 
consultation system has been in 
place at Sukari since the project 
design phase, and during the 
construction phase. With mining in 
operation we have maintained open 
channels of communication with all 
our stakeholders for the purpose of 
information disclosure and for them 
to raise grievances or concerns. In 
providing these opportunities we have 
been pleased to find that, throughout 
2016, as in previous years, the Sukari 
Gold Mine continues to enjoy full 
support from the local community and 
government authorities.
Community development initiatives
In 2016, we have continued our 
support and contribution to community 
development in Marsa Alam and 
Red Sea area at large. Initiatives 
were designed and implemented to 
address community needs and were 
implemented where possible through 
full collaboration and co-ordination 
with local authorities, community 
groups and associations.
Infrastructure initiatives:
• provision of additional generators 
and related transformers to 
add 3.2MW to the Marsa Alam 
power station; 
• continuing to supply electricity to a 
neighbouring Bedouin settlement 
of circa 200 people; and 
• establishment of a children’s 
playground in Marsa Alam.
CASE STUDY: STRENGTHENING POWER 
GENERATION IN MARSA ALAM
Marsa Alam is not connected to the 
national grid for electricity but is supplied 
by power through a diesel power plant 
of capacity 5MW that is about 30 years 
old. The power plant is not adequate 
to the city needs or its future plans and 
development. Sukari supplied the power 
plant with additional generators to 
provide needed electricity. 
• Two generators with a combined 
capacity of 3.2MW were provided to 
the Marsa Alam power plant. 
• A further generator house was 
supplied and constructed.
• Training has been provided to the 
power station staff to operate and 
maintain the generators. 
Social involvement activities:
• organising a marathon along Marsa 
Alam and Edfu roads; 
• sponsoring local events and 
celebrations including the orphans’ 
day, police day and the environment 
day; and
• donation of equipment and furniture 
to local authorities in Marsa Alam. 
Enhancing education:
• training of 85 geology and 
engineering students at Sukari  
in the summer vacation; and
• organising field visits to Sukari for 
circa 1,040 students and officials.
Social welfare contributions:
• provision of food waste to 
neighbouring Bedouins for 
grazing purposes;
• financing surgery for Bedouins in 
the Marsa Alam hospital;
• financing daily iftars during 
Ramadan for unprivileged 
individuals in Marsa Alam; and
• distributing food at key 
community events.
Advanced exploration
Burkina Faso
The project lies in Batie, Noumbiel 
Province, in the south-west region of 
Burkina Faso. Batie is a town with a 
population of about 30,000 and has 
56 villages affiliated to it.
Education is one of the most important 
focus areas for the region where there 
is a need to create a more productive, 
higher skilled next generation of 
Burkinabes and help to build capacity 
beyond the lifespan of our activities in 
the region. The School Bike Project, 
for example, rewards academic 
performance and helps to empower 
communities and improve access to 
education for students who walk up 
to 10km each day to attend school.
Multiple water wells have been built 
in communities across the licence 
area to combat problems associated 
with poor water quality. This has an 
immediate impact on every part of 
village life and each well can serve up 
to 1,000 people’s basic daily needs. 
Part of our investment in this initiative 
goes into training village residents to 
maintain and repair the pumps and 
routinely check installations.

Integration of Company policies
The Company’s health, safety and 
environmental policies and standards 
have been integrated into the Batie 
operations where relevant. 
These include:
• provision of health services at camp;
• training and induction requirements;
• incident investigation and reporting 
requirements;
• internal communication mechanisms; 
• vehicle safety requirements;
• contractor management; and 
• code of conduct – anti-bribery policy

the clinic has a full-time paramedic. 
The camp is also equipped with an 
ambulance to transfer cases to the 
nearest medical centre in Batie or to 
hospital in Gauoa.
The clinic is accessible to employees 
at all times and provides quality health 
services with a particular focus on 
malaria. Through applying protective 
measures and through employee 
awareness programmes, the malaria 
frequency rate was 89 per 1,000 people 
in 2016 compared to the 180 per 1,000 
country frequency rate in Burkina Faso 
as a whole.
CASE STUDY: SUPPL Y OF STUDENTS’ BIKES
The local transportation in Batie and 
around the village is limited. Students in 
particular depend on cycling or walking 
to school. Centamin decided to provide 
bicycles to students to facilitate their 
daily commute and encourage and 
motivate them to study. The project 
was designed in co-operation with the 
education director of the Noumbiel 
province. 50 bicycles were given to the 
students with excellent achievements in 
their school year. Each student received 
a bicycle and a school bag together with 
school accessories. A ceremony was held 
for the occasion and executive officials 
from Batie and Noumbiel attended. 
The project received high recognition 
in the media as an initiative to support 
education and excellence. This project 
was very well received by the community 
and Centamin received requests to 
repeat it in the following years.
Our employees
In Burkina Faso, 95 people 
(90 nationals and five expatriate staff) 
were employed in 2016 and 95% 
of those employed are Burkinabe. 
The remaining 5% are experienced 
expatriate mining exploration 
professionals.
The current staff is composed of 
geologists (18 employees in total 
with the expatriate staff), field 
technicians, field technician assistants 
and the surveyor (30 employees) and 
administration staff, as well as other 
support staff (47 employees). 9% of 
our Burkina workforce are women who 
work in Ouagadougou as well as at the 
camp in Batie. 
Environment
An environmental impact assessment 
study (“EIA”) has been carried out 
in accordance with Burkina Faso 
legislation. Of particular note in 
connection with the EIA were the 
specific issues relating to the social 
environment and these were identified, 
as follows:
• relocation of communities 
directly impacted;
• relocation of cashew tree 
plantations;
• identification of sacred and 
religious sites;
• social acceptability and job creation;
• economic impact assessment; and
• community projects. 
The process of developing the EIA 
included a stakeholder consultation 
for the project and the associated 
relocation requirements. The proposed 
Batie project extends to villages and 
occupied areas and thus some farms, 
houses and public areas will need to be 
relocated. A relocation plan has been 
prepared taking account of the views 
expressed in the consultation including 
those of farmers, land owners and local 
chiefs. Local committees have been 
formed to follow up the process. With 
the further optimisation and design of 
the project, the relocation plan will be 
refined accordingly. 
An important component of 
exploration activities is the 
rehabilitation of sites. There are 
procedures to ensure the safe, 
stable and environmentally sound 
closure of pits and wells immediately 
after completion of works. Drilling 
contractors are required to implement 
such procedures at all their 
drilling sites. Centamin plc

Community and society
Stakeholder engagement remains a key 
element throughout the exploration 
and advanced exploration phase. This 
will become increasingly important as 
the Company proves the resource and 
is able to develop an operating mine in 
the region. Centamin, through its local 
subsidiaries, will continue to engage 
with the local community in relation to 
its projects in Batie.
Stakeholder engagement is undertaken 
through individual and group meetings 
to discuss concerns. These include:
• access to exploration lands;
• identification of sacred sites that 
must not be disturbed;
• compensation for removing trees 
or disturbing land; and
• conflict management.
Community development initiatives
Community development in 2016 
tackled several objectives including 
enhancing:
• education;
• health services; 
• social involvement; 
• livelihood ; and
• preparation of a community 
development plan with and for the 
communities covering the project 
areas, which will guide the Company 
community investment activities 
from 2018 onwards.
Enhancing education:
• initiating work to establish a primary 
school in Danhal.
Enhancing health services:
• supporting Batie medical centre 
through providing antivenins, 
running water, power access, 
analysis equipment, and financing 
hygiene services; and
• supporting Gauoa medical center 
through providing haematology 
equipment and beds and furniture.
Social involvement:
• sponsorship of a community 
development plan for the Batie 
mine project areas, which will be

Payments to governments
The Reports on Payments to 
Governments Regulations (the 
“Regulations”) came into force 
on 1 December 2014. Whilst the 
Regulations are part of UK law, 
they apply to the Company by virtue 
of its listing on the London Stock 
Exchange (pursuant to Disclosure 
and Transparency Rule 4.3A). 
The Regulations require companies 
active in the extractive industries 
to report any payments they have 
made to their host governments in 
the form of taxes, bonuses, royalties, 
fees and support for infrastructure 
payments. The Regulations implement 
Chapter 10 of the EU Accounting 
Directive. The Regulations are part of 
an EU-wide effort to curb corruption 
and promote transparency in the 
energy and extractives sector. Their 
stated objectives are to provide 
citizens of resource-rich countries with 
the information they need to hold 
their governments to account; and to 
provide greater insight (for investors 
and all other stakeholders) into how 
the sector operates and the range of 
economic contributions that can result.
The Regulations require disclosure 
of the following:
a) production entitlements;
b) taxes levied on the income, 
production or profits of companies, 
excluding taxes levied on 
consumption such as value added 
taxes, personal income taxes or 
sales taxes;
c) royalties;
d) dividends, other than dividends 
paid to a government as an ordinary 
shareholder unless they are paid 
in lieu of a production entitlement 
or royalty;
e) signature, discovery and 
production bonuses;
f) licence fees, rental fees, entry fees 
and other considerations for licences 
and/or concessions; and
g) payments for infrastructure 
improvements.
Where a payment or series of related 
payments do not exceed GBP86,000 
they do not need to be disclosed but, 
in the interests of transparency, the 
Company has included these costs.

Health and safety – Sukari
The Lost Time Injury Frequency 
Rate (“LTIFR”) for 2016 was 0.27 per 
200,000 man hours (2015: 0.12 per 
200,000 man hours), with a total of 
5,187,635 man hours worked during 
2016 (2015: 5,032,828). Continued 
development of the onsite health and 
safety culture has resulted in improved 
reporting of incidents.
Centamin remains committed to further 
improving health and safety during 
2017 towards our zero-harm target.
Open pit
The open pit delivered total material 
movement of 62.2Mt, an increase of 
8% on the prior year (2015: 57.8Mt). 
This increase was related to improved 
mining productivity and equipment 
utilisation. The strip ratio was 4.68, 
a reduction on 5.60 in 2015 as ore 
mining focused on the Stage 3A 
and 3B areas and the next stages of the 
northern and eastern walls of the open 
pit which progressed in line with the 
mine plan.
Ore production from the open pit 
was 10.95Mt at 0.93g/t, with an 
average head grade to the plant 
of 0.95g/t. The ROM ore stockpile 
balance decreased by 128kt to 577kt 
by the end of the year. Ore mining 
was primarily from the Stage 3A area, 
which provided access to higher-grade 
sulphide portions of the ore body 
during 2016.
In 2017 mining activities will be 
conducted in Stage 3 and Stage 4 
along with pioneering activities in 
Stage 5. Ore will be supplied from 
Stage 3B whilst developing the 
elevated benches from Stage 4. 
Expected ore mined is 10.7Mt at an 
average grade of 1.06g/t. The strip 
ratio is planned to be 5.23 during 
2017. During Q1 2017 the open pit 
is scheduled to develop a low-grade 
east wall cutback and planned gold 
production will be lower than Q4 2016.
Underground mine 
The underground mine produced 
1.02Mt of ore, a 12% decrease on 
2015 (1.16Mt). Ore from stoping 
accounted for 55% (0.56Mt) of the 
total, with the balance of ore (0.45Mt) 
from development. The average 
mined head grade was 9.0g/t, above 
our forecast. The average grade from 
stoping was 9.1g/t (an increase of 32% 
on 2015) and the average grade from 
development was 9.0g/t (an increase 
of 49% on 2015).
During the first quarter, higher tonnage 
and lower-grade stockwork stopes on 
the western contact and in the central 
zone were completed. Thereafter, 
stoping was carried out predominately 
from the eastern side of the deposit, 
where higher-grade mineralisation 
typically occurs in laminated quartz 
veins, with sulphide stockworks trailing 
out westward into the porphyry mass. 
This, together with local geotechnical 
variations, requires a narrower and 
more selective mining method, thus 
reducing the available tonnes per 
vertical metre. This has resulted 
in a higher average grade for the 
year, coupled with a slight reduction 
in productivity.
Underground development advanced 
7,880 metres, including progression of 
the Amun, Horus and Ptah declines. 
This development comprised 
4,557 metres in Amun and 3,323 
metres in Ptah.
The exhaust circuit for the Ptah decline 
was progressed, ensuring sufficient 
ventilation as the decline extends 
deeper into the ore body.
A total of 9,691 metres of grade control 
drilling were completed, aimed at 
short term mine planning and resource 
development. A further 25,670 metres 
of underground diamond drilling 
continued to test for reserve extensions 
below the current Amun and Ptah 
zones. A new exploration decline also 
commenced within the north-eastern 
Cleopatra zone of Sukari Hill. Further 
details and underground drilling results 
are discussed in the exploration section 
of this report.

Processing
The Sukari plant processed 11.56Mt of 
ore in 2016, a 9% increase on 2015 and 
5% above our base case of 11.0Mtpa, 
as forecast at the beginning of the 
year. Productivity continued to increase 
throughout the year, with 2.95Mt 
processed during the fourth quarter, 
reflecting the ongoing ramp up of the 
expanded circuit.
Metallurgical recovery averaged 89.4%, 
a 0.6% increase on 2015. Work is 
continuing to optimise the operational 
controls and improve circuit stability 
to ensure recoveries are maintained at 
approximately 90% at the increased 
rate of throughput. 
The dump leach operation produced 
9,872oz during the year.
The 2017 production guidance is 
based on a forecast production rate 
of 11.75Mt, with an annual average 
gold recovery of 89.75%. Grades 
are expected to show a rising trend 
throughout the year, starting the 
first quarter at 1.33g/t and rising to 
1.78g/t in the final quarter of the year, 
averaging 1.57g/t. An expansion of the 
secondary crusher system is planned 
during 2017, with an expected capital 
cost of US$6 million. This is expected 
in due course to increase the grinding 
capacity of Plant 1, and thus lead 
to further overall plant throughput 
increases to above 12Mtpa. Centamin plc

Drilling from underground remains 
a focus of the Sukari exploration 
programme as new development 
provides improved access to test for 
high-grade extensions of the deposit. 
The ore body remains open to the 
north, south and at depth and further 
underground drilling of the Sukari 
deposit will take place during 2017, 
from across the existing and planned 
areas of development.

Cleopatra exploration decline
The existing underground operations 
at Sukari have demonstrated that the 
western contact zone between the 
main porphyry and the surrounding 
metasedimentary rock units is highly 
prospective for high-grade gold 
mineralisation. This contact has limited 
drilling in the north-western portion 
of Sukari Hill, where the porphyry is 
approximately 300 metres wide and 
access for surface drill rigs is limited. 
High grades have been observed 
along the north-eastern flank of Sukari 
Hill, where an interpreted en-echelon 
set of three mineralised zones are 
located, namely Cleopatra, Julius and 
Antoine zones. Cleopatra outcrops 
as two distinct quartz veins on the 
north-eastern flank of Sukari Hill, 
whereas Julius and Antoine do not 
outcrop. The zones are interpreted as 
commencing on the eastern porphyry 
contact, dipping broadly to the west. 
This project is designed to commence 
development along strike within the 
upper Cleopatra zone and set up four 
drill sites in the centre of the porphyry. 
The drives will provide a large quantity 
of geological data in addition to that 
gained from the drilling. 
The initial project will be developed in 
two phases. Phase 1 has a projected 
cost of US$5 million, with 1,370 metres 
of development and 96,422 tonnes 
of mined material to be completed 
over a five-month period. Phase 1 
commenced during the third quarter, 
with the portal established and 
893 metres of development completed 
to year end 2016. This development 
produced 21,078 tonnes of low-grade 
mineralised material. The first drill 
cuddy has been established and 
exploration drilling commenced during 
December 2016. The initial target is 
a westerly-dipping dilation of stock 
work porphyry which is located on the 
eastern contact. 
Phase 2 has a projected cost of 
US$6.5 million, with 1,057 metres of 
development and 54,409 tonnes of 
mined material to be completed over 
a five-month period. Grade control 
diamond drilling has commenced for 
three proposed strike drives. 
The initial project is aimed at 
developing infrastructure with the 
capacity to support mining rates of 
up to 1Mtpa from this area. Ultimate 
production rates will depend on 
future results from the development, 
exploration drilling and further 
development. It will be in addition 
to the current underground ore 
production from the Amun and 
Ptah declines. Centamin plc

Côte d’Ivoire
Centamin has seven permits covering 
circa 2,334km
2
. Six of these are part 
of the Doropo Project across the 
border from Batie West in Burkina 
Faso and the other is in the west of 
the country. Eight permits are currently 
under application and, once these 
are awarded, exploration will focus 
on regional surface geochemistry 
and mapping aimed at identifying 
anomalies for first-pass drilling.
Drilling within the Doropo Project 
area gained momentum during 2016, 
with the fleet increasing from one to 
three rigs by the last quarter. The initial 
areas of focus is a 5km radius area, 
containing five prospects: Souwa, 
Nokpa, Kekeda, Han and Chegue. 
Systematic drill-testing of these 
prospects, together with infill drilling 
towards the end of the year, has led to 
a new discovery and a maiden resource 
of 0.3Moz at 1.6g/t indicated and 
1.0Moz at 1.3g/t inferred. This resource

At the Souwa prospect, mineralisation has been tested 
over a 1,700m strike length and 200m vertical depth. 
Several large high-grade mineralised shoots are hosted 
by a shallow-dipping shear zone.
Côte d’Ivoire continued
Exploration during 2016, including 
soil geochemistry, auger drilling 
and ground IP surveys, also 
provided evidence of higher-grade 
mineralisation on several other 
prospects (Dilly, Hinda, Atirré and 
Enioda). The Enioda prospect is 
believed to be the strike extension of 
the Napelepera mineralised structure, 
within Centamin’s Burkina Faso 
licences, as discussed below. 
Work in 2017 will focus on expanding 
and upgrading the initial resource, in 
addition to first-pass drilling on newly 
defined prospects. 
The Nokpa prospect hosts high-grade 
mineralisation from three cross 
cutting structures near a dyke swarm. 
It currently has a 150m diameter 
footprint, a shallow plunge along 
the fault plans and is open in 
all directions.

explore and drill-test the numerous 
targets along the 160km length of 
greenstone belt contained within our 
extensive 2,200km
2
 licence holding. 
Results from this programme will 
lead to further drilling and resource 
development during 2017. Exploration 
remains focused on developing new 
zones of near-surface and high-grade 
mineralisation, as defined by 
geochemical sampling, geophysical 
surveys and analysis of an in-house 
structural model.
Exploration during 2016 prioritised two 
main prospect areas, Wadaradoo and 
Napelapera. During 2016 there were 
164,333m of RC, 6,633m of diamond, 
69,370m of aircore and 27,810m of 
auger drilled. Drilling activities were 
scaled down during the second half 
of the year to allow for analysis of the 
assay results.
At Wadaradoo, drilling outlined both 
structurally-controlled mineralisation 
(Wadaradoo Main and Wadaradoo 
North) and broad disseminated zones 
of mineralisation (Wadaradoo East and 
Wadaradoo Far East). 
At Wadaradoo Main, high-grade north 
plunging shoots were identified on 
both the main 020° trending structure 
and 320° trending splay structures. 
These structures have all been drilled 
on a 50m x 50m or greater spacing and 
remain open at depth. At Wadaradoo 
North, mineralisation is hosted by a 
tightly confined, high-grade structure 
with narrow, more discontinuous zones 
in the hanging wall. Drilling during 
the year closed off this structure along 
strike and at depth. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW continued
Exploration is continuing at several other target areas, where major cross-cutting 
structures coincide with demagnetised and altered zones. This includes the 
Gongombili anticline (the southern continuity of the Wadaradoo main structure).

At Napelapera, our exploration licence holdings were extended to the 
Côte d’Ivoire border. Gold mineralisation at this prospect area is typically hosted 
within a broad alteration halo around the main structure. Cross-cutting structures 
‘compartmentalise’ the granodiorite host rock into broad dilation zones of 
higher-grade mineralisation along the main structural trend. This trend was drilled 
out to the south-west, where higher grades are observed, with drilling covering a 
strike length of over 4km. Mineralisation remains open at depth.

The Poni prospect on the Danhal permit consists of a narrow 600m length 
mineralised structure, which is open to the north and south and at depth. 
Initial drilling was conducted in early 2016. At Tiopolo, a small narrow 
mineralised structure has been identified over a strike length of 450m, with 
consistent mineralisation which is open along strike and at depth. Follow-up 
work is planned in these areas.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”) and adopted for use by 
the European Union and in accordance 
with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
The group financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Now in its seventh year of production, 
the Sukari Gold Mine remains highly 
cash generative and this is reflected in 
the group’s financial results for the year 
ended 31 December 2016:
• 2016 revenues of US$687.4 million 
were up 35% year-on-year with an 
8% increase in realised gold prices 
and a 25% increase in gold sales;
• cash costs decreased to US$513 per 
ounce produced from US$713 in 
2015, driven predominantly by the 
decrease in fuel price and other cost 
savings, as well as higher production 
than originally forecast;
• AISC of US$694 per ounce sold was 
below our forecast of US$720-750 
per ounce mainly due to the 
higher gold production base and 
the rescheduling of certain capital 
cost items;
• EBITDA increased by 145% to 
US$372.9 million, mainly due to 
higher gross operating margins 
as a result of the gold price and 
also a decreased production cost 
associated with net changes in 
production inventories;
• profit before tax increased by 357% 
to US$266.8 million, due to the 
factors above;
• earnings per share before profit share 
of 23.05 US cents were up 412% on 
4.51 US cents per share in 2015; and
• operational cash flow of 
US$366.3 million was 97% higher 
than 2015, due to the higher gold 
production base, gold prices and 
much lower cost base achieved.
The board of directors approved an 
interim 2016 payment of 2.00 US cents 
per share (versus a 2015 interim 
payment of 0.97 US cents per share). 
With the strong performance of our 
flagship asset and solid cash flows 
carrying through into the second 
half, a final dividend for 2016 of 
13.5 US cents per share has been 
proposed for approval at the AGM 
on 21 March 2017. This represents 
a full year pay-out of approximately 
US$178 million, which is equivalent 
to approximately 70% of our net free 
cash flow for 2016 and follows the 
update to our policy announced on 
9 January 2017.
Centamin remains committed to 
its policy of being 100% exposed 
to the gold price through its 
unhedged position, and maintained 
a healthy cash, bullion on hand, 
gold sales receivables and 
available-for-sale financial assets 
balance of US$428 million as at 
31 December 2016.
Centamin has continued to return strong earnings  
and cash flow generation.

Revenue
Revenue from gold and silver sales has 
increased by 35% to US$687.4 million 
(US$508.4 million in 2015), with an 
8% increase in the average realised 
gold price to US$1,256 per ounce 
(US$1,159 per ounce in 2015) assisted 
by a 25% increase in gold sold to 
546,630 ounces (437,571 ounces 
in 2015).
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents the cost of 
mining, processing, refinery, transport, 
site administration and depreciation 
and amortisation, and movement in 
production inventory. Cost of sales is 
inclusive of US$24.6 million in relation 
to disputed fuel charges (refer to 
note 12 to the financial statements for 
further information) and has decreased 
by 6% to US$389.3 million, as a 
result of:
(a) a 8% decrease in total 
mine production costs 
from US$314.8 million to 
US$288.3 million, despite a 5% 
increase in processed tonnes offset 
with a 7% decrease in mined tonnes 
as a result of improved operational 
efficiencies and lower overall cost; 
(b) a 14% increase in depreciation and 
amortisation from US$93.9 million 
to US$107.0 million due to higher 
production physicals, reclassification 
of exploration and evaluation 
expenditure to mine development 
and an increase in the associated 
amortisation charges; and
(c) a 179% decrease in movement in 
production inventories costs from 
US$7.5 million to (US$5.9) million.
Other operating costs
Other operating costs reported 
comprise expenditure incurred for 
communications, consultants, directors’ 
fees, stock exchange listing fees, share 
registry fees, employee entitlements, 
general office administration expenses, 
the unwinding of the restoration 
and rehabilitation provision, foreign 
exchange movements, the share 
of profit/loss in associates and the 
3% production royalty payable to 
the Egyptian government. Other 
operating costs increased by 16% 
to US$32.1 million, as a result of:
(a) a US$2.9 million increase in net 
foreign exchange movements 
from a US$2.1 million gain to a 
US$5.0 million gain; 
(b) a US$1.0 million decrease in 
corporate costs; 
(c) a US$5.4 million increase in royalty 
paid to the government of the ARE 
in line with the increase in gold sales 
revenue; and
(d) a US$2.5 million provision for 
stock obsolescence against stores 
inventory in Egypt.
Finance income
Finance income reported comprises 
interest revenue applicable on the 
Company’s available cash and term 
deposit amounts. The movements 
in finance income are in line with the 
movements in the Company’s available 
cash and term deposit amounts.
Profit before tax
As a result of the factors outlined 
above, the group recorded a profit 
before tax for the year ended 
31 December 2016 of US$266.8 million 
(2015: US$58.4 million). 
Tax
The group operates in several countries 
and, accordingly, it is subject to, the 
various tax regimes in the countries in 
which it operates.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share (after profit share) of 
18.61 US cents compare with 4.51 US 
cents in 2015. The increase was driven 
by the factors outlined above.
Comprehensive income
Other comprehensive income 
movement was the result of the 
revaluation of available-for-sale 
financial assets.  Centamin plc

FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
Financial position
At 31 December 2016, the group 
had cash and cash equivalents of 
US$399.9 million compared to 
US$199.6 million at 31 December 
2015. The majority of funds have been 
invested in international rolling short 
term higher interest money market 
deposits.
Current assets have increased 
by US$200.8 million or 55% to 
US$563.5 million, as a result of:
(a) an increase in net cash inflows of 
US$200.3 million (net of foreign 
exchange movements);
(b) a US$4.2 million decrease in stores 
inventory to US$102.3 million;
(c) a US$2.3 million decrease in 
prepayments;
(d) a US$1.1 million increase in gold 
sale receivables; and
(e) a US$5.9 million increase in overall 
mining stockpiles, gold in circuit 
levels and finished goods inventory 
values to US$34.2 million.
Non-current assets have decreased 
by US$29.1 million or 2.8% to 
US$1,023 million, as a result of:
(a) US$56.9 million expenditure for 
property, plant and equipment 
(comprising of plant and mining 
equipment and rehabilitation asset);
(b) US$107.0 million charges for 
depreciation and amortisation;
(c) US$49.6 million increase in 
exploration and evaluation assets, as 
a result of the drilling programmes in 
Sukari Hill, the Sukari tenement area, 
Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire; and
(d) a US$28.8 million decrease in 
prepayments due to the utilisation 
of the prior year cumulative advance 
payments made to EMRA.
Current liabilities are unchanged at 
US$54.5 million. Change in underlying 
balances include:
(a) US$4.9 million decrease in trade 
payables offset by a $5.8 million 
increase in accruals, primarily as a 
result of a $4 million EMRA accrual 
in trade payables and accruals;
(b) US$6.8 million decrease in tax 
liabilities that were settled during 
the year; and a 
(c) US$5.9 million increase in current 
provisions primarily driven by stock 
obsolescence and withholding tax 
provisions held at year end.
Non-current liabilities have increased 
by US$0.6 million to US$7.7 million 
as a result of an increase in the 
rehabilitation provision.
The value of issued capital has 
increased by US$1.9 million due to 
the vesting of awards.
Share option reserves reported 
have increased by US$0.6 million to 
US$3.0 million as result of the forfeiture 
and vesting of awards and the resultant 
transfer to accumulated profits and 
issued capital respectively, offset by 
the recognition of the share-based 
payments expense for the year.
Accumulated profits increased by 
US$168.7 million as a result of a:
(a) US$266.0 million profit for the year 
attributable to the shareholders of 
the Company; offset by
(b) US$46.1 million in dividend 
payments to external shareholders; 
comprising a US$22.9 million final 
dividend payment for 2015 and a 
US$23.1 million interim dividend 
payment for 2016; and
(c) US$51.3 profit share charge for 
EMRA for the year.

Cash flows
Net cash flows generated by operating 
activities comprise receipts from gold 
and silver sales and interest revenue, 
offset by operating and corporate 
administration costs. Cash flows have 
increased by US$181.4 million to 
US$366.3 million, primarily attributable 
to an increase in revenue, due to an 
increase in gold sold ounces combined 
with a higher average realised price.
Net cash flows used in investing 
activities comprise exploration 
expenditure and capital development 
expenditures including the acquisition 
of financial and mineral assets. 
Cash outflows have increased by 
US$35.1 million to US$105.8 million. 
The primary use of the funds was 
for investment in underground 
development at the Sukari site in Egypt 
and exploration expenditures incurred 
in West Africa.
Net cash flows generated by 
financing activities comprise the 
dividend payments made to external 
shareholders and profit share to 
EMRA in Egypt. During the year 
US$46.1 million was paid comprising 
the final dividend for 2015 of 
US$22.9 million and the interim 
dividend for 2016 of US$23.1 million. 
A profit share charge of US$51.3 million 
was recorded to EMRA during the 
year with US$18.5 million paid in cash 
during the period. Taxes paid related 
predominantly to settling a liability 
with the Australian Tax Office of 
US$7.6 million.
Exchange rates
Effects of positive exchange 
rate changes have increased 
by US$6.5 million as a result of 
movements of some of the functional 
currencies used within the operation 
in the year.
The group receives its income 
from gold sales in US dollars, 
however, it is offset by the fact that 
in November 2016, the Egyptian 
government floated the Egyptian 
pound in an attempt to stabilise its 
economy. This has led to a significant 
devaluation of the currency which has 
led to an increase in inflation. This is a 
potential risk for the group as it has led 
to increases in the prices of fuel, raw 
materials and other goods as well as 
pressure to increase staff wages. 
EMRA 
A significant milestone was achieved 
during the year, as the capital 
investment in the Sukari operation by 
Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary 
Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”) was 
recovered from cash flows to the 
extent that profit share commenced 
during the third quarter. Centamin 
had previously elected to make 
advance payments against future 
profit share from 2013 onwards, to 
demonstrate goodwill towards the 
Egyptian government. The total value 
of these payments, amounting to 
US$28.75 million, were recovered 
against entitlement to profit share 
by the Egyptian Mineral Resources 
Authority (“EMRA”). To the end 
of 2016, further distributions of 
profit share amounting to a total of 
US$18.5 million had subsequently 
been paid to EMRA with another 
US$4 million accrued at year end. 
Both EMRA and PGM will benefit from 
advance distributions of profit share 
on a proportionate basis in accordance 
with the terms of the Concession 
Agreement and considering ongoing 
cash flows, historic costs that are still 
to be recovered and any future capital 
expenditure.

Diesel fuel dispute
The group is currently involved in a 
dispute regarding the price at which 
Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) is supplied 
to the Sukari Gold Mine. The nature 
of this dispute is set out more fully 
in note 21. However, in brief, in 
January 2012 the group was told by its 
fuel supplier (acting on the instruction 
of the Egyptian General Petroleum 
Corporation (“EGPC”)), that it would 
no longer be able to receive DFO at 
local (subsidised) prices. The group 
subsequently received a demand 
from its fuel supplier for repayment 
of subsidies received from 2009.
The group has issued court 
proceedings in relation to these 
demands. However, the group has, 
since January 2012, had to pay the full 
international price for DFO to ensure 
continuity of supply. The group remains 
of the view that an instant move to 
international prices is not a reasonable 
outcome and will look to recover funds 
advanced thus far should the court 
proceedings be concluded in its favour. 
Management recognises the practical 
difficulties associated with reclaiming 
funds from the government and for 
this reason has fully provided against 
the prepayment of US$231.2 million 
to 31 December 2016 of which 
US$24.6 million was provided for 
during 2016 as follows:

FINANCIAL REVIEW continued
Non‑GAAP financial measures
Three non-GAAP financial measures are used in this report:
(1) EBITDA
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the following from profit before tax:
• finance costs;
• finance income; and
• depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the group’s ability to generate liquidity by producing 
operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA is also frequently used by 
investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” that is based 
on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise 
value of a company. EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and does not have any 
standardised definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs and income of financing activities and taxes, 
and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other 
companies may calculate EBITDA differently. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit for the year 
attributable to the Company.

(1) Profit before tax, depreciation and amortisation and EBITDA includes a provision to reflect the removal of fuel subsidies (refer to note 12 to the financial 
statements for further details).
(2) Cash cost per ounce calculation 
Cash costs per ounce is a non-GAAP financial measure. Cash cost per ounce is a measure of the average cost of 
producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a period by the total gold production over the 
same period. Operating costs represent total operating costs less administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and 
amortisation. Management uses this measure internally to better assess performance trends for the Company as a whole. 
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP , certain investors 
use such non-GAAP information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. The Company 
believes that these measures provide an alternative reflection of the group’s performance for the current period and 
are an alternative indication of its expected performance in future periods. Cash costs is intended to provide additional 
information, does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or 
as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP . This measure is not necessarily indicative 
of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP . Other companies may calculate these 
measures differently. Centamin plc

In June 2013 the World Gold Council, an industry body, published a Guidance Note on the AISC metric, which gold 
mining companies can use to supplement their overall non-GAAP disclosure. AISC is an extension of the existing ‘cash 
cost’ metric and incorporates all costs related to sustaining production and in particular recognising the sustaining capital 
expenditure associated with developing and maintaining gold mines. In addition, this metric includes the costs associated 
with developing and maintaining gold mines, corporate office structures that support these operations, the community and 
rehabilitation costs attendant with responsible mining and any exploration and evaluation costs associated with sustaining 
current operations. AISC per ounce is arrived at by dividing the dollar value of the sum of these cost metrics, by the ounces 
of gold produced.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Through the financial reporting and 
budgeting process together with the 
review of operational activity, the board 
has considered the short and longer 
term strategic focus areas (set out on 
page 20), as well as the principal risks, 
risk appetite and resulting business 
objectives.
Having consulted with the 
non-executive directors and engaged 
with an external facilitator who 
evaluated the board during the year, 
I continue to believe that the format 
and composition of the board remains 
suitable for the current needs of the 
business. This view is supported by 
the external facilitator.
In respect to succession planning, 
we as a board aim to nurture talent 
through the business. Through the 
nomination committee, we have 
identified key personnel within the 
organisation for whom we have 
allocated resources and training to 
ensure they achieve their potential.
Our CEO, who was the former 
COO, is evidence of our commitment 
to encourage talent through the 
organisation. Now that Andrew has 
completed a second year as CEO, I am 
pleased to see his continued efforts to 
develop and bring about efficiencies 
within the organisation, delivering on 
our key strategic focus areas.
Our board composition and approach 
to leadership are set out in detail 
on page 67. Within the directors’ 
report and, where applicable, 
the strategic report, the directors 
provide the required governance 
and regulatory assurances. 
These are set out in the following areas:
• C1.1. Fair, balanced and 
understandable (directors’ 
responsibilities statement and 
assumptions in the audit and 
risk report);
• C.1.3. Going concern (directors’ 
responsibilities statement and 
assumptions in the audit and 
risk report);
• C.1.2. Business model and delivery 
of strategy (strategic report 
including the business model);
• C.2.1. Robust assessment 
of principal risks (directors’ 
responsibilities and assumptions 
in risk management report);
• C.2.2. Viability statement (risk 
management report); and
• C.2.3. Monitoring and review of 
effectiveness of risk management 
and internal control systems (audit 
and risk report).
2016 has been an exceptional 
year, with further improvements 
in operational efficiency and a 
strong financial performance on the 
backdrop of a stronger gold price and 
operational cost savings. We approach 
2017 with a knowledgeable board, 
a strong management team and a 
clear strategy to deliver substantial 
shareholder value.
Josef El‑Raghy
Chairman

INTRODUCTION
In 2016 we invested in our systems and reporting  
processes to further improve the quality of information,  
giving the board the best opportunity to make informed  
and timely decisions.
Josef El‑Raghy  
Chairman
Dear shareholders
Centamin remained focused on its 
drive for productivity and efficiency 
at the Sukari Gold Mine, whilst 
undertaking a growth strategy aimed 
at enhancing shareholder returns over 
the long term.
Efficient use of the board’s time and 
resources has been a focus this year, 
and by working on improvements to 
our systems and reports, the board is 
in the best possible position to make 
informed and timely decisions.
The communication between the 
executive and non-executive directors 
is particularly important and by 
allowing open discussion on key issues, 
Centamin ensures that shareholders 
are properly informed about all major 
events and results. Centamin plc

Compliance statement
The Company is incorporated in Jersey, 
Channel Islands. The Company is, by 
virtue of the Listing Rules, subject to 
the 2014 Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”) issued by the UK Financial 
Reporting Council and therefore the 
Company must confirm that it has 
complied with all relevant provisions 
of the Code or to explain areas of 
non-compliance. The Code can be 
found on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website, www.frc.org.uk.
In addition, the Company is required 
to follow the principles of corporate 
governance set out in the best practice 
recommendations of the Toronto 
Stock Exchange, in particular those 
recommendations in National Policy 
58201 – Corporate Governance 
Guidelines (NP 58-201).
Throughout the year ended 
31 December 2016, the Company was 
in full compliance with the provisions 
set out in the Code with the exception 
of the following matters:
• the Code and best practice 
recommendations favour that 
the chairman be an independent 
director on appointment. Josef 
El-Raghy is not an independent 
non-executive chairman within the 
meaning of the Code. Additional 
measures remain in place 
whereby Edward Haslam (deputy 
chairman and senior independent 
non-executive director) takes an 
active role to ensure the board’s 
ongoing effectiveness in all respects; 
and
• the Code requires three 
independent non-executives to 
be appointed to the remuneration 
committee, however, following the 
resignation of Kevin Tomlinson, the 
nomination committee and board 
approved the appointment of Trevor 
Schultz who, as a former executive 
director between 2008 and 2014, 
is not considered independent. 
The nomination report on 
page 78 and 79 sets out the review 
process in nominating Trevor Schultz 
for the committee appointment.
It is noted that in the case of the 
directors’ remuneration report, 
the disclosures have exceeded the 
obligations on the Company given 
its incorporation in Jersey. However, 
the Company considers such enhanced 
disclosure is appropriate to allow 
shareholders to compare the Company 
with UK incorporated FTSE 250 listed 
companies. It has also incorporated 
many additional and voluntary 
disclosures in its strategic report.
The Company has applied the main 
principles set out in the Code, enabling 
shareholders to evaluate how the 
principles have been applied. Centamin plc

Leadership
This report sets out the key areas the 
board has focused on during the year, 
together with details of the roles of the 
key board members and an assessment 
of the effectiveness of the board.
The board sets and implements 
the strategic aims and values of the 
Company, providing strategic direction 
to management. See further details in 
the strategic report.
The chairman, Josef El-Raghy, is 
responsible for ensuring the business 
is run in accordance with the board’s 
strategy. The CEO, Andrew Pardey, 
has the responsibility for implementing 
strategy and overseeing the day-to-day 
running of the business.
The management team and board 
are relatively few in number and are, 
therefore, actively involved in, and 
made aware of, all the major activities 
of the group. They can therefore ensure 
the Company’s actions are aligned with 
the strategic aims of the group.
The responsibilities of the board and 
key roles within the organisation are 
set out below:
The chairman:
• leads the board to ensure it 
operates effectively;
• sets the agenda and ensures all 
matters are given due consideration 
and that directors have the 
opportunity to contribute to 
board discussions;
• communicates with shareholders in 
relation to the Company’s strategic 
aims and policies; and
• represents the group before key 
stakeholders including government 
officials (including EMRA).
The chief executive officer:
• develops and implements 
short, medium and long term 
corporate strategies;
• is responsible for day-to-day 
management of the business and 
the implementation of the board’s 
strategic aims; and
• promotes the highest standards of 
safety, corporate compliance and 
adherence to codes of conduct.
The non‑ executive directors:
• challenge and help develop the 
group’s strategy;
• participate as members of the board 
on their respective committees;
• monitor the performance of 
management;
• need to be satisfied as to the 
adequacy and integrity of financial 
and other reporting;
• determine appropriate levels of 
remuneration for executive directors; 
and
• raise any concerns with the board  
or with management.
Details of the senior management team 
are set out on pages 74 and 75.
Detailed knowledge of the group’s 
activities is essential and, each year, 
the board visits Sukari where they are 
shown the underground operation, 
open pit site and the operations 
plant, accompanied by the heads of 
department based at Sukari. In addition 
to regular site visits to Sukari, the senior 
members of the management team 
and executive visit the exploration 
sites in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire 
to ensure the activities in these 
regions are aligned with the corporate 
objectives of the group.
The board delegates certain of 
its responsibilities directly to the 
committees (see section below).
Board committees
The board committees are a valuable 
part of the Company’s corporate 
governance structure. The workload 
of the board committees is far 
greater than the table of scheduled 
meetings would indicate, as ad-hoc 
meetings and communications occur 
frequently between the directors and 
management. The board is in receipt 
of detailed financial and operational 
monthly reports as well as the quarterly 
and annual financial disclosures.
The board has delegated certain 
matters to its committees and their 
reports are presented within the 
strategic or directors’ reports as 
explained in the table below.
Health, safety, environmental and sustainability  
committee – strategic report pages 36 to 49.
CSR report – see the HSES committee report on page 36.

Board appointments 
and independence
When determining whether a 
director is independent, the board 
has established a directors’ test of 
independence policy, which is based 
on the definitions of independence in 
the Canadian Securities Administrators’ 
National Instrument 52-110 – Audit 
Committees and the Code. 
Based on this policy, the majority of 
the board is considered independent 
non-executive directors.
Following the resignation of Kevin 
Tomlinson in May 2016, the board 
and nomination committee have met 
and approved the appointment of 
Trevor Schultz (non-executive director) 
as a member of the remuneration 
and nomination committees, 
and Edward Haslam (deputy 
chairman and senior independent 
non-executive director) as a member 
of the health, safety, environmental 
and sustainability committee. 
The Company remains compliant with 
the provisions of the Code, whereby 
at least half the board, excluding the 
chairman, comprises non-executive 
directors who are determined by the 
board to be independent.

CASE STUDY – GOVERNANCE IN ACTION
A major part of the strategic growth in 2016 relates to the review, approval and development of the Cleopatra decline at the north end 
of Sukari Hill. An initial capital expenditure commitment of US$11.5 million is required to commence the project and develop phase 1 
and phase 2. The board was provided with a management proposal which covered the following key areas:
• executive summary;
• phase 1 and 2 drill meters and estimated development tonnes;
• phase 3 stoping proposals;
• phase 4 access and development proposals; and
• cost estimates and initial returns.
Detailed geological data, including assay results and 3D images of the interpreted mineralised zones were included in the report. 
In addition, a clear plan setting out the stage of development in conjunction with the existing operation was provided together with 
the infrastructure, equipment and personnel requirements. A breakdown of likely cost and potential grades from the initial stages of 
development was provided to the board.
The board unanimously approved the proposal, following which onsite activity commenced to include the first drive development and 
underground exploration.
During the approval process, the board discussed the likely future contribution Cleopatra would make to production at Sukari and the 
cost/benefit analysis of the development in the context of the wider open pit mine plan and existing underground operation. The board 
has substantial experience in mining and are familiar with the ore body. As such, they were able to knowledgeably debate the proposed 
approach to the project, whilst equally recognising the benefits of the strategy.
The initial project is aimed at developing infrastructure with the capacity to support mining rates of up to 1Mtpa from this area. Ultimate 
production rates will depend on future results from the programme and further development, and would be in addition to the current 
underground ore production from the Amun and Ptah declines.
The board reviews any changes to its 
charters and policies annually and in 
readiness for the introduction of the 
Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”) in 
July 2016, certain of the policies and 
charters were updated to comply with 
MAR. In particular, the Company’s 
existing disclosure committee was 
placed on a more formal footing, which 
is consistent with MAR and updated 
procedures and templates were also 
approved by the board to comply 
with MAR. Training was provided to 
the board and senior management 
in relation to these changes in the 
Company’s policies and procedures.
Amendments to the board and 
committee charters are monitored 
annually and include the latest 
amendments to the 2016 UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
The board and audit and risk 
committee spent time reviewing their 
internal control environment, risk 
management processes and internal 
and external reporting.
Areas of focus for the board in 2017
Strategic planning – the board 
regularly reviews and approves 
strategic plans and initiatives put 
forward by management and the 
executive, including growth proposals 
and efficiency initiatives. Details 
of the strategic objectives for cash 
generation, shareholder return, growth 
and social responsibility can be found 
in the strategic report.
Communications – the board 
oversees the Company’s public 
communications with shareholders and 
other stakeholders and will continue to 
ensure systems remain appropriate to 
meet the demands of the business.
Risk assessment – the board has 
primary responsibility for identifying 
the principal risks in the Company’s 
business and to ensure the 
implementation of appropriate systems 
to manage these risks. The board will 
continue to review its processes for risk 
identification and evaluation, improving 
internal communication and external 
reports in this area.
Internal control – the board, with 
assistance from the audit and risk 
committee oversees the group’s 
internal control and management 
information systems. The board will 
continue to work with the internal 
auditor, who are now in their second 
year to help bring about efficiencies 
within the business. The appointment 
of BDO LLP as the Company’s 
internal auditor has led to a number 
of suggestions including formalities 
around risk reporting (to the board and 
employees), cyber security and related 
infrastructure improvements and stock 
and inventory management processes.
Reporting and audit – the board, 
through the audit and risk committee, 
has reviewed and implemented 
upgrades to the accounting 
systems. This process of review and 
enhancement of systems will continue 
in 2017 with a view to streamlining 
processes and improving the reliability 
and timeliness of internal reports. Centamin plc

INTRODUCTION continued
Areas of focus for the board in 2017 
continued
Relationship with stakeholders – 
the board will continue to maintain, 
develop and monitor relationships 
with key stakeholders including 
EMRA in relation to Sukari and other 
governmental bodies in Burkina Faso 
and Côte d’Ivoire.
Board effectiveness
Each committee carries out a 
self-assessment evaluation of its 
effectiveness over the year. This review 
compares the responsibilities and 
objectives of the committee against 
the activities carried out during the 
year. This evaluation is submitted to the 
board for review. The internal annual 
performance evaluation of the board 
was completed in January 2017 for the 
year ended 31 December 2016.
The non-executive directors meet at 
least annually, without the chairman 
or CEO present and evaluate their 
performance during the year. The 
board is assisted by the nomination 
committee on its evaluation of the 
non-executive directors. The Institute 
of Directors were appointed as the 
Company’s external facilitator in 
May 2016 to assess the effectiveness 
of the board. The evaluation covered 
six key areas including i) board 
dynamics, ii) strategic direction and 
clarity of purpose, iii) delegation 
to management, iv) stakeholder 
engagement v) board process and 
vi) risk management.
The full report was presented to the 
senior independent non-executive 
director and deputy chairman, Edward 
Haslam who discussed the findings 
with the non-executive directors and 
separately with the chairman and CEO.
The external facilitator concluded that 
“the board is highly cohesive as a 
group and appears to discharge the 
business of the board effectively, this is 
a good board and there are no causes 
for concern”.
The recommendations following the 
survey can be summarised in three 
main areas:
• succession planning approach: 
build more formality around 
the process with consideration 
to diversity;
• induction process: build formality 
around the process of induction; and
• roles and responsibilities: continue 
to further define the role of the 
CEO following his appointment 
in February 2015.
The board considered the results of the survey and noted the following in respect to an action plan:

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
71
It is noted that none of the 
recommendations and subsequent 
actions were seen as weaknesses in 
existing procedures or reporting and 
represented improvements to existing 
processes and procedures.
As a direct result of the internal and 
external evaluation process, there 
were no proposed changes to the 
membership of the committees or 
the composition of the non-executive 
directors or executive directors. 
The nomination committee and the 
board discussed the need for any new 
appointments to the board, either 
through the process of succession 
planning or external appointments. 
Discussions of this nature will continue 
in 2017. The recommendations and 
any resulting actions were discussed by 
the board in 2016 with Edward Haslam 
(senior independent non-executive 
director and deputy chair) charged 
with implementing any of the required 
recommendations.
Managing risks and internal controls
The board is responsible for satisfying 
itself that management has developed 
and implemented a sound system 
of risk management and internal 
control. Assisted by the audit and risk 
committee, management reports to the 
board on the group’s principal risks and 
the extent to which it believes these 
risks are being appropriately managed 
and mitigated.
Full details of the risk environment 
can be found in the risk management 
report on page 30 to 35.
The board is pleased to confirm that 
the Company remains in compliance 
with best practice guidelines, with 
the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code and relevant Canadian 
requirements, and the systems in place 
to manage risk and the internal control 
environment have been in place 
for the year under review, up to the 
date of approval of the annual report 
and financial statements.
During the year, the Company 
conducted an assessment of the 
control environment of the group, 
summarised by the following 
key headings:
• corporate governance framework;
• management reporting framework;
• material contracts and contract 
management;
• procedures for forecasting 
and budgeting;
• external reporting obligations 
and procedures;
• information technology 
environment; and
• corporate and operational principal 
risk assessment. 
The board made the following 
recommendations to enhance 
the internal control environment 
following the review and these are 
summarised below:
• continue to upgrade the finance 
accounting software in addition 
to the work completed in 2016;
• carry out a complete review of 
all material and major contracts 
in conjunction with the existing 
tender process;
• utilise the services of the internal 
auditor to evaluate the IT 
environment and ensure efficient 
use of the existing infrastructure; 
and
• continue to build upon the existing 
reporting framework with a view to 
enhancing the reporting flows from 
the business and communicating 
the policies, business strategy and 
culture to the organisation.
It was noted that the review of the 
internal control environment and 
subsequent recommendations were 
not seen as significant failings or 
weaknesses, but are reflective of the 
detailed review that was undertaken.

Dear shareholders
I am presenting this corporate 
governance report in my capacity 
as chairman of the compliance and 
corporate governance committee, a 
committee established by the board of 
the Company. The committee’s primary 
functions, responsibilities and duties 
are set out in the committee charter.
Compliance and corporate 
governance committee
As at the date of this report, the 
compliance and corporate governance 
committee is chaired by Mark Bankes 
and its members are Edward Haslam 
and Mark Arnesen.
The activities undertaken during the 
year included the following:
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The board recognises the importance of keeping the 
market fully informed of the group’s activities and of 
communicating openly and clearly with all stakeholders.
Mark Bankes  
Chairman of the compliance and 
corporate governance committee
ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE COMMENTARY
Review of progress in respect to 
the Concession Agreement court 
appeal hearing (see note 21 to the 
financial statements)
Whist the substantive merits of the case remain strong, 
Law no. 32 (which is legislation designed to protect 
and encourage foreign investment) should bring a 
resolution to this litigation in the Company’s favour. 
The committee monitors with interest the outcome of 
developments in the appeal challenging the validity 
of Law no. 32 and reviews the litigation process in the 
Egyptian courts more widely.
Review of progress in respect to 
the DFO litigation (see note 21 to 
the financial statements)
The committee was disappointed with the State 
Commissioner’s report produced in September this 
year, however the report, which is non-binding, does 
not, in the committee’s view, impact the strong merits 
of our case. Our legal advisers do not believe the 
report properly addresses the key arguments of the 
Company’s case. The committee continues to monitor 
progress in the Egyptian courts to resolve this dispute.
Monitoring of government 
relations relating to the Concession 
Agreement and review of 
the timing and mechanism 
of profit share
The committee reviews key correspondence between 
senior management and government. With the 
onset of profit sharing with the Egyptian government 
(“EMRA”) this year, the committee wishes to ensure 
that the process is properly managed in accordance 
with the Concession Agreement and that all parties 
continue to be treated fairly and equitably.
Review updates to the Company’s 
policies and procedures following 
the introduction of the Market 
Abuse Regulation (“MAR”)
The committee reviewed the impact of MAR and the 
consequent amendments to policies and procedures. 
There were no significant substantive changes to 
the protocols already in place and the committee 
considered the Company’s policies particularly in 
respect of disclosure and securities trading which were 
already more robust than those mandated by MAR.
Assisting with discussions on 
public announcements through 
the disclosure committee
The committee agreed to place the existing disclosure 
committee on a more formal footing.
Review of the reporting and 
disclosure requirements required 
by the LSE and TSX
The committee is active in the review of public 
disclosures and continue to review and comment on 
such disclosures to ensure messaging and information 
is clear and understandable to the market.

All shareholders are encouraged to 
attend our AGM on 21 March 2017, 
which will be held in Jersey. This 
will be an excellent opportunity to 
meet board members and our senior

The board of directors aims to ensure 
that shareholders are provided with 
important information in a timely 
manner via written and electronic 
communications. 
The chairman, CEO, senior 
independent non-executive director 
and deputy chairman as well as 
our head of investor relations, 
communicate with major shareholders 
on a regular basis through face-to-face 
meetings, telephone conversations, 
and analyst and broker briefings to 
help better understand the views of the 
shareholders. Any material feedback 
is then discussed at board level. In 
particular, the feedback from certain 
of the proxy advisory companies, 
which provide guidance and voting 
recommendations to shareholders, 
is discussed by the board.
Shareholder communication is 
maintained through the following 
key information channels:
• the annual report;
• the notice of annual general 
meeting and management 
information circular;
• the annual general meeting;
• the annual information form;
• quarterly and half-yearly financial 
and operational reports;

all stakeholders. The Company has a 
formal continuous disclosure policy to 
ensure this occurs. A sub-committee 
of the board, known as the continuous

advises on the Company’s continuous 
disclosure obligations. All actions 
and decisions of the sub-committee 
are presented to the compliance and 
corporate governance committee

NOMINATION REPORT
Dear shareholders
I am presenting this report as 
chairman of the nomination 
committee,  a committee established 
by the board of the Company.
The committee played an active role 
in the review of succession plans and 
assessing progress to fill key vacancies 
within the organisation.
The committee also considered the 
role and responsibility of the chairman, 
Josef El-Raghy and the CEO, Andrew 
Pardey who was appointed CEO 
on 1 February 2015. The interplay 
between chairman and CEO is 
important and the committee spent 
time with both individuals to ensure 
their roles were defined and the new 
CEO had the required support of the 
board and management team.
Following the resignation of our former 
CFO, the committee was actively 
involved in the recruitment process 
to identify and appoint a new chief 
financial officer. Ross Jerrard was 
appointed and joined the Company 
on 18 April 2016. A key consideration 
of the committee was the support and 
training needed for Ross as an officer 
of the Company.
The committee considered the 
proposal to appoint Trevor Schultz 
as a member of the remuneration 
committee and nomination committee, 
and Edward Haslam as a member 
of the HSES committee. The 
appointments followed the resignation 
of Kevin Tomlinson in May 2016. In 
both cases, the committee evaluated 
the composition, experience, balance 
and skill set on each of the committees. 
Further details are set out opposite.
The committee was focused this year on succession 
planning, to ensure that the key personnel within the 
organisation had the support and training to allow them 
to reach their potential.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
79
The committee met three times during 
the year and held one meeting by way 
of written resolution. The committee 
undertook the following activities:
• reviewed the board succession plans 
and progress to fill vacancies among 
the senior management team;
• made recommendations to 
the board on the appointment 
to the committees and senior 
management;
• made recommendations as to the 
structure, size and composition of 
the board and board committees;
• reviewed the competencies, skills, 
knowledge and experience of 
directors;
• made recommendations for the 
appointment and re-election of 
directors to the board;
• considered the requirements for 
board diversity (including gender 
and ethnic diversity); and
• reviewed the policy on senior 
and executive recruitment and 
succession planning.
In 2016, the nomination committee and 
the board discussed the need for any 
new appointments to the board, either 
through the process of succession 
planning or external appointments 
and determined that no changes or 
additions were necessary at this time. 
Discussions of this nature will continue 
in 2017.
The report provides more detail on the 
activities, decisions and policies of the 
nomination committee and the board.

Chairman of the nomination committee

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Nomination committee
As at the date of this report, the 
nomination committee comprises 
Edward Haslam (chairman) and 
Mark Arnesen, both of whom 
are independent non-executive 
directors, and Trevor Schultz, who is a 
non-executive director of the Company. 
Trevor was appointed on 1 October 
2016 following the resignation of 
Kevin Tomlinson in May 2016.
Board diversity
The board set out its updated policy on 
recruitment, the selection process and 
succession planning in the 2015 annual 
report and further considered the 
recommendations of the nomination 
committee both in connection with 
recruitment policy, selection process 
and succession planning in 2016.
In particular, in connection with board 
diversity, the board’s position is that, 
whilst all appointments should be 
continued to be made on merit, 
female candidates will continue to 
be considered routinely as part of 
the recruitment process. It remains 
the board’s intention to identify a 
suitable female candidate as part of 
the recruitment process as and when 
the need arises for a new appointment 
at board level. In addition, and as 
part of our succession planning, 
the committee will continue to appoint 
and encourage female professionals 
to apply for managerial positions to 
ensure a progressive pipeline of talent 
within the Company’s management 
and senior management team.
However, women do still account for 
a small percentage of the workforce, 
particularly in Egypt where only 1% 
of the Egyptian workforce are female. 
This is mainly due to social conditions 
in Egypt and in the Middle East where 
in general, female employees are not 
encouraged to work at remote sites.
A greater percentage of women are 
employed throughout the group in 
the administrative offices and at the 
Company’s headquarters and onsite in 
Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. Of our 
West African employees, over 10% are 
women working in Ouagadougou as 
geologists based at camp. Across the 
Company, a number of women hold 
senior positions in the areas of legal, 
accountancy, HSES and subsidiary 
directorships.
In developing the Company’s policy on 
diversity, the board has considered the 
requirements of the Code and National 
Instrument 58-101.
The board, through the recommendations 
of the nomination committee, will 
provide an update on the recruitment 
process in future reporting disclosures. 
Details of the current composition of 
the board and the wider management 
team are set out in the directors’ report.
Performance evaluation
The senior independent non-executive 
director held meetings with the 
non-executive directors without the 
executive directors present, providing 
feedback to the full board. These 
meetings focused primarily on the 
evaluation of the board’s performance, 
a performance evaluation of the 
chairman and CEO, discussing the 
quality of reporting and information 
flows to the board and discussions on 
the strategic aims and objectives for 
the group. 
The board is assisted by the 
nomination committee on its 
evaluation of the non-executive 
directors. An external facilitator was 
appointed in May 2016 to assess the 
effectiveness of the board. The last 
review by an external facilitator was 
carried out in May 2013. A summary of 
the review can be seen in the corporate 
governance section on page 70.
The non-executives also discussed 
openly with the executive directors, 
the areas they could assist further with 
in relation to business development, 
succession planning and strategy 
relating to the appointment and 
retention of key personnel.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
81
An evaluation of the board and its 
committees was undertaken during the 
year and was concluded in March 2016. 
The board, in conducting its evaluation, 
reviewed the activity, composition 
and expertise of the committees and 
considered their effectiveness taking 
account of the following:
• the responsibilities set out in their 
respective charters;
• activities carried out during the year, 
taking account of their mandated 
duties and responsibilities; 
• progress made in respect of their 
duties and responsibilities;
• attendance and contribution to the 
committees; and
• reporting and updates provided to 
the board.
The board reviewed its own 
membership and performance 
and this review was concluded in 
December 2016.
The nomination committee had 
recommended to the board the 
following key appointments:
• appointment of Ross Jerrard as CFO 
(as an officer of the Company), who 
joined in April 2016;
• appointment of Trevor Schultz on 
the remuneration and nomination 
committees (as a member of the 
committees); and
• appointment of Edward Haslam on 
the HSES committee (as a member 
of the committee).
Details of the appointment process 
for the role of CFO (an officer of the 
Company) are set out in the 2015 
annual report.
In respect to the appointment of 
Trevor Schultz, the committee was 
aware of the Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”) which requires 
three independent non-executives 
to be appointed to the remuneration 
committee. The committee noted 
that as a former executive director 
who served on the board between 
May 2008 and May 2014, Trevor 
Schultz was not considered to be 
independent.
The committee gave due 
consideration to Trevor’s experience 
and expertise and the composition 
of the remuneration and nomination 
committees, and recommended 
his appointment as a member of 
the remuneration and nomination 
committees, notwithstanding the 
technical breach of the Code.
The committee noted that Trevor has 
been integral to the establishment of 
Sukari as a globally significant gold 
mining operation, and oversaw the 
construction of the Stage 4 process 
plant. He has a unique vantage point 
into the workings of the operation, 
what the mine is capable of achieving 
and also knows the challenges faced 
in operating the first modern mine 
in Egypt. With these attributes, 
the committee considered that 
Trevor Schultz will add significant 
value, particularly when setting 
challenging but realistic performance 
targets and critically assessing the 
achievements of senior management 
and executive directors. In particular, 
with a working knowledge of the mine 
and practical experience, he is well 
positioned to guide the committee 
on some of the key nomination and 
remuneration decisions regarding 
senior management and executive 
appointments, retention and salary 
as well as identifying key candidates 
and existing team members for 
succession planning. The proposal to 
appoint Trevor Schultz as a member 
of the remuneration and nomination 
committees was proposed by the 
committee and ratified by the board 
in August 2016.
The appointment of Edward Haslam 
as a member of the HSES committee 
was considered by the committee and 
approved by the board in August 2016. 
The committee and the board 
considered Edward’s experience and 
expertise and the composition of the 
HSES committee.
The committee continues to work 
closely with the chairman and 
CEO to ensure that the roles and 
responsibilities are clearly defined, 
and that the CEO has the required 
support of the board and senior 
management to undertake the 
role effectively.
The performance of all directors is 
constantly reviewed by the chairman 
and, periodically, by the nomination 
committee. The Company deployed 
a formal process for evaluation of the 
board, the board members, the board 
committees and the chairman during 
the relevant period led by the senior 
independent non-executive director.
The board has also had training 
sessions on various topics during the 
year, carried out by external legal 
advisers. Topics included a regulatory 
update, recent case law discussions 
and an update on the new Market 
Abuse Regulation. Centamin plc

1. Introduction and annual statement
As chairman of the remuneration 
committee, I am pleased to present 
the 2016 remuneration report and 2017 
remuneration policy.
The committee maintained a simple yet 
effective remuneration structure during 
the year, with the key elements of base 
salary, bonus and long term restricted 
share plan (“RSP”). The report itself 
has been modified this year to provide 
further information on the committee’s 
remuneration decisions and the key 
performance targets that are set for 
the executive directors.
Changes to the committee
The committee welcomed Trevor 
Schultz (non-executive director) to 
the remuneration committee later 
in the year, following the resignation 
of Kevin Tomlinson. Trevor brings to 
the committee a wealth of industry 
experience having overseen the 
construction of Stage 4 at Sukari. 
This unique vantage point into 
the workings of the operation and 
first-hand experience of the challenges 
faced in operating the first modern 
mine in Egypt will add significant value 
to the committee.
REMUNERATION REPORT
Our remuneration decisions are designed to motivate and 
reward exceptional performance.

Performance
As set out in the business model, 
Centamin creates value through 
the process of gold exploration and 
production, maximising production 
at the lowest possible cash cost of 
production and all-in sustaining cost. 
The gold and silver doré bars produced 
at Sukari are sold to our appointed 
refiners who, in turn, refine the doré 
bars and sell the near-pure gold at 
the price determined by the London 
bullion markets.
The performance targets set by 
the committee for the RSP and 
executive bonuses relate to the 
value chain created by the Company. 
The relative success of the executives in 
implementing the Company’s strategic 
aims are assessed by the committee 
using a balance scorecard approach. 
Some of the key metrics used by the 
committee to assess performance can 
be summarised as follows:
• safety: improving the health and 
safety environment and maintaining 
a culture of safety in the workplace 
assessed via LTIF rates;
• production: delivering base case 
production (ounces produced) and 
rewarding maximising the upside 
potential of the mine;
• cost control: maintaining cash 
cost of production and all-in 
sustaining cost within budgeted 
and forecast rates; and
• stakeholders: in-country 
stakeholder management 
through co-operative relations 
with government resulting in 
operational efficiency.
Additional metrics used by the 
remuneration committee to measure 
the success of the executive directors 
are set out further in the report.
Salary reviews
The committee undertook salary 
reviews for both of the executive 
directors. The independent salary 
review took into consideration the 
directors’ personal performance, 
their updated roles and responsibilities 
and industry benchmarking data. 
The committee proposed an 
increase of 3% for Josef El-Raghy 
from 1 January 2017 in line with the 
average cost of living increase. The 
Company’s CEO, Andrew Pardey 
received a 7% salary increase effective 
from 1 January 2017, to align the 
CEO’s base salary closer to the 
market median, in accordance with 
the Company’s remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders in May 2016.
Fee reviews 
Reviews of the non-executive directors’ 
fees were undertaken. There were no 
proposed changes to the structure of 
the non-executive directors’ fees.
RSP
Andrew Pardey (CEO) will continue 
to participate in the RSP in 2017 
with an expected grant of up to 
150% of base salary to be awarded. 
Josef El-Raghy (chairman) does not 
currently participate in the scheme and 
as a shareholder
(1)
 with a 4.67% interest 
in the Company, Josef El-Raghy 
remains aligned with the interests 
of shareholders. 
Shareholder consultation
I have engaged with shareholders and 
proxy advisory firms during the year, 
which has resulted in an improvement 
in our disclosures on performance 
targets as well as further explanation 
on the criteria used to assess 
executive performance. Although 
our remuneration policy remains 
unchanged in all material respects, 
we will continue to present our policy 
to shareholders annually seeking a 
non-binding vote. 
As a non-UK Company, we are not 
required to seek a binding vote for our 
remuneration policy, but adhere to the 
requirement by presenting the report 
annually for approval. We will continue 
to engage with shareholders, proxy 
advisory firms and other stakeholders 
throughout 2017.
Bonus structure
The executive bonus opportunity and 
structure for 2016 will remain the same 
in 2017. For the executive directors, the 
maximum bonus opportunity is 175%. 
This bonus opportunity for executive 
directors will be reduced to a maximum 
bonus opportunity of 125% in any year 
where an award under the RSP is made.
Summary
The Company reached a significant 
milestone this year having recovered 
in excess of US$1 billion of capital 
expenditure since production started at 
Sukari in late 2010. With an expected 
20 year mine life, the Company looks 
set to make significant returns to all of 
our stakeholders, including our partner, 
the Egyptian government. There are 
still challenges, particularly in respect 
of the ongoing litigation, details of 
which are set out in note 21 to the 
financial statements. However, from an 
operational and financial perspective 
this has been another successful year 
and it is within this context that the key 
remuneration decisions for 2016 have 
been taken by the committee.
The following report has been 
made available to the auditor;

2. Summary of executive remuneration
Chairman
The base salary for Josef El-Raghy, 
which is paid in sterling, at GBP515,000 
for 2016 will rise by 3% effective 
from 1 January 2017 to GBP530,450. 
An annual pension contribution 
of 20% of base salary is made to 
Josef El-Raghy.
The bonus outcome for Josef El-Raghy 
for 2016 was 75% of the maximum 
opportunity, which equates to 
GBP675,938 and represents 131% of 
base salary. As Josef El-Raghy does not 
participate in any long term incentive 
plan, no awards were either granted 
or vested and hence the annual bonus 
plan is the sole incentive arrangement 
for Josef El-Raghy. The bonus 
calculation is made by reference to a 
balanced scorecard which comprises of 
a combination of financial, operational, 
strategic and individual performance 
criteria. Full details are on pages 96 
and 97.
Chief executive officer
The base salary for Andrew 
Pardey, which is paid in sterling, at 
GBP460,000 will rise by 7% effective 
1 January 2017 to GBP492,200. 
The increase is consistent with the 
Company’s remuneration policy and 
aligns the base salary closer to the 
market median.
The bonus outcome for Andrew 
Pardey for 2016 was 77% of the 
maximum opportunity, which equates 
to GBP435,531 and represents 
96% of base salary. The bonus 
calculation is made by reference to a 
balanced scorecard which comprises a 
combination of financial, operational, 
strategic and individual performance 
criteria. The remuneration for Andrew 
Pardey in 2016 still positions him below 
the median based on the market data. 
Andrew Pardey participates in the 
RSP and is due to receive awards in 
June 2017 of up to 150% of base pay. 
These awards remain subject to the 
performance conditions set out in the 
scheme. The last tranche of awards 
made to Andrew Pardey under the 
terms of the DBSP , which were issued 
prior to his appointment as CEO, 
will vest in June 2017.
3. The committee

4. Our remuneration policy 
Introduction
The remuneration report and the 
remuneration policy were put to 
shareholders on an advisory basis at 
the AGM on 11 May 2016 and the 
resolutions were passed by a majority 
of 98.58% and 99.13%, respectively. 
The remuneration policy and the 
directors’ remuneration report as 
detailed in the annual report, will 
be subject to separate non-binding 
advisory votes at the AGM on 21 March 
2017. The remuneration policy will be 
effective following the AGM until the 
next AGM in 2018.
The policy that was put to shareholders 
on 11 May 2016 was on an advisory 
basis and remains in force until the 
conclusion of the AGM in 2017. 
A copy of the policy is available 
on the Company’s website. 
There are no material changes 
proposed to the policy in 2017, 
however, as the policy was on a 
non-binding vote we will continue to 
put our policy to shareholders on an 
annual basis. The remuneration policy 
and the application of the policy in 
2017 is detailed below.
In developing its remuneration policy, 
the committee has had regard to 
the fact that the business of the 
Company is operated outside the UK 
and in a market which requires the 
engagement, motivation and retention 
of very particular operational and 
managerial personnel and skills. 
The remuneration policy therefore 
seeks to:
• position remuneration packages to 
ensure that they remain competitive, 
taking account of all elements of 
remuneration and be reflective of 
the performance of the Company;
• use external benchmark data on a 
transparent and open basis using 
comparator groups that reflect the 
industry and size of the Company;
• provide relevant and stretching 
incentive arrangements for relevant 
employees that are based upon 
pre-agreed performance criteria 
against which individuals will then 
be tested;
• provide long term incentives that 
encourage the involvement, in the 
long term, of the performance of 
the Company; and
• encourage executives, and in 
particular executive directors, to 
build and maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company. 
REMUNERATION REPORT continued
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ELEMENT DETAILS FOR 2016 FOR 2017
Base pay
Objective
Base pay to be set competitively 
so as to allow the motivation and 
retention of key executives of 
the calibre and skills necessary 
to support Centamin’s short and 
long term objectives.
Pay is reviewed annually and any change ordinarily takes 
effect from 1 January. 
Salaries are benchmarked against a number of comparator 
groups as described below to provide a balanced 
approach. Increases will take account of those of the 
general workforce. 
Increases will take account of the performance of 
the individual and the benchmarked data but any 
increase which exceeds that of the general workforce 
may only normally be awarded in cases of a change in 
responsibility, complexity and nature of the role or size of 
the organisation or when the pay level becomes out of line 
with the market data.
The base salary for 
2016 was as follows:
Josef El‑Raghy 
GBP515,000; and
Andrew Pardey 
GBP460,000 (from 
1 April 2016).
There is no intended 
change in the policy 
for 2017. 
A 3% increase has 
been awarded for 
Josef El-Raghy and 
a 7% increase for 
Andrew Pardey 
effective from 
1 January 2017.
Josef El‑Raghy 
Increase of 3%.
New base salary 
GBP530,450.
Andrew Pardey 
Increase of 7%.
New base salary 
GBP492,200.
Benefits
Objective
Benefits may be provided where 
necessary to ensure competitive 
remuneration packages are 
consistent with the market.
The normal benefits that may be provided include such 
items as car or car allowance, life assurance, private 
medical provision, subscriptions and phones. Normal 
benefits will not currently exceed 5% of base pay.
Where necessary, due to the location of operations of 
the business, it may be necessary to provide additional 
benefits such as private security, accommodation and 
reasonable travel costs or enhanced provision of other 
benefits. Additional benefits may not exceed 10% of base 
pay (to include tax paid on the benefits).
Therefore normal benefits and additional benefits will not 
currently exceed 15% of base pay (to include tax paid on 
the benefits).
A proportion 
of benefits 
was utilised  
in 2016.

remain within  
the policy. Centamin plc

REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS continued
ELEMENT DETAILS FOR 2016 FOR 2017
Pension
Objective
Positioned to ensure 
competitive packages and 
provision of appropriate income 
for executives in retirement.
A payment in lieu of pension will be made which is up 
to 20% of base pay. Where any payment is required to 
be made under a statutory provision then this amount 
will be included within the above limit. No director has a 
prospective entitlement to a defined benefit pension by 
reason of qualifying services.
Josef El-Raghy 
receives a cash 
payment in lieu of a 
pension equivalent 
to 20% of his 
base salary.
Andrew Pardey does 
not currently receive 
a pension or a cash 
payment in lieu of 
a pension.
There is no intended 
change to the 
pension contribution 
for Josef El-Raghy.
There is no current 
intention to award 
Andrew Pardey a 
pension, however 
this will be kept 
under review 
in 2017.
Annual bonus
Objective
To provide a driver and reward 
for the delivery of short term 
performance goals, normally over 
the course of the financial year.
Performance criteria, which are set at the beginning of each 
year, are based upon a balanced scorecard approach. 
The balanced scorecard shall be based 70% on financial, 
operational and strategic targets and 30% on individual 
key tasks.
The performance measures are selected to provide an 
appropriate balance between incentivising executive 
directors to meet financial/operational targets for the 
year and incentivising them to achieve specific strategic 
objectives. In selecting the performance conditions 
for each year, consideration will be given to market 
expectations and the performance measures that are 
generally regarded as reflective of the performance of the 
industry. These will normally be selected from financial 
performance measures (profitability, cost against budget 
and operational efficiency), strategic measures (M&A 
opportunities, exploration and project delivery), corporate 
measures (health and safety and corporate governance) 
and individual tasks.
For executive directors, the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 175% of base salary, however a lower 
amount will be set for executive directors who participate 
in the new RSP . 
The threshold is achieved at 25% of the maximum 
opportunity and the target is 62.5%. Full details of the 
criteria for awarding bonuses are set out on pages 95 
to 97.
The committee may apply claw back to any bonus where 
the committee is of the view that facts have come to 
light, which had they been known at the time, would have 
affected the committee’s decision to pay part or all of 
any bonus.
Out of a maximum 
of 175%, actual 
outcome for Josef 
El-Raghy was 75%.
Out of a maximum 
of 125%, actual 
outcome for Andrew 
Pardey was 77%.
Bonus maximum 
opportunity of 
175%, reducing 
to a maximum 
opportunity of 125% 
of base salary in 
any year an award 
is made to an 
executive under 
the new RSP .
Long term incentives
Objective
To align the interests of 
the executives with those 
of shareholders through a 
meaningful ownership of shares.
The RSP was approved at the AGM in 2015. Executive 
directors and senior employees may participate in the 
scheme at the recommendation of the committee. 
The performance conditions of grants made under the 
new RSP and the terms of the RSP are set out in section 7.
For management, but not directors, the Company has 
a deferred bonus share plan (“DBSP”) as part of the 
annual bonus. The Company can require up to 100% of 
a bonus to be deferred into shares. Such shares will then 
be released typically as a third at the end of each 12, 24 
and 36 month period.
690,000 awards 
were granted to 
Andrew Pardey in 
June 2016 under the 
terms of the RSP .
4,999,000 awards in 
total were granted 
in June 2016 to 
employees.
1.2 million shares 
were granted 
to employees 
under the DBSP 
in June 2016.
Awards under the 
terms of the RSP 
are to be made to 
Andrew Pardey in 
June 2017. 
The RSP is available 
to all executives 
(and senior 
management), 
however there are 
no current plans 
to make awards to 
Josef El-Raghy. Centamin plc

REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS continued
ELEMENT DETAILS FOR 2016 FOR 2017
Share ownership 
requirement
Objective
To encourage ownership of shares 
thereby creating a link of interest 
between shareholders and the 
executives.
Executive directors are required to build a holding of 
shares in the Company equivalent to 150% of base salary 
over a five-year period from appointment. Personal 
holdings from vested shares are to be included in 
the calculation.
Josef El-Raghy 
(and family) hold an 
interest of 4.67% 
in the Company, 
which exceeds the 
requirements of 
the policy.
Andrew Pardey 
holds 969,268 
shares in the 
Company (excluding 
unvested awards 
under the DBSP and 
RSP) which exceeds 
the requirements of 
the policy based on 
the share price at 
31 December 2016.
There are no 
changes to 
the policy.
Policy if a new director is appointed
The Company has a track record of 
succession planning and growing 
and promoting talent internally, 
as demonstrated by the appointment 
of the new CEO in 2015.
When hiring a new executive director, 
or promoting an individual to the 
board, the committee will offer a 
package that is sufficient to attract 
and motivate while aiming to pay no 
more than is necessary, taking account 
of market data, the impact on other 
existing remuneration arrangements, 
the candidate’ s location and experience, 
external market influences and internal 
pay relativities.
The structure of the remuneration 
package of a new executive director 
will follow the policy above, however 
in certain circumstances, the 
committee may use other elements 
of remuneration if it considers it 
appropriate with due regard to the 
best interests of the shareholders. 
In particular, a service contract that 
contains a longer initial notice period, 
tapering down to twelve months 
over a set period of time, the buy-out 
of short and/or long term incentive 
arrangements (taking account of 
the performance measures on such 
incentives) as close as possible on a 
comparable basis, the provision of 
long term incentives and the provision 
of benefits such as housing allowance 
or similar, particularly where it is an 
expatriate appointment.
The remuneration committee review all 
executive contracts and will determine 
the appropriate notice period, 
by considering the role and position. 
Notice periods would not ordinarily 
exceed twelve months.
The committee may, where necessary 
and in the interest of shareholders, 
also offer recruitment incentives 
to facilitate the recruitment of an 
appropriate individual subject to 
the following limits:
• annual bonus plus buy-out short 
term incentives as described above 
will not exceed 175% of base pay; 
and
• long term incentives will be limited 
to an aggregate of 250% in the first 
year or where there is a buy-out of 
long term incentives as described 
above to 150%.
The limits of 175% and 250% (as set 
out above) are the limits that cover 
all awards, be they standard or 
recruitment awards. Specifically the 
remuneration committee cannot make 
standard awards plus these awards, 
as the limits of 175% and 250% are 
the absolute limits.
To facilitate the buy-out awards 
outlined above the committee may 
grant awards to a new executive 
director under Listing Rule 9.4.2. 
The total package offered to a new 
recruit will not exceed the overall 
limits set out in the Company’s 
remuneration policy.
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s approach to payment 
on loss of office will take account of 
the circumstances of the termination 
of employment. In the case of a good 
leaver, the individual will be expected 
to work through the notice period and 
will be entitled to all the benefits under 
the service agreement during that 
period. Directors’ contractual terms and 
conditions, including notice periods, 
are reviewed by the remuneration and 
nomination committees.
In the case of a termination as a result 
of poor performance or a breach of any 
of the material terms of the agreement, 
then the Company may terminate with 
immediate effect without notice and 
with no liability to make any further 
payment to the individual other than in 
respect of amounts accrued due at the 
date of termination. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
91
Where the Company wishes to 
terminate the agreement and make a 
payment in lieu of notice, this payment 
shall be phased in monthly or quarterly 
instalments over a period of no longer 
than twelve months (or the notice 
period if less) and any payment should 
be reduced in accordance with the 
duty on the executive to mitigate his 
loss. The Company will consider if any 
bonus amount is to be included in 
the calculation when determining the 
payment in lieu of notice. Any bonus 
(if included at all) would be restricted 
to the director’s actual period of 
service only.
In the case of notice given in 
connection with and shortly following 
a change of control then the executive 
directors are entitled to payment in lieu 
of an amount equal to twelve month’s 
basic salary plus bonus. Any bonus that 
may be due to him at the completion 
of the change of control, shall be 
determined by the remuneration 
committee and such bonus (if any) 
would be based on the period only 
up to the completion of the change 
of control, taking account of all the 
relevant key performance indicators.
Claw back provisions for executive 
directors relate to bonus and holiday 
taken in advance.
In relation to the RSP , the Company’s 
approach to payment on loss of office 
will take account of the circumstances 
of the termination of employment. 
In the case of a good leaver, then the 
individual will be expected to work 
through the notice period and will be 
entitled to all the benefits under the 
service agreement during that period. 
In the case of a termination as a result 
of poor performance or a breach of any 
of the material terms of the agreement, 
all unvested awards and all vested but 
unreleased awards will lapse.
A malus claw back provision has been 
included in the RSP which relates to 
the dismissal of an eligible employee 
for gross misconduct, fraud or matters 
materially adversely affecting the 
group’s reputation. If an award holder 
ceases to be an eligible employee 
under this provision, in the period 
after the award has vested, but before 
the settlement of the deferred shares, 
any subsisting rights in the award 
shall immediately lapse upon the 
date of such cessation.
In the case of death, annual bonus will 
be determined by the remuneration 
committee, which shall determine 
the bonus to be paid taking account 
of the duration in employment and 
performance of the Company and long 
term incentives shall be treated in the 
same way as a good leaver.
Policy on external board appointments
The Company will consider requests 
for executive directors to have 
non-executive external appointments, 
on the basis that such appointments 
do not adversely impact on the duties 
required to be performed to the 
Company. Where there are external 
appointments, the director will retain 
any fees for such appointments and 
will not be liable to account to the 
Company for such fees. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

REMUNERATION REPORT continued
Our remuneration policy for executive 
directors is consistent with that across 
the Company and aims to attract and 
retain high performing individuals and 
to reward success. Base pay and benefits 
are set competitively taking account of 
the individual’ s performance and market 
data. Annual incentives are typically 
linked to local business performance 
with a focus on performance against 
key strategic business objectives. Key 
management team members may also 
receive some of their annual bonus 
in shares which are deferred. At this 
time there are no all-employee share 
arrangements but this is kept under 
review on a regular basis taking account 
of the locations the Company operates 
in and the appropriateness of share base 
rewards in such locations.
All employees of Sukari Gold Mine 
Company (the majority of whom are 
based at the Sukari mine site) are 
subject to a performance related 
bonus which is linked to the underlying 
operation performance, and cost 
control measures at the mine. Further 
details on employee relations can be 
found in the CSR report.
The following graphs set out the 
remuneration structure for Josef 
El-Raghy and illustrates the minimum, 
to 50% of 175% at target, and 175% 
of base for the maximum. There are 
no long term incentive elements. 
The following graphs set out the 
remuneration structure for Andrew 
Pardey and shows the minimum, 
to 50% of 125% at target and 125% 
of base for the maximum. The graph 
assumes that Andrew Pardey will be 
awarded shares under the terms of the 
RSP of 150% of his base salary as the 
maximum and 75% of base salary at 
the target. 
Please see the following section for 
details of the performance targets and 
bonus achievements.

Policy on external board appointments continued
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NON‑EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ELEMENT DETAILS FOR 2016 FOR 2017
Non‑executive  
director fees
Objective
To attract and retain high calibre 
non-executive directors by the 
provision of competitive fees.
Non-executive directors receive annual fees within an 
aggregate directors’ fee pool limited to an amount which 
is approved by shareholders.
Fees are reviewed every two years against the same 
comparator groups as used for the executive directors.
The fees payable to the deputy chairman and senior 
independent non-executive director (“SNED”) were 
reduced in 2015 due to Josef El-Raghy resuming his 
sole role as chairman and assuming responsibility for all 
chairmanship duties.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any incentive 
arrangements. 
The following fees 
apply in 2016, with 
no change to the 
fee structure since 
1 April 2013: 
• basic fee 
GBP65,000;
• chair of a 
committee 
GBP10,000;  
and 
• member of 
a committee 
GBP5,000.
The fees payable 
to the SNED reflect 
the enhanced role 
undertaken by 
Edward Haslam. The 
fee of GBP125,000 
remains unchanged 
in 2016 and no 
further remuneration 
has been applied 
for additional 
committee 
membership 
during the year.
The fees for the 
NEDs and SNED 
were reviewed in 
2016 and the fees 
will remain as for 
2016 in 2017.
There are no 
proposed changes 
to the fee structure 
in 2017. The fees 
for the other 
non-executives will 
next be reviewed 
in 2018. 
The fees payable 
to the SNED are 
subject to an annual 
review and there 
are no proposed 
changes to the fee 
structure in 2017. 
Incentives
Objective
No incentives.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any short 
or long term incentive plans.
There is no intended 
change to the policy 
for 2017. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
93
Feedback from shareholders, as well 
as proxy advisers (acting on behalf of 
many of our major shareholders) and 
meetings held with shareholders and 
investors are considered as part of 
the Company’s annual remuneration 
policy review. Major shareholders 
are contacted should there be any 
proposed material changes to our 
remuneration policy.
Although the committee does not 
actively consult with employees on 
the remuneration policy, consideration 
is given to the base salary increase, 
relative performance of the Company 
and working conditions of the wider 
workforce. The main differences in 
determining executive and senior 
employee compensation compared 
to the wider workforce relates to the 
emphasis on rewarding long term 
performance, as well as performance at 
an operational, strategic and corporate 
level. Consideration is also given to the 
level of responsibility of executives and 
senior employees.
Implementation of policy
The Company intends to implement 
the remuneration policy for 2017 as 
detailed in this remuneration report.

Notes to table:
• Josef El-Raghy and Andrew Pardey are paid in sterling.
• There have been no vesting events in respect to the RSP during 2015 or 2016 and a value cannot be attributed to the performance conditions, as they will be 
evaluated based on the Company’ s results in 2017. Therefore the LTI for Andrew Pardey is reflected as nil. Details of the grants made to Andrew Pardey under 
the terms of the RSP can be found on page 99.
• The pension payable to Josef El-Raghy represents a cash payment in lieu of contributions to a pension scheme.
• Superannuation contributions were paid by the Company in 2015 in respect to Mark Arnesen and this is included in the 2015 pension column.
• Directors’ remuneration paid in foreign currency was converted at an average rate during the year. The average GBP:US$ exchange rate for 2016 was 1.3437. 
Bonus accruals for 2016 applied an exchange rate of GBP:US$1.23.

Non‑executive director fees (audited)
Non-executive directors receive annual fees within an aggregate directors’ fee pool limited to an amount which is approved 
by shareholders. The committee reviews and recommends, for board approval, remuneration levels and policies for directors 
within this overall directors’ fee pool. The fees which are paid are also periodically reviewed. The current annual fee rate for 
non-executive directors is as follows:
     As at  As at  
     31 December 2016 31 December 2015
Annual base fee    GBP65,000 (US$79,980) GBP65,000 (US$96,353)
Chairman of a board committee   GBP10,000 (US$12,305) GBP10,000 (US$14,824)
Member of a board committee   GBP5,000 (US$6,152) GBP5,000 (US$7,412)
Deputy chairman and senior independent director  GBP125,000 (US$153,808) GBP125,000 (US$185,295)
Notes to table:
• As the Company has an executive chairman, Edward Haslam undertakes an enhanced role as deputy chairman and senior non-executive chairman. These 
duties are reflected in this fee. The fee remains unchanged in 2016 and no further remuneration has been applied for additional committee membership.
• These amounts include any statutory superannuation payments where applicable.
• The Company reviewed the non-executive director fees during 2016 and no increases were proposed.
• The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Company’s share plans or incentive plans.
Base pay
Remuneration of the executive 
directors and the senior management 
team is considered against three 
criteria: i) general pay levels and pay 
increases throughout the Company; 
ii) the performance and skills of the 
individual; and iii) market data.
In respect of market data for the 
executive directors and the senior 
management team, a selection of five 
different comparator groups are used 
in order to gain a balanced view of 
the market data. These comparator 
groups consist of a bespoke list of UK 
and international mining companies, 
companies with a similar market 
capitalisation, companies with a similar 
turnover, the mining sector and the 
FTSE 250. 
Any increase which exceeds that of the 
general workforce may only normally 
be awarded as a result of change 
in responsibility or change in the 
complexity and nature of the role or 
the size of the organisation or the pay 
level becoming out of line with market 
data. Pay is reviewed annually and any 
changes ordinarily take effect from 
1 January.
Base salary for Josef El-Raghy, which 
is paid in sterling, at GBP515,000 for 
2016 will rise by 3% effective from 
1 January 2017, in line with the cost 
of living increase.
Base salary for Andrew Pardey, which is 
paid in sterling, at GBP460,000 will rise 
by 7% effective from 1 January 2017, 
to align the CEO’s base salary closer to 
the market median, in accordance with 
the Company’s remuneration policy 
approved by shareholders in May 2016.
2016 annual bonus
The bonus plan for the executive 
directors is based upon a balanced 
scorecard approach designed to 
encourage and reward the delivery 
of operational performance. For Josef 
El-Raghy the bonus is split between 
70% business and 30% individual 
targets as follows:
• 70% – the business targets are 
based on: 
• 20% – financial (profitability/
financial position, total cost 
against budgeted total cost); 
• 20% – operational (meeting 
production guidance, 
CSR development and 
implementation of the 
operational objectives);
• 20% – strategic measures 
(M&A opportunities, strategic 
management and formalisation 
of the business strategy);
• 10% corporate (maintaining 
sound corporate governance 
and structure, maintaining 
shareholder relations, board 
leadership and effective 
management of the board).
• 30% – the individual tasks 
are based on executive 
development and succession 
planning, communications of 
business strategy, and in-country 
stakeholder management and 
shareholder relations.
For Andrew Pardey, the bonus is split 
between 70% business and 30% 
individual targets as follows:
• 70% – the business targets are 
based on: 
• 25% – financial (profitability/
financial position, cost against 
budget and operational efficiency); 
• 25% – operational (meeting 
production guidance, health 
safety and environment, CSR 
development, open pit and 
underground mining, resource 
and reserve growth);
• 10% strategic measures 
(exploitation success in Egypt and 
elsewhere, M&A opportunities 
including geographical 
diversification); and
• 10% corporate (corporate 
governance improvements, 
shareholder relations and in-country 
stakeholder management).
• 30% – the individual tasks are 
based on building the management 
team, maintaining and improving 
standards of health and safety and 
environmental matters; and building 
the management team and senior 
staffing levels.

Background to remuneration decisions 
linked to the strategic priorities
Cash generation:
• 551,036 ounces produced 
(re-guided upwards during the 
year) representing a 26% increase 
on 2015;
• 2016 production at  
US$513/oz cash cost of 
production and US$694/oz AISC;
• further production upside/lower 
cash costs at Sukari for no material 
capex; and
• US$400 million in cash at 
31 December 2016.
Shareholder returns:
• dividend returns, with free cash flow 
to fund the next stage of growth;
• no debt, no hedging and Sukari 
capex complete; and
• share price performance relative 
to peers.
Growth:
• exploration/development to 
be funded from cash reserves 
after dividend;
• significant Sukari reserve expansion 
potential, especially via high grades 
from the underground operation;
• exploration at Sukari to include 
developing the Cleopatra decline; and
• advanced exploration in Burkina 
Faso and highly prospective 
tenements in Côte d’Ivoire.
Social responsibility:
• LTIFR rates at Sukari remained 
at low levels during 2016 of 
0.27 per 200,000 working hours;
• training and staff development;
• community projects; and
• government relations.
As set out in the risk matrix, 
the Company is exposed to the 
daily fluctuations in the price of gold, 
receiving the market rates on the day 
of sale. Consequently, revenue cannot 
be directly linked with the performance 
of the executive, and therefore the 
remuneration committee uses other 
metrics to measure the success of 
the executive directors, which are 
illustrated in the following graphs 
and reflected in the remuneration 
tables below.

In reviewing performance against the criteria and in arriving at the decision, the committee considered the key milestones 
achieved during the year which Josef El-Raghy was instrumental in delivering. These included the following:
Josef El‑Raghy
ACHIEVED
Strategic
• Maintaining the dividend payout in accordance with the policy.
• Exceeding the operational and financial metrics.
• Resource/reserve replacement and expansion at Sukari, with a focus on the high-grade underground.
• Exploration programme over licence areas in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
Corporate
• Corporate governance improvements – engagement programme with shareholders.
• Continued hand over of roles and responsibilities to the CEO.
• Maintain sound corporate governance and structure, board leadership and effective management of the board,  
executive development and succession planning.
Individual KPIs
• Presenting at key seminars and investor conferences throughout the year.
• M&A opportunities reviewed and assessed.
• Maintaining good relations with the authorities in Egypt and administration of the Concession Agreement.
• Building relations with the authorities in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
• Formalisation and communications of business strategy.
• In-country stakeholder management and shareholder relations.
On this basis, the committee determined that 75% of the maximum bonus of 175% of Josef El-Raghy’s 2016 base salary 
had been achieved. This resulted in a payment of GBP675,938 (US$831,719).

In reviewing performance against the criteria and in arriving at the decision, the committee considered the key milestones 
achieved during the year which Andrew Pardey was instrumental in delivering. These included the following:
Andrew Pardey
ACHIEVED
Strategic
• Exceeding the operational and financial metrics.
• Development of Cleopatra.
• Further optimisation of the process plant (throughput rates).
• Sukari reserve expansion potential, especially via high grades from the underground.
• Exploration programme over licence areas in Burkina Faso.
• Exploration programme over licence areas in Côte d’Ivoire.
Corporate
• Health and safety – safety record of 0.27 LTIFR in 2016. 
• Maintaining low LTI rates and aiming for a zero-harm safety record throughout the group’s operations.

Long term incentives – shares award table (audited)
Josef El-Raghy does not currently participate in any long term incentive arrangement. There is a deferred bonus share 
plan (“DBSP”) for senior management and a shareholder approved restricted share plan (“RSP”) for directors and 
senior management.
Andrew Pardey was granted 690,000 awards in 2016 under the new restricted share plan. Andrew has not received any 
new grants under the DBSP as he is not eligible to receive new grants as a director. The final tranche of the grants awarded 
under the DBSP prior to Andrew becoming a director will vest in June 2017. Vested awards received by Andrew Pardey in 
2016 under the DBSP amounted to 553,333 shares. Under the terms of the DBSP , the participant receives vested shares by 
virtue of their continued employment with the Company on anniversary of the award over the three-year vesting period.

7. Long term incentive arrangements
Introduction
Centamin introduced a long term incentive scheme which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 18 May 2015. 
The scheme was introduced to provide a suitable recruitment and retention tool for any new or promoted executives and 
incentivise executive directors and senior management. The plan, which complies with best practice guidelines, is to provide 
a platform, as part of the remuneration policy, to be used to provide a long term reward tool for participants.
Summary of the restricted share plan (“RSP”)
The RSP provides the right for the Company to grant awards to employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
REMUNERATION REPORT continued Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
103
Eligibility Awards may be granted under the RSP to all persons who at the date at which the award is granted under the RSP are 
employees of the group, though at present it is envisaged that awards will be reserved for senior management in the group. 
The remuneration committee decides to whom awards are granted, the number of ordinary shares falling under an award and 
the precise nature of the performance conditions. No awards may be granted more than ten years after the date on which the 
RSP was adopted by the Company.
Granting of awards Awards may be granted under the RSP at any point during the 28 day period following adoption of the RSP , the 42 day period 
following the announcement of the annual, quarterly or half-year results of the Company or at any other period in which the 
directors of the Company deem that awards should be granted due to exceptional circumstances. In no circumstances shall 
awards be made at a time when their grant would be prohibited by or in breach of any law, regulation with force of law, or rule of 
an investment exchange on which shares are listed or traded. The shares to be transferred pursuant to vested awards may either 
be newly issued shares, treasury shares, or existing shares to be transferred pursuant to the Company’s employee benefits trust, 
the trustees of which are Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited.
Anti-dilution  
and scheme limits
The overall number of shares transferred or transferable pursuant to awards, when aggregated with all employee share plans 
operated by the Company (dilutive shares) cannot exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the Company in any ten-year rolling 
period when added to the dilutive shares. The overall number of shares transferred or transferable pursuant to awards for the 
benefit of executives, when aggregated with all executive share plans operated by the Company (executive dilutive shares) 
cannot exceed 5% of the issued share capital of the Company in any ten-year rolling period when added to the executive 
dilutive shares. For the purposes of these limits, treasury shares will count as newly issued shares where required by institutional 
investor guidelines. Awards or other rights to acquire shares which have lapsed or have been renounced do not count towards 
this limit. The aggregate market value of any award received by an award holder may not (assessed on the value of the shares at 
the date of granting the award), exceed 150% of the award holder’s total remuneration as at the date of the grant of the award. 
In circumstances that the remuneration committee determine as being exceptional, that limit may be increased to 250% for a  
particular award.
Award price Award holders are not required to make any payment to participate in the RSP and no price is payable by the award holders to 
enable shares to be transferred.
Exit events In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, winding up or compulsory acquisition of the Company, the vesting of an 
award may be accelerated. A proportion of the shares subject to an award equivalent to the proportion of the vesting period 
which has passed at the date of the exit event (rounded down to the nearest month) shall vest, subject to the extent the 
performance conditions have been met, to be determined at the discretion of the remuneration committee. In the event of an 
internal reorganisation of the group which results in a new holding company and where the shareholders of the new holding 
company, immediately after it has obtained control, are substantially the same as the shareholders of the Company, awards may 
not vest or lapse but will be replaced by new awards over shares in the new holding company.
Leavers Where an award holder leaves employment with the group, their award will immediately suspend and will lapse upon the expiry 
of 30 days from the date of leaving, unless the remuneration committee determines that the award holder should be entitled to 
retain their award. Where the remuneration committee permits the leaver to retain their award, a proportion of the award will vest 
over a proportion of the award shares which is equivalent to the proportion of the vesting period which has passed at the date of 
leaving (rounded down to the nearest month) subject to the extent the performance conditions have been met, to be determined 
at the discretion of the remuneration committee. The resulting shares will be issued or transferred to the award holder on the date 
they would have received them, had they not left (subject to the same transfer in two equal tranches). An award granted under the 
RSP is not transferable. Awards will also lapse if an award holder is declared bankrupt or attempts to assign their award.
Status of shares The shares acquired under the RSP will rank pari passu with the Company’s issued ordinary shares.
Alteration 
of awards
If there is a variation of the share capital of the Company, including a rights issue, consolidation, sub-division or reduction of 
share capital that effects the value of awards under the RSP , the remuneration committee may adjust the awards in a manner that 
they deem to be fair and reasonable.
Amendments  
to the RSP and 
assumption  
of awards
The RSP may at any time, on the recommendation of the remuneration committee be amended or added to in any respect, 
provided that prior approval of the Company has been obtained in a general meeting for alterations or additions to the rules of 
the RSP which are to the advantage of award holders in respect of the rules governing eligibility, entitlement to acquisition of 
shares under an award, to whom awards can be granted, RSP limits and individual limits on participation and the adjustment of 
awards on a variation of share capital. Awards granted under previous schemes operated by the Company may be assumed into, 
or satisfied under, the RSP . Minor amendments to benefit the administration of the RSP , to take account of a change in legislation 
or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for award holders or group companies would 
not require approval in a general meeting.
Malus claw 
back provision
This clause has been included so that an award holder who ceases to be an eligible employee for cause (see definition below) in 
the period after the award has vested but before the settlement of the deferred shares (i.e. during the two-year holding period) 
shall immediately forfeit his/her rights in the award from the date of cessation. Cause is defined as “ceasing to be an eligible 
employee by reason of dismissal for gross misconduct, fraud or materially adversely affecting the group’s reputation”.
Following the adoption of the restricted share plan, the Company has granted the following awards:
June 2015 
5,145,000 conditional awards to employees of the group (of which 900,000 awards were made to Andrew Pardey, CEO).
June 2016
4,999,000 conditional awards to employees of the group (of which 690,000 awards were made to Andrew Pardey, CEO).
In total, 35 employees participate in the RSP , including heads of department and senior personnel based onsite,  
as well as members of the senior management team located at the head office. Centamin plc

Summary of the restricted share plan 
(“RSP”) continued
The awards to be granted in June 2017 
will vest in June 2020 (with 50% of the 
vested shares deferred for a further two 
years) and will be subject to satisfaction 
of the performance conditions over 
the three-year financial period ended 
31 December 2019:
• TSR: 20% of the award shall be 
assessed by reference to a target 
total shareholder return (“TSR”). 
If the top end of the TSR target 
is met (if the Company is ranked 
equal to or better than the upper 
quarter total shareholder return of 
selected comparator companies, 
see below) all 20% of the award 
tranche shall vest. If the Company 
is ranked at the median level in a 
table of comparator companies by 
reference to TSR, 25% of the award 
tranche shall vest (i.e. 5% of the 
award). Proportionate amounts of 
the award tranche will vest for results 
in between. 
The comparator group is as follows: 
Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd, AngloGold 
Ashanti, Centerra Gold, Eldorado 
Gold, Gold Fields Ltd, Kinross Gold 
Corporation, IAMGOLD Resources 
Inc, Petropavlovsk, Randgold 
Resources, Yamana Gold, Inc, Acacia 
Mining plc, Alacer Gold, B2 Gold 
Corp and Endeavour Mining;
• mineral reserves: 30% of the award 
shall be assessed by reference to 
mineral reserve replacement and 
growth. Reserve replacement is 
calculated based on the cumulative 
reserve estimates (from June 2016 
to the most recent reserve estimate 
prior to vesting) compared with the 
cumulative reserves mined from 
31 December 2016 to 31 December 
2019. All 30% of the award will 
vest if the ratio is 100%. 25% of the 
award tranche will vest if the ratio is 
at least 75% (i.e. 7.5% of the award);
• EBITDA: 20% of the award shall 
be assessed by reference to 
compound growth in EBIDTA over 
the three-year period to December 
2019. If a compound annual 
growth rate of 3.5% of EBITDA 
is achieved by 2019, all 20% of 
the award tranche shall vest. If 
EBIDTA in 2019 is maintained at 
the levels achieved in 2016, 25% 
of the award tranche shall vest (i.e. 
5% of the award). Proportionate 
amounts of the award tranche will 
vest for results in between. The 
performance criteria will be assessed 
based on the financial year ended 
31 December 2019; and
• gold production: 30% of the award 
shall be assessed by reference 
to compound growth in gold 
production over the three-year 
period to December 2019. If a 
compound annual growth rate of 
3.5% of gold production is achieved 
by 2019, all 30% of the award 
tranche shall vest. If gold production 
in 2019 is maintained at the levels 
achieved in 2016, 25% of the award 
tranche shall vest (i.e. 7.5% of the 
award). Proportionate amounts of 
the award tranche will vest for results 
in between.
As Sukari reaches optimum production 
rates, the relative year-on-year 
rate of growth slows. Maintaining 
production rates at this optimum 
level still represents an award, with 
an appropriate incentive to further 
improve production rates through 
efficiency and optimization.
The awards granted on 4 June 2016 
will vest on 4 June 2019 (with 50% 
of the vested shares deferred for a 
further two years) and will be subject 
to satisfaction of the performance 
conditions over the three-year financial 
period ended 31 December 2018:
• TSR: 20% of the award shall be 
assessed by reference to a target 
total shareholder return (“TSR”). 
If the top end of the TSR target is 
met (currently anticipated to be if 
the Company is ranked equal to 
or better than the upper quarter 
total shareholder return of selected 
comparator companies, see below) 
all 20% of the award tranche shall 
vest. If the Company is ranked 
at the median level in a table of 
comparator companies by reference 
to TSR, 25% of the award tranche 
shall vest (i.e. 5% of the award). 
Proportionate amounts of the 
award tranche will vest for results 
in between. 
The comparator group is as follows: 
Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd, AngloGold 
Ashanti, Centerra Gold, Eldorado 
Gold, Gold Fields Ltd, Kinross Gold 
Corporation, IAMGOLD Resources 
Inc, Petropavlovsk, Randgold 
Resources, Yamana Gold, Inc, Acacia 
Mining plc, Alacer Gold, B2 Gold 
Corp and Endeavour Mining;
• mineral reserves: 30% of the award 
shall be assessed by reference to 
mineral reserve replacement and 
growth. Reserve replacement is 
calculated based on the cumulative 
reserve estimates (from June 2015 
to the most recent reserve estimate 
prior to vesting) compared with the 
cumulative reserves mined from 
31 December 2015 to 31 December 
2018. All 30% of the award will 
vest if the ratio is 105%. 25% of the 
award tranche will vest if the ratio is 
at least 75% (i.e. 7.5% of the award);
• EBITDA: 20% of the award shall 
be assessed by reference to 
compound growth in EBIDTA over 
the three-year period to December 
2018. If a compound annual growth 
rate of 9% of EBITDA is achieved, 
all 20% of the award tranche shall 
vest. If a compound annual growth 
rate of 5% of EBITDA is achieved 
25% of the award tranche shall vest 
(i.e. 5% of the award). Proportionate 
amounts of the award tranche will 
vest for results in between; and
• gold production: 30% of the award 
shall be assessed by reference 
to compound growth in gold 
production over the three-year 
period to December 2018. 
If a compound annual growth 
rate of 8% of gold production is 
achieved, all 30% of the award 
tranche shall vest. If a compound 
annual growth rate of 4% of gold 
production is achieved 25% of the 
award tranche shall vest (i.e. 7.5% of 
the award). Proportionate amounts 
of the award tranche will vest for 
results in between.

share (expected from 2017) likely 
to impact the growth of EPS, the 
remuneration committee will have 
the discretion to make a fair and 
equitable adjustment, if necessary, 
to reflect the impact of profit share 
when assessing the growth over 
the period of the grant. Any such 
adjustment will be discussed with 
key shareholders at the time; and
• 30% of the award shall be assessed 
by reference to compound growth in 
gold production over the three-year 
period to December 2017. 
If a compound annual growth rate of 
10% of gold production is achieved, 
all 30% of the award tranche shall 
vest. If a compound annual growth 
rate of 6% of gold production is 
achieved 25% of the award tranche 
shall vest (i.e. 7.5% of the award). 
Proportionate amounts of the 
award tranche will vest for results 
in between.
The above measures are assessed by 
reference to current market practice 
and the remuneration committee 
will have regard to current market 
practice when establishing the precise 
performance conditions for awards.
Deferred bonus scheme 
(not for directors)
This plan, introduced in 2012, allowing 
the annual bonus to be matched 
with shares which are then ordinarily 
released in three annual tranches, 
conditional upon the continued 
employment with the group. The plan 
was introduced as a review of annual 
bonus arrangements for management 
with the objectives of:
• increasing the variable pay element 
of remuneration;
• introducing a new retention element 
in the remuneration package; and 
• linking part of that reward to the 
medium term share performance 
of the Company.
On 4 June 2013, the Company 
offered participants of existing plans 
the opportunity to replace awards 
with an initial one-off award under 
the deferred bonus share plan. In 
June 2014, the participants who met 
the vesting criteria received their first 
tranche, representing one-third of the 
original award. Additional grants were 
awarded in June 2014 and June 2016 
to new and existing participants which 
also vest in thirds over three years. 
The plan is not open to directors of 
the Company and any shares used for 
the plan are not newly issued shares.
The DBSP , now in its fifth year, 
provides a simple yet effective 
incentive to senior management and 
senior employees below board level, 
motivating and retaining individuals 
over the longer term. 26 employees 
remain in the scheme, including heads 
of department and senior personnel 
based onsite, as well as members of 
the senior management team located 
at the head office.
At the AGM of the Company on 
11 May 2016 the following votes 
for and against the adoption of the 
remuneration report were as follows:
    For Against Withheld
Approval of the remuneration report  806,745,332 (98.58%) 11,641,708 (1.42%) 12,406,078

AUDIT AND RISK REPORT
Dear shareholders
This report provides a summary 
of the activities undertaken by our 
independent audit and risk committee 
during 2016. The report looks at the 
involvement of the committee in 
respect of the work carried out by the 
external auditor, the appointment and 
scope of the internal audit function 
and the development of the control 
environment in compliance with the 
2014 Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”).
Audit committee composition 
and effectiveness
The audit and risk committee has 
three independent non-executive 
directors, Mark Bankes, Edward Haslam 
and me as chairman. Biographies 
of the members of the committee 
can be found on pages 72 and 73. 
All committee members attended all 
eight scheduled meetings during 2016. 
In accordance with the Ontario 
Securities Commission requirements, 
all members of the committee are 
considered financially literate (pursuant 
to section 1.5 of the Multilateral 
Instrument 52-110) and in compliance 
with the Code, I am the member 
with the required relevant financial 
experience as a professionally 
qualified accountant.
The committee meetings are regularly 
attended, by invitation, by the 
chairman, CEO and CFO along with 
the company secretary and general 
counsel. PwC is also invited to 
attend relevant committee meetings. 
Separate discussions outside of formal 
committee meetings are regularly held 
between the external audit partner, 
the committee chairman and the CFO.
In addition to the scheduled quarterly 
meetings, the committee also meet, by 
way of conference calls, at least once 
a quarter to review the draft quarterly 
and annual financial statements. 
The committee was encouraged by the work carried out in 
2016 by management to improve the control environment 
through upgrades in IT systems and streamlining policies 
and procedures.

During the year, the committee 
carried out an evaluation of its own 
performance, taking into consideration 
the contribution to the quarterly 
and annual accounts and the risk 
review and risk assessment process. 
The committee also considered 
its composition, the competency, 
availability and contribution of its 
members and did not recommend 
any further changes to the board. 
The committee considered the results 
and noted that there were no proposed 
changes to the composition. The board 
also conducted an evaluation of the 
committee, its composition, experience 
and activities during the year and there 
were no proposed changes to the 
composition of the committee.
The committee considered the action 
plan for 2017 which included (but not 
limited to) the following areas:
• a review of the scope of the internal 
audit function to ensure the tasks 
are aligned with the business needs;
• the support and development of 
the risk reporting to assist further 
defining the Company’s risk 
appetite; and
• assisting the dissemination of key 
messages about the Company’s 
culture, attitude to risk and 
risk tolerances throughout the 
organisation (see risk management 
report in the strategic report for 
more details).
A summary of the committee’s responsibilities and activities carried out during 2016 are set out below:

Significant issues highlighted during the year by the committee
The following significant issues were considered by the committee during the year (full details and analysis are set out in 
note 4 to the financial statements).
TOPIC SIGNIFICANT ISSUE SUMMARY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE KEY ACTION POINTS
Cost recovery 
and profit 
share
Accounting treatment A full analysis has been performed by 
management on the cost recovery model 
(“CRM”), the timing and mechanism for 
profit share.
The committee reviewed the approach taken 
in reconciling the CRM, the requirements 
under the concession agreement and the 
correspondence with government (EMRA) 
on the timing, payment process and allocation 
between the parties.
Committee actions
• Approval of CRM.
• Agreement on timing and mechanism of profit 
sharing going forward in compliance with 
the CA.
• Agreement to residual cost recovery payments 
eligible for recovery in accordance with the 
concession agreement.
Management actions
• Profit share payments to EMRA and repayment 
of advance distributions commenced in 
October 2016.
• Accounting for profit sharing and residual cost 
recovery payments.
Valuation of 
stores and 
consumables 
inventory
Accounting for 
transactions
Inventory is required to be carried at the lower 
of cost or net realisable value. For inventory 
of this nature, a write down to net realisable 
value will generally occur when the inventory 
is damaged or obsolete. The committee 
considered management’s proposals in 
respect to the valuation of inventory. The 
committee agreed with management that 
there was no requirement for a write off if 
inventory, however, in respect of inventory 
obsolescence, a provision of US$2.5 million 
had been applied.
Committee actions
• Review of management accounting papers.
• Monitoring the cost and timing of the planned 
system improvements.
Management actions
• A review of inventory holding periods, 
identification of slow moving and obsolete 
stock was implemented by management 
during the year.
• Inventory software systems were upgraded 
in 2016 to help further identify and 
categorise stock.
Impairment 
of assets 
(other than 
financial 
assets)
Accounting for 
transactions
Management has concluded that there is no 
indication that an impairment exists, nor have 
any indicators arisen after the reporting period 
and are therefore not required to perform a full 
impairment review under IAS 36.
In making the assessment as to the possibility 
of whether impairment losses have arisen, 
the committee reviewed:
• exploration and evaluation assets and 
activity for indicators of impairment;
• management’s assessment of the factors 
in IFRS 6 and IAS 36 as they apply to 
E&E assets for Sukari, Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire.
Committee actions
• The committee reviewed the papers presented 
by management in respect to IAS 6 and IAS 36 
and were in agreement with the conclusions 
set out above.
Management actions
• Preparation of the impairment review for 
presentation to the committee, to include 
the key assumptions such as:
• forecast gold prices;
• discount rates;
• production volumes;
• reserves and resources report; and
• costs and recovery rates.
Accounting 
basis of 
preparation
Going concern The directors performed an assessment of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern at the 
end of each reporting period. The period of the assessment covered at least twelve months from 
date of signing the financial statements. In addition to the twelve month going concern consideration 
the directors assessed the Company’s prospects over the longer term, specifically addressing a 
period of five years as part of the overall viability statement. Details of the viability statement and 
review assessment can be found in the strategic report on page 31.
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) the directors of UK listed 
companies are required to consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate basis of 
preparation of financial statements.
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by management, in which any reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions on which cash flow forecast is based, the directors considered 
it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. Key assumptions 
underpinning this forecast include:
• litigation as discussed in note 21 to the financial statements;
• forecast gold price;
• production volumes; and
• costs and recovery rates.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 have therefore been prepared on 
a going concern basis, which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during 
the normal course of operations, in preparing the financial statements.

TOPIC SIGNIFICANT ISSUE SUMMARY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE KEY ACTION POINTS
Dividend 
policy
Company policy Due to the strong financial position of 
the Company and the ongoing cash flow 
generation from the Sukari Gold Mine, 
the committee and the board considered 
the Company’s dividend policy and full year 
dividend proposals. The board approved 
an update to the Company’s dividend policy 
whereby the board will aim to approve 
an annual dividend of at least 30% of the 
Company’s net cash flow after sustaining 
capital costs and following the payment of 
profit share due to the government of Egypt.
Committee actions
• The committee reviewed the papers presented 
by management and recommended to 
the board the review and approval of the 
proposed interim and final dividend proposals.
Management actions
• Preparation of the dividend proposal 
papers and associated cash flow projections 
and forecasts.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The committee was satisfied that 
the controls over the accuracy and 
consistency of the information in the 
2016 annual report were sufficiently 
robust. The committee reviews the 
control environment and is in receipt 
of monthly, quarterly and annual 
financial and budgetary information. 
The committee is also involved in the 
review of all key accounting policies 
and matters requiring judgment 
and estimation.
The committee has, at the request of 
the board, also considered whether 
the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable. In arriving at that 
decision, the committee has been 
involved in reviewing, at an early stage, 
the content of (both) the financial 
statements and the strategic report 
(including the business model), the 
performance review and governance 
reporting throughout the report 
(including the directors’ report). 
The assessment of each component 
by the committee can be summarised 
as follows:
• is the annual report fair and 
balanced?
• have the group’s activities been 
presented fairly in all respects?
• does the narrative reporting fairly 
represent financial results?
• have we disclosed key indicators 
of performance?
• have we applied the 
appropriate emphasis on the 
material matters?
• do the chairman and CEO 
reports reflect the full story?
The committee considered these 
questions (and more) and as an 
example, the committee considered 
the reporting of both the positive and 
less favourable outcomes this year. 
For example, the increase in ounces 
of gold produced during the year 
were sufficiently weighted against 
longer term growth expectations, 
as Sukari’s production is optimised. 
In addition, the expectations around 
the exploration projects in Burkina 
Faso and Côte d’Ivoire were balanced 
against the expected time horizon 
for advanced exploration projects to 
reach production.
• is the annual report clear and 
understandable? 
• do we clearly show our business 
model and strategy to the 
reasonably informed reader 
of  the report?
• have we identified the key 
metrics and explained the 
significance of these results?
• have we reflected the link 
between our strategy, 
performance and financials?
• are our risk and governance 
presented clearly?
The committee recommended that the 
key strategic priorities be integrated 
throughout the report to help investors 
understand the linkages between risk, 
strategy and performance. In addition, 
consideration was given to include 
narrative in the front half of the report 
to ensure the key items drawn from the 
financial statements were appropriately 
addressed in both the strategic and 
directors’ reports. 
A further review of the report was 
carried out to remove repetition 
(where possible) to further streamline 
the report.
The committee concluded that the 
annual report was ‘fair’, ‘balanced’ and 
‘understandable’ having considered 
the activity of the Company during 
the period and that users of the report 
would be able to understand our 
position, strategy, business model 
and overall performance which were 
presented consistently throughout the 
annual report. 
External auditor
During 2016, the Company’s external 
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (“PwC”) attended committee 
meetings to present its detailed 
audit plan and final audit review and 
recommendations. The committee 
agreed with the audit approach at the 
planning stage and agreed with the 
materiality thresholds and key audit risk 
areas identified by PwC.
During the year the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Audit Quality Review Team 
(“FRC Review Team”) carried out a 
review of the external audit file for the 
annual report 2015. There was one 
minor recommendation and the review 
by the FRC Review Team has now 
been closed. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016

External auditor continued
External auditor effectiveness
The group has an established control 
environment which ensures regular 
reporting by its operating mine and 
exploration projects through to the 
Company’s headquarters in Jersey. 
Progress was made in 2016 to improve 
our stock handling and inventory 
systems onsite, to help improve our 
reporting and inventory management.
The committee undertakes a review of 
the effectiveness of the external auditor 
at the half-year review and annual 
statutory audit. This review compares 
the original audit plan against the 
delivery of the audit. The committee 
also reviews the process, taking 
account of the views of the senior 
members of the finance team and 
the CFO. A detailed questionnaire 
is completed by the audit committee 
to help with the evaluation process. 
Following the evaluation process, key 
findings are relayed to the audit partner 
and where applicable an action plan 
and control sheet is set up to ensure 
recommendations are addressed. 
There has been open communication 
between the committee and the audit 
partner throughout the statutory audit 
and management has also worked 
directly with the audit team. PwC has 
also had open access to the board 
of directors.
The audit team visited Sukari regularly 
to carry out inventory, controls and 
substantive testing. PwC also visited 
our legal advisers in Cairo and carried 
out audit work at our administrative 
offices in Egypt and Jersey.
Having carried out the evaluation, 
the committee is satisfied that the 
audit engagement for the financial 
year ended 2016 was both effective 
and added value to the group.
Non‑audit fees
There was no significant non-audit 
work carried out by PwC during the 
year, with the majority of the tax 
advisory services continuing to be 
provided by the Deloitte LLP tax teams 
in the UK and Australia. The group’s 
policy for non-audit services sets out 
the categories which the external 
auditor will and will not be allowed 
to provide to the group and those 
engagements that need pre-approval 
of the group. Fees for audit services 
incurred during the year amounted to 
US$626k, there were non-audit services 
carried out by PwC during the year 
of US$15k. Full details are set out in 
note 23 to the financial statements. 
Our policy on non-audit services and 
auditor independence can be found 
on our website.
Audit rotation
There has been no rotation of audit 
partner since PwC’s appointment 
in 2014, allowing for a further two 
years before rotation is required. 
The Company’s policy is to tender 
the external audit every ten years.
Auditor objectivity and independence
The committee continues to 
monitor the auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and are satisfied that 
PwC and the group have appropriate 
policies and procedures in place to 
ensure that these requirements are 
not compromised. 
Appointment of the internal auditor
BDO LLP , the group’s externally 
appointed internal auditor, carried 
out a detailed review of the IT systems 
throughout the group, focusing in 
detail on the IT environment. The audit 
team spent time in Egypt to evaluate 
the IT infrastructure and compile 
their report.
BDO LLP provided a list of 
recommendations to the committee 
which included proposals to enhance 
the IT environment and make better 
use of the existing infrastructure and 
the system in place. The action plan 
and progress updates, following 
the initial internal audit review, will 
be monitored by the committee 
throughout 2017.

resources and information to complete 
their scope in 2017.
The internal auditor will make an 
assessment each year of any significant 
changes to the risk profile of the 
organisation and consider any areas of 
focus for the provision of internal audit 
services. The committee will ultimately 
be seeking an independent viewpoint 
and assurance over the internal control 
environment from BDO LLP .
Risk assessment
The board has overall responsibility 
for establishing risk across Centamin 
through a robust risk management 
system that allows for the assessment 
and management of material strategic 
and operational risks. In addition, the 
board is responsible for articulating 
the group’s risk appetite against the 
principal risks.
The audit and risk committee monitors 
the risk management and internal 
control structure implemented by 
management. It advises on significant 
changes to that structure so as to 
obtain reasonable assurance that the 
Company’s assets are safeguarded 
and that reliable financial records are 
maintained. The committee assists 
in developing the risk environment, 
making suggestions on ways in 
which the business can improve its 
internal reporting. The committee 
receives comprehensive monthly 
reporting information from the group’s 
operations and enhanced reporting in 
the event of an incident.

AUDIT AND RISK REPORT continued
Risk assessment continued
During the year, the audit and risk 
committee and the board evaluated 
their risk management processes and 
reporting. In evaluating the current 
processes and taking advice and 
guidance from both the external 
and internal auditors, they have 
prepared a revised and updated 
risk management framework.
The updated framework will assist the 
Company to enhance reporting and 
information flows to the board and 
assist the board, aided by the audit 
and risk committee, in assessing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s systems 
for management of material strategic 
and operational risks. In addition, the 
following reports were prepared for 
the audit and risk committee’s review:
• comprehensive control 
environment memorandum and 
recommendations for further 
improvement prepared by the 
management team;
• monthly and quarterly reporting 
on the operational activity, 
including enhanced reporting on 
any significant operational and 
corporate issues;
• internal audit work on IT systems 
at Sukari and Alexandria, Egypt;
• external audit work culminating 
in the annual and half-yearly 
audit report;
• quarterly risk reporting to 
include analysis on corporate 
and operational risks, mitigation 
(including insurance cover), 
operational level 4/5 incident 
reporting and corrective action; and
• policy updates and review.
The assessment identifies the risks 
facing the business and we consider 
the annual assessment to be suitably 
robust, covering strategic and 
operational risks at a corporate level 
and risks identified at our operations in 
Egypt, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
The assessment carried out during the 
year, which also took note of the work 
carried out by the internal auditor, 
concluded that there were adequate 
procedures, polices and controls in 
place at an operational level and 
that the risks at a corporate level, 
taking into account the Company’s 
strategic objectives, had been 
adequately identified. 
Targets in 2017
The board and the audit and risk 
committee will use the risk framework 
agreement to influence the type and 
form of risk information that is currently 
reported to management and the 
board. The board will also consider the 
approach taken to, and effectiveness 
in, influencing the Company’s risk 
appetite and risk culture throughout 
the organisation. Activities that will 
be taking place during 2017 include:
• embedding the risk management 
framework within the organisation;
• enhancing the reporting to 
the board at a strategic and 
operational level;
• considering further our risk appetite 
towards strategic risks and strategic 
objectives; and
• continuing with its work to 
improve the control environment 
and updating the control 
environment memorandum.
The audit and risk committee and 
the board are pleased to confirm that 
the Company remains in compliance 
with best practice guidelines and with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and relevant Canadian requirements. 
The Code contained a number of 
changes including an increased focus 
on how risk is governed and managed, 
with new provisions on the robust 
assessment of solvency and liquidity, 
continuous monitoring of systems of 
internal control and a statement on 
business viability. Details of our viability 
statement can be found on page 31 
and our going concern statement can 
be found on page 114.
Having considered the risks in detail, 
the principal risks have been identified 
and are set out on pages 32 to 35. 
The risks reflected in the matrix and 
the mitigating actions reflect the 
principal risks to the Company and its 
stakeholders.
Control environment
Full details of the risk management and 
control environment are set out in the 
strategic report. The risk management 
report concludes by identifying the 
principal risks for the business and the 
Company’s statements on risk appetite 
and long term viability.
While the board has overall 
responsibility for risk management 
and internal controls, the board has 
delegated certain responsibilities 
to this committee. These include 
responsibility over the adequacy 
of the internal control policies and 
procedures and the effectiveness of 
internal financial controls and risk 
management systems.
The key features of the control 
environment are to ensure compliance 
with laws, regulations and other 
requirements relating to external 
reporting by the Company of financial 
and non-financial information. 
The purpose of the risk management 
framework is to understand the risks 
the group faces and to manage 
them appropriately to enhance the 
Company’s ability to improve its 
decision making process, deliver on its 
objectives and subsequently improve 
its performance as a mining company.
During the year, the committee 
reviewed the overall control 
environment, including specific 
financial controls and procedures. 
The committee also recommended 
the adoption of a new risk framework 
agreement to formalise the existing 
information and reporting flows 
between the operation, the executive 
management team and the committees 
and board. Centamin plc

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
113
The committee was encouraged by the 
developments during the year, which 
included the following:
• upgrade of Mainpac, an accounting 
system for managing the 
supply chain;
• update of the 2016 
accounting manual;
• comprehensive review of the 
existing board and committee 
charters and key corporate policies;
• review of the existing supply manual 
and a delegated authorities manual; 
and
• the development of a standard 
template for all contracts to include 
standard terms and conditions.
As part of the review process, it was 
necessary to update the existing 
corporate policy on risk and the board 
adopted a revised and updated risk 
management framework agreement. 
The risk management framework 
includes additional detail about the 
scope and structure of an executive risk 
management working group, which 
will be preparing quarterly reports on 
an ongoing basis to help implement 
the suggested improvements following 
the last review and internal audit 
recommendations. 
The appointment of the internal auditor 
BDO LLP , in 2015, was an important 
step in the Company’s evolution, 
and will help the Company and the 
committee identify any potential 
weaknesses in the control environment 
and recommend improvements for 
the future.
Controls over financial reports 
and financial statements
The consolidated financial statements 
and annual report are prepared at 
the Company’s head office in Jersey, 
where the group financial controller 
and chief financial officer are based. 
The accounting information from 
the group’s operations is provided 
to the head office where the ledgers 
are consolidated. Appropriate 
reconciliations and reviews are 
performed at the level of the operation 
and at the group’s head office by 
way of the performance of monthly, 
quarterly and annual reconciliations.
Going concern and long term viability
The directors considered it appropriate 
to continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. The going 
concern statement is detailed in full 
in note 3 to the financial statements. 
The statements in relation to the 
group’s viability, over the longer term, 
are set out in the risk management 
report on page 31 and the directors’ 
report on page 114.
External auditor
So far as each current director of 
the Company is aware, the auditor 
has had full access to all relevant 
information and the committee has 
answered any questions raised by the 
auditor allowing the auditor to carry 
out its duties.
The committee recommends to the 
board the appointment of PwC as 
auditor at the forthcoming annual 
general meeting. PwC has expressed 
its willingness to continue in office 
as auditor.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, 
the committee has concluded that 
it has acted in accordance with its 
terms of reference and has ensured 
the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor. A member of 
the committee will be available at the 
annual general meeting along with 
the CFO to answer any questions in 
relation to this report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and financial statements 
in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law, 1991 (the “Law”) and applicable laws 
and regulations. The Law requires the 
Company to prepare financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and the Company 
has chosen to prepare the accounts in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union and applicable law.
Under the Law, the directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the group and of the 
profit or loss of the group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
accounting standards require that directors:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Law. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Due to the Company’s 
place of incorporation and its dual listing, 
it is subject to legislation in the United 
Kingdom, Canada and Jersey governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements, which may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The directors are also responsible for the 
preparation of the strategic report (including 
the business model and risk management 
report), directors’ report, directors’ 
remuneration report, nomination report 
and corporate governance statement. 
These reports are contained within the 
annual report and financial statements.
These financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 have been 
prepared on a going concern basis, which 
contemplate the realisation of assets and 
liquidation of liabilities during the normal 
course of operations, in preparing the 
financial statements.
The directors consider that the annual 
report and financial statements, when 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
The directors have undertaken a robust 
assessment of the principal risks impacting 
the Company. The assessment identified 
strategic and operational risks at a corporate 
level and principal risks impacting our 
operations in Egypt and West Africa. 
Details of the risk assessment can be found 
in the audit and risk report on pages 111 
and 112 and the risk management section 
on pages 30 to 35.
The board receives written assurances from 
the CEO and CFO that to the best of their 
knowledge and belief, the group’s financial 
position presents a true and fair view and 
that the financial statements are founded 
on a sound system of risk management, 
internal compliance and control. Further, 
they confirm that the group’s risk 
management and internal compliance 
is operating efficiently and effectively. 
The board recognises that internal control 
assurances from the CEO and CFO can 
only be reasonable rather than absolute, 
and therefore they are not and cannot 
be designed to detect all weaknesses in 
control procedures.
The financial statements have been audited 
by the independent audit and accounting 
firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , who 
were given unrestricted access to all 
financial records and related information, 
including minutes of all shareholder, board 
and committee meetings.
The financial statements were approved by 
the board of directors on 1 February 2017 
and signed on their behalf by:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Centamin plc
Our audit approach
Context
Centamin plc is listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and its principal operation is 
the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt. Production 
continues to increase and this together 
with the positive impact on profitability 
of strong gold prices set the context 
for our audit in 2016. In addition to the 
operation of Sukari the group continues its 
exploration programme in Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire.
Overview
• Overall group materiality: $6.8 million 
which represents 5% of three-year 
average profit before tax, after 
exceptional items (2015: $5.4 million). 
The higher materiality reflects the higher 
profitability of the group.
• We focused our audit procedures on the 
Sukari Gold Mine, as well as performing 
audit procedures over the group’s 
significant exploration and corporate 
operations. Two components were 
subject to an audit of their complete 
financial information whilst a further four 
were subject to specific audit procedures 
over material balances. Audit procedures 
were performed in Egypt and Jersey. 
• All audit work on the areas of 
focus was performed by the group 
engagement team.
The scope of our audit  
and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining 
materiality and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgments, for example in 
respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override 
of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had 
the greatest effect on our audit, including 
the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as “areas of focus” in the 
table on page 116. We have also set out 
how we tailored our audit to address these 
specific areas in order to provide an opinion 
on the financial statements as a whole, 
and any comments we make on the results 
of our procedures should be read in this 
context. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit. 
Changes in areas of focus
In 2016, one addition was made to 
our areas of focus whilst one other was 
removed. Amounts due to the government 
with respect to operating and exploration 
properties was added this year. With the 
commencement of profit share payments 
to the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority 
(“EMRA”) management were required 
to use judgment in their determination 
of the amount of profit share payable for 
the period. 
Taxation was removed as an area of focus in 
2016 as the material tax liability which arose 
in the prior period was event driven and 
did not reoccur. As a result there were no 
material tax balances in the current period.  Centamin plc

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT continued

AREA OF FOCUS HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE AREA OF FOCUS
The appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court in Egypt 
concerning the validity of the Sukari Concession Agreement
Refer to page 143 (note 21 to the financial statements) and pages 34 
and 35 (principal risks). 
The group is in the process of appealing a ruling passed by the 
Egyptian Administrative Court in October 2012. If the ruling is upheld, 
the group’s operations at the Sukari Gold Mine will be significantly 
reduced and there is, therefore, a risk of material impairment in 
property, plant and equipment at Sukari, which had a carrying value of 
$867.7 million at 31 December 2016.
The outcome of this case is subject to significant uncertainty due to 
ongoing political, social and economic volatility in Egypt.
We discussed the legal case with the group’s legal team, and 
considered appropriate documentation to understand the legal 
position and the basis of the directors’ assessment of the outcome 
of the court case.
We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of internal 
and external legal counsel by considering professional qualifications, 
fee arrangements and other relevant factors. These procedures 
satisfied us that internal and external legal counsel were competent, 
capable and objective.
We also obtained and read a copy of the Concession Agreement, 
as signed by the relevant parties.
The directors assessed that the group’s case has strong legal merit and 
will ultimately be successful. Based on our work, we determined that 
the directors had reflected all available information in their assessment.
We tested the disclosures in note 21 to the financial statements and 
determined that they were consistent with the requirements of IFRS 
and the results of our audit work.
The claim before the Administrative Court  
concerning diesel fuel disputes
Refer to page 143 (note 21 to the financial statements) and pages 34 
and 35 (Principal risks).
The group is involved in an ongoing legal case relating to historical 
and current fuel subsidies. The potential amount that could be 
recouped by the group relating to the current subsidy case is  
$231.2 million and the potential amount that the group could have to 
pay if they lose the historical case is EGP403 million (approximately 
US$21.8 million at current exchange rates).
To date, the group has not provided for the historical case, based on 
internal and external assessments of the merits of the case, but has 
made disclosure of a contingent liability.
In 2016, the group has disclosed the impact of the current subsidy 
case, being the difference between international and subsidised diesel 
price that has impacted the group’s results for the year, in note 21 to 
the financial statements. No contingent asset has been recognised.
We discussed the legal fuel subsidy cases with the group’s legal team, 
and considered appropriate documentation to understand the legal 
position and to evaluate the directors’ assessment of the outcome of 
the case.
We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of internal 
and external counsel, by considering professional qualifications, fee 
arrangements and other relevant factors. These procedures satisfied 
us internal and external legal counsel were competent, capable 
and objective.
The results of the procedures we performed, as described above, 
supported the directors’ accounting treatment, under which no liability 
was recognised in respect of the historical case and no asset was 
recognised in respect of the current subsidy case.
We considered whether any new factors had arisen this year 
that would impact the appropriateness of continuing to disclose this 
item as exceptional. There were no new developments of this nature.
We also considered the sufficiency of the disclosure regarding the case 
and found that it was consistent with the requirements of IFRS and 
gave a balanced description of the case.
Amounts due to the government with respect to  
operating and exploration properties
Refer to page 135 (note 7 to the financial statements) and pages 34 
and 35 (Principal risks).
The group operates across a number of jurisdictions and, like most 
groups, is subject to periodic challenges by the government on 
amounts owed with respect to the Sukari operations in Egypt and the 
exploration properties in West Africa.
The amounts owed to EMRA with respect to the profit sharing 
arrangement under the Concession Agreement are based on 
management’s best judgment of the probable amount of the profit 
share liability. 
As at 31 December 2016 the group has an expense of $51.3 million 
and a net payable/receivable of $4 million as the result of profit sharing 
and cost recovery mechanisms under the Concession Agreement, 
which we considered merited our focus.
Amounts owed to the government in Burkina Faso and Côte 
d’Ivoire were not material during the year; however the risk of 
uncertainty due to payments owed to the government will increase 
as exploration continues.
With regards to amounts owed to EMRA, we held discussions with 
management regarding their calculation of the amount due and 
obtained the calculation.  
We agreed the amounts in the calculation to source documentation 
and where elements of the calculation were subject to uncertainty, 
we tested management’s assessment of the probable amount of the 
liability to satisfy ourselves that amounts due to government had 
been appropriately recorded. Where management had obtained 
independent legal or expert advice, we obtained that advice and 
evaluated the competency of the experts involved to assess the 
key assumptions.
We also performed procedures to ensure the completeness 
of amounts due to government, with no material unrecorded 
amounts identified.  Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to 
ensure that we performed enough work to 
be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account 
the geographic structure of the group, the 
accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which the group operates. 
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining 
an understanding of the group and its 
environment, including group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at group level. The group is 
headquartered in Jersey and has production 
operations and exploration activity in Egypt, 
with exploration activity in Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire.
Based on that assessment, our group audit 
scope focused primarily on the Sukari 
Gold Mine in Egypt, the group’s principal 
operation, which was subject to a full-scope 
audit. Specific audit procedures were 
performed over material balances relating 
to the group’s exploration and corporate 
activities. We visited the Sukari Gold Mine 
and conducted audit fieldwork in Alexandria 
and Jersey. During these visits, we observed 
and discussed mining operations with local 
management and met with the group’s 
external in-country legal counsel in Cairo.
Furthermore, we performed work over the 
consolidation of the group’s components 
and significant head office and consolidation 
adjustments.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced 
by our application of materiality. We 
set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative 
considerations, helped us to determine the 
scope of our audit and the nature, timing 
and extent of our audit procedures on the 
individual financial statement line items and 
disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we 
determined materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group $6.8 million 
materiality (2015: $5.4 million).
How we  5% of three-year average 
determined it  profit before tax, after 
exceptional items.
Rationale for  We used the profit before  
benchmark  tax after exceptional items  
applied  benchmark and took a 
three-year average to 
eliminate the effects 
of gold price volatility. 
We chose profit before tax 
after exceptional items as 
it is the key indicator of the 
financial performance of 
the group. 
We agreed with the audit committee that 
we would report to them misstatements 
identified during our audit above $338,000 
(2015: $270,000) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review the directors’ statement, set 
out on page 114, in relation to going 
concern. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if we have anything material 
to add or to draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. We have nothing 
material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, 
the directors have concluded that it is 
appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. 
The going concern basis presumes that the 
group has adequate resources to remain 
in operation, and that the directors intend 
it to do so, for at least one year from the 
date the financial statements were signed. 
As part of our audit we have concluded that 
the directors’ use of the going concern basis 
is appropriate. However, because not all 
future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee 
as to the group’ s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
Other required and voluntary reporting
ISAs (UK & IRELAND) REPORTING
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• information in the annual report is:

materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
• the section of the annual report on pages 109 and 110, as required by provision C.3.8 of the

UNDER ISAs (UK & IRELAND) WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO YOU IF WE HAVE ANYTHING  
MATERIAL TO ADD OR TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IN RELATION TO:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 114 of the annual report, in accordance with provision 
C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.
• the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.
• the directors’ explanation on page 31 of the annual report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or 
to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review the directors’ statement that they 
have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the group and 
we have also reviewed the statement 
that the directors have chosen to make in 
relation to the longer-term viability of the 
group. Our review was substantially less 
in scope than an audit and only consisted 
of making inquiries and considering 
the directors’ process supporting their 
statements; checking that the statements 
are in alignment with the relevant provisions 
of the Code; and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing our audit. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review. 
Adequacy of information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for 
our audit. We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review the part of the corporate governance 
statement relating to ten further provisions 
of the Code. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. 
Opinions on additional disclosures
Directors’ remuneration report
The Company voluntarily prepares a 
directors’ remuneration report in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. The directors have requested that we 
audit the part of the directors’ remuneration 
report specified by the United Kingdom 
Companies Act 2006 (“Companies Act 
2006”) to be audited as if the Company 
were a UK quoted company.
In our opinion, the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
Corporate governance statement
The Company prepares a corporate 
governance statement that includes the 
information with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems and about 
share capital structures required by the 
Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority. The 
directors have requested that we report on 
the consistency of that information with the 
financial statements. 
In our opinion, the information given in the 
corporate governance statement set out on 
pages 71 and 155 with respect to internal 
control and risk management systems and 
about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Opinion on other matters
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ 
report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge 
and understanding of the group and its 
environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we are required to report if we have 
identified any material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report. 
We have nothing to report in this respect. Centamin plc

Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those 
of the directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on 
page 114, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, 
has been prepared for and only for the 
parent company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Article 113A of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person 
to whom this report is shown or into whose 
hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial 
statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas 
by assessing the directors’ judgments 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgments, and evaluating the disclosures in 
the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, 
to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw 
conclusions. We obtain audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination 
of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies, 
we consider the implications for our report. 
With respect to the strategic report and 
directors’ report, we consider whether those 
reports include the disclosures required by 
applicable legal requirements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2016
1. General information
Centamin plc (the “Company”) is a listed 
public company, incorporated in Jersey and 
operating through subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entities operating in Egypt, 
Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, United Kingdom 
and Australia. It is the parent company of 
the group, comprising the Company and its 
subsidiaries and joint arrangements.
Registered office and principal place 
of business: 
Centamin plc 
2 Mulcaster Street  
St Helier, Jersey JE2 3NJ
The nature of the group’s operations and 
its principal activities are set out in the 
directors’ report and the strategic report 
of the annual report.
2. Adoption of new and revised 
accounting standards
Standards not affecting the reported 
results nor the financial position
In the current year, the new and revised 
standards and interpretations that have 
been adopted have not had a significant 
impact on the amounts reported in these 
financial statements.
New standards, amendments and 
interpretations not yet adopted
Standards and interpretations issued but 
not yet effective up to the date of issuance 
of the financial statements are listed below. 
This listing of standards and interpretations 
issued are those that the group reasonably 
expects to have an impact on disclosures, 
financial position or performance when 
applied at a future date.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with 
customers’. The new standard replaces 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction 
contracts’ and provides a five-step 
framework for application to customer 
contracts: identification of customer 
contract; identification of the contract 
performance obligations; determination 
of the contract price; allocation of the 
contract price to the contract performance 
obligations; and revenue recognition as 
performance obligations are satisfied. 
A new requirement where revenue is 
variable stipulates that revenue may only 
be recognised to the extent that it is highly 
probable that significant reversal of revenue 
will not occur. The group is currently 
assessing the impact of IFRS 15 but as the 
majority of gold sales are not subject to 
pricing adjustments, a significant impact is 
not anticipated. The new standard will be 
effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’. IFRS 9 
addresses the financial reporting of financial 
assets and financial liabilities. This standard 
replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: 
recognition and measurement’. IFRS 9 
requires financial assets to be classified 
into two measurement categories: those 
measured at fair value and those measured 
at amortised cost. The determination is 
made at initial recognition. The classification 
depends on the entity’s business model 
for managing its financial instruments and 
the contractual cash flow characteristics 
of the instrument. For financial liabilities, 
the standard retains most of the IAS 39 
requirements. The main change is that, in 
cases where the fair value option is taken 
for financial liabilities, the part of a fair 
value change due to an entity’s own credit 
risk is recorded in other comprehensive 
income rather than in net earnings, unless 
this creates an accounting mismatch. 
The impairment model and hedging rules 
have also been amended under IFRS 9 but 
the derecognition rules remain the same. 
The group does not expect a significant 
impact from IFRS 9 at the moment as it does 
not enter into formal hedge accounting 
arrangements, has no long term trade 
or other receivables and does not hold 
financial liabilities at fair value. However, the 
group will need to consider the accounting 
for assets currently held as available-for-sale. 
The new standard will be effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The new standard will 
replace IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and eliminates the 
classification of leases as either operating or 
finance leases by the lessee. Classification of 
leases by the lessor under IFRS 16 continues 
as either an operating or a finance lease, 
as was the treatment under IAS 17 ‘Leases’. 
The treatment of leases by the lessee will 
require capitalisation of all leases resulting 
in accounting treatment similar to finance 
leases under IAS 17 ‘Leases’. Exemptions 
for leases of very low value or short term 
leases will be applicable. The new standard 
will result in an increase in lease assets and 
liabilities for the lessee. Under the new 
standard the treatment of all lease expense 
is aligned in the statement of earnings 
with depreciation, and an interest expense 
component recognised for each lease, in 
line with finance lease accounting under 
IAS 17 ‘Leases’. The group’s office building 
leases will come on balance sheet on 
adoption of IFRS 16 but this is not expected 
to have a significant impact on either the 
balance sheet or KPI reporting. IFRS 16 will 
be applied prospectively for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
3. Summary of significant 
accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements are denominated 
in US dollars (“US$”), which is the 
presentational currency of Centamin plc. 
All companies in the group use the US$ as 
their functional currency except for the UK 
subsidiaries which are denominated in Great 
British pounds (“GBP”) and the Australian 
subsidiaries which are denominated in 
Australian dollars (“A$”). All financial 
information presented in US dollars has 
been rounded to the nearest thousand 
dollars, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”) and adopted 
for use by the European Union and 
interpretations issued from time to time 
by the IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRS IC”) both as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and which 
are mandatory for EU reporting as at 
31 December 2016, the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991, and IFRS as issued by the IASB 
and interpretations issued from time to time 
by the IFRS IC which are mandatory as at 
31 December 2016, therefore the group 
financial statements comply with Article 4 
of the EU IAS Regulation. The group has 
not early adopted any other amendments, 
standards or interpretations that have been 
issued but are not yet mandatory.
The consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis 
and under the historical cost convention, 
as modified by available-for-sale financial 
assets, and financial assets and financial 
liabilities (including derivative) instruments 
at fair value through profit and loss. Centamin plc

Comparative figures 
Certain comparative figures have been 
reclassified to conform with the financial 
statement presentation adopted for the 
current year. These are categorisation 
changes for comparison purposes 
only and have no effect on results 
as previously reported.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
are prepared by combining the financial 
statements of all the entities that comprise 
the consolidated entity, being the Company 
(the parent entity) and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including 
structured entities) over which the group has 
control, as defined in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated 
financial statements’. Consistent accounting 
policies are employed in the preparation 
and presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements 
include the information and results of each 
subsidiary from the date on which the 
Company obtains control and until such 
time as the Company ceases to control such 
entity. The group controls an entity when 
the group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with 
the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity.
In preparing the consolidated financial 
statements, all intercompany balances and 
transactions, and unrealised profits arising 
within the consolidated entity are eliminated 
in full.
Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”) is jointly 
owned by PGM and EMRA on a 50% 
basis. For accounting purposes, SGM is 
wholly consolidated within the Centamin 
group of companies reflecting the 
substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see note 21) and 
will therefore recognise a non-controlling 
interest (“NCI”) for EMRA’s participation. 
Furthermore, based on the requirements 
of the Concession Agreement, payments 
to NCI meet the definition of a liability and 
will be recorded in the income statement 
and statement of financial position (below 
profit after tax), as the EMRA profit share, 
on the date that a net production surplus 
becomes available. Payment made to 
EMRA pursuant to the provisions of the 
Concession Agreement is based on the net 
production surplus available as at 30 June, 
being SGM’s financial year end. Pursuant to 
the Concession Agreement, the provisions 
of which are described more fully below, 
whilst PGM is responsible for funding SGM’s 
activities, PGM is also entitled to recover the 
following costs and expenses payable from 
sales revenue (excluding the royalty payable 
to the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”)): 
(a) all current operating expenses incurred 
and paid after the initial commercial 
production; (b) exploration costs, including 
those accumulated to the commencement 
of commercial production (at the rate 
of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per 
annum); and (c) exploitation capital costs, 
including those accumulated prior to the 
commencement of commercial production 
(at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated 
cost per annum).
EMRA is entitled to a share of 50% of 
SGM’s net production surplus which is 
defined as ‘revenue less payment of the 
fixed royalty to Arab Republic of Egypt 
(“ARE”) and recoverable costs’. However, 
in accordance with the terms of the 
Concession Agreement, in the first and 
second years in which there is a profit share, 
PGM will be entitled to an additional 10% 
of net production surplus and an additional 
5% in the third and fourth years. Any 
payment made to EMRA pursuant to these 
provisions of the Concession Agreement will 
be recognised as a variable charge in the 
income statement (below profit after tax) of 
Centamin, which will lead to a reduction in 
the earnings per share.
Going concern 
These financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 have been 
prepared on a going concern basis, which 
contemplate the realisation of assets and 
liquidation of liabilities during the normal 
course of operations. 
The group meets its day-to-day working 
capital requirements through existing 
cash resources. As discussed in note 21, 
the operation of the mine has been 
affected by two legal actions. The first of 
these followed from a decision taken by 
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation 
(“EGPC”) to charge international, not 
local (subsidised) prices for the supply of 
DFO, and the second arose as a result of 
a judgment of the Administrative Court of 
first instance in relation to, amongst other 
matters, the Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation 
lease. In relation to the first decision, the 
Company remains confident that in the 
event that it is required to continue to pay 
international prices, the mine at Sukari will 
remain commercially viable. Similarly, the 
Company remains confident that the appeal 
it has lodged in relation to the decision of 
the Administrative Court will ultimately be 
successful, although final resolution of it 
may take some time. On 20 March 2013, 
the Supreme Administrative Court upheld 
the Company’s application to suspend the 
decision until the merits of the Company’s 
appeal were considered and ruled on, thus 
providing assurance that normal operations 
will be able to continue during this process.
In the unlikely event that the group is 
unsuccessful in either or both of its legal 
actions, and that the operating activities 
are restricted to a reduced area, it is the 
director’s belief that the group will be able 
to continue as going concern.
Having assessed the principal risks and the 
other matters discussed in connection with 
the long term viability statement (refer to 
the risk management report included within 
the annual report), the directors considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
Accounting policies 
Accounting policies are selected and 
applied in a manner which ensures that 
the resulting financial statements satisfy 
the concepts of relevance and reliability, 
thereby ensuring that the substance 
of the underlying transactions or other 
events is reported. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.
The following significant policies have been 
adopted in the preparation and presentation 
of these financial statements:
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand 
deposits. Cash equivalents are short term, 
highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised in the group’s balance sheet 
when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Centamin plc

3. Summary of significant  
accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities and equity 
Debt and equity instruments are classified 
as either financial liabilities or as equity 
in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of 
an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the group are 
recognised at the proceeds received, net of 
direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss (“FVTPL”) or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL 
when the financial liability is either held for 
trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. 
A financial liability is classified as held for 
trading if:
• it has been incurred principally for 
the purpose of repurchasing it in the 
near term; 
• on initial recognition it is part of 
a portfolio of identified financial 
instruments that the group manages 
together and has a recent actual pattern 
of short term profit taking; or
• it is a derivative that is not designated 
and effective as a hedging instrument. 
A financial liability other than a financial 
liability held for trading may be designated 
as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
• such designation eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement 
or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise;
• the financial liability forms part of a 
group of financial assets or financial 
liabilities or both, which is managed 
and its performance is evaluated on a 
fair value basis, in accordance with the 
group’s documented risk management 
or investment strategy, and information 
about the grouping is provided internally 
on that basis; or
• it forms part of a contract containing 
one or more embedded derivatives, and 
IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition 
and measurement’ permits the entire 
combined contract (asset or liability) 
to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at 
fair value, with any gains or losses arising 
on remeasurement recognised in profit 
or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in 
profit or loss incorporates any interest paid 
on the financial liability and is included in 
the ‘other gains and losses’ line item in the 
income statement.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including 
borrowings, are initially measured at fair 
value, net of transaction costs. Other 
financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest 
expense recognised on an effective yield 
basis. The effective interest method is a 
method of calculating the amortised cost 
of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. 
The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, 
a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The group derecognises financial liabilities 
when, and only when, the group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled 
or they expire.
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised and 
derecognised on trade date where the 
purchase or sale of a financial asset is under 
a contract whose terms require delivery 
of the financial asset within the timeframe 
established by the market concerned, and 
are initially measured at fair value, net of 
transaction costs except for those financial 
assets classified as at fair value through the 
profit or loss which are initially measured at 
fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investments in subsidiaries are measured at 
cost in the Company financial statements. 
Other financial assets are loans and 
receivables. The classification depends 
on the nature and purpose of the financial 
assets and is determined at the time of 
initial recognition.
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial 
asset and of allocating interest income over 
the relevant period. The effective interest 
rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net 
carrying amount on initial recognition.
Available‑for‑sale (“AFS”) financial assets
Listed shares and listed redeemable notes 
held by the group that are traded in an 
active market are classified as being AFS 
and are stated at fair value. Fair value is 
determined in the manner described in 
note 27. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated 
profits with the exception of impairment 
losses, interest calculated using the effective 
interest method and foreign exchange 
gains and losses on monetary assets, which 
are recognised directly in profit or loss. 
Where the investment is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in 
the investments revaluation reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are 
recognised in profit or loss when the group’s 
right to receive the dividends is established.
The fair value of AFS monetary assets 
denominated in a foreign currency is 
determined in that foreign currency and 
translated at the spot rate at the balance 
sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and 
losses that are recognised in profit or loss 
are determined based on the amortised 
cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign 
exchange gains and losses are recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other 
receivables that have fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an 
active market are classified as loans 
and receivables. Loans and receivables 
are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method less 
impairment. Interest is recognised by 
applying the effective interest rate except 
for short term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, 
are assessed for indicators of impairment 
at each reporting date. Financial assets are 
impaired where there is objective evidence 
that as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of 
the financial asset the estimated future 
cash flows of the investment have been 
impacted. For financial assets carried 
at amortised cost, the amount of the 
impairment is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
127
The carrying amount of the financial asset 
is reduced by the impairment loss directly 
for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables where the carrying 
amount is reduced through the use of an 
allowance account. When a trade receivable 
is uncollectible, it is written off against the 
allowance account. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are 
credited against the allowance account. 
Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in profit 
or loss.
With the exception of available-for-sale 
equity instruments, if, in a subsequent 
period, the amount of the impairment 
loss decreases and the decrease can be 
related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, 
the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed through profit or loss to the extent 
the carrying amount of the investment 
at the date the impairment is reversed 
does not exceed what the amortised cost 
would have been had the impairment not 
been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity instruments, any 
subsequent increase in fair value after an 
impairment loss is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Derecognition of financial assets 
The group derecognises a financial asset 
only when the contractual rights to the 
cash flows from the asset expire, or when it 
transfers the financial asset and substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the asset to another entity. If the group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership 
and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the group recognises its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated 
liability for amounts it may have to pay. 
If the group retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of a transferred 
financial asset, the group continues to 
recognise the financial asset and also 
recognises a collateralised borrowing for 
the proceeds received.
Employee benefits 
A liability is recognised for benefits accruing 
to employees in respect of wages and 
salaries, annual leave, long service leave 
and sick leave when it is probable that 
settlement will be required and they are 
capable of being measured reliably.
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee 
benefits expected to be settled within 
twelve months, are measured at their 
nominal values using the remuneration rate 
expected to apply at the time of settlement. 
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee 
benefits which are not expected to be 
settled within twelve months are measured 
as the present value of the estimated future 
cash flows to be made by the consolidated 
entity in respect of services provided by 
employees up to reporting date.
Superannuation
The Company contributes to, but does not 
participate in, compulsory superannuation 
funds (defined contribution schemes) on 
behalf of the employees and directors in 
respect of salaries and directors’ fees paid. 
Contributions are charged against income 
as they are made.
Exploration, evaluation and 
development expenditure 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in 
relation to each separate area of interest are 
recognised as an exploration and evaluation 
asset in the year in which they are incurred 
where the following conditions are satisfied:
• the rights to tenure of the area of interest 
are current; and
• at least one of the following conditions 
is also met:
• the exploration and evaluation 
expenditures are expected to 
be recouped through successful 
development and exploration of the 
area of interest, or alternatively, by its 
sale; or
• exploration and evaluation activities 
in the area of interest have not at the 
reporting date reached a stage which 
permits a reasonable assessment 
of the existence or otherwise of 
economically recoverable reserves, 
and active and significant operations 
in, or in relation to, the area of 
interest are continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets are 
initially measured at cost and include 
acquisition of rights to explore, studies, 
exploration drilling, trenching and sampling 
and associated activities. General and 
administrative costs are only included in the 
measurement of exploration and evaluation 
costs where they are related directly to 
operational activities in a particular area 
of interest.
Exploration and evaluation assets are 
assessed for impairment when facts 
and circumstances (as defined in IFRS 6 
‘Exploration for and evaluation of mineral 
resources’) suggest that the carrying 
amount of exploration and evaluation assets 
may exceed its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount of the exploration and 
evaluation assets (or the cash generating 
unit(s) to which it has been allocated, being 
no larger than the relevant area of interest) 
is estimated to determine the extent of 
the impairment loss (if any). Where an 
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but only to the extent that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in previous years.
Where a decision is made to proceed with 
development in respect of a particular area 
of interest, the relevant exploration and 
evaluation asset is tested for impairment, 
reclassified to mine development 
properties, and then amortised over the 
life of the reserves associated with the area 
of interest once mining operations have 
commenced.
Mine development expenditure is 
recognised at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any impairment losses. 
When commercial production in an area 
of interest has commenced, the associated 
costs are amortised over the estimated 
economic life of the mine on a units of 
production basis.
Changes in factors such as estimates of 
proved and probable reserves that affect 
unit of production calculations are dealt 
with on a prospective basis. Centamin plc

Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of 
each group entity are presented in its 
functional currency being the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates. For the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements, the 
results and financial position of each entity 
are expressed in US dollars, which is the 
functional currency of the group and the 
presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements except for the UK 
subsidiaries which are denominated in 
Great British pounds and the Australian 
subsidiaries which are denominated in 
Australian dollars. 
In preparing the financial statements of the 
individual entities, transactions in currencies 
other than the entity’s functional currency 
are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
At each reporting date, monetary items 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
reporting date. Non-monetary items carried 
at fair value that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the date when the fair value 
was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. Exchange differences 
are recognised in profit or loss in the period 
in which they arise.
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Costs including 
an appropriate portion of fixed and 
variable overhead expenses are assigned 
to inventory on hand by the method 
appropriate to each particular class of 
inventory, with the majority being valued 
on a weighted average cost basis. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs necessary to make 
the sale.
Ore stockpiles, gold in circuit and 
finished goods are valued applying 
absorption costing.
Interests in joint arrangements 
The group applies IFRS 11 ‘Joint 
arrangements’. Under IFRS 11 investments 
in joint arrangements are classified as either 
joint operations or joint ventures depending 
on the contractual rights and obligations 
each investor. Joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method. In relation to 
its interests in joint operations, the group 
recognises its share of assets and liabilities; 
revenue from the sale of its share of the 
output; and its share of expenses.
SGM is wholly consolidated within the 
Centamin group of companies, reflecting 
the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see note 22).
Leased assets 
Leased assets are classified as finance 
leases when the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of the leased asset 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified 
as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as 
an expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term, except where other systematic 
basis is more representative of the time 
pattern in which economic benefits from 
the leased asset are consumed. Contingent 
rentals arising under operating leases are 
recognised as an expense in the period in 
which they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) 
PPE is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. PPE 
will include capitalised development 
expenditure. Cost includes expenditure that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition of 
the item as well as the estimated cost of 
abandonment. In the event that settlement 
of all or part of the purchase consideration is 
deferred, cost is determined by discounting 
the amounts payable in the future to their 
present value as at the date of acquisition. 
Subsequent costs are included in the 
asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the 
group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of 
the replaced part is derecognised. All other 
repairs and maintenance are charged to 
the income statement during the financial 
period in which they are incurred. The cost 
of PPE includes the estimated restoration 
costs associated with the asset.
Depreciation is provided on PPE. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line 
basis so as to write off the net cost or 
other revalued amount of each asset over 
its expected useful life to its estimated 
residual value.
The estimated useful lives, residual values 
and depreciation method are reviewed at 
the end of each annual financial period, with 
the effect of any changes recognised on a 
prospective basis.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The following estimated useful lives are 
used in the calculation of depreciation:
Plant and equipment  2 – 20 years  
Office equipment  3 – 7 years  
Mining equipment  2 – 13 years  
Buildings  4 – 20 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or 
scrappage of an asset is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is 
recognised in income.
Mine development properties 
Where mining of a mineral resource has 
commenced, the accumulated costs are 
transferred from exploration and evaluation 
assets to mine development properties.
Amortisation is first charged to new mine 
development ventures from the date of first 
commercial production. Amortisation of 
mine properties is on a unit of production 
basis resulting in an amortisation charge 
proportional to the depletion of the proved 
and probable ore reserves. The unit of 
production can be on a tonnes or an ounce 
depleted basis.
Capitalised underground development 
costs incurred to enable access to specific 
ore blocks or areas of the underground 
mine, and which only provide an economic 
benefit over the period of mining that ore 
block or area, are depreciated on a units of 
production basis, whereby the denominator 
is estimated ounces of gold in proven and 
probable reserves within that ore block 
or area where it is considered probable 
that those resources will be extracted 
economically. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Stripping activity assets
The group defers stripping costs incurred 
(removal of mine waste materials which 
provide improved access to further 
quantities of material that will be mined in 
future periods). This waste removal activity 
is known as stripping. There can be two 
benefits accruing to the entity from the 
stripping activity:
• usable ore that can be used to produce 
inventory; and
• improved access to further quantities 
of material that will be mined in 
future periods.
The costs of stripping activity to be 
accounted for in accordance with the 
principles of IAS 2 ‘Inventories’ to the extent 
that the benefit from the stripping activity is 
realised in the form of inventory produced. 
The costs of stripping activity which 
provides a benefit in the form of improved 
access to ore is recognised as a non-current 
stripping activity asset where the following 
criteria are met:
• it is probable that the future economic 
benefit (improved access to the ore 
body) associated with the stripping 
activity will flow to the entity;
• the entity can identify the component of 
the ore body for which access has been 
improved; and
• the costs relating to the stripping activity 
associated with that component can be 
measured reliably.
When the costs of the stripping activity 
asset and the inventory produced are not 
separately identifiable, production stripping 
costs are allocated between the inventory 
produced and the stripping activity asset by 
using an allocation basis that is based on a 
relevant production measure. A stripping 
activity asset is accounted for as an addition 
to, or as an enhancement of, an existing 
asset and classified as tangible or intangible 
according to the nature of the existing 
asset of which it forms part. A stripping 
activity asset is initially measured at cost and 
subsequently carried at cost or its revalued 
amount less depreciation or amortisation 
and impairment losses. A stripping activity 
asset is depreciated or amortised on a 
systematic basis, over the expected useful 
life of the identified component of the ore 
body that becomes more accessible as a 
result of the stripping activity. The stripping 
activity asset is depreciated using a units 
of production method based on the total 
ounces to be produced over the life of the 
component of the ore body.
Deferred stripping costs are included in 
“stripping assets”, within tangible assets. 
These form part of the total investment in 
the relevant cash generating unit, which 
is reviewed for impairment if events or a 
change in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is 
included in operating costs.
Impairment of assets (other than exploration 
and evaluation and financial assets) 
At each reporting date, the group reviews 
the carrying amounts of its tangible and 
intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for 
which there are largely independent cash 
inflows (cash generating units).
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value loss costs to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessment of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset for which the estimates of future 
flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of a cash 
generating unit is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the cash generating unit is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. Where an impairment 
loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the cash generating unit is 
increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but only to the extent 
that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the cash generating 
unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a 
revalued amount, in which case the reversal 
of an impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable for 
goods and services in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, VAT and other 
sales-related taxes.
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of mineral production 
is recognised when the group has passed 
the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the mineral production to the 
buyer, it is probable that economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to 
the group, the sales price can be measured 
reliably, and the group has no significant 
continuing involvement and the costs 
incurred or to be incurred in respect of the 
transaction can be measured reliably. This is 
when insurance risk has passed to the buyer 
and the goods have been collected at the 
agreed location.
Where the terms of the executed sales 
agreement allow for an adjustment to the 
sales price based on a survey of the mineral 
production by the buyer (for instance an 
assay for gold content), recognition of the 
revenue from the sale of mineral production 
is based on the most recently determined 
estimate of product specifications.
Pre‑production revenues 
Income derived by the entity prior to the 
date of commercial production is offset 
against the expenditure capitalised and 
carried in the consolidated statement of 
financial position. All revenues recognised 
after commencement of commercial 
production are recognised in accordance 
with the revenue policy stated above. 
The commencement date of commercial 
production is determined when stable 
and sustained production capacity has 
been achieved.
Production royalty 
The Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) is 
entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales 
revenue (revenue net of freight and refining 
costs) as defined from the sale of gold 
and associated minerals from the Sukari 
Gold Mine. This royalty is calculated and 
recognised on receipt of the final certificate 
of analysis document received from the 
refinery. Due to its nature, this royalty is 
not recognised in cost of sales but rather 
in other operating costs. Centamin plc

accounting policies continued
Other income 
Interest income 
Interest income is recognised when it is 
probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the group and the amount of income 
can be measured reliably. Interest income 
is accrued on a time basis, by reference 
to the principal outstanding and at the 
effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected 
life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of businesses as defined 
by IFRS 3 are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The consideration 
for each acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values (at the date of 
exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed, and equity instruments issued 
by the group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for 
the acquisition includes any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition 
date fair value. Subsequent changes in 
such fair values are adjusted against the 
cost of acquisition where they qualify as 
measurement period adjustments (see 
below). All other subsequent changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability are 
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 
either in profit or loss or as a change to 
other comprehensive income. Changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration 
classified as equity are not remeasured, and 
its subsequent settlement is accounted for 
within equity.
Where a business combination is achieved 
in stages, the group’s previously-held 
interests in the acquired entity are 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition 
date (i.e. the date the group attains control) 
and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising 
from interests in the acquiree prior to the 
acquisition date that have previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income 
are reclassified to profit or loss, where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that 
interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities that meet the 
conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
(2008) are recognised at their fair value at 
the acquisition date, except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and 
liabilities or assets related to employee 
benefit arrangements are recognised 
and measured in accordance with IAS 12 
‘Income taxes’ and IAS 19 ‘Employee 
benefits’ respectively;
• liabilities or equity instruments related 
to the replacement by the group of an 
acquiree’s share-based payment awards 
are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 
‘Share-based payments’; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are 
classified as held for sale in accordance 
with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held 
for sale’.
Assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations are measured in accordance 
with that standard. If the initial accounting 
for a business combination is incomplete 
by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for 
which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted during 
the measurement period (see below), or 
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, 
to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of 
the acquisition date that, if known, would 
have affected the amounts recognised as of 
that date.
The measurement period is the period 
from the date of acquisition to the date the 
group obtains complete information about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of 
the acquisition date, and is subject to a 
maximum of one year.
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the 
group has significant influence and that is 
neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement. 
Significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating 
policy decisions of the investee but is not 
control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of 
associates are incorporated in these financial 
statements using the equity method of 
accounting, except when the investment 
is classified as held for sale, in which case 
it is accounted for in accordance with 
IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and 
discontinued operations’.
Under the equity method, investments in 
associates are carried in the consolidated 
balance sheet at cost as adjusted for 
post-acquisition changes in the group’s 
share of the net assets of the associate, less 
any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. Losses of an associate in 
excess of the group’s interest in that 
associate (which includes any long term 
interests that, in substance, form part of 
the group’s net investment in the associate) 
are recognised only to the extent that the 
group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over 
the group’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate recognised at 
the date of acquisition is recognised as 
goodwill. The goodwill is included within 
the carrying amount of the investment 
and is assessed for impairment as part of 
that investment.
Any excess of the group’s share of the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities over the 
cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where a group entity transacts with an 
associate of the group, profits and losses 
are eliminated to the extent of the group’s 
interest in the relevant associate.
The group determines at each reporting 
date whether there is any objective 
evidence that the investment in the 
associate is impaired. If this is the case, the 
group calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable 
amount of the associate and its carrying 
value and recognises the amount adjacent 
to share of profit and loss of associates in 
the income statement.
Dilution gains and losses arising in 
investments in associates are recognised 
in the income statement.
Share‑based payments 
Equity settled share-based payments with 
employees and others providing similar 
services are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instrument at grant date. Fair value 
is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes 
model. Where share-based payments are 
subject to market conditions, fair value was 
measured by the use of a Monte-Carlo 
simulation. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity settled share-based 
payments is expensed over the vesting 
period, based on the consolidated entity’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
131
Equity settled share-based transactions with 
other parties are measured at the fair value 
of the goods or services received, except 
where the fair value cannot be estimated 
reliably, in which case they are measured 
at the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted, measured at the date the entity 
obtains the goods or the counterparty 
renders the service. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for 
the grant of the options is recognised as an 
expense. The total amount to be expensed 
is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the options granted:
• including any market performance 
conditions (for example, an entity’s 
share price);
• excluding the impact of any service 
and non-market performance vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and 
remaining an employee of the entity over 
a specified time period); and
• including the impact of any non-vesting 
conditions (for example, the requirement 
for employees to save or holding shares 
for a specific period of time).
When the options are exercised, the 
Company issues new shares. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share 
capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The expected life used in the model has 
been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
and behavioural considerations. Further 
details on how the fair value of equity 
settled share-based transactions has been 
determined can be found in note 28. 
At each reporting date, the group revises 
its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest. The impact 
of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in profit or loss 
over the remaining vesting period, with 
corresponding adjustment to the equity 
settled employee benefits reserve.
Issued capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of new shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from 
the proceeds.
Where the Company or other members 
of the consolidated group purchases 
the Company’s equity share capital, the 
consideration paid is deducted from the 
total shareholders’ equity of the group 
and/or of the Company as treasury shares 
until they are cancelled. Where such 
shares are subsequently sold or reissued, 
any consideration received is included in 
shareholders’ equity of the group and/or 
the Company.
Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of 
the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on 
taxable profit for the period. Taxable 
profit differs from profit as reported in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income because of items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other periods and items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are 
generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of 
other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor 
the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. Deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences associated 
with such investments and interests are 
only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that there will be sufficient 
taxable profits against which to utilise 
the benefits of the temporary differences 
and they are expected to reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profits will be available to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period in which the liability 
is settled or the asset realised, based on tax 
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period. The measurement of 
deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the 
tax consequences that would follow from 
the manner in which the group expects, at 
the end of the reporting period, to recover 
or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Restoration and rehabilitation
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation 
is recognised when there is a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of 
exploration, development and production 
activities undertaken, it is probable that 
an outflow of economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation, and the 
amount of the provision can be measured 
reliably. The estimated future obligations 
include the costs of dismantling and removal 
of facilities, restoration and monitoring of 
the affected areas. The provision for future 
restoration costs is the best estimate of the 
present value of the expenditure required 
to settle the restoration obligation at the 
reporting date. Future restoration costs 
are reviewed annually and any changes in 
the estimate are reflected in the present 
value of the restoration provision at each 
reporting date.
The initial estimate of the restoration 
and rehabilitation provision relating to 
exploration, development and mining 
production activities is capitalised into the 
cost of the related asset and amortised on 
the same basis as the related asset, unless 
the present obligation arises from the 
production of the inventory in the period, 
in which case the amount is included in 
the cost of production for the period. 
Changes in the estimate of the provision of 
restoration and rehabilitation are treated in 
the same manner, except that the unwinding 
of the effect of discounting on the provision 
is recognised as a finance cost within other 
operating costs rather than being capitalised 
into the cost of the related asset. Centamin plc

4. Critical accounting judgments 
Critical judgments in applying the entity’s 
accounting policies 
The following are the critical judgments that 
management has made in the process of 
applying the group’s accounting policies 
and that have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements.
Management has discussed its critical 
accounting judgments and associated 
disclosures with the Company’s audit and 
risk committee.
Impairment of assets (other than exploration 
and evaluation and financial assets) 
IFRS requires management to test for 
impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount of a finite lived asset may not be 
recoverable. Management has concluded 
that there is no indication that an 
impairment exists, nor have any indicators 
arisen after the reporting period and are 
therefore not required to perform a full 
impairment review under IAS 36.
In making its assessment as to the possibility 
of whether impairments losses having 
arisen, management considered the 
following indications:
• internal sources of information;
• external sources of information; and
• litigation.
The key assumptions previously applied in 
impairment reviews are:
• forecast gold prices;
• discount rate;
• production volumes;
• reserves and resources report; and
• costs and recovery rates.
Litigation
The group exercises judgment in measuring 
and recognising provisions and the 
exposures to contingent liabilities related 
to pending litigation, as well as other 
contingent liabilities (see note 21 to the 
financial statements). Judgment is necessary 
in assessing the likelihood that a pending 
claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, 
and to quantify the possible range of the 
financial settlement.
The group is currently a party to two legal 
actions both of which could affect its 
ability to operate the mine at Sukari in the 
manner in which it is currently operated and 
adversely affect its profitability. The details 
of this litigation, which relate to the loss of 
the Egyptian national subsidy for Diesel Fuel 
Oil and the ability of the group to operate 
outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the 
Administrative Court of first instance to be 
the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, are 
given in note 21 to the financial statements 
and in the most recently filed Annual 
Information Form (“AIF”) which is available 
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although it 
is possible to quantify the effects of the loss 
the national fuel subsidy, it is not currently 
possible to quantify with sufficient precision 
the effect of restricting operations to an area 
of 3km
2
.
Every action is being taken to contest these 
decisions, including the making of formal 
legal appeals and, although their resolution 
may still take some time, management 
remains confident that a satisfactory 
outcome will ultimately be achieved. In the 
meantime, however, the group is continuing 
to pay international prices for Diesel Fuel 
Oil. With respect to the Administrative Court 
ruling, on 20 March 2013 the Supreme 
Administrative Court upheld the Company’s 
application to suspend this decision until 
the merits of the Company’s appeal are 
considered and ruled on, thus providing 
assurance that normal operations will be 
able to continue during this process.
In the unlikely event that the group is 
unsuccessful in either or both of its legal 
actions, and that the operating activities 
are restricted to a reduced area, it is 
management’s belief that the group will 
be able to continue as going concern.
Recovery of capitalised exploration 
evaluation and development expenditure 
The group’s accounting policy for 
exploration and evaluation expenditure 
results in exploration and evaluation 
expenditure being capitalised for those 
projects where such expenditure is 
considered likely to be recoverable through 
future extraction activity or sale or where 
the exploration activities have not reached 
a stage which permits a reasonable 
assessment of the existence of reserves.
This policy requires management to make 
certain estimates and assumptions as 
to future events and circumstances, in 
particular whether the group will proceed 
with development based on existence of 
reserves or whether an economically viable 
extraction operation can be established. 
Such estimates and assumptions may 
change from period to period as 
new information becomes available. 
If, subsequent to the exploration and 
evaluation expenditure being capitalised, 
a judgment is made that recovery of the 
expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be 
abandoned, the relevant capitalised amount 
will be written off to the income statement.
Going concern 
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial 
Reporting Council (“FRC”), the directors 
of UK listed companies are required to 
consider whether the going concern basis 
is the appropriate basis of preparation of 
financial statements.
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast 
prepared by management, in which it 
included any reasonably possible change 
in the key assumptions on which cash flow 
forecast is based, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the group will 
have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Key assumptions underpinning this 
forecast include:
• litigation as discussed in note 21 
to the financial statements;
• forecast gold price;
• production volumes; and
• costs and recovery rates.
These financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 have therefore 
been prepared on a going concern basis, 
which contemplate the realisation of assets 
and liquidation of liabilities during the 
normal course of operations, in preparing 
the financial statements.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The following are the key assumptions 
concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the reporting 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year:
Provision for restoration and 
rehabilitation costs 
The group is required to decommission, 
rehabilitate and restore mines and 
processing sites at the end of their 
producing lives to a condition acceptable 
to the relevant authorities. The provision 
has been calculated taking into account 
the estimated future obligations including 
the costs of dismantling and removal of 
facilities, restoration and monitoring of 
the affected areas. The provision for future 
restoration costs is the best estimate of the 
present value of the expenditure required 
to settle the restoration obligation at the 
reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates 
Estimates of recoverable quantities of 
reserves include assumptions on commodity 
prices, exchange rates, discount rates and 
production costs for future cash flows. 
It also involves assessment and judgment of 
complex geological models. The economic, 
geological and technical factors used to 
estimate ore reserves may change from 
period to period. Changes in ore reserves 
affect the carrying values of mine properties, 
property, plant and equipment, provision 
for rehabilitation assets and deferred 
taxes. Ore reserves are integral to the 
amount of depreciation and amortisation 
charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and the calculation 
in the valuation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground 
mine at Sukari are partly based on estimates 
regarding future resource and reserve 
growth. It should be specifically noted that 
the potential quantity and grade from the 
Sukari underground mine is conceptual 
in nature, that there has been insufficient 
exploration to define a mineral resource and 
that it is uncertain if further exploration will 
result in the target being delineated as a 
mineral resource.
Depreciation of capitalised underground 
mine development costs 
Depreciation of capitalised underground 
mine development costs at the Sukari 
Gold Mine is based on reserve estimates. 
Management and directors believe that 
these estimates are both realistic and 
conservative, based on current information. 
EMRA profit share
Payments made to EMRA pursuant to the 
provisions of the Concession Agreement 
are recognised as a variable charge in the 
income statement (below profit after tax) 
of Centamin, which leads to a reduction 
in the earnings per share. The profit share 
payments during the year will be reconciled 
against SGM’s audited June 2017 financial 
statements. Any variation between 
payments made during the year (which are 
based on the Company’s estimates) and 
the audited financial statements, may result 
in a balance due and payable to EMRA 
or advances to be offset against future 
distributions.
Egyptian pound 
The group operates predominantly in 
Egypt. The group receives its income from 
gold sales in US dollars, however, it is 
offset by the fact that in November 2016, 
the Egyptian government floated the 
Egyptian pound in an attempt to stabilise 
its economy. This has led to a significant 
devaluation of the currency which has led 
to an increase in inflation. This is a potential 
risk for the group as it has led to increases 
in the prices of fuel, raw materials and 
other goods as well as pressure to increase 
staff wages.

7. EMRA profit share
EMRA is entitled to a share of 50% of SGM’s net production surplus which can be defined as ‘revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to 
Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) and recoverable costs’. However, in accordance with the terms of the Concession Agreement, in the first 
and second years in which there is a profit share, PGM will be entitled to an additional 10% of net production surplus and an additional 5% 
in the third and fourth years.

Entitlements to EMRA pursuant to the provisions of the Concession Agreement are recognised as a variable charge in the income 
statement (below profit after tax) of Centamin, which leads to a reduction in the earnings per share. The profit share payments during the 
year will be reconciled against SGM’s audited June 2017 financial statements. 
Any variation between payments made during the year (which are based on the Company’s estimates) and the audited financial statements, 
may result in a balance due and payable to EMRA or advances to be offset against future distributions. This will be reflected as an accrual 
or prepayment in each reporting period.
Centamin elected to make advance payments against future profit share from 2013 onwards and the value of these payments amounted 
to US$28.75 million. These payments were recovered by PGM during the year by way of net off against EMRA’s entitlement to profit share 
during the period.

EMRA and PGM benefit from advance distributions of profit share which are made on a weekly/fortnightly basis and proportionately in 
accordance with the terms of the Concession Agreement. Future distributions will take into account ongoing cash flows, historic costs that 
are still to be recovered and any future capital expenditure. The profit share payments during the year will be reconciled against SGM’s 
audited June 2017 financial statements. 
Subsequent to year end further profit share advance distributions totalling US$7 million have been made to EMRA.  Centamin plc

8. Tax 
The group operates in several countries and, accordingly, it is subject to the various tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. From 
time to time the group is subject to a review of its related tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing 
authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the group’s business conducted within the country involved. If the group 
is unable to resolve any of these matters favourably, there may be an adverse impact on the group’s financial performance, cash flows or 
results of operations. In the event that management’s estimate of the future resolution of these matters changes, the group will recognise 
the effects of the changes in its consolidated financial statements in the period that such changes occur. 
In Australia, Centamin Egypt Limited and Pharaoh Gold Mines NL have elected to form a tax-consolidated group and therefore are treated 
as a single entity for Australian income tax purposes. Pharaoh Gold Mines NL benefits from the “Branch Profits Exemption” whereby 
foreign branch income will generally not be subject to Australian income tax.
In Egypt, Centamin has entered into a concession agreement that provides that the income generated by Sukari Gold Mining Company’s 
activities is granted a long term tax exemption from all taxes imposed in Egypt.

Tax consolidation
Relevance of tax consolidation to the consolidated entity 
Companies within the group’s wholly owned Australian resident entities formed a tax-consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2003. 
The head entity within the tax-consolidated group is Centamin Egypt Limited. The members of the tax-consolidated group are Pharaoh 
Gold Mines NL, Viking Resources NL and North African Resources NL. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
137
Nature of tax funding arrangements and tax‑sharing agreements 
Entities within the tax-consolidated group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax-sharing agreement with the head entity. 
Under the terms of the tax-funding agreement, Centamin Egypt Limited and each of the entities in the tax-consolidated group have agreed 
to pay a tax-equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax liability or current tax asset of the entity. Such amounts 
are reflected in amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax-consolidated group. 
The tax-sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax-consolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation 
of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been 
recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax-sharing agreement is 
considered remote.

Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost.
All gold and silver sales during the year were made to a single customer in North America and are neither past due or impaired.
The average age of the receivables is nine days (2015: 14 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. There are no trade receivables 
past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been recognised. Of the trade receivables 
balance, the gold sales debtor is all a receivable from Asahi Refining of Canada. The amount due has been received in full subsequent to 
year end. Other receivables represent GST and VAT amounts owing from the various jurisdictions that the group operates in and inventory 
returns to vendors where refunds are expected to occur.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value. Centamin plc

Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO“) dispute 
As more fully described in note 21 below, the group is currently involved in court action concerning the price at which it is supplied with 
DFO. Since January 2012, the group has had to pay for DFO at the international price rather than the subsidised price which it believes 
it is entitled to. It is seeking recovery of the funds advanced since 2012 through court action. However, management recognises the 
practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this reason has, fully provided against the prepayment 
of US$231.2 million to 31 December 2016 of which US$24.6 million was provided for during 2016.
In order to allow a better understanding of the financial information presented within the consolidated financial statements, and specifically 
the group’s underlying business performance, the effect of the Diesel Fuel Oil dispute is shown below. 
This has resulted in a net charge of US$24.6 million in the profit and loss.

Contingent liabilities
Fuel supply
In January 2012, the group received a letter from Chevron (its then fuel supplier) to the effect that Chevron would not be able to continue 
supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices. It is understood that the reason that this letter was issued 
was that Chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). It is understood 
that EGPC itself took the decision to issue this instruction because it had received legal advice from the Legal Advice Department of 
the Council of State (an internal government advisory department) that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt 
were not entitled to such subsidies. In addition, during 2012, the Company received a demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel 
subsidies received in the period from late 2009 through to January 2012, for EGP403 million (approximately US$21.8 million at current 
exchange rates).
The group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State) and in consequence in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the 
group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is every prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and in 
order to ensure the continuation of supply, the group has since January 2012 advanced funds to its fuel supplier, Chevron, based on the 
international price for diesel. As at the date of the financial statements, no final decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter.
In September 2016, the State Commissioner’s Office produced a report containing non-binding recommendations for the Administrative 
Court in which the case is proceeding. The report’s findings were unfavourable to the group. The group’s legal advisers do not believe the 
report properly addresses the substantive merits of the group’s case and, as such, the Company continues vigorously to pursue its claim. 
The Company has prepared a response to the report which it will submit at the next hearing in the case. The group remains of the view that 
an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to recover funds advanced thus far should the court 
proceeding be successfully concluded. However, management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from 
the government and for this reason has fully provided against the prepayment of US$231.2 million. Refer to note 12 of the accompanying 
financial statements for further details on the impact of this provision on the group’s results for 2016.
No provision has been made in respect of the historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based on legal advice, the Company believes that 
the prospects of a court finding in its favour in relation to this matter remain very strong.
Concession Agreement court case 
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, amongst others, an 
independent member of a previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the agreement that confers on the group rights to 
operate in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, was entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Mineral 
Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”), and was approved by the People’s 
Assembly as Law no. 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient evidence had been 
submitted to court in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation lease” between PGM and EMRA had received approval from the 
relevant minister as required by the terms of the Concession Agreement. Accordingly, the court found that the exploitation lease in respect of 
the area of 160km
2
 was not valid although it stated that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. Centamin, however, 
is in possession of the executed original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the 
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the court.
Upon notification of the judgment the group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine at Sukari. These 
included lodging a formal appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 2012. In addition, in conjunction with the 
formal appeal the group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to suspend the initial decision until such time as the court was able 
to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. On 20 March 2013 the court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision 
and providing assurance that normal operations would be able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way.
EMRA has lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter which is supportive of the Company’s position in this matter. 
Furthermore, in late December 2012, the Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter publicly indicated that, 
in his view, the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and that the “exploitation lease” was valid. The Minister of Petroleum also 
expressed support for the investment and expertise that Centamin brings to the country. The Company believes this demonstrates the 
government’s commitment to its investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
The Company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from a number of leading Egyptian law firms who have confirmed 
that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km² lease. In addition, the Company has been advised that it 
should benefit from Law no. 32 of 2014, which came into force in April 2014 and which restricts the capacity for third parties to challenge 
any contractual agreement between the Egyptian government and an investor. This law, whilst in force and ratified by the new parliament, 
is currently under review by the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt. It therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on 
strong legal grounds and will ultimately be successful. The appeal was stayed by the Supreme Administrative Court in June 2016 until the 
Supreme Constitutional Court rules on the validity of Law no. 32 of 2014. If the Supreme Constitutional Court upholds Law no. 32, the 
group is advised that it will benefit from its provisions. In the event that the Supreme Constitutional Court rules that Law no. 32 is invalid, 
the group remains confident that its appeal will be successful on the merits.  Centamin plc

Contingent liabilities continued
Concession Agreement court case continued 
In the event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the group, the operations at Sukari 
may be adversely effected to the extent that the group’s operation exceeds the exploitation lease area of 3km
2
 referred to in the original 
court decision. 
The Company remains confident that normal operations at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process is under way. Centamin does 
not currently see the need to take the matter to a court outside of Egypt as Centamin remains of the belief that the Egyptian Court will rule 
in Centamin’s favour.

Through its wholly owned subsidiary, PGM, the Company entered into the Concession Agreement with EMRA and the Arab Republic of 
Egypt granting PGM and EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals in specific concession areas 
located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Concession Agreement came into effect under Egyptian law on 13 June 1995.
In 2005 PGM, together with EMRA, were granted an exploitation lease over 160km
2
 surrounding the Sukari Gold Mine site. The exploitation 
lease was signed by PGM, EMRA and the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and gives tenure for a period of 30 years, commencing 
24 May 2005 and extendable by PGM for an additional 30 years upon PGM providing reasonable commercial justification.
In 2006 SGM was incorporated under the laws of Egypt. SGM was formed to conduct exploration, development, exploitation and 
marketing operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement. Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the project rests 
with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM. Centamin plc  
Annual report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fiscal terms of the Concession Agreement require that PGM solely funds SGM. PGM is however entitled to recover from sales revenue 
recoverable costs, as defined in the Concession Agreement. EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production surplus or profit share 
(defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). As at 31 December 2015, PGM had not recovered its 
cost and accordingly, no EMRA entitlement had been recognised at that date. During 2016 payments to EMRA commenced as advance 
profit share distributions. Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a 
variable charge in the income statement.
The Concession Agreement grants certain tax exemptions, including the following:
• from 1 April 2010, being the date of commercial production, the Sukari Gold Mine is entitled to a 15-year exemption from any taxes 
imposed by the Egyptian government on the revenues generated from the Sukari Gold Mine. PGM and EMRA intend that SGM will in 
due course file an application to extend the tax free period for a further 15 years. The extension of the tax free period requires that there 
has been no tax problems or disputes in the initial period and that certain activities in new remote areas have been planned and agreed 
by all parties;
• PGM and SGM are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of machinery, equipment and consumable 
items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at the Sukari Gold Mine. The exemption shall only apply if there is no 
local substitution with the same or similar quality to the imported machinery, equipment or consumables. Such exemption will also be 
granted if the local substitution is more than 10% more expensive than the imported machinery, equipment or consumables after the 
additional of the insurance and transportation costs;
• PGM, EMRA and SGM and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export of gold and associated 
minerals produced from the Sukari Gold Mine;
• PGM at all times is free to transfer in US$ or other freely convertible foreign currency any cash of PGM representing its share of net 
proceeds and recovery of costs, without any Egyptian government limitation, tax or duty;
• PGM’s contractors and sub-contractors are entitled to import machinery. Equipment and consumable items under the “Temporary 
Release System” which provided exemption from Egyptian customs duty; and
• legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed and movable 
assets remains with PGM and SGM.

The audit and risk committee and the external auditor have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the auditor’s objectivity and 
independence could be compromised. These safeguards include the implementation of a policy on the use of the external auditor for 
non-audit related services.
Where it is deemed that the work to be undertaken is of a nature that is generally considered reasonable to be completed by the auditor 
of the Company for sound commercial and practical reasons, the conduct of such work will be permissible provided that it has been 
pre-approved. All these services are also subject to a predefined fee limit. Any work performed in excess of this limit must be approved 
by the audit and risk committee. Centamin plc

(a) Group risk management
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the cash and equity balance. The group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from the 
previous financial period.
The group has no debt and thus not geared at the year end or in the prior year. The capital structure consists of cash and cash equivalents 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital and reserves as disclosed in notes 18 and 19. The group 
operates in Australia, Jersey, Egypt, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. None of the group’s entities are subject to externally imposed 
capital requirements.
The group utilises inflows of funds toward the ongoing exploration and development of the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt, and the exploration 
projects in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.

(b) Financial risk management and objectives
The group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential risk 
adverse effects and ensure that net cash flows are sufficient to support the delivery of the group’s financial targets whilst protecting future 
financial security. The group continually monitors and tests its forecast financial position against these objectives.
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market; commodity; credit; liquidity; foreign exchange; and interest rate. 
These risks are managed under board approved directives through the audit committee. The group’s principal financial instruments 
comprise interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Other financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables, which arise 
directly from operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, group policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
(c) Market risk
The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the Australian dollar, Great British pound and Egyptian pound. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and 
recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The risk is measured by 
regularly monitoring, forecasting and performing sensitivity analyses on the group’s financial position.
Financial instruments denominated in Great British pound, Australian dollar and Egyptian pound are as follows:

US$/EGP decrease by 10%    (639) (726) — —
The group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased at the end of the current period mainly due to the decrease in foreign currency 
cash holdings in Australian dollars and a corresponding increase in US dollar cash holdings.
The amounts shown above are the main currencies which the group is exposed to. Centamin also has small deposits in euro (US$114,553) 
and West African franc (US$505,182), and net payables of US$593,457 in euro and US$1,134,928 in West African franc. A movement of 
10% up or down in these currencies would have a negligible effect on the assets/liabilities.
The group has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign currency 
liabilities. The Company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency holdings in line with underlying 
requirements and commitments.
(d) Commodity price risk
The group’s future revenue forecasts are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, in particular gold prices. The group has not entered into 
forward gold hedging contracts.  Centamin plc

(e) Interest rate risk

nature of these financial instruments. Cash deposits are placed on term period of no more than 30 days at a time.

(f) Liquidity risk 
The group’s liquidity position is managed to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet its financial commitments in a timely and cost 
effective manner.
Ultimate responsibility or liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, who has established an appropriate management 
framework for the management of the group’s funding requirements. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash 
reserves and management monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow. The tables above reflect a 
balanced view of cash inflows and outflows and shows the implied risk based on those values. Trade payables and other financial liabilities 
originate from the financing of assets used in the group’s ongoing operations. These assets are considered in the group’s overall liquidity 
risk. Management continually reviews the group liquidity position including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position 
and maintain appropriate liquidity levels. Centamin plc

(g) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. 
The group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit-worthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral or other security 
where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The group measures credit risk on a fair value basis. 
The group’s credit risk is concentrated on one entity, but the group has good credit checks on customers and none of the trade receivables 
from the customer has been past due. Also, the cash balances held in Australian dollars which are held with a financial institution with a high 
credit rating.
The gross carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk 
without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained.
(h) Fair value
The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements represents their respective fair values, 
principally as a consequence of the short term maturity thereof.
(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

28. Share‑based payments 
Restricted share plan 
The Company’s shareholder approved restricted share plan (“RSP”) allows the Company the right to grant Awards (as defined below) to 
employees of the group. Awards may take the form of either conditional share awards, where shares are transferred conditionally upon the 
satisfaction of performance conditions; or share options, which may take the form of nil cost options or have a nominal exercise price, the 
exercise of which is again subject to satisfaction of applicable performance conditions. 
The awards due to be granted in June 2017 will vest following the passing of three years. Vesting will be subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance conditions (and the two-year holding period for 50% of the award) which will be divided into four tranches, as set out on 
page 104 of the directors’ remuneration report. These measures are assessed by reference to current market practice and the remuneration 
committee will have regard to current market practice when establishing the precise performance conditions for awards.
To date the Company has granted the following conditional awards to employees of the group.
June 2015 Awards
Of the 5,145,000 awards granted on 4 June 2015 under the RSP , 3,845,000 awards remain granted to eligible participants (18 in total) and 
apply the following performance criteria:
• 20% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to a target total shareholder return;
• 50% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to absolute growth in earnings per share; and
• 30% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to compound growth in gold production.
June 2016 Awards
Of the 4,999,000 awards granted on 4 June 2016 under the RSP , 4,704,000 awards remain granted to eligible participants (31 in total) 
applying the following performance criteria:
• 20% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to a target total shareholder return;
• 30% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to mineral reserve replacement and growth;
• 20% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to compound growth in EBIDTA; and
• 30% of the Award shall be assessed by reference to compound growth in gold production.
Conditional share awards and options together constitute “Awards” under the plan and those in receipt of Awards are “Award Holders”.
A detailed summary of the scheme rules is set out in the 2015 AGM proxy materials which are available at www.centamin.com. In brief, 
Awards will vest following the passing of three years from the date of the Award and vesting will be subject to satisfaction of performance 
conditions. The above measures are assessed by reference to current market practice and the remuneration committee will have regard to 
market practice when establishing the precise performance conditions for future Awards.
Where the performance conditions have been met, in the case of conditional Awards, 50% of the total shares under the Award will be 
issued or transferred to the Award Holders on or as soon as possible following the specified vesting date, with the remaining 50% being 
issued or transferred on the second anniversary of the vesting date.

(1) The vesting of 20% of the awards granted under this plan are dependent on a TSR performance condition. As relative TSR is defined as a market condition 
under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’, this requires that the valuation model used takes into account the anticipated performance outcome. We have 
therefore applied a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The simulation model takes into account the probability of performance based on the expected 
volatility of Centamin and the peer group companies and the expected correlation of returns between the companies in the comparator group. 
The remaining 80% of the awards are subject to reserve, EBITDA and gold production performance conditions. As these are classified as 
non-market conditions under IFRS 2 they do not need to be taken into account when determining the fair value. These grants have been valued 
using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value calculated was then converted at the closing GBP:US$ foreign exchange rate on that day. Centamin plc

Deferred bonus share plan (“DBSP”)
In 2012, the Company implemented the DBSP , which is a long term share incentive arrangement for senior management (but not executive 
directors) and other employees (participants).
On 4 June 2013, the group offered to both the beneficiaries of the shares awarded under the Employee Loan Funded Share Plan (“ELFSP”) 
and to the majority of the beneficiaries of the options granted under the Employee Option Scheme (“EOS”) the choice to replace their 
awards and options with awards under the DBSP . The group has accounted for this change as modifications to the share-based payment 
plans and will be recognising the incremental fair value granted, measured in accordance with IFRS 2, by this replacement over the vesting 
period of the new DBSP awards.
Under this offer, each participant has been granted a number of awards under the DBSP equivalent to the number of shares or options held 
under the ELFSP and EOS respectively. Such DBSP awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the DBSP and shall ordinarily vest 
in three equal tranches on the anniversary of the grant date, conditional upon the continued employment with the group. All offers made to 
participants were accepted. The award of the deferred shares will not have any performance criteria attached. They will however be subject 
to a service period.

➜ ➜ Case study: logging and assembly editing for Granada
“ During the logging phase, up to 20 individuals were 
simultaneously working on the rushes via standard desktop 
PCs in Granada. This enabled the editors and producer/directors 
to begin the editing process immediately. Whilst the loggers 
were logging, the directors were simultaneously viewing 
the logged material, mapping out their programmes prior to 
editing. Compared to the length of time and inconvenience of 
conventional logging solutions, this is an incredible leap forward.” 
Jo Manser, Head of Post Production, Nats
In the summer of 2005 Granada used FORscene 
to automate its entire logging process for the 
new reality show ‘Trust Me I’m a Holiday Rep’. 
It compressed and uploaded footage directly to 
the FORscene platform on the internet where it 
was accessible for logging through any desktop 
PC or Mac with a broadband internet connection. 
Chosen to reduce the cost and increase the 
efficiency of the project, FORscene was 
delivered to Granada under licence by Nats Post 
Production. The tool was initially brought in to 
electronically log all the footage generated. 
However, the producer/directors working on 
the series were so impressed by FORscene’s 
overall functionality and ease of use that they 
started to use it to create assembly edits. 
‘Trust Me I’m a Holiday Rep’, was ﬁlmed in 
Cyprus and aired on Five in September 2005.
“ Conventional logging techniques create huge challenges 
for broadcasters due to the time consuming reality of 
logging time codes and adding commentary by hand 
– this is especially true in the realm of reality TV . Forbidden 
Technologies is one of the few companies in the post 
production sector able to rise to these challenges by 
providing an automated tool, FORscene.”
Stephen Streater, CEO, Forbidden Technologies
Forbidden Technologies plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 04 Chairman’s statement
In the year to 31 December 2005, the sixth year of our 
development, the company recorded sales of £59,705 
compared to £76,788 in the previous year. Administrative 
expenses were £874,637 (2004: £787,563) and the loss 
for the year was £725,379 (2004: loss of £614,127).
At the year end the balance sheet showed £957,369  
of net current assets (2004: £1.68 million) and liquid 
resources of £876,919 (2004: £1.61 million).
The lower sales level is a reflection of the change in our 
business model from the licensing of individual copies 
of our compression software to organisations putting 
video onto websites, to the delivery of logging and 
editing solutions to television post production teams.
The increase in administrative expenses was almost 
entirely due to the recruitment of new staff.
The balance sheet reflects the continuing tight control 
which is exercised over all costs in the company.
Strategy
In the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2004 
the board outlined a revised strategy for the company 
and indicated key market sectors upon which Forbidden 
would concentrate:
1. Professional post production
2. Consumer (i.e. in-home) editing and publishing
3. Intruder and fire security
To date these sectors have proven to be an appropriate 
selection. Mobile phone applications which we 
previously identified separately are now an integral  
part of each of our sector offerings. All three of these 
sectors are developed from the same core platform – 
FORscene. All gain from improvements in our dynamic 
R & D activities and our ability to enhance our products 
to meet our partners’ and customers’ individual needs.
The pace of commercialisation in each sector has varied 
through the past year as we have flexed our resource 
allocations to reflect the urgency and immediacy of 
each opportunity, however, the chosen strategic 
sectors remain our focus going forward.
Market place
As predicted, 2005 saw significant growth of the key 
technologies and their market penetration in the UK 
which are critical to the expansion of our business. 
Computers provided much increased storage capacity, 
broadband connections accelerated at a remarkable rate 
to a level today in excess of 10 million homes and the 
typical broadband speed on new computers has gone 
from 512Kbps to around 2Mbps. Broadband costs have 
come down from an average of £20+ per month to the 
latest launch of free broadband 8Mb connection from 
Carphone Warehouse. Picture quality on mobile phones 
has increased significantly. The latest models can now 
capture video at near VHS quality.
All of these developments increase the potential sales 
revenues of the company’s products, since they are the 
pre requisite conditions upon which our research and 
development efforts have been based.
Current activities
Professional post production
The continuing development and refinement of 
FORscene has been our top priority over the past six 
months. It has absorbed a high proportion of our R & D 
effort as interest and involvement of major broadcasters 
and partners has increased month by month throughout 
the various pilots that have been taking place. Individual 
customer needs have been identified and satisfied.
FORscene is a truly revolutionary product in the post 
production process of programme creation and is 
described as ‘disruptive technology’ by experts in the 
“ Our shareholders should begin to see signiﬁcant 
change in the proﬁle of the business.”
Forbidden Technologies plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 05 Chairman’s statement continued
industry. In December 2005, Forbidden won the 
Royal Television Society Award for the best 
technology innovation in the post production 
process. The award ceremony was videoed on one 
of the new generation mobile phones, uploaded over 
the air into FORscene, edited and published for web 
and mobile delivery. It can be seen on our website at  
http://www.forbidden.co.uk/videos/rts/.
FORscene provides very high value by saving both 
significant time and money and simplifying life for loggers, 
editors, producers and directors. More detail is provided  
in the Chief Executive’s Review in the next pages.
Post production costs can represent 25% or more of 
total programme costs, and, as the hours shot increase 
for productions (partly driven by lower costs of digital 
footage), so the attraction of significant savings offered 
by FORscene increases. This is a world wide market and 
is worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year.
Another example of the power of the FORscene 
platform is its use by the British Army to publish 
frequent videos, recording an expedition to Mount 
Everest. The videos can be downloaded onto mobile 
phones of interested parties and potential army recruits 
as part of an Army recruitment drive.
FORscene will also be used by IBC TV News at the 
International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam 
in September, providing a most appropriate exposure 
of our mobile capability.
Consumer editing and publishing
Clesh is the consumer version of FORscene. You can 
sign up for Clesh at our website at http://info.clesh.com.
The consumer use of video clips is soaring following  
the introduction of internet video sites such as Google 
Video and YouTube, where consumers contribute and 
share their video content.
A site such as YouTube in the USA has grown in twelve 
months to have 40 million video clips per day viewed 
by its members, demonstrating the explosive potential 
of the web as the primary medium for communication.
Clesh was introduced to the UK market in early 2006 
through a promotion with Tiscali, the internet and 
broadband company. Consumers now have access to  
a free, basic account through the Clesh.com website.
Forbidden Technologies plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06
Forbidden’s office  constituents to be able to take its place in this explosion:
a)  Simplicity and accessibility: go to the web page and 
Clesh is there.
b)  It is cross-platform: it can be used on PC, mobile or 
video iPod.
c)  The content is generated by the user and consumer: 
the more videos that people put into the system the 
more there is to view.
During the next year the strategic imperative for Clesh is 
to build our customer base by attracting large groups of 
consumers to share their videos across the globe.
Intruder and fire security
In the latter stages of the year, management took  
the decision to focus resources on the immediate 
opportunity for FORscene in the broadcast market 
rather than an intruder and fire security product. 
However, the company intends to use the FORscene 
platform to develop a competitive product in this large 
market, albeit at a somewhat later date than was 
anticipated previously.
Board and staff
During 2005 the board welcomed Phil Madden  
as Finance Director following the retirement of  
Douglas Blaikie. One sales person resigned to relocate 
abroad and two new employees joined the Company.
Our thanks are owed to the dedication, enthusiasm and 
skill of our team in all capacities and it continues to be 
a pleasure to see such good product and service output, 
consistently achieved.
Prospects
In the interim report for 2005 I indicated that the 
company had high confidence in significant sales 
expansion in 2006. This continues to be our view and 
orders in the first quarter are significantly ahead of the 
first six months of the previous year. If our expectations 
of the outcome of the various pilots and projects with 
broadcasters are realised, our shareholders should begin 
to see significant change in the profile of the business.

Chief Executive’s review
Introduction
In last year’s review, I outlined some of the technical 
and market expectations which have been fulfilled since 
the Forbidden Technologies flotation. Forbidden has 
applied its technology in an increasingly focused way 
as part of its plan to create the video platform for the 
internet – FORscene.
Internet video platform
The internet is becoming a major force in video creation 
and distribution. Consider the features to expect in an 
internet video platform:
➜ internet based – accessed through a web browser
➜ no installation – can run on any / every computer
➜ no configuration – easy to get up and running
➜ low cost or free
➜ simple to learn
➜ cross-platform editing – PC, Mac, Linux
➜  cross-platform publishing – Desktop, Mobile phone, 
video iPod
➜ wide in scope:
 – reviewing
 – logging
 – editing
 – web publishing
 – mobile / iPod publishing
 – hosting
➜ available in volume
The year has seen a further expansion of FORscene’s 
web and mobile publishing capability and a major 
acceleration in the internet video editing tool. It will 
come as no surprise that Forbidden’s FORscene meets 
all the criteria above for an internet video platform. 
The professional video market
To appreciate the focus of Forbidden’s market entry 
strategy, it helps to understand the workflow in the 
professional video market.
Video post production processes vary widely between 
productions. Video is shot using video cameras, and is 
generally stored on tape. Some or all of the following 
steps may then be carried out:
➜ ingest – transfer of video into the system
➜  review – look through source material and note what 
is there
➜  log – add transcript / enable shots to be found simply 
during editing
➜  shot selection – select shots / speech which might  
be useful
➜ shot ordering – construct the story
➜  rough cut – order the shots; trim to about the  
right length
➜ possibly re-ingest tape for the offline
➜  offline – make the programme, often at relatively low 
video quality
➜ possible re-ingest tape for the online
➜  online – finish the programme at top video quality  
for broadcast
The strategy has been to introduce FORscene into the 
relatively simple early stages of this process: ingest, 
review and log. As customers discover the benefits of 
our intuitive web based solution, it is simple to move  
up the value chain by just staying on the FORscene 
escalator a bit longer. In the few short months since its 
first broadcast use, FORscene has already moved up  
to shot selection, shot ordering and rough cut.
“ The internet is becoming a major force in video 
creation and distribution. Forbidden’s FORscene 
internet platform is ready for it.” Both FORscene and the global IT infrastructure it runs 
on continue to improve. It is already possible to finish 
entire programmes with FORscene on web and mobile. 
Consumer video – Clesh
Clesh is the consumer interface into the power of 
FORscene, with simplicity of use as the key priority.  
It allows consumers to experience the functionality and 
features of FORscene to edit and share their own video 
and mobile phone footage on the internet, through a 
home PC. The internet is so cheap that we can make 
our consumer version available for free. You can sign  
up for Clesh on our website at http://info.clesh.com/.
As we upgrade the Clesh video library to allow users to 
submit their own content, Clesh will be an increasingly 
attractive one-stop shop for internet video. Higher 
volume users will be able to purchase packages with 
extra features, extra storage, extra views and extra 
editing time, depending on requirements.
Technology
Underlying all Forbidden’s work is its technological strength.
Forbidden’s video compression technology has provided 
a unique codec designed for web-based editing. Control 
of the codec has led to improvements all the way 
through from storyboard editing to web publishing.
Forbidden’s Java player gives almost universal reach  
to Windows, Macs and PCs. The web player, which does 
not require installation, security updates or machine 
configuration, will play automatically on standard 
machines. Forbidden upgrades its Java player to  
meet the evolving needs of the market.
These days, high end mobile phones have internet 
access. Mobile publishing is a key component of 
Forbidden’s armoury.
FORscene is robust, automatically tuning itself to work 
well on a wide range of computer speeds and internet 
connection speeds.
These technical solutions are not easily copied by third 
parties as the expertise required is so specialised and 
has taken a long time to accumulate.
Technology award
FORscene has been recognised in the recent Royal 
Television Society Technology Award, awarded by the 
unanimous decision of the judges.
FORscene is the perfect product for this potentially 
vast and exciting market.
Shareholder offer
This year’s shareholder offer is £1,000 worth of free 
credits. The form is at the back of the annual report 
and accounts.
Regulatory (IFRS)
Forbidden Technologies plc expects to adopt IFRS in the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007. 
The board has begun considering the differences 
between UK accounting standards and IFRS, and have 
identified ‘accounting for development’ costs as an area 
which could impact on the Company’s financial statements 
going forward.

Corporate governance
In June 1998, the London Stock Exchange published the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice 
(the Combined Code) which embraces the work of the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel committees and became 
effective in respect of accounting periods ending on or after December 1998.
The listing rules require that listed companies (but not companies traded on the Alternative Investment Market “ AIM”) 
incorporated in the UK should state in the report and accounts whether they comply with the Code of Best Practice 
and identify and give reasons for any area of non-compliance. The company is listed on AIM and therefore no 
disclosure is required.
The company supports the principles and aims of the code and follows the code wherever it is reasonable to do so. 
It operates an effective board which meets on a timely basis.
The board is aware of the requirements of the code and the need for appropriate controls and systems to safeguard 
the company’s assets. Wherever possible appropriate controls are in place and monitored by the board. However, 
full compliance with the code is not possible because of the size and resource constraints of the company and 
because of the relative cost benefit assessment in putting in place the additional procedures.
As the company grows in size and resources the board intends to increase its compliance.
This is not a statement of compliance as required by the Combined Code and should therefore not be relied 
upon to give the disclosures that would normally be made.
Political and charitable donations
The company made no political or charitable donations in the year (2004: £nil).
Research and development
The company has carried on research and development during the year, the costs of which are written off to the 
profit and loss account.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc 
as auditors of the company is to be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

Directors’ report (continued) Forbidden Technologies plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 15
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company 
and of the profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
➜ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
➜ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
➜  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
➜  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report that complies with that law.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities 16
Forbidden Technologies plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005
We have audited the financial statements of Forbidden Technologies plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 
which comprise the profit and loss account, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement and the related notes. 
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities on page 15, the company’s directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and UK accounting standards 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not 
consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend 
to any other information.
Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Forbidden Technologies plc Forbidden Technologies plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2005 17
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion 
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
➜  the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its loss for the year 
then ended; and
➜  have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered 
material in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below. In these financial statements the following 
new standards have been adopted for the first time: 
➜ FRS 21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’; 
➜ the presentation requirements of FRS 25 ‘Financial instruments: presentation and disclosure’; and
➜ FRS 28 ‘Corresponding amounts’.
FRS 28 ‘Corresponding amounts’ has had no material effect as it imposes the same requirements for comparatives 
as hitherto required by the Companies Act 1985. 
Fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by 
equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows. A full year’s charge is provided in 
the year of acquisition:
Leasehold improvements – Over the life of lease 
Fixtures and fittings – 50% straight line per annum 
Computer equipment – 50% straight line per annum
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Employee share schemes
The cost of awards to employees that take the form of rights to shares are recognised over the period of the 
employee’s related performance. The company does not issue options at below market price. National insurance 
contributions are accrued in accordance with standard accounting practice.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research and development is written off to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing 
differences. Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance 
sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the provision of goods and services to 
customers. For the supply of equipment and maintenance charges, turnover is recognised at the time of invoicing 
and invoices are raised upon the completion of the services provided. Revenue derived from the sale of FORscene 
credits is recognised on an accruals basis in line with the amount of editing time used. FORscene credits that have 
been billed but not used are treated as deferred revenue.

Cash and liquid resources
Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, 
less overdrafts payable on demand. Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without 
curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at, or close to, 
their carrying values or traded in an active market. Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year 
and a corporate bond.

Turnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the principal activity and has been 
entirely earned within the UK.

The company believes that share ownership by executive directors and key staff strengthens the link between their 
personal interests and those of the shareholders. It therefore operates both an approved and an unapproved share 
option scheme under which options have been granted.
The exercise price must not be less than the higher of 1) the nominal value of the share and 2) the market value 
of the share at the date of the grant.

results. Across Mainstream, this year  
we reported record levels of customer 
satisfaction, up two percentage points from 
2012 to reach 79% (2012: 77%). Further  
to this, our higher-margin unique holiday 
sales increased by four percentage points, 
accounting for 69% of Mainstream holidays 
sold (2012: 65%), proving that our strategy  
to focus on unique holidays is working. 
For more information, please see page 54 
Dividends
We have a progressive dividend policy and  
it is the Group’s aim to maintain underlying 
dividend cover at around two times. 
Reflecting this year’s performance, the Board 
is recommending a final dividend per share  
of 9.75p per share (2012: 8.3p), an increase  
of 17%. At the time of our interim results, the 
Board proposed an increase of 10% to 3.75p 
(2012: 3.4p), leading to a full year dividend of 
13.5p per share, up 15% from 11.7p in 2012. 
Board
On 8 February 2013 I was appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director, and on 25 March 
2013, was appointed to replace Dr Michael 
Frenzel as Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Board following his retirement. On the same 
day, Sebastian Ebel became a Non-Executive 
Director. 
For more information on the Board, please  
see page 66 
Sustainable development
TUI Travel is a truly worldwide organisation 
and we are committed to operating our 
business in a sustainable manner. We have  
a three-year Sustainable Holidays Plan, 
launched in 2012, which sets out four 
overarching goals with 20 measurable  
and challenging commitments to responsible 
tourism. In this report we highlight progress 
from the second year of the plan and were 
pleased to see some promising results, 
particularly in terms of carbon management. 
We achieved our airline carbon reduction 
target of 9% (2008-2014) one year ahead  
of schedule with a reduction in our airlines’ 
per passenger carbon emissions of 3.2% 
year-on-year to 70.7g CO
2/RPK (2012: 73.0g 
CO 2/RPK).
Sustainability is ingrained in our business 
culture, not just for our own future as a 
business but as industry leaders to set an 
example to the wider travel industry and 
beyond. 
For more information, please visit page 26 
Colleagues
The customer is at the centre of everything 
we do, but equally important to our success 
are our colleagues. TUI Travel is an 
organisation built from a workforce of over 
55,000 dedicated colleagues worldwide, all  
of whom share a common set of values which 
together creates TUI Travel and drives our 
performance as a market leader.
The hard work and commitment of this 
network of colleagues is vital to the success 
we have had to date. They play an integral 
part in driving our future growth. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank personally 
every one of our colleagues for putting in 
such a fantastic effort and helping us achieve 
the performance we have had in this 
record-breaking year. 
Friedrich Joussen 
Non-Executive Chairman
This has been another record breaking 
year for TUI Travel. It is my first year  
as Chairman of the Company and I am 
delighted to report a 20% increase in 
underlying operating profit to £589m,  
or 13% on a constant currency basis to 
£555m (2012: £490m). This has generated 
growth in our underlying basic earnings 
per share (EPS), having increased by  
19% to 30.8p (2012: 25.8p). Our statutory 
operating profit decreased slightly to 
£297m (2012: £301m) largely due to the 
£188m impairment of goodwill, meaning 
our statutory EPS has moved from  
12.5p to 5.4p for 2013. 
We operate in a market segment that, as a 
matter of course, has to weather geo-political 
events. As a result, it is vital that we have  
a strong and resilient business model that 
enables us to deliver on our strategy, which  
in turn drives long-term sustainable growth 
and increased shareholder returns. All of 
which, I am pleased to report, have been 
achieved this year. 
The travel and tourism sector has continued 
to grow by an average of 4% annually since 
1995, and is forecast to grow by 3.1% in 2013 
alone – outpacing the global economy. The 
comparable growth of TUI Travel is testament 
to what a fantastic year this has been, and 
shows how well we are positioned to continue 
to deliver on our annualised 7-10% growth 
plan. 
Results
Our financial performance comes as a result 
of our continued commitment to delivering 
high-quality unique holidays direct to our 
customers. This is coupled with a resilient 
business model and ambitious yet achievable 
growth roadmap. Our commitment to the 
customer is also delivering measurable 
15% 
Growth in full year

margins, are often booked earlier leading to 
better yield management and efficiency and 
we receive excellent customer feedback that, 
in the majority of cases, leads to repeat 
bookings and advocacy within our customer 
base. One of our flagship unique holiday 
concepts is Sensatori from Thomson, which 
received a 92% customer satisfaction score 
this year. We have continued growing our 
unique holiday portfolio across the Group  
and remain committed to identifying 
opportunities to develop it further. 
Our direct distribution channels are key to 
the Group’s success and enable us to increase 
margin and improve results. The number of 
holidays booked through our Mainstream 
websites continues to increase and this 
remains the core contributor for direct sales. 
Of our direct sales, 35% are online, which 
equates to £3.7 billion in revenue. There is 
still ample opportunity to increase direct 
distribution channels which will help us gain 
further margin across all our source markets. 
We are an online business but we continue  
to drive further enhancements through 
technologies that amplify the customer 
experience at the front-end and drive further 
efficiencies in the back-end processes. In  
May this year we launched the award-winning 
TUI Digital Assistant in the UK as the 
‘MyThomson’ mobile app, which was very well 
received by customers, achieving a five star 
rating in the Apple App Store and topping the 
free download travel app chart shortly after 
launch. Since then, we have had in excess of 
180,000 downloads, proving we understand 
what our customers want and need from 
their travel provider. Post year end, we began 
the TUI Digital Assistant international roll-out 
with the ‘Meine TUI’ mobile app launch in the 
German source market. 
I am pleased to say that we were the first 
business in the UK to take delivery of the 
Boeing 787 d reamliner that has exceeded 
customer and our own expectations in its  
first few months of operation. t his has 
enabled us, and will continue to enable us, to 
fly to new and exciting destinations such as 
Thailand from the UK. In May we committed 
to purchasing 60 new Boeing 737 ma X 
aircraft and secured the option and right  
to purchase another 90 on the same terms.  
The deal will enhance our unique offering, 
replace older aircraft, improve fuel efficiency 
and help secure the future of our six airlines. 
The delivery of the 60 committed aircraft  
will run from January 2018 until March 2023. 
It has been a record year for us but we don’t 
believe it will stop there. We are pleased  
with the performance at the start of Winter 
2013/14, with 60% of the programme sold,  
and we are encouraged by early Summer 
2014 trading against strong comparatives. 
TUI Travel is structurally well positioned  
with a robust business model that gives  
us a long term competitive advantage. The 
business continues to deliver sustainable 
growth through our unique holiday 
experiences, increasingly distributed online, 
whilst leveraging its scale as one organisation. 
This in turn will drive further value for both 
our customers and shareholders. Building  
on this year’s outperformance where we have 
achieved a 20% underlying operating profit 
growth, I remain confident that we will deliver 
consistently on our five year annualised 
growth target of between 7% to 10%.
Our colleagues are the true driver of the 
business. Their commitment, endeavour  
and passion to deliver incredible travel 
experiences for our customers is proven in 
the exceptional results we have announced 
this financial year. I would like to thank each 
and every one of them for the dedication 
they have shown, and continue to show,  
each and every day. Thank you again.
Peter Long 
Chief Executive 
As a Group we have had a great year. 
Because of this, I’d like to start by 
thanking our colleagues across the 
business who have pushed themselves  
to deliver this fantastic set of results. 
Thank you. 
t his financial year has been exceptional and 
our strategy continues to bear fruit. For the 
sixth year running we have delivered a record 
underlying operating profit. t his year we 
achieved £589m (2012: £490m), representing 
growth of 20% over the 12-month period.  
On a constant currency basis, our underlying 
operating profit increased 13% to £555m 
(2012: £490m) surpassing the top end of our 
growth roadmap target (10%). Revenue has 
increased during the financial year by 4% to 
£15.1 billion, or on a constant currency basis, 
2% to £14.7bn (2012: £14.5bn). Our two 
largest source markets saw underlying 
operating profit growth of 27% in the u K and 
30% in Germany, delivering £251m (2012: 
£197m) and £113m (2012: £87m) respectively, 
while margins continue to improve.
Following these results it is obvious that our 
strategy of selling unique holidays directly  
to our customers is the right one. As the 
business continues its move towards a more 
online future, and while we efficiently manage 
our costs, we continue to build upon the 
foundations of a business set for sustainable 
growth. Our colleagues within the business 
care deeply about the customer experience 
and everything we do is built around 
enhancing it at every level, through every 
stage of the customer journey, from dreaming 
of a holiday to sharing it with family and 
friends once they have returned home.
Over two-thirds of Mainstream holidays 
booked are now unique holidays, an increase 
on last year that has been steadily rising  
since 2007 when this became the focus of  
our strategy. t he main benefits of unique 
holidays are five-fold. t hey provide higher

Why we do it: Market overview
t he economic environment
The global economic recovery has maintained the slow pace of 2012, 
with GDP growth recorded at slightly below 3%. This can be attributed 
to weaker domestic demand and continued low growth in several key 
emerging market economies, combined with the ongoing recovery 
from recession in the main European countries. 
While emerging and developing economies registered a 4.5% increase 
in GDP, advanced economies experienced a more modest increase  
of 1.2%. Our two largest source markets, the UK and Germany, saw 
growth of 1.4% and 0.5% respectively in 2013. 
[Source: World Economic Outlook Update (7.10.13), IMF]
Despite this slow growth Germany and the UK have seen 
unemployment decreasing year-on-year. Germany has the second 
lowest unemployment rate in the Eurozone at 5.3% and the UK has 
seen unemployment levels fall to 7.7% in 2013. [Source: EuroStat (2013 Q2)]
t he leisure travel market
2012 was a record year for International Tourism with global international 
arrivals surpassing the 1 billion mark for the first time. 2012 saw 
growth continue at 4%, slightly less than the 4.8% seen in 2011. Europe 
continues to account for over half of worldwide arrivals, reaching 
534 million in 2012. 
The travel market continues to be driven by high growth in online 
bookings and, while the uncertain economic environment has had an 
effect on consumer travel spending habits, demand for leisure travel 
remains strong. 
Customer power has never been greater in the travel and tourism 
market. Developments in technology allow the customer to compare, 
contrast and review their choices as well as interact with suppliers and 
fellow customers worldwide. So whether customers are looking for 
unique holidays with bespoke services or simply want to combine a 
cheap flight with a hotel, they have a wealth of brands and booking 
options from which to choose.
Our business model (see page 15) aims to cater to the changing market 
trends to best serve these differing needs of our customers. The Tour 
Operator model focuses on providing unique holiday experiences, 
coupled with end-to-end service while the Online Accommodation  
model focuses on providing a range of hotels across the globe in line  
with customer demand. This diversity of offering means customers 
searching for traditional all-inclusive packages, multi-stop bespoke 
itineraries or worldwide city breaks can all book with us. 
t he political climate 
As a global organisation, we feel the impact of government regulation 
in all of the markets in which we operate. Some of our activities, such 
as those undertaken by our airline, are heavily regulated. Many of our 
lawmakers, particularly in Europe, are becoming increasingly focused 
upon measures to protect customers.
Our political and regulatory affairs team seek to engage with legislators 
at an early stage in relation to all of those areas of regulation that might 
have a material impact upon the way we do business. Our focus is always 
to work with governments to bring forward legislation that is fit for 
purpose, properly balances the interests of industry and consumers 
and treats all industry players fairly.
The last 12 months have seen significant developments at the 
European level with the Commission proposing new legislation in the 
area of Air Passenger Rights and bringing forward proposals for reform 
of the Package Travel Directive. We have engaged consistently with the 
Commission as they have developed these proposals and will engage 
over the coming 12 months with the European Parliament and the 
Council of Ministers as they come to consider the suggested reforms 
in detail.
Aviation taxation also remains on the agenda as governments across 
the world look for ways to increase revenue. Our role is to remind 
them of the importance of the travel and tourism industry as a driver 
for growth. 
In the UK, the debate on airport capacity continues. We will maintain a 
full role in that debate in order to ensure that the specific requirements 
of leisure airlines and passengers are fully understood.
t he sustainability challenge
Travel and tourism accounts for 9% of global GDP and 6% of global 
exports. The industry will continue to be one of the world’s fastest-
growing sectors, with emerging economies in particular seen as engines 
of such growth (from 47% market share in 2012 and expected to  
reach 57% by 2030*). Tourism today is responsible for 1 in 11 jobs 
globally* but also for 5% of global carbon dioxide emissions**. From  
a sustainable development perspective this poses a challenge – the 
growth of an industry highly dependent on fossil fuels and biodiversity 
in a world of finite natural resources.
Our businesses have been facing up to this challenge for over a decade. 
For TUI Travel, responding to these issues means bringing sustainability 
centre stage, to build on the efficiency and resilience of our business  
and the services it provides. Our Sustainable Holidays Plan is a  
major step forward in our journey towards providing special travel 
experiences whilst minimising environmental impact, respecting the 
culture and people in destinations and bringing real economic benefit 
to local communities. See our Sustainable Development section on 
page 26 for more information.

SHAREHOl DER INFORMATION
Our core markets consist of the UK, Sweden, Germany, France, 
Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Switzerland & 
Canada. Between them they account for £498bn of global travel 
spend. Our four largest source markets of the UK & Ireland, 
Germany, France & Sweden make up over 70% of this spend
*
.
The broad range of product and niche and international 
customer markets that apply to Specialist & Activity businesses 
make it difficult to quantify spend on these holidays but their 
geographical reach and popularity continue to increase.
The total Online Accommodation market accounts for £87bn  
of global travel spend.
Within the Accommodation Wholesaler segment, TUI Travel’s 
addressable market makes up about £17bn of this spend.
The Group also participates in the Accommodation OTA 
segment with focus in the UK, Asia-Pacific and Brazil, which 
accounts for £6.4bn of the total Accommodation OTA market.
Our core markets are projected to grow at a 3% CAGR over the 
next five years. The Mainstream holiday market remains resilient 
and continues to see growth in a tough economic environment.
The Accommodation Online Travel Agent (OTA) market is 
projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.6% over the next five years 
while the Accommodation Wholesaler market is expected to 
grow at a CAGR of 7.8%.
We continue to be the number one tour operator in Europe with 
either number one or two positions in each of our core markets.
In addition, we have market-leading positions in a number 
of specialist segments with a portfolio of unique products, 
unrivalled product knowledge and superb customer experience.
Our Accommodation Wholesaler business (Hotelbeds & 
Bedsonline) continues to lead the market in the B2B space. 
With our Accommodation OTA business we are positioned strongly 
in the UK (LateRooms.com) & Asia-Pacific (AsiaRooms.com) and 
are building our presence in the l atin American market through 
MalaPronta, Brazil’s fourth largest online accommodation OTA.
Customers are increasingly moving towards online channels to 
fulfil their travel needs and we expect this trend to continue into 
2014 and beyond. We therefore remain committed to improving 
our online presence, increasing our participation in social media 
and moving towards an online-driven company culture.
Demand for unique holiday experiences continues to see 
strong growth and with a diverse range of experiences on  
offer, TUI Travel remains well placed.
Online Accommodation continues to be one of the fastest 
growing segments in the leisure travel industry. The recent growth 
is derived from the increase in online bookings coupled with 
strong demand from emerging markets. Online Accommodation, 
therefore, remains a key area for TUI Travel where we look to 
consolidate our leadership position within the Accommodation 
Wholesaler market and build on our international position in 
the Accommodation OTA segment.

How we do it:  
Our five strategic drivers
Over the next few pages we explore what our five strategic 
drivers mean for our Tour Operator and Online Accommodation 
businesses. We will outline why they are important to us, 
how we adhere to them operationally to ensure profitable 
performance, how we know they are working, and finally a 
selection of highlights from this past year. There are distinct 
parallels across some drivers, uniting the two business models, 
while the focus can be considerably different for others.
content c ASe Study 
Strong unique 
products: Sensatori 
& Sensimar 
Sensatori and Sensimar are two 
examples of our unique holiday 
offering, operating out of the UK  
and German markets respectively  
to a variety of destinations worldwide. 
Both concepts provide affordable 
luxury to the customer. Demand 
for these unique holidays continues 
(see KPIs section on page 38) and 
this year a new hotel opened for both 
Sensimar in Andalucía and Sensatori 
in Turkey. 2014 will see Sensatori 
open in Jamaica, and Sensimar  
open its first resort in Mexico. 
We continue to develop these  
unique concepts across all our source 
markets which helps differentiate  
us from our competitors.

o ur content range and diversity  
is attractive to our customers 
w hy?
• An increasing propensity to travel due to global economic 
recovery creates an ever-expanding market place  
of customers looking for a competitive range of 
accommodation product, in terms of both geography  
and price.
• Travellers are increasingly exploring opportunities to 
research and book accommodation product online and  
thus they benefit from our large volume of well-presented 
content and price-competitiveness.
w hat are we doing about it?
• Ensuring that we have a wide variety of product, in terms 
of quality, destination and budget. It is also important that 
our content is translated well digitally, that it is rich, inspiring 
and relevant. 
• The emerging markets are increasingly important to our 
online accommodation businesses, both as a source market 
and as a destination. We have a clear strategy for targeting 
these markets, with particular focus in our five-year plan 
on further expansion in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, 
Americas and Africa.
h ow do we know this is working?
• Over the past year Accommodation Wholesaler (our B2B 
business) TTv has grown in the key regions of Middle East, 
Asia Pacific, Americas and Europe (excluding UK, Spain and 
Portugal) by over 30%. 
• The improvement in our Accommodation OTA hotel 
content is showing early positive signs, especially with the 
use of new ‘unique’ images on Malapronta.com, which has 
led to a positive impact in conversion.
2013 h ighlights
• Our Accommodation Wholesaler business has seen a 16% 
increase in hotel inventory in FY13. 
• The Brazilian Accommodation OTA, MalaPronta, has seen a 
110% increase in its hotel portfolio in the past year across 
the main domestic destinations of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro 
and Curitiba.
u nique content forms the backbone  
of our t our o perator strategy
w hy?
• Unique content is tailored to the differing needs of 
customers, ensuring that we offer the right product  
to the right customer.
• Provides value-added services and features which 
command a margin premium over commodity products.
• Books early when compared to commodity products enabling 
us to manage our capacity and yield more effectively.
• l eads to higher customer satisfaction and an increase  
in repeat bookings.
• Adds value to our brand – ma kes us identifiable and clarifies 
our brand proposition as an end-to-end travel provider.
• Finally, as all of our unique content is exclusive to 
TUI Travel, it also helps create effective barriers to entry 
for our competition.
w hat are we doing about it?
In Mainstream: 
• Continuously reviewing our existing concept portfolio, 
adapting where appropriate for different Source Markets.
• Developing new hotel concepts which are exclusive to our 
brands and in line with customer demand.
• l ooking at concepts from a holistic pan-European perspective, 
which would be suitable for Mainstream as a whole.
In Specialist:
• Maintaining our focus on providing unique experiences 
through our range of brands to cater to a wide range of 
customer needs. 
• In FY13 Hayes & Jarvis launched a tailor-made offering, 
providing seamless service to customers wanting bespoke 
itineraries to places such as India, South Africa and l atin 
America. 
h ow do we know this is working?
• Demand for unique holidays remains strong; in FY13

Offering more tailored products
Across the Nordics, there are a total of 10 next-generation stores that are proving that a 
modern high-street customer experience can complement an online-sales focus. We know 
that this combined strategy is working as a result of the exceptional performance of the 
Nordic countries – 11% increase in underlying operating profit for FY13.
Next-generation stores exist to inspire customers, giving them a modern pre-holiday 
experience in which staff play a more advisory role, rather than the traditional focus on  
sales. In this way, colleagues work with customers to understand their needs, before offering 
advice as to locations that fit their criteria. Stores feature modern technology, world maps 
and virtual brochures on large screens around the shop, for customers to peruse at will. 
Simultaneous to this, online distribution is at an all-time high in the Nordics, up two 
percentage points from 2012 to reach 67% in 2013 – demonstrating that our next-generation 
stores work with, rather than competing against, online points of contact.

SHAREHOl DER INFORMATION
we remain committed to our focus on direct distribution and being online driven 
w hy?
• Increasing numbers of European travellers are researching  
and booking their travel via digital channels; we need to ensure 
we keep in step with our consumers’ evolving behaviour.
• One of the reasons cited for not booking online is the perceived 
lack of personal service. We are working on personalising our 
interactions with customers so we can learn more about what 
they are looking for, what they have booked in the past and 
what interests they have. This in turn informs how we develop 
and tailor our product and service and how we can market to 
and retain these customers more effectively.
• Having strong, recognisable brands plays a key role in the online 
world, helping to increase direct traffic to our websites which 
generally tends to have a higher conversion rate.
• Focusing our distribution on direct channels reduces our reliance 
on third-party agents and allows us to form a direct relationship 
with the customer. This also drives down our distribution costs.
• Direct distribution allows us to have greater control over our 
brands and how they are marketed and sold. The clearer we 
communicate about our brands and what they offer, the more 
likely we are to develop loyal customers who will become 
ambassadors, helping us acquire new customers.
w hat are we doing about it?
• TUI Travel is focused on b eing an ‘online-driven’ business  
providing customers with an easy and inspiring online 
experience. ‘Online-driven’ refers to the entire customer 
journey: inspiration, planning, booking, pre-departure,  
the holiday experience and returning home and sharing.
• 2013 saw the creation of the Mainstream Distribution & Online 
team providing support to all source markets and sharing best 
practice on digital matters, retail operations, CRM and ancillaries. 
This has led to the standardisation of several processes and the 
proliferation of best practice across markets with immediate 
financial benefit.
• A large portion of our market continues to value the face-to-
face service of a travel agency. We are working on transforming 
the traditional agency into the next-generation retail concept 
store to combine the expertise of our people with the latest 
technology as we move into a true multi-channel world.
• Our Specialist businesses leverage a strong brand portfolio 
offering everything from adventure and sailing holidays to 
private jet tours. We are investing in our online platforms to 
enhance booking and search functionality and provide our 
customers with inspirational content to showcase our products.
h ow do we know this is working?
• Online sales across the Mainstream Sector are steadily increasing. 
In FY13 online bookings made up 35% (FY12: 33%) of our holiday 
sales and we have clear strategic plans and targets in place  
to drive online sales further in all source markets (see KPIs). 
• All our Mainstream businesses have their core websites mobile 
enabled to take advantage of the growing proportion of their 
online traffic coming through tablets and smartphones.
2013 h ighlights
• TUI Nordic has opened new retail concept stores across its four 
markets which act as a branding and marketing channel supporting 
online sales as well as being a sales channel in their own right.
• The UK opened the first ret ail concept store in the Bluewater 
shopping centre. The shop includes next-generation design 
principles featuring user-generated content, digital billboards 
and interactive features.
• Our Mainstream businesses have over 2.5m Facebook fans  
with an industry leading rate of engagement. Thomson.co.uk  
was awarded the No. 1 ‘Socially Devoted’ business in the UK  
by Social Bakers, for the level of social customer service.
• Within our Specialist portfolio, our ski brand Crystal is increasing 
its direct distribution by reducing reliance on third-party agencies, 
and introducing price parity across online and offline channels.
d istribution is key to the successful performance of our o nline Accommodation businesses
w hy?
• As an ‘online-only’ business, it is critical we provide our 
customers with an effective and easy-to-use search and booking 
experience. In this arena, having excellent digital presentation 
and user experience is as important as good content. This 
means that the details – website response time, usability of  
the interface, etc., – are essential. Furthermore, consumers are 
increasingly expecting a seamless experience across all devices 
– so the mobile and tablet experience should match the 
traditional desktop experience.
• Maintaining our reputation is important to our Accommodation 
Wholesaler brands as the business is built on retaining 
customers who are loyal because of the service and product 
associated with our brand name.
• Growing our customer base in the competitive OTA market 
requires a combination of good brand awareness and strong 
online visibility in organic and paid search, together with a clear 
eCRM strategy to drive customer loyalty and repeat bookings.
w hat are we doing about it?
• Our Accommodation Wholesaler business is currently building a 
large client base to grow intra-regional and domestic penetration 
mainly in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Americas and Africa.
• In Accommodation OTA our focus is to build on our brand 
positioning of l ateRooms.com in the UK and expand in the 
emerging markets through AsiaRooms.com and in Brazil with 
the acquisition of MalaPronta.com. 
h ow do we know this is working?
• Accommodation Wholesaler saw a 50% growth in the number  
of XMl links between their inventory and travel agencies’ 
booking systems, with half of these being in the Middle East  
and Asia Pacific.
• LateRooms.com was the most recognised Accommodation  
OTA brand in the UK during FY13 with 63% brand awareness. 
2013 h ighlights
• Our Accommodation Wholesaler travel agency distribution 
channel, Bedsonline, has seen an year-on-year increase of  
60% in travel agent bookings.

strategy in our Accommodation OTA businesses in order to 
grow new and repeat bookings.

Providing seamless interaction  
for our customers
In July, we launched the award-winning TUI Digital Assistant in the form of the MyThomson 
mobile app, which allows customers to access information about and plan their holidays from 
the moment they book, through until their departure and even whilst on holiday. The app 
includes everything from flight information and luggage allowance details, to maps to help 
customers plan the best route to the airport. The personalised holiday countdown can also 
be shared via social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.
The MyThomson iPhone app was the most popular free travel app shortly after launch and 
had over 180,000 downloads in its first few months following release. Post year end we have 
rolled out the TUI Digital Assistant in the German source market with the launch of the 
‘Meine TUI’ mobile app and will continue this roll out to source markets across the Group. 
One of the main advantages of this technology is that we have one development cost that 
benefits all our markets.

w hy?
• Fast-changing customer demands require us to have  
a modern and flexible technological platform.
• It enables us to best showcase our product and 
communicate with and sell to our customers effectively. 
• By implementing robust back-end finance and reservation 
systems we can support business operations and also 
provide reliable and actionable management information.
• Having an efficient technology infrastructure allows us to 
drive efficiencies and therefore provides further value to 
our customers.
w hat are we doing about it?
• Within Mainstream, we are in the process of upgrading our 
web front-end reservation and finance systems across all 
source markets. These technology upgrades will provide 
our websites with new search functionalities, improved 
personalisation and richer content as well as enhanced 
mobile capability as our customers increasingly research 
and book their holidays on mobile devices.
• Our Specialist businesses have made good progress in 
consolidating their finance and reservation systems to 
leverage our scale across multiple brands and continue on 
their journey of standardisation, while balancing the varied 
requirements of the different holiday experiences they offer.
h ow do we know this is working?
• The Thomson & First Choice websites have recently  
gone through a major front-end overhaul. This includes 
incorporating Broad Search (flexible date, departure and 
destination options), self-validating search and filtering  
into the holiday search process. This has already resulted  
in a vastly improved ‘look-to-book’ ratio.

Consolidating our market-leading position
The Greek island of Kos is a prime example of how the Mainstream Sector is utilising its 
potential for growth, with three of our largest source markets reporting substantial successes 
on the island. 
Kos has become one of TUI Netherlands’ most successful destinations, reporting growth  
of 13% year-on-year. The market share of 35% of overall Dutch passengers to the island  
can mainly be attributed to differentiated products – of which Puravida and KidsClubs are 
the most successful, whilst its share of exclusive accommodation in Kos has risen to 33%. 
l ast summer, TUI Nordic re-launched Kos as a destination through an extensive line-up of 
differentiated concepts. The brand was the market leader for trips to Kos in Summer 2013, 
and received consistently high customer satisfaction. 
Over the past three years, our UK & Ireland Mainstream programme to Kos has grown by 
48%. This, coupled with the success of TUI Nordic and Netherlands, highlights how we are 
successfully expanding our business through a well-executed strategy.

o ur scale and potential for growth

w hy?
• No other leisure travel business operates in as many 
markets and has as many customers as we do. The travel 
market nonetheless remains highly dynamic and competitive 
and it is therefore essential to seize new growth 
opportunities and maintain our market-leading positions. 
• l everaging our scale and driving further synergies and 
cost efficiencies also enables us to provide added value 
to customers.
w hat are we doing about it?
• 2013 saw us approach scale in a different way with the 
creation of the Mainstream Board.
• This gave focus to our efforts to leverage our scale across 
all source markets to consolidate our market-leading position 
and grow the number of customers travelling with us.
• Growth in new markets remains an important area of focus 
for TUI Travel. Our Russian tour operator business has 
given us a position in this market and we continue to seek 
opportunities in markets like Brazil and China.
• In our Specialist & Activity Sector we continue to review 
opportunities to leverage our successful brands in new 
and existing source markets.

• As a result of the formation of the Mainstream Board, it was 
decided to consolidate our Mainstream purchasing and digital 
teams as well as combining the efforts of our destination 
services team in resort. This has allowed us to maximise 
economies of scale and will continue to drive further 
efficiencies (see ‘Our People’ on page 34).
• In May we further enhanced our offer with the delivery of 
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This has meant we have been 
able to extend our long-haul programme and vastly 
improve our customers’ flying experience.
• Following a shareholder meeting in July, a proposal was 
accepted to purchase 60 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft showing 
the confidence and faith in the Company’s ability to grow.
• Our Specialist & Activity Sector underwent a restructure  
in late 2012 which led to the creation of two management 
portfolios: grouping Marine, Specialist Holidays Group  
and Ski together and uniting Education, North American 
Specialist and Sport. The aim was to facilitate better 
sharing of expertise and knowledge across divisions.

The TUI Travel Big Picture was introduced in November 2012 to help bring to life our Group 
strategy, vision and strong growth plans in a dynamic and engaging way.
Supporting our open and honest culture, the Big Picture is designed to help drive colleague 
understanding, creating a dialogue about the path that we’re on and the role each of us has 
to play in the future success of our business, working together to achieve our goals.
Using an image to convey strategy and direction helps to make it more clear, consistent and 
memorable. In the UK & Ireland, more than half of our people could identify all three of our 
business goals unprompted following a conversation about the Big Picture. Before this, only 
20% could mention one of the business goals.

How we do it: Sustainable development
STRATEGIC REpo RT
Travel and tourism is one of the world’s largest industries. 
The growth and employment it creates makes it of critical 
importance to the global economy. However, from a 
sustainable development perspective, the industry’s high 
dependency on fossil fuel, natural resources and biodiversity 
poses a challenge, one which our businesses have been 
addressing for over a decade. Our vision is to make travel 
experiences special whilst minimising environmental impact, 
respecting culture and people and bringing economic benefits 
to communities. 
Our commitment to Responsible Leadership is widely acknowledged. In 
FY13 we were pleased that our performance was recognised as follows:
• For the sixth consecutive year, TUI Travel was featured in CDP’s 
Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) and was ranked in 
the top 10% of the FTSE 350 for o ur approach to carbon disclosure 
and governance. TUI Travel was the only Travel & Leisure company 
to feature in the 2013 CDLI and the only company to feature for the 
sixth year running.  www.cdproject.net
• TUI Travel was recognised by Carbon Clear for its approach to 
carbon reporting, ranking the Company joint sixth in the FTSE 100 
in its annual survey.  www.carbon-clear.com/uk 
• We continue to be listed on the FTSE4Good Index in recognition 
of meeting strict social, environmental and governance standards. 
• For the third consecutive year TUI Travel was featured in the 
RobecoSAM Sustainability Yearbook which highlights the best 
performing 15% of companies who submit data to the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index (the largest 2,500 companies globally).

Holidays Report, see  www.tuitravelplc.com/sustainability
Governance
Commitment at the most senior level is vital for us to achieve our  
goal of leading the leisure travel sector in sustainable development. 
Johan Lundgren, Deputy Chief Executive, is the TUI Travel PLC Board 
sponsor for sustainable development and Jacky Simmonds, Group HR 
Director, is responsible for reporting on sustainable development to  
the Group Management Board. Jane Ashton is the Director of Group 
Sustainable Development. The Group Management Board acts as  
the Steering Committee, setting the strategic direction and long-term 
objectives for sustainable development across the Group. 
The role of Group Sustainable Development is to drive change towards 
a more sustainable business and to forge leadership in our industry 
sector. The team works closely with other parts of the Group and a 
network of sustainable development coordinators in each key source 
market/Sector who have a remit to develop and implement sustainable 
development strategy, supported by a network of champions. 
Risk management
Policy and mitigation for Group-wide risks relating to sustainability are 
facilitated by Group Risk Management and Sustainable Development, 
with responsibility for managing such risks also shared by the 
businesses themselves. Increasing legislative and societal demands on 
an organisation like ours require that we act responsibly and identify 
and manage our risks effectively. 
Key areas of risk identified are:
• Legislative and societal demands in relation to size and  
management of TUI Travel PLC’s carbon footprint
• Actions of colleagues need to uphold TUI Travel’s sustainable 
development policy
• Actions of suppliers need to uphold TUI Travel’s environmental 
and social supplier standards
• To understand better the socio-economic impacts of tourism
• Concern over damage to and quality of destinations due  
to ecosystem degradation and climate change
• Growing expectation among our customers regarding 
sustainability issues

them see our latest Sustainable Holidays Report. We have also identified 
sustainability risks within the Principal Risks section, see page 42

Our three-year Sustainable Holidays Plan was launched in 2012 and marks our journey towards 
a more sustainable future. It reflects significant integration of environmental and social 
principles into the way we do business – performance measures, processes and the customer 
proposition. It sets out four ambitious goals underpinned by 20 commitments in our priority 
areas – taking care in destinations, reducing carbon emissions and engaging our colleagues and 
customers in sustainability. Our Sustainable Holidays Plan aligns with our corporate strategy.

we will deliver 10 million 
‘greener and fairer’ holidays 
We will measure this by the number of 
customers we take to hotels with credible 
sustainability certifications from 2012  
to 2014, e.g. sustainability certifications 
working with the Global Sustainable 
Tourism Council such as Travelife, and 
international environmental management 
standards such as ISo 14001 and EMAS.
Travel and tourism accounts for 9% of the world’s GDP  
and 6% of global exports (U nWTo , 2013). Tourism also 
accounts for 1 in 11 jobs globally (U nWTo , 2013) and is the 
main source of foreign exchange in one-third of developing 
countries (UnEP , 2011). The leisure t ravel industry can have 
both positive and negative impacts on communities and  
the natural environment – the challenge is how to manage 
these impacts for the greatest good.
o ur business case
We want our holidays to benefit local livelihoods and protect the 
environment, and in doing so maintain the quality, viability and 
desirability of our products for years to come. We’re working with 
stakeholders in destinations around the world to make this a reality.
TUI Travel has a global supply chain, and our suppliers are the driving 
force for improving our sustainability performance in our destinations. 
Each of them plays a significant role in managing our impacts on the 
local community, economy and environment. 
We are committed to influencing more hotels to achieve credible 
sustainability certifications, so as to be assured that our suppliers are 
making continual sustainability improvements. This not only improves 
our sustainability performance, but also benefits our suppliers.
Depending on the region, energy costs account for between 5% and 
15% of a hotel’s turnover (blueContec, 2012), so reducing energy 
use can have a significant impact on the bottom line. We’re already 
helping many of our hotels by training them on eco-efficiencies, 
which ultimately delivers better value for money for our customers. 
Engaging in sustainability can help hotels differentiate their product, 
meet growing customer demand, and protect their destinations.  
There is also evidence that our most sustainably-managed hotels are 
those which are delivering higher quality and customer satisfaction.
We are involved in hundreds of projects that support communities 
and reduce environmental impacts. Where we can, we focus on the 
destinations where we send the most customers and where we believe 
we can make the greatest difference. In FY13 this included Brazil,  
Cape verde, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Greece, Kenya, 
Mexico, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey. 
FY13 h ighlights
• We featured over 1,200 hotels with sustainability certifications.
• We took 3.8 million customers to hotels with credible sustainability 
certifications.
• We organised many sustainability supplier workshops, for example 
in the Costa del Sol, Italy, Kos, Madeira, Mallorca and Rhodes.
• TUI UK & Ireland worked with blueContec and Responsible 
Hospitality Partnership to provide their differentiated hotels with 
dedicated environmental consultancy. o f the circa 40 hotels who 
participated, reductions in energy and water consumption have 
already generated cost savings of nearly Euros 2 million to date.
• TUI nederland was the first major travel company to be certified 
to the new Travelife standard for tour operators.
• We were actively involved in the development of the industry’s first 
ever Global Welfare Guidance for Animals in Tourism, produced  
by ABTA – The Travel Association, and launched in June 2013. TUI 
Travel provided support for the guidelines at a launch event at the 
EU Parliament in Brussels and we continue to audit our suppliers 
against animal welfare standards.
• TUI Deutschland has partnered with GIZ to support a major project 
in Tunisia. In year two of the project, seminars took place with hotel 
managers on sustainability and equal opportunities for women, 
hotel staff were trained on service quality and customer satisfaction 
and linkages created between local women artisans and hotels.

TUI Travel PLC acknowledges the Un Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights and has many policies and initiatives in place to 
identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how we are addressing  
key human rights issues. We continue to work with stakeholders to 
understand better and respond to these issues. 
We have a Group employee Code of Conduct which covers a wide 
range of human rights including discrimination and working conditions 
and commits TUI Travel to upholding the principles of the U n Global 
Compact. The Company also has HR policies (see page 34), Health  
& Safety policies (see page 52), an Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy 
(see page 71) and a Whistle-blowing Policy (see page 71) addressing 
key human rights. TUI Travel’s Mainstream businesses are signed up  
to the international Child Protection Code and support several child 
protection projects.
In 2013, TUI Travel launched a new Supplier Code of Conduct for all 
suppliers including hoteliers. The code sets out the minimum standards 
we expect from suppliers and their employees, contractors, agents  
and subsidiaries when working on our behalf. The code covers human 
rights and labour laws, support for local communities, environmental 
impacts, and bribery and corruption. 
We are actively encouraging our hotel suppliers to implement credible 
sustainability certifications. The majority of businesses across the 
Group promote Travelife, which incorporates the principles of the 
Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code. Travelife recognises hotels which 
care for the environment, their employees and the local community. 
We have been working with Travelife to strengthen criteria around 
human rights and these will be launched in 2014. We are also working 
with ABTA and industry peers to address key concerns on human 
rights issues collectively.

• Jetair and Jetairfly received the sustainable tourism award at the 
Travel Magazine Travel Awards in 2012.
• In november 2012, TUI Travel formed a three-year partnership with 
the German Government Development agency GIZ, The Code and 
other industry partners to focus on child protection in Thailand. 
• Hotelbeds and Blue Travel Partner Services officially partnered  
with UnICEF in the Dominican Republic to protect children from 
exploitation.
• TUI nederland won the ‘o verall winner’ award and the ‘Best for 
child protection’ award at the 2013 World Responsible Tourism 
Awards. This achievement came as a result of their long-term 
commitment to the cause: in implementing colleague training, raising 
awareness amongst travellers and a project in Brazil which helps 
vulnerable adolescents find a job in the tourism industry. Intrepid 
Travel was also ‘Highly Commended’ for its work on child protection 
over the last 20 years.
• We aim to influence the sustainable management of key destinations. 
We have been working with the Travel Foundation in Cyprus, which 
includes the integration of minimum sustainability standards into 
the island’s national hotel quality rating system, and in Cape verde, 
where we have helped to set up a destination council to tackle 
sustainability issues using a multi-stakeholder approach. 
We are conscious of the pressures that tourism can place on local 
populations and resources and therefore work collaboratively with 
communities, governments and a range of other partners to support 
the sustainable management of destinations. Examples include:  
ABTA – The Travel Association, the Born Free Foundation, Deutscher 
Reiseverband, Dutch Association of Travel Agents & Tour o perators, 
GIZ, Global Sustainable Tourism Council, The Tour o perators Initiative, 
and The Travel Foundation.

A DECADE o F Coll ABo RATIo N
TUI Travel has been working with the Travel Foundation, a sustainable tourism charity, since it launched in 2003. 
During this decade of partnership, the Travel Foundation has supported us on our sustainability journey, providing  
a wide range of resources and expertise and collaborating with the business on strategic projects that have helped  
it address the sustainability issues facing the travel and tourism sector. We are the largest industry supporter and 
donor to The Travel Foundation, which over the last 10 years has trained more than 10,000 local people in skills 
to boost tourism, reduce environmental impacts and improve customer experience – and also trained 800 hotels 
to reduce energy, water and waste. We have raised over £4 million since 2003 and we won the Contribution to 
the Community Award at the 2013 TTG Travel Awards for our outstanding work with the Travel Foundation.

Travel and tourism are responsible for around 5% of global 
CO
2
 emissions (UnEP , 2011). As a leading leisure travel 
company, our challenge is to prepare for a low carbon future 
by further reducing our environmental impacts and helping 
our suppliers do the same. Carbon management is a 
priority for TUI Travel: our airlines’ carbon efficiency is one 
of the Company’s key performance indicators (see page 
38
)
. Our carbon management strategy covers aviation, 
hotels, major premises, retail shops, water transport and 
ground transport emissions. 
o ur business case
It makes sense, both from a business and from an environmental 
perspective, for us to embed carbon management into our key 
business practices. 
Predictable weather, comfort and an attractive local environment are 
critical factors in the quality of the holiday experiences we provide for 
our customers. Climate change could negatively impact on all three of 
these factors, and is therefore a business risk for TUI Travel (see our 
2013 CDP submission for further details).
We have also identified climate change-related regulation as a material 
issue for the Company (see page 51). We monitor and are prepared for 
regulatory proposals on climate change – such as the UK Government’s 
mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirements (see below).
o ur focus on energy and fuel efficiency allows us to make significant 
cost savings. Across TUI Travel, improved management of energy, 
natural resources and fuel across our operations has saved £16 million 
in FY12*.
We aim to operate Europe’s most fuel-efficient airlines and to continue 
to invest in cutting edge aviation technology. In FY13, TUI Travel 
airlines’ total carbon emissions were 5,101,532 tonnes. Emissions  
from aviation make up approximately 90% of our Company’s carbon 
footprint. Our target is to reduce TUI Travel airlines per passenger 
carbon emissions by 9% by 2015 (baseline 2008). In FY13, we met this 
target, reducing our average per passenger carbon emissions by 9.3% 
against our baseline.
We have developed our position on aviation and climate change in 
partnership with key stakeholders, whose insight and guidance have 
helped us to identify how we can play a leading role in campaigning 
for smarter carbon legislation. 
Read our ‘Campaigning for smarter carbon legislation’  
article here:  www.tuitravelplc.com/sustainability  
and watch our  ‘Transparency in carbon reporting’ video.

• TUIfly was ranked the most climate-efficient charter airline 
worldwide for the second year in a row and most climate-efficient 
airline in the world with more than one million passengers in the 
2013 atmosfair Airline Index. Thomson Airways was ranked second 
most climate-efficient airline for short haul flights.
• TUIfly achieved ISo 14001 certification (an international 
environmental management standard).
• 94% of our aircraft are now fitted with fuel-saving blended

• Sunsail achieved certification by the British Standards Institute 
(BSI) to the sustainable event management (ISo 20121) standard, 
which recognises organisations that maximise economic, social and 
environmental opportunities at their events.
We have developed collaborative partnerships with many stakeholders 
whose insight and guidance continue to help us develop our position 
on aviation and climate change. Examples include: AlgaePARC in the 
netherlands, Aviation Initiative for Renewable Energy in Germany 
(AIREG), CDP, Forum for the Future, Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users 
Group (SAFUG) and Sustainable Aviation in the UK.
Greenhouse gas emissions
TUI Travel has reported on all of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission 
sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports Regulations 2013). The organisational boundary 
used for its Scope 1 & 2 and, where appropriate, Scope 3 inventory 
of GHG emissions is operational control and it corresponds to the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
For the first time TUI Travel is disclosing carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO 2e) data for both its absolute and relative (e.g. airline) emissions, 
historically we have just disclosed CO 2 emissions. CO 2e refers to CO 2 
and the other five Kyoto GHGs: Methane (CH 4); nitrous oxide (n 2O); 
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); Perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and Sulphur 
hexafluoride (SF 6).
All material GHG emissions have been included and disclosed following 
a thorough review of entities and the emissions sources across the 
Company’s UK and international operations. The methodology for 
the assessment is based on voluntary and mandatory GHG reporting 
guidance issued by DEFRA (the UK Government’s Environment 
Department). Please see tables below for our absolute and intensity 
CO
2e and CO 2 data for FY13.

Colleagues
Our colleagues are crucial to delivering our commitments on 
sustainability. We want them to be engaged, knowledgeable 
and enthusiastic about sustainability and we believe that 
this will drive recruitment and loyalty to TUI Travel.
o ur business case
Research shows that a company’s reputation is increasingly important 
to today’s employees, who seek synergy between their own and their 
employer’s values. Our HR colleagues regularly hear from new starters 
that TUI Travel’s sustainability performance influenced their choice of 
TUI Travel as a prospective employer.
One of TUI Travel’s core values is Responsible Leadership, which is 
increasingly embedded into how we measure behaviour and performance. 
Research carried out by the non-profit organisation net Impact in 2012 
shows employees who have the opportunity to make a direct social 
and environmental impact through their job report higher satisfaction 
levels than those who do not, by a factor of 2:1. 
We communicate regularly about the progress we’re making on securing 
a sustainable future for our industry. A key challenge is to make our 
Sustainable Holidays Plan accessible and practical for all colleagues. 
To this end we embed sustainability in recruitment material, our intranets, 
newsletters, inductions, blogs by senior managers, dedicated films and 
e-learning modules, as well as many other communication channels. 
FY13 h ighlights
• Many sustainability awareness-raising events took place. For example, 
TUI Travel colleagues in many destinations supported the Travel

Customers will regard Tu I  
Travel as a leader in delivering 
more sustainable holidays
We will measure this by our performance  
in consumer research in our key source 
markets.
Customers
Through the purchases they make and the actions they 
take on holiday, our customers play a vital part in achieving 
TUI Travel’s Sustainable Holidays Plan. That’s why we are 
working to influence choice and develop new products 
to encourage customers to choose ‘greener and fairer’ 
holidays and act responsibly when they are on holiday.
o ur business case
There is a growing awareness among our customers about sustainability, 
such as the impact of carbon emissions from flying and the need to 
ensure that local people get a fair deal from tourism. Although these 
issues are not the major deciding factor for most people when they 
choose a holiday, it is in the interest of our destinations and the 
environment that it becomes a strong influencing factor. In several of 
our key source markets we have found a positive correlation between 
more sustainable holidays and customer satisfaction. 
We are encouraging holidaymakers to engage in sustainable tourism

• At the end of 2012 we conducted international sustainability 
consumer research with 6,000 holidaymakers in six source markets 
and the findings were very similar to our research in 2010. We found 
that:
> 1 in 2 consumers would be willing to book a more sustainable 
holiday if available
> 2 in 3 consumers want their holiday company to be clear  
about what they do to make their holidays more sustainable
> 2 in 3 consumers would change their behaviour on holiday  
to help the environment
> We also found that Modern Mainstream consumers had a  
greater engagement with sustainability compared to traditional 
Mainstream consumers.
• We have developed an online platform called Spreading smiles  
to bring our sustainability initiatives to life for customers and 
colleagues.  www.spreadingsmiles.com
• Fritidsresor, our brand in Sweden, was ranked most sustainable 
travel company in Sweden in the 2013 Sustainable Brand Index. 
• Across the Group our businesses are working to reduce brochures 
and to use digital platforms throughout the customer journey. For 
example, Thomson launched an award-winning MyThomson app, 
allowing users to look up and book excursions on their smart 
phones, as well as find out about local events in their resort. TUI UK 
& Ireland reduced the number of brochure pages printed by 14% 
year-on-year.
• TUI UK & Ireland won a Silver Award in the Interactive Category  
of the IvCA Clarion Awards 2013 for their eco-traveller programme. 
The awards recognise best practice in communicating the 
importance of sustainability.

o ur people
Our team of 55,000 people working across the world in approximately 
180 countries is what makes TUI Travel what it is today and gives us a 
real advantage. With our shared vision of making travel experiences 
special and our values of customer driven, playing to win, responsible 
leadership and value driven, we are all working towards the same 
strategy and strong growth plans for the future success of our 
business.
Engaging and involving our colleagues
With many brands and businesses across the world making up TUI 
Travel, there are many more things that make us the same and bind us 
together than those things that could be regarded as differences. The 
one shared vision and common values that we are all working towards 
really strengthen our business directly and impacts on our 
performance. 
At the start of the last financial year, we introduced a new and simple 
way to convey the business strategy and vision for the future through 
the Big Picture. The Group Management Board worked together with 
colleagues from across the world to develop the visual, ensuring it 
represents the whole Group, its core essence and where the business 
is heading, recognising the financial and economic factors that affect 
our performance.
Designed with lots of detail to stimulate discussion, the purpose of the 
Big Picture is for it to be used as a tool to have conversations with our 
people to make sure that they understand our plans for the future,  
and the part that they can play. By using a picture we make sure that 
our story is clear, consistent and memorable. It helps to ensure that 
our strategy and vision is understood and contributes to making our 
people feel engaged and motivated. 
The picture has been actively rolled out across our Group in all Sectors 
with the exception of the Specialist & Activity Sector where it will be 
rolled out following completion of the Sector’s restructuring.

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
To measure whether we are meeting our people goals and ensuring  
that we are continually driving improvement, our first TUI Travel 
Group-wide global opinion survey took place in September 2012 across 
all areas of the Group. Work is well underway to address the survey 
feedback and a number of changes have already been made. As well  
as local plans being in place across the Group, themes to come out of 
the survey included Opportunity, Pride and Trust. The feedback around 
Opportunity focused on increasing the visibility of career opportunities 
and a new internal careers portal was launched in July bringing together 
TUI Travel’s global vacancies for the first time (see Global Mobility and 
Collaboration). This also supports the feedback around Pride and our 
people wanting to feel part of one global business as we build and 
strengthen our TUI Travel identity as an employer. Raised as part of  
the Trust theme was leadership effectiveness and to help build trust 
through involvement and more focused employee communication, the 
TUI Travel Big Picture was introduced. These areas will be measured 
again in the next survey when we will also be able to benchmark our 
results and measure how these may have changed. Over the long-term, 
we strive to reach engagement levels that reflect high performance 
and in 2012 we reached 64%.
We also recognise that our people are incredibly knowledgeable about 
their business areas and that they have some great insight and ideas to 
offer. There are a number of active employee representative forums in 
place across the Group to ensure two-way feedback and involvement 
raising matters of importance to our people and our business. In addition, 
the Specialist & Activity Sector’s Specialist Holidays Group has  
involved everyone working in that area to drive their Darwin business 
transformation project, giving them the opportunity to shape the  
way we work throughout the entire customer journey. Operating in 
workstreams, the project has been driven entirely by ideas generated 
from employees at all levels, empowering the team and giving them  
a vehicle to make a difference to the way we work.
Digitally enabling our people
With Online Driven being a key part of our strategy, we are committed 
to initiating and improving the digital literacy of our people across the 
world. Our Digital Workplace vision is to create a single environment 
that is available to our Group-wide colleagues anytime, anywhere,  
any way, which provides instant access to communications, colleague 
data, social interaction and working practices. Creating a Digital 
Workplace enables a transformation in our business culture, improving 
collaboration and efficiency in our working practices and increasing  
the awareness of expertise and knowledge sharing. This will empower 
our colleagues to become brand ambassadors enabling them to fully 
engage with our customers.
We’ve invested in a number of online tools to help support our people 
to build on their knowledge and help with this shift in mind-set. All of our 
colleagues now have access to E-consultancy, a global online resource 
providing digital training and materials.
Our global Finance Academy continues to bring our Group-wide 
finance community together to share best practice and provide access 
to the latest training and guidance, raising their skills and capability. 
The multi-lingual, secure, online Learning Management portal now has 
over 1,500 members across 42 countries with membership continuing 
to grow. Over 1,900 courses have been completed since the launch of 
the Finance Academy in April 2013. Sponsored by Will Waggott, CFO, 
the Academy has already enabled us to create and deliver the ongoing 
COSO internal control training, deliver targeted learning on Cash 
Management to senior finance staff, and provide best practice training 
and guidance on Financial Reporting through internal systems.
Within our Specialist & Activity Sector, the Specialist Holidays Group 
has introduced a Digital Academy boosting the digital talent pipeline, 
providing all employees across the business with the opportunity to 
apply for a six-month secondment to one of the digital teams. Successful 
candidates are appointed a mentor for the duration of the placement 
and are provided with both external and on-the-job support. Six 
placements have already taken place including employees from 
Commercial, Sales and Publishing.

How we do it: Our people
continued
Investing in our leaders
At TUI Travel, we know that to deliver our strategy and ensure our 
future growth, we need talent, strong leadership and development 
opportunities for all. 
Leadership at TUI Travel is about engaging and empowering people 
whilst delivering results and managing performance. To ensure this, 
our Global High Performance Leadership programme focuses on 
the development of our high-potential senior leaders, equipping  
them to support our commercial business growth and strategy. 
Sponsored by the Deputy Chief Executive and MD of Mainstream, 
Johan Lundgren, the programme aims to enhance strategic thinking 
and leadership skills, creating the foundation for more active 
collaboration across the Group. Held at the prestigious IMD business 
school in Switzerland, around 20 leaders participate each year and  
are set real high strategic priority business challenges to create 
tangible business improvement plans. 
Reinforcing this, our suite of Global High Potential Learning & 
Development programmes has been designed for our talent in the early 
stages of their careers or who have been identified as successors to 
commercial senior leadership roles in the future. Sponsored by Joan Vilà, 
MD Accommodation & Destinations Sector, about 80 people take part 
in Perspectives each year, widening their understanding of the Group 
strategy, our expectations of future leaders and helping to drive the 
mobility of talent across the Group, supporting our global leadership 
culture. Our Horizons programme is also supported by members of the 
GMB who attend sessions and spend time with the circa 40 delegates 
that take part each year.
Two new core leadership programmes have been created to support 
managers’ development and are being piloted through some markets 
with a view to launching globally across the Group during 2014. 
Leadership Essentials, a two-day workshop, focuses predominantly  
on self and people leadership and is designed for those early in their 
leadership journey to embed the behaviour which encourages this  
and brings out the best in people. Leadership Evolution is a three-day 
leadership workshop focused on self, people and business leadership 
designed for more experienced managers, allowing them to explore the 
evolution of themselves as a leader and the organisation in the face  
of a rapidly-changing environment. 
In addition to these development initiatives, we also run internal  
and external mentoring and coaching programmes.
Developing our talent pipeline
To build our succession of leadership talent, our International  
Graduate Leadership Programme continues to attract, develop  
and retain high-quality graduates to become our future senior 
Commercial Leaders. 
With two intakes per year, another five graduates joined our team in 
September 2013 from the UK, Germany, Romania and Spain. To reflect 
the increasing globalisation of our business, we focus on attracting 
graduates with an international mind-set and a professional approach 
suitable for our fast-paced, ever changing environment. There is a 
mentoring programme in place providing support throughout the 
18-month programme and senior leaders are committed to meeting 
and developing the graduates through specific assignments in their 
businesses. Speaking a minimum of two languages including English, 
our graduates are provided with significant international commercial 
business exposure across the Group with the aim for them to become 
emerging leaders within 3-4 years.
Within TUI UK & Ireland, a placement scheme for university students 
takes place each year providing 8-10 people on a ‘sandwich’ degree 
course a placement in Trading, Product, Purchasing, Cruise and 
e-commerce. Having run successfully for five years, the scheme has 
won, and been shortlisted for, a number of awards including “Best 
Overall Placement Scheme” from National Council for Work Experience 
(2010) and regularly features in the Top 10 Placement schemes  
by RateMyPlacement.co.uk in which it is currently seventh in the 
medium-sized scheme category. 48 students have completed this 
scheme since it was introduced, with an additional eight joining for  
the 2013/14 year. 13 students who have completed the scheme have 
returned to the business on completion of their degree, with eight 
currently working in the business.
This business also has the leading employer apprenticeship 
programme in the UK & Ireland travel sector. Working in partnership 
with the Skills Funding Agency and strategic partner City & Guilds, a 
world leading vocational education organisation, over 400 qualifications 
have been achieved by our retail team this year. In December, after just 
one year with Thomson, Stacie Guiel, who joined our Brighton shop in 
2011, was awarded a City & Guilds Medal for Excellence recognising her 
outstanding performance in travel services.
In addition, TUI UK & Ireland has succession planning programmes in 
retail and overseas at every level linked to recognised qualifications.
TUI Deutschland Leisure Travel has one of the largest training 
programmes in the German travel industry, with their apprenticeship 
scheme training approximately 250 people over three years. Securing 
the future of the business, the programme aims to attract the best 
candidates, setting high standards and qualifying criteria. In December 
2012, Franziska Binner from Peine, finished her apprenticeship as the 
best merchant in tourism in Lower Saxony and was honoured by the 
Federal Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, 
Dr Kristina Schröder. A blog (www.tui-azubiblog.de) was introduced  
at the end of 2012 where apprentices write about their experiences, 
providing an authentic report helping to promote the programme  
to prospective candidates.

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Corsair has introduced a new apprenticeship scheme welcoming more 
than 30 trainees during 2013, demonstrating Corsair’s commitment  
to develop and support young people into the workplace. Corsair has 
also partnered with two schools within the airline industry, the “Ecole 
Nationale de l’Aviation Civile” (ENAC) and AFMAE. ENAC, the only 
aviation focused university in France, offers training and continued 
education for pilots and engineers and AFMAE focuses on supporting 
other professions including cabin crew and technicians. These 
partnerships strengthen Corsair’s offering for employees while 
ensuring quality in our professional training. 
The Accommodation & Destinations Sector’s Laterooms Group has 
started to work with Manchester Metropolitan University to attract 
graduate placements on to their Agency Life Student Project. Two 
students joined the scheme in October 2013 as part of the Marketing 
division, spending one day a week with LateRooms.com as part of their 
second year degree course. Enabling LateRooms.com to provide real 
experience for students, the programme also allows the business to 
develop, mentor and find future talent while raising awareness for 
the brand.
Global mobility and collaboration
To help improve global mobility, a new global resourcing function is being 
created for the financial year 2013/14 focusing on senior leadership and 
enabling our people to move more easily around the Group and the 
world. Driving the strategy for increasing the number of international 
moves across the business reinforces our commitment to internal 
promotions and moves. 
As part of this and in response to the feedback in our global employee 
opinion survey Your Voice (see Engaging and Involving our Colleagues), 
a new internal careers portal was launched in July bringing together 
TUI Travel’s global vacancies for the first time, increasing the visibility 
of career opportunities. Launched in all areas of the Group, around 50 
management vacancies are advertised on a weekly basis covering all 
Sectors, with roles of all levels being introduced at the end of 2013.
These initiatives will enable us to monitor better mobility between 
businesses as well as across Sectors, continuing to build on and 
improve opportunities for career development while staying with 
TUI Travel.
We are also driving a more global mind-set by encouraging colleagues 
from across the Group based all over the world to work more closely 
together. Over the past 12 months the Mainstream Sector has been 
focusing on leveraging its scale by sharing best practice and working more 
collaboratively with each other. One example of this new way of working 
is the creation of a new Purchasing department, set up to buy on 
behalf of the whole of Mainstream rather than just for each individual 
Source Market. This has encouraged networking opportunities for our 
people and collaboration across all Source Markets as well as offering 
more value to the customer (see pages 14 to 25).
a team of individuals – strength in diversity
It is not only our customers that we recognise are all individuals. Our 
55,000 strong workforce based all over the world represents a wide 
range of different backgrounds and cultures, enabling us to gain a real 
advantage and truly understand our customers and their ever changing 
needs. Our diversity is at the heart of our success and is one of our 
major strengths, making each brand so successful and our Company 
what it is. 
We are clear that we don’t tolerate discrimination under any 
circumstances and our ethos is that opportunities should be equally 
available to everyone. We have principles and guidelines in place to 
ensure this is maintained at every level, throughout our Company.
Illustrating this diverse workforce, 24% of our senior leaders (243) 
based across 24 countries are female. Across our total workforce,  
63% of all employees and 38% of managers are female. 
Rewarding our colleagues and supporting 
their wellbeing
It is the dedication of our people that makes the difference when it 
comes to making travel experiences special and we strive to make 
our people feel valued.
Recognising the importance of good retirement planning, we continue 
to offer pension arrangements across the Group reflective of local 
legislative requirements, as well as the economic position of our 
business and market practice. This year there have been significant 
changes in the UK with the introduction of new pension auto-
enrolment legislation. Since June 2013, eligible employees are now 
automatically enrolled into our Company pension scheme with a set 
level of Company and employee contributions. Over 4,700 people have 
been successfully enrolled into the Company pension scheme.
We continue to encourage share ownership in the Company amongst 
colleagues. In the UK we are able to offer a share incentive plan that 
allows colleagues to purchase TUI Travel PLC shares in a tax efficient way. 
The health and wellbeing of our colleagues is paramount and an example 
of how this is supported in TUI UK & Ireland is their pilot programme, 
Your Life – a healthier, happier you, which aims to increase employee 
engagement. The programme has resulted in a reduction in the average 
duration of long-term sickness absence and days lost through sickness. 
TUI Leisure Travel in Germany has also developed a new health 
management scheme as a part of a pilot project in our travel agencies 
focused on preserving the health of employees.

Our unique holidays form the backbone of our Mainstream businesses 
and are exclusive to us. Unique holidays provide value added services and 
features which command a margin premium over commodity products. 
This in turn leads to higher customer loyalty and an increase in repeat 
bookings. Unique holidays also book earlier enabling us to manage our 
capacity and yield more effectively and it is very difficult for our 
competitors to replicate these concepts.
DIstr IBute D DIre Ctl y to the Customer – growth from onl Ine
Our direct distribution channels are central to the Group’s strategy. By 
increasing the direct distribution of our holidays we lower distribution 
costs, reduce the reliance on third party distributors and can build on our 
customer relationships. As an online-driven business, we have a focus on 
the online customer experience. During the year, we continued to see the 
benefits of the investments we have been making in our online platforms. 
We are moving to one core online platform across Mainstream.

In the year, we increased the unique holidays mix by four percentage points across the 
Mainstream Sector as a whole to 69%. Within this, the UK and Germany improved by four 
percentage points to 83% and 51% respectively, and the Nordic region improved by one 
percentage point to 93%.
Customer satisfaction for the UK, Nordic region and Germany combined increased by  
two percentage points to 79%, driven by improved scores in all three source markets.
To measure our progress, we have two distribution KPIs: (i) direct distribution mix;  
and (ii) online distribution mix.
Direct distribution mix increased to 66%, with improvements in all source markets.  
The improvement in direct distribution was driven by the online channel which has 
increased by two percentage points in 2013 to 35%. Within this, the UK improved by  
three percentage points to 47%, the Nordic region improved by two percentage points  
to 68% and Germany improved by four percentage points to 8%.
The Mainstream overhead percentage of revenue improved from 5.2% to 4.6% in 2013. 
2013 was a year of restructuring and refocusing for the Specialist & Activity Sector and,  
as anticipated, underlying operating profit has not grown during the year. Now that the 
Sector restructure is complete, we look forward to delivering against our growth roadmap 
in the next four years. As part of this, we have already delivered £3m of business 
improvement savings during 2013.

One of our key strategic objectives is to continue to improve the Group’s 
profitability and free cash flow and therefore deliver superior returns on 
investment. This improvement will allow us to invest further in the future 
of our business which will benefit our customers, colleagues and 
shareholders.
We are experiencing greater stakeholder interest in sustainability  
and believe that creating more sustainable holidays will help protect  
our product into the future and also support product differentiation,  
brand loyalty, customer satisfaction and competitive advantage.
we are targeting our airlines 
to reduce per passenger 
carbon emissions by 9% 
by 2015 (against a baseline 
of 2008). s ee s ustainable

SHAr EHOl DEr INf Or MATION
r OIC has improved again this year by 2.6 percentage points to 14.8%, driven by the 
significant increase in underlying net operating profit after tax.
We generated a cash conversion rate of 90% in 2013 as a result of a strong operating  
cash flow performance. We continue to target a cash conversion rate of at least 70%  
going forward. 
We delivered £46m of operational efficiency savings through the business improvement 
programme in the last 12 months, with a further £19m to be delivered in the next two 
years.
We made significant improvements in 2013. Our airlines’ per passenger carbon emissions 
reduced by 3.2% year on year, from 73.0g CO
2/r PK in 2012 to 70.7g CO 2/r PK in 2013, a 
9.3% reduction against our 2008 baseline year. This was achieved through investment in 
new more fuel-efficient aircraft, operational efficiencies, fuel conservation activities and 
capacity amends. 
We had a strong performance in Accommodation Wholesaler in 2013, with 28% growth  
in underlying operating profit at constant currency (2012) rates. TTV grew by 23% from 
£1.351bn to £1.655bn in 2013, with 16% growth in roomnights. Top-line growth was driven 
primarily by expansion in Asia and l atin America.
We continued to invest in the Asian and Brazilian markets in Accommodation OTA during 
2013. Traffic grew by 7% in the year. Whilst roomnights grew by 8% in AsiaRooms, total 
roomnights fell by 6%, driven by l ater ooms, which implemented a new online platform 
during the year.

What are the risks? Principal risks
Risk Governance
•	 Successful risk management is critical to the long-term success  
of our business and a key area of management focus.
•	 We continue to strengthen our risk governance framework which 
enables us to understand more fully the threats and opportunities 
in the market place, to match these against the strengths and 
weaknesses of our Group and to respond accordingly. Our risk 
management process, and the risk software supporting it, helps to 
drive clarity, consistency, transparency and accountability at every 
level of the organisation. It enables us to understand and manage 
our risk exposures (both individually and in aggregate) across the 
Group so that, at any given time, we are incurring the right level  
and the right type of risk to pursue effectively our strategic goals.
•	 We recognise that good risk governance exists when an organisation 
is intuitively sensitive to changes in its risk landscape and its risk 
pr ofile 	 and 	 is 	 quick 	 t o 	 flex	 either 	 it s 	 stra t egic 	 objec tiv e 	 and/ or 	 it s	 
risk strategy, as necessary. We also recognise that this capability 
r equir es 	 a c tiv e 	 c ommitment 	 a t 	 the 	 t op , 	 a 	 str ong 	 independent 	 risk	
function, clear, consistent risk methodology and language, good 
inf orma ti on 	 flo ws	 and 	 a 	 cultur e 	 o f 	 open 	 and 	 honest 	 c ommunicati on.
•	 Our risk governance framework is set out below and summarises the 
various risk related roles, responsibilities and relationships operating 
throughout the Group.
Strategic Risk Governance
Risks OF the Strategy: (Direction)
The Board determines the strategic direction of the business and 
agrees the nature and extent of the risk it is prepared to take to 
a ch ie v e 	 it s 	 stra t egic 	 objec tiv es.	
Effective risk management is dependent on the capability and 
commitment of our people. The Nomination Committee ensures  
that an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience exists 
in the Boardroom to understand and manage the risk environment  
at a strategic level, providing a culture whereby risks and assumptions 
are rigorously and freely challenged and debated. 
To ensure that the strategic direction chosen by the business 
represents the best of the strategic options open to it, the Board is 
supported by the Group Strategy function. This function exists to 
facilitate and inform the Board’s assessment of the risk landscape  
and development of potential strategies by which it can drive 
long-term shareholder value. On an annual basis the Group Strategy 
function develops an in-depth fact base, in a consistent format which 
o utlines 	 the 	 mark et 	 a t tra c tiv eness, 	 c ompetitiv e 	 positi on 	 and 	 financial	
performance by Sector and source market. These are presented to  
the Board by the Executive Directors and time set aside in April, July 
and September to allow full consideration and debate as to the level 
and 	 t ype 	 o f 	 risk 	 tha t 	 the 	 Boar d 	 finds 	 appr opria t e 	 in 	 the 	 pursuit 	 of	
enhanced shareholder value. Through this process, the strategic 
options and the trade-offs between risk and reward are debated 
upfr ont 	 and 	 thr o u gh 	 on g o in g 	 r e view 	 and 	 r efinement 	 ar e 	 pulled	
pr o gr essiv ely 	 int o 	 the 	 close 	 w ea v e 	 o f 	 stra t egic 	 int ent 	 that 	 best 	 fit s	 
the business, its culture, capabilities and resource. The strategy,  
onc e 	 fully 	 defined, 	 c onsider ed 	 and 	 appr o v ed 	 b y 	 the 	 Boar d, 	 is 	 then	
inc orporat ed 	 int o 	 the 	 Gr o up ’ s 	 fiv e 	 y ear 	 r oadmap 	 and 	 helps 	 t o 	 define	
and communicate the risk appetite and expectations of the 
organisation both internally and externally.
Risks TO the Strategy: (Execution)
Having determined the appropriate level of risk for the business, in 
relation to the potential for reward, the Board then ensures that risks 
t o 	 the 	 deliv er y 	 of 	 the 	 strat egic 	 objec tiv es 	 ar e 	 identified, 	 assessed 	 and	
managed effectively. 
While the Nomination Committee ensures an optimum balance  
of 	 skills, 	 kno wledg e 	 and 	 experienc e 	 r equir ed 	 within 	 the 	 ex ecutiv e	
management team to deliver the strategy, the Remuneration 
Committee ensures the appropriate incentivisation to drive high 
performance with commensurate control. Business performance 
r elating 	 t o 	 the 	 a chie v ement 	 of 	 strat egic, 	 operati onal 	 and 	 financial	
objec tiv es 	 is 	 r e vie w ed 	 and 	 monit or ed 	 closely 	 at 	Business Review 
Meetings chaired by the Chief Executive.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, seeks assurance  
that the risk management process is operating effectively throughout 
the organisation and that risks to the delivery of the strategy and 
long-term viability of the business are being managed effectively such 
that 	 the 	 risk 	 pr ofile 	 is 	 w ell 	 within 	 the 	 risk 	 capa cit y 	 of 	 the 	 organisati on	
and appropriately aligned with the risk appetite set by the Board. The 
Audit Committee receives this assurance from three lines of defence: 
Management: The Audit Committee invites presentations from 
management on a routine basis to understand the key risks facing  
their businesses and how these are being addressed.
Group Functions: The Audit Committee receives updates from the 
Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) and Group Risk 
function on activities relating to risk management as well as updates 
from the Group functions (including their relevant Compliance 
functions) on activities relating to the establishment of control 
standards and adherence to them. 
Internal Audit: The Audit Committee receives assurance from Internal 
Audit over the processes, Principal risks and business transformation 
initiatives most critical to the Group’s continued success.
Operational Risk Governance
Whilst ultimate responsibility for risk management rests with the 
Board, effective day-to-day management of risk sits within the 
business. Management is responsible for setting the right tone at  
the top and establishing a culture where employees are expected  
to be risk aware, control minded and to ‘do the right thing’.
The GRMC is a Committee of the Group Management Board (GMB) 
comprising the full membership of the GMB supported by key 
members of the risk and control community. It is chaired by the  
Chief Executive and meets four times a year. The GRMC has two  
key responsibilities: 
•	 to ensure that an effective risk management process is operating 
throughout the organisation 
•	 to be involved actively in identifying, assessing and managing those 
risk s 	 most 	 significant 	 t o 	 the 	 long- t erm 	 value 	 of 	 the 	 organisati on.	
T o 	 discharg e 	 the 	 first 	 of 	 these 	 r esponsibilities 	 the 	 GRMC 	 selec t s 	 k e y	
business areas and Group functions for scrutiny and invites the MDs 
and their Risk Champions (individuals chosen by the MDs to champion 
the process in their respective business areas) to discuss how risk is 
manag ed 	 ( risk 	 pr oc ess ) 	 and 	 the 	 risk s 	 identified 	 ‘ bot t om 	 up ’ 	 as 	 a 	 r esult	
(risk content). It also receives regular presentations from the Director 
of Group Audit Services & Risk on the ongoing level of engagement 
and 	 ef f ec tiv eness 	 of 	 ea ch 	 Sec t or /Sour c e 	 Mark et 	 in 	 r elati on 	 t o 	 the 	 risk	
manag ement 	 pr oc ess, 	 specific 	 ar eas 	 of 	 str eng th 	 and 	 w eakness 	 b y	
individual business area and an analysis of the ‘bottom up’ risks 
reported, along with any developing themes.

Risk Governance Framework
The 	 majorit y 	 o f 	 GRMC 	 time 	 ho w e v er 	 is 	 r eser v ed 	 f or 	 the

achieve targeted risk level. These risks, controls and targets are 
reviewed and approved at the GRMC and then communicated  
‘top down’ to the wider business to ensure that risks are managed 
within these levels through the organisation. 
Recognising the unpredictability and speed at which risks can 
materialise into issues (risk velocity) and the impact this can have  
on the Group, the GRMC has developed tailored response plans for 
each of the Group’s key risks. Principal risk owners within the GRMC 
are accountable for developing Key Risk Indicators, as appropriate to 
increase the organisation’s awareness and sensitivity to movements 
in its risk landscape, thereby helping to extend its risk horizon and 
enhance its risk response capability. The GRMC also recognises the 
natural cycle of risk exposure, the interaction of individual risks and 
the extent to which individual risks may be offset through natural 
hed gin g 	 or 	 amplified 	 thr o u gh 	 specific 	 risk 	 c ombinati ons.	
Feedback to the Board
The Director of Group Audit Services & Risk provides an update to 
the Audit Committee and the Board on how risk is being managed 
across the organisation (risk process) and the Executive Directors 
provide an update to the Board twice a year on the key risks under 
consideration (risk content). This feedback is reviewed and debated 
b y 	 the 	 Boar d 	 t o 	 ensur e 	 tha t 	 it 	 fit s 	 with in 	 it s 	 o v erall 	 risk 	 appetit e .	
Wher e 	 ther e 	 is 	 misalignment 	 bet w een 	 the 	 risk 	 pr ofile 	 and 	 the 	 risk	
appetite (i.e. management are taking too much or too little risk 
r ela tiv e 	 t o 	 the 	 stra t egic 	 objec tiv es ) 	 the 	 Boar d 	 seek s 	 t o 	 ensur e 	 that	
appropriate corrective action is being taken. During the year the 
Board reviewed the completeness of the Principal risks, debated  
risk appetite and management’s alignment with it and raised issues 
relating to the transparency and consistency of ‘bottom up’ risks 
reported. 
Additional sub committees of the GMB
The following committees form part of the overall risk governance 
framework:
The Capability Committee supports the risk governance process 
by assessing the Group’s current capability and competence against 
it s 	 futur e 	 needs 	 in 	 the 	 a ch ie v ement 	 o f 	 it s 	 stra t egic 	 objec tiv es.	
The investment Committee ensures that risk and reward is closely 
scrutin ised 	 pri or 	 t o 	 an y 	 a c quisiti ons, 	 capital 	 expenditur e 	 and 	 major	
investments. 
The projects Committee 	 o v ersees 	 cr oss- Gr oup 	 pr o jec t s 	 and	
ensures that interdependencies and risks (both upside and 
downside) are understood fully and guidance provided, as 
appropriate.
Risk Management process
The Group Risk function supports the risk management process  
by providing guidance, support and challenge to management  
whilst acting as the central point for co-ordinating, monitoring  
and reporting on risk across the Group.
The Group Risk function applies a consistent risk methodology 
across all key areas of the business. This is underpinned by risk and 
control software implemented during FY12 which has reinforced 
clarity of language, visibility of risks, controls and actions and 
accountability of ownership.

the risks identify the gross risks relevant to the pursuit of strategy 
within their business area in the context of:
•	 longer-term strategic and emerging threats; 
•	 medium-term challenges associated with business change 
programmes; 
•	 shorter-term risks triggered by changes in the external and 
regulatory environment; and
•	 shorter-term risks in relation to internal operations and control.

areas of concern and enable the development of measures to control 
or remove the hazards. Safety management systems continue to be

The Group H&S induction programme – Safety in your Workplace 
– continues to be used to provide a baseline of H&S knowledge 
for employees. Since its launch in 2008, over 8,000 employees have 
completed the programme.
Within the United Kingdom, any relevant injuries, diseases or dangerous 
occurrences are reported under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR). The incident statistics 
for the UK for 2012/13 are given below.
Within the United Kingdom local and national authorities continue to 
visit various Group premises offering advice and highlighting relevant 
issues. No enforcement notices or convictions have occurred within

The Group attaches great importance to the health and safety (H&S) 
of its customers and employees at all levels of the business. Andrew John, 
Group Director – Secretariat, Health & Safety and Risk (formerly Group 
Legal Director & Company Secretary), continues to be the Group 
Management Board (GMB) member with responsibility for reporting  
to the GMB on H&S matters.
Sectors, and the divisions and businesses within them, continue to liaise, 
co-operate and share best practice in line with the TUI Travel H&S Policy 
Statement issued and signed by the Chief Executive, Peter Long. 
In the Group airlines, a risk-based safety management system (which 
engages the whole airline at all levels in safety management) is used. 
The operations of the airlines are regulated by the European Aviation 
Safety Agency (EASA) and by the applicable national aviation body 
(e.g. in the United Kingdom, the Civil Aviation Authority). Each Group

At Group level, the Board authorised the creation, with effect from 
1 July 2013, of a small Group H&S Compliance Department tasked with:

Customer safety
Each of the Sectors has responsibility for ensuring that sound customer 
H&S practices and robust safety management systems are embedded 
within their businesses. 
In the Mainstream Sector, the UK & Ireland business has outsourced 
certain aspects of its H&S activities to specialist external third-party 
providers who supply services related to general customer safety. 
This includes audits of overseas accommodation, transport and excursion 
suppliers (utilising a mix of physical visits and self-assessments), new 
builds and major refurbishments as well as targeted hygiene, water 
and 	 f ood 	 sa f et y 	 c onsultanc y 	 when 	 h igh-risk 	 ar eas 	 ar e 	 identified.	
These third-party providers are instructed and monitored by our 
UK-based team, which sets the H&S strategy, agrees the audit 
schedule and takes responsibility for the development and 
implementation of the UK & Ireland Mainstream safety management 
system. 
In our German businesses, there is a dedicated H&S team which is 
responsible for all H&S matters, together with the development and 
implementation of standards to ensure the wellbeing of all customers. 
Regular checks are undertaken and all relevant areas are monitored 
and reviewed on a continuous basis to identify any potential risks. 
In the Nordics, H&S activities across the Mainstream businesses 
(Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) are co-ordinated through 
the Crisis Management & Sustainability Business Development team. 
This team is responsible for setting H&S strategy, undertaking audits 
and for the operation and development of the TUI Nordic safety 
management system. 
The 	 Specialist 	 & 	 Ac tivit y 	 Sec t or 	 (SA S) 	 opera t es 	 a 	 Sec t or -specific 	 H&S	
function. The Sector’s H&S team consists of 12 professionals based in 
the UK and overseas, servicing all six SAS divisions. Audits of suppliers 
are undertaken utilising a mix of physical inspections and supplier self-
assessments by means of ‘Sure2Care’ – the in-house web-based due 
diligence system. 
Durin g 	 the 	 y ear , 	 an 	 enhanc ed 	 syst em 	 o f 	 ‘ risk 	 pr ofiling ’ 	 was 	 intr oduc ed	
against which all SAS businesses are measured. Appropriate safety 
management systems are devised and implemented according to the 
risk s 	 identified 	 with in 	 ea ch 	 business.
In the Accommodation & Destinations Sector (A&D), H&S is managed 
by each individual division and business. These businesses are either 
involved in the supply of traditional destination market services (such as 
accommodation, excursions and transportation) or in the online supply 
of hotel accommodation in many countries. The ‘Sure2Care’ in-house 
safety system tool is used to verify the safety of the products and 
services being marketed.

Group performance 
Year ended 30 September
Group revenue grew by 4% from the prior year to £15,051m 
(2012: £14,460m). This result was driven by organic growth of 2% 
and a foreign currency translation impact of 2%. Organic revenue 
growth was driven by higher package volumes and average selling 
prices in many source markets.
The main drivers of the year-on-year improvement in underlying 
operating profit are as follows:
£m
2012 underlying operating profit 490
Mainstream trading +34
French contract provision -11
Accommodation Wholesaler +10
Specialist & Activity -12
Other -2
Business improvement +46
2013 underlying operating profit at constant currency 555
FX translation +34
2013 underlying operating profit 589
Underlying operating profit improved by £65m to £555m in 2013, 
on a constant currency basis, an increase of 13%.
The improvement in operating profit was driven by strong 
performances in the UK, Germany and Nordic region as well as the 
delivery of £46m cost savings through the business improvement 
programme. These cost savings were primarily driven by back office 
restructuring and IT platform replacement across a number of 
markets. However, these positive results were partially offset by 
weakness in our French tour operator and Specialist & Activity Sector.
A reconciliation of underlying operating profit to statutory operating 
profit is as follows:

Having taken delivery of our first Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft 
earlier this year, we announced on 19 November 2013 that we are 
ordering two additional 787-8 aircraft. The additional order takes the 
Group’s commitment from 13 to 15 Dreamliners, with the additional 
two aircraft expected to arrive in 2016. TUI Travel operates six airlines, 
four of which operate, or will operate, Dreamliner aircraft: Thomson 
Airways, Arkefly, TUI Fly Nordic and Jetairfly.
As well as long haul, we also confirmed plans to renew our short/mid 
haul fleet during the year. On 9 July 2013, we announced the order of 
60 narrow-body Boeing 737 mAX aircraft from Boeing, as part of our 
fleet renewal strategy and move to modern mainstream. The 737 mAX 
aircraft utilise a new technology engine type from CFm which Boeing 
asserts results in a 13% improvement in fuel efficiency and a 40% 
noise reduction over today’s main competitors. This results in lower per 
seat costs than current generation aircraft and competitor products. 
The delivery period for the 60 committed aircraft will start in January 
2018 and run until March 2023. We also have the option and right to 
purchase up to a further 90 Boeing 737 mAX aircraft.
Acquisitions & investments
Acquisitions were made in the year for a total investment value of 
£30m in order to expand business operations in line with the Group’s 
growth strategy. Businesses acquired during the year primarily related 
to the 50.1% of TUI Infotec GmbH that the Group did not already 
own and 100% of the share capital of JBS Group, Isango! and TT 
Visa Services.
Net financial expenses
Net financial expenses have increased from £100m to £116m, primarily 
as a result of one-off gains in the prior year not repeating of £9m, 
coupled with £7m higher expenses from asset backed financing in the 
current year.
The revision to IAS 19 ‘employee benefits’ is effective for the financial 
year commencing 1 October 2013 and makes significant changes to the 
recognition, measurement and disclosure of defined benefit pension 
schemes. The most significant impact for the Group is that interest 
expense will be calculated by applying the discount rate on the net 
defined benefit liability. This replaces the interest cost on the defined 
benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets. Had the 
standard been applied in the current financial year, the Group’s net 
financial expense would have been £12m higher.
Separately disclosed items (SDIs)
Separately disclosed items net to a £24m expense in the year (2012: £92m 
expense). The following table provides a breakdown of these items:
2013
£m
2012
£m
Restructuring 54 102 
Pension credit (25) –
Other (5) (10)
Total SDIs 24 92 
The separately disclosed items expense includes the following items:
• £25m occurring in France from the ongoing restructure of the tour 
operator and the airline.
• £18m incurred in the Specialist & Activity sector due to the removal 
of the sector management team, the closure of a business in the 
l anguages division, further restructuring of the adventure business 
and rationalisation of overseas bases in the marine division.
• £7m in Accommodation & Destinations sector due to a 
rationalisation of business structure in several regional programmes. 
• £25m pension credit relating to the closure of the TUI Netherlands 
defined benefit pension scheme and transfer of the existing pension 
fund assets and liabilities to AeGON.
Further information is included within Note 4.
Goodwill impairment charge
The total goodwill impairment charge recognised in the year was 
£188m. This included a £119m impairment within Specialist & Activity, 
primarily across the education, marine and Sport businesses, and a 
£69m impairment within mainstream, primarily relating to businesses 
trading in North Africa. 
Further information is included within Note 10.
Taxation
The underlying effective rate of taxation for the year ended 
30 September 2013 is calculated based on the underlying profit before 
tax (excluding separately disclosed items, acquisition related expenses 
and impairment charges) for the year of £473m and is calculated at 
27%. Based on the current structure of the business and existing local 
taxation rates and legislation, it is expected that the underlying tax rate 
will be maintained at this level in the medium term.
The actual tax rate of 72% differs from the underlying effective tax 
rate due to the tax effect of the non-recognition of tax losses in France 
and goodwill impairment charges of £188m on which no tax deduction 
is available.

BUs In ess and f In an CIal rev Iew The cash tax rate is expected to be lower than the underlying income 
tax rate as we utilise our deferred tax assets generated from 
restructuring expenditure and trading losses. During the year, the 
Group paid £14m of UK cash corporation tax and a further £96m  
of cash corporate taxes in other jurisdictions. In the coming year, we 
envisage a cash tax rate of approximately 20% of underlying profit 
before tax.
In October 2013, the Group reached agreement on the terms to settle 
a tax audit with the Spanish tax authorities. Further information is 
included within Note 8.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share was 30.8p (2012: 25.8p).  
Statutory basic earnings per share was 5.4p (2012: 12.5p).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 9.75p per share 
(2012: 8.30p). On 10 May 2013 the Board recommended an interim 
dividend of 3.75p per share (2012: 3.40p), making a full year dividend of 
13.5p per share (2012: 11.7p). The final dividend will be paid on 9 April 
2014 to holders of relevant shares on the register at 7 march 2014.
The Group’s policy is to maintain underlying dividend cover at around 
two times. We intend to continue to operate a dividend re-investment 
plan as an alternative to receiving a cash dividend.
Cash and liquidity
The net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less loans, overdrafts 
and finance leases) at 30 September 2013 was £2m (30 September 
2012: net debt of £142m). This excludes restricted cash of £145m 
(2012: £34m). The increase in restricted cash is primarily due to receipt 
of £98m from the Belgian government in relation to disputed VAT in  
a long-running court case. Further information is included in Note 17.
The net cash position consisted of £1,753m of cash and cash 
equivalents, which includes restricted cash of £145m, £594m of current 
interest-bearing loans and liabilities and £1,012m of non-current 
interest-bearing loans and liabilities. As at 30 September 2013, undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities totalled £1,192m (2012: £1,018m).
Cashflow conversion is 90% of underlying profit before tax. Free cash

We remain satisfied with our funding and liquidity position. We have 
three main sources of long-term debt funding as at 9 December 2013 
– these include the external bank revolving credit facilities totalling 
£1,120m which mature in June 2015, a £350m convertible bond (due 
October 2014) and a £400m convertible bond (due April 2017). The 
external bank revolving facilities are used to manage the seasonality  
of the Group’s cash flows and liquidity. 
We signed a medium-term £300m bank credit facility during the year, 
maturing in April 2016. This was to ensure the Group was in a position, 
if required, to redeem the £350m convertible bond that matures in 
October 2014. We expect to refinance our bank revolving credit facility 
approximately 12 months ahead of its maturity date.

Our growth levers 
Creating shareholder value
We are very pleased with our performance this year against our clearly 
defined strategic growth levers. These drive improved profitability 
and free cash flow, and therefore, superior returns on investment. 
This improvement will allow us to invest further in the future of our 
business which will benefit our customers, colleagues and shareholders.
1. Delivering Mainstream Growth
We are 18 months into running this Sector in a more cohesive way 
which we are calling “One mainstream”. This move is enabling us to 
fully leverage both the strength of expertise across the Sector and 
the scale of the Group. Our mainstream business reported a record 
performance over the year, with underlying operating profits growing 
by 22% to £514m. Since the creation of the mainstream Board, a lot 
has been achieved:
• Our single purchasing team is responsible for purchasing £4.5bn  
of accommodation across all our mainstream businesses; gaining  
key exclusivities, driving down cost and managing commitments to 
ensure we leverage our scale as europe’s largest tour operator.
• We have a unified approach to the development of international 
unique holiday concepts.
• The Distribution and Online function is responsible for developing 
and agreeing the direct distribution strategy across all source 
markets.
• Within Digital Transformation we are taking a single approach across 
booking systems, platforms, customer engagement tools and digital 
content. 
• In-Resort Services is focused on delivering a modern efficient 
digitally enabled service to our customers in resort.
• The Group’s five leisure airlines are reducing duplication, driving  
best practice, investing once for the benefit of all five airlines and 
improving flexibility wherever possible.
• Across the Sector, benchmarking of cost and revenue positions  
has led to clear business efficiency targets to drive down costs  
in the back office and drive ancillary revenue benefits.
• One mainstream enables us to further develop our customer 
proposition and our customer experience function will ensure that 
we consistently touch every part of our customer’s journey. One 
mainstream continues to evolve, delivering greater benefits as one 
business across the strategic drivers of unique holidays, direct 
distribution and operational efficiency. 
1.1 Unique holidays only available from TUI Travel
Unique holidays
Our unique holidays form the backbone of our mainstream businesses 
and are exclusive to us. Unique holidays provide value added services 
and features which command a margin premium over commodity 
products. This in turn leads to higher customer loyalty and an increase 
in repeat bookings. Unique holidays also book earlier enabling us to 
manage our capacity and yield more effectively. Due to our experience 
in designing and operating new concepts it is very difficult for our 
competitors to replicate these holidays.
Sales of higher margin unique holidays during the year increased by 
four percentage points to 69% of mainstream holidays. This includes 
the UK and Germany, which both saw sales of unique holidays increase 
by four percentage points. The Nordics market saw unique holidays 
increase by one percentage point over the year. In the UK, 93% of 
Thomson holidays were unique in Summer 2013. We achieved a 
customer satisfaction score of 79% for our three largest mainstream 
markets, a two percentage point increase over the prior year, driven  
by improved scores in all three source markets. Demand for unique 
holiday experiences continues to see strong growth and our customers 
are more delighted than ever with the holiday experiences we have 
designed for them.
One mobility platform
Our unique holiday offering gives us control over the end-to-end 
customer experience and an opportunity to interact with our 
customers throughout their journey. We have a clear digital strategy to 
enhance and deepen the relationship with our customers. This year we 
have successfully launched our award-winning digital assistant app in 
the UK and German markets. The apps have received almost 200,000 
downloads to date and good levels of engagement with almost 100,000 
shares through social media channels. 
Other markets will launch on the same platform during 2014 giving  
us one common mobility platform across all markets. The digital 
assistant is a key driver in maintaining the ongoing customer 
relationship and will be used to link our people more effectively with 
our customers any time, anywhere, any way with an ongoing pipeline 
of features continuing to be added, including mobile boarding passes, 
seat selection and upgrade, search and book functionality as well  
as an ability to create personalised recommendations and offers.  
To connect our people with our customers we are digitally enabling  
our in-resort teams with tablets to effectively connect our physical 
presence with the digital world. 
Flight experience
A key part of our unique holiday offering is also the flight experience 
and we continue to reshape the composition of our airline fleet to 
drive customer satisfaction and simplify the fleet to one short-haul 
and one long-haul aircraft type. We were the first UK operator to  
take delivery of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner earlier this year and 
remain the only integrated tour operator to operate these aircraft.  
The customer experience is very important to us and the feedback we 
receive from those who fly on these aircraft is exceptional. The Boeing 
787 family provides unmatched fuel efficiency, resulting in exceptional 
environmental performance. The aircraft uses 20 % less fuel than 
today’s aircraft of a similar size. We are also enabling a single set of 
operating procedures for the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fleet across 
engineering, maintenance and crew, creating a more flexible and 
efficient fleet.
Having a modern, cost-efficient and reliable fleet is strategically 
important to the Group. We are strongly positioned with a young 
aircraft fleet compared to other leisure airlines. The average age of  
our fleet is eight years, however a significant portion of our narrow 
body fleet consists of Boeing 737-800 aircraft which have an average 
age of 5.5 years. Being able to offer our customers the most advanced, 
comfortable aircraft, whether they are travelling with us to short or 
long-haul destinations, while reducing our environmental impact, will 
only strengthen our position. In July 2013 our shareholders approved 
an order for 60 new Boeing 737-mAX aircraft with deliveries beginning 
in 2018, along with an option and right to acquire up to 90 further 
aircraft. This will further reduce the average age of our fleet, resulting 
in TUI Travel continuing to operate one of the youngest and most fuel 
efficient airlines in europe.
1.2  Distributed directly to the customer – growth from online
Direct distribution
Our direct distribution channels are central to the Group’s strategy. By 
increasing the direct distribution of our holidays we lower distribution 
costs, reduce the reliance on third party distributors and can build on 
our customer relationships. Our direct distribution mix improved by 
one percentage point over the year to 66% of mainstream sales, with 
improvements in all key source markets. The improvement in direct 
distribution was driven by the online channel which also increased by 
two percentage points in 2013 to 35% of mainstream sales. During the 
year, we generated £3.7bn of revenue online within our mainstream 
business, reflecting 12% growth in online package bookings.

BUs In ess and f In an CIal rev Iew One online platform
As an online-driven business, we have a focus on the online customer 
experience. During the year, we continued to see the benefits of the 
investments we have been making in our online platforms. We are 
moving to one core online platform across mainstream. The UK and 
Nordic markets have made this transition and are seeing significant 
improvements in conversion as a result of the redesigned user 
experience and search functionality that makes it easier for the 
customer to find their perfect holiday experience with us. Our other 
core markets will begin using the same online platform during the 
course of 2014. The websites in our core online markets are now tablet 
and mobile optimised as our customers increasingly use their tablets 
and mobile devices to dream, plan, search and book with us.
Next generation retail stores
We continue to modernise our retail offering. In the UK we have 
launched the first of our next generation stores which combine 
personal advice and service with a rich digital experience that enables 
customers to build their perfect holiday. This will be integrated into  
a holiday planner tool that allows them to take their ideas home with 
them and book using whatever channel they choose.
1.3 Leveraging our scale
As europe’s largest tour operator we leverage our scale across all 
source markets to consolidate our market-leading position and grow 
the number of customers travelling with us. Our One mainstream 
structure is in place and yielding tangible benefits. The move from 
multiple online and back-end platforms to one core platform is a key 
driver of efficiencies going forward. 
We have market leading positions and brands across our portfolio.  
The breadth of our brands offers our customers a wealth of holiday 
experiences. This leading market position and scale means that our 
competition cannot easily replicate what we do. There are significant 
barriers to entry in both our positioning and deep-rooted relationships 
with hotel suppliers. Our scale also enables us to deliver synergy 
benefits through joint contracting and purchasing of accommodation 
and destination contracting. 
During the year, overheads as a percentage of sales fell by 60bp from 
5.2% to 4.6%. We expect to hold overheads in absolute terms and,  
as a result, overheads as a percentage of sales will reduce further.
2. Organic Specialist & Activity growth
The Specialist & Activity Sector offers a wide range of unique activity 
and experience based holidays to 1.4m customers from around the 
world. We have market-leading positions in a number of specialist 
segments with a portfolio of experiential and tailor-made holidays, 
unrivalled product knowledge and superb customer experiences.
During 2013, the Specialist & Activity Sector underwent a strategic 
review which included a change in management, a reduction of  
central costs from streamlining back-office operations and the exit  
of a number of unprofitable lines of business. As a result, overall sales 
were down on the prior year. Now that this review is complete we are 
confident of delivering underlying annualised profit growth of 8-10%  
at constant currency in the year ahead. 
We are investing in our online platforms to enhance booking and 
search functionality and provide our customers with inspirational 
content to showcase our products. Our specialist businesses are 
making good progress in consolidating their finance and reservation 
systems to leverage our scale across multiple brands and continue  
on their journey of standardisation while balancing the varied 
requirements of the different holiday experiences they offer. 
3.  Leveraging our global leadership position in 
Accommodation Wholesaler through growth 
in existing markets
Our Accommodation Wholesaler business (Hotelbeds and Bedsonline) 
is a market leader operating in the B2B segment with a global 
distribution presence. We have a clear strategy of consolidating our 
market-leading position even further by continuing to grow our existing 
destinations whilst accelerating our expansion into new markets with 
particular focus on Asia, l atin America and Africa. The total Online 
Accommodation market accounts for £87bn of global travel spend, 
with the Accommodation Wholesaler market accounting for £17bn  
of this spend. 
Accommodation Wholesaler continues to consolidate its global 
leadership position, delivering TTV growth of 23% to £1,655m during 
the year with a strong performance from Asia and l atin America. 
Roomnights grew by 16% to 19.3 million during 2013, with hotel 
inventory also increasing by 16% to 62,000 hotels. Accommodation 
Wholesaler delivered a 28% growth in underlying operating profit 
during the year at constant currency rates.
4. Investing in Accommodation OTA
In Accommodation OTA (online travel agent) our focus is to build on 
our strong brand positioning of l ateRooms.com in the UK and expand 
in the emerging markets through AsiaRooms.com across Asia and in 
Brazil with malaPronta, Brazil’s fourth largest accommodation-only 
OTA. 
Accommodation OTA TTV declined by 6% to £422m during the year. 
This decline was driven by a delay in migration to a new online 
platform for l ateRooms. The new platforms are now in place, 
delivering an improved user experience. l ateRooms continues to 
benefit from strong brand recognition and S eO (search engine 
optimisation) visibility. On the mobile front, we designed and delivered 
mobile-optimised websites for l ateRooms, AsiaRooms and malapronta 
as well as making a number of significant improvements to the 
l ateRooms and AsiaRooms apps. 
5.  Focus on free cash flow generation, ROIC and 
operational efficiency
One of our key strategic objectives is to continue to improve the 
Group’s profitability and free cash flow and therefore deliver superior 
returns on investment. This improvement will allow us to invest  
further in the future of our business which will benefit our customers, 
colleagues and shareholders.
During the year, we generated record cash flow with free cash 
improvement of £122m to £427m. Underlying ROIC has improved 
again this year by 2.6 percentage points to 14.8%. This increase was 
driven by the strong improvement in earnings during the year. We 
generated a cash conversion rate of 90% in 2013, up by 12 percentage 
points. We continue to target a cash conversion rate of at least 70% 
going forward.
We have been successful in implementing our Group-wide business 
improvement programmes this year. The total savings made this  
year equates to £46m, an acceleration of the target outlined at the 
start of year. These cost savings were primarily driven by back office 
restructuring and IT platform replacement across a number of 
markets. 
Our drive to improve efficiency does not stop here. Our One 
mainstream platform is already in place and yielding tangible benefits. 
The move from multiple platforms to one core platform is a key driver 
of efficiencies going forward.

The UK business delivered a £54m improvement in underlying 
operating profit to £251m during the year. This translates to an 
operating margin of 6.5%, a 110 basis point improvement over the 
prior year. This record result was driven by strong load factors, focus 
on higher margin unique holidays increasingly distributed online and  
a 5% increase in package volumes during the year.
Demand for our unique holidays remained strong over the period, 
accounting for 83% of departures, up four percentage points on the 
prior year. We expanded a number of unique holiday products over  
the Summer season, driven by customer demand, including Couples, 
Splash and Sensatori concepts. The result also benefited from a two 
percentage point increase in direct distribution to 89% compared with 
the prior year. Online bookings accounted for 47% of all bookings, up 
three percentage points year-on-year. As part of our mobile strategy, 
we launched the myThomson app into the Apple App Store in June 
with high ratings and over 180,000 downloads to date. 
The UK business delivered £6m of efficiency savings towards the 
business improvement programme in the period.

Nordics achieved an underlying operating profit of £79m (2012: £71m). 
This improved position was driven by strong trading in the tour 
operator, a non-repeat of the flooding in Bangkok which adversely 
affected the result last year and 8% increase in package volumes 
during the year. The Nordic business maintained a strong underlying 
operating margin of 6.5%.
Unique holidays accounted for 93% of departures, broadly in line with 
the prior year but masking a shift to higher margin concept hotels within 
this mix. In particular, there was strong demand for our Blue Couples 
and Blue Star concepts. Direct distribution increased by two percentage 
points to 89%. Online distribution continues to grow, standing at 67% 
of bookings, up two percentage points over the prior year.

Germany reported a strong underlying operating profit up by £26m  
to £113m (2012: £87m). l ong-haul performed particularly well, with 
strong demand to Thailand, USA and Cuba. Whilst overall package 
volumes were flat during the year, primarily due to a re-focused 
programme, unique holidays saw year-on-year growth. The operating 
margin for the German business increased by 50 basis points to 2.7% 
in 2013, driven by higher margins in Greece in particular following the 
Euro crisis during 2012. 
Unique holidays accounted for 51% of departures, up four percentage 
points over the prior year. Demand has been driven by the Robinson 
and Sensimar brands, and our new TUI Reisewelten labels (Beach, 
Classic, l ifestyle, Nature, Premium and Scene), which have been well 
received by our customers. 
We continue to implement our strategy to improve direct distribution 
with a focus on online via our TUI.com website. Direct distribution 
stands at 36%, an increase of two percentage points over the prior 
year. On the retail side, we intend to roll out TUI branding across the 
majority of our owned and franchised shops. Online continues to grow 
and stood at 8% of bookings in 2013, up by four percentage points 
from the prior year. A key focus remains mobile optimisation and 
following the year-end we have launched the meine TUI app in 
Germany. This is the adapted version of the myThomson digital 
assistant app that launched in the UK earlier this year. We expect  
to roll out the app across other source markets during 2014. 
The German business delivered £9m of efficiency savings towards the 
business improvement programme in the period. Restructuring will 
continue to focus on simplifying the corporate structure through the 
2014 financial year.

France reported an underlying operating loss of £60m (2012: loss of £47m). 
The higher loss versus last year was driven by the tour operator, which 
continued to be impacted by low demand for North Africa and general 
weakness in the French economy. As a result, we have reduced our 
loss-making long-haul programme, removed unprofitable routes and 
destinations from the portfolio as well as providing for £11m of 
onerous French hotel contracts. 
The French tour operator delivered £11m of efficiency savings towards 
the business improvement programme in the period. We implemented 
further restructuring in the French business towards the end of the 
year to streamline our back-office and retail functions in light of a 
continuing adverse trading environment. An additional £19m of 
restructuring costs was recognised in the 2013 income statement as 
separately disclosed items and we expect the cash impact for this to  
be spread over the next two years. The combination of shop closures 
and head-count reductions will deliver a further £15m cost reduction 
by 2017. 
The Airline result significantly improved from the prior year, moving 
very close to a breakeven position. The turnaround was driven by 
changes to the fleet composition, which saw two new A330-300 
aircraft arriving during the period. A smaller, more flexible fleet  
will help to reduce risk within the programme. In addition to this, 
significant improvements were made to the customer experience with 
increased customer service standards. The restructuring programme 
in the French airline is now complete, with £12m of efficiency savings 
towards the business improvement programme delivered in the period.

Specialist & Activity
Specialist & Activity reported a profit of £41m (2012: £48m) reflecting the exit of a number of unprofitable 
lines of business, tough comparatives in the Sports business and higher costs in our marine business. 
However, this lower result was partially offset by strong margins in our Ski business as well as improved 
trading in the Adventure business. 
During the year, the Specialist & Activity Sector underwent a period of restructuring where we reduced 
central and back-office costs across the business. Some of this restructuring cost was absorbed into the 
underlying 2013 sector result. This restructuring is now largely complete and the business is on track to 
deliver growth in 2014 as set out in our road map.

Online Accommodation
The Online Accommodation business delivered underlying operating 
profit of £40m (2012: £35m), reflecting a strong underlying performance 
in Accommodation Wholesaler as well as the expansion in Asia for our 
OTA business and investment in our recent Brazilian OTA acquisition, 
malapronta. TTV for Online Accommodation grew by 17% to £2.1bn and 
roomnights increased by 10% primarily due to strong organic growth 
from our Accommodation Wholesaler brands (Hotelbeds and Bedsonline). 
Accommodation Wholesaler continues to consolidate its global 
leadership position, delivering TTV growth of 23% to £1,655m during 
the year with a strong performance from Asia and l atin America. 
Roomnights grew by 16% to 19.3 million during 2013, with hotel 
inventory also increasing by 16% to 62,000 hotels. Accommodation 
Wholesaler delivered a 28% growth in underlying operating profit 
during the year. 
Accommodation OTA TTV declined by 6% to £422m during the year. 
This decline was driven by a delay in migration to a new online 
platform for l ateRooms. The new platforms are now in place, 
delivering an improved user experience. l ateRooms continues to 
benefit from strong brand recognition and S eO visibility. On the mobile 
front, we designed and delivered mobile-optimised websites for 
l ateRooms, AsiaRooms and malapronta as well as making a number  
of significant improvements to the l ateRooms and AsiaRooms apps. 
Inbound Services
The Inbound Services business delivered underlying operating 
profit of £38m (2012: £31m). This was driven by a good underlying 
performance from the business, £2m positive translation impact,  
and by a reallocation of overhead costs from the Accommodation  
& Destinations sector to the emerging markets sector. 
Incoming passenger volumes increased by 7% over the prior year. 
In cruise handling, the number of port calls handled increased by 8%.

Current trading and outlook
s ummer 2014
For Summer 2014, we are pleased with early trading, despite facing 
strong comparatives from the prior year, and continue to see strong 
demand for our unique holidays. To date, approximately 13% of the 
overall mainstream Summer programme has been sold. We currently 
expect capacity for our Summer 2014 programme to be in line with  
last year, although we have the flexibility in our model to make 
strategic capacity changes on select high-margin opportunities. Our 
restructured Specialist & Activity business has had a good start to the 
year, whilst Accommodation Wholesaler continues to see double-digit 
growth, driven by Asia and l atin America. 
Fuel/Foreign exchange
We have hedged the majority of our fuel and currency requirements 
for the seasons currently on sale, which gives us certainty of costs 
when planning capacity and pricing. The following table shows the 
percentage of our forecast requirement that is currently hedged for 
euros, US Dollars and jet fuel.
As at 5 December 2013 Winter 2013/14 Summer 2014
Euro 91% 74%
US Dollars 93% 86%
Jet Fuel 89% 78%
Outlook
Overall, we are pleased with trading at the start of our new financial 
year. Winter 2013/14 performance is in line with expectations with 60% 
of the programme sold. For Summer 2014, we are encouraged by early 
trading despite strong comparatives. In particular, we continue to see 
strong demand for our unique holidays. Our Accommodation Wholesaler 
business is seeing sustained double-digit growth, driven by Asia and 
l atin America, whilst our restructured Specialist & Activity business  
has had a good start to the year and is on track to deliver growth as 
set out in our road-map. At this stage, we continue to expect to hold 
our Winter loss and deliver a H1 result broadly in line with last year, 
excluding the timing of easter which falls in the second half of the year.
TUI Travel is structurally well positioned with a robust business  
model that gives us a long-term competitive advantage. The business 
continues to deliver sustainable growth through our unique holiday 
experiences, increasingly distributed online, whilst leveraging its scale 
as one organisation. This, in turn, will drive further value for both our 
customers and shareholders. Building on this year’s outperformance 
where we have achieved a 13% underlying operating profit growth 
on a constant currency basis, we remain confident that we will deliver 
consistently on our five year annualised growth target of between 
7% to 10% underlying operating profit growth at constant currency. 
Winter 2013/14
Performance for Winter 2013/14 is in line with our expectations. 
To date 60% of the overall mainstream Winter programme has been 
sold. As a result of the unrest in egypt we have actively remixed the 
programme and reduced our capacity to egypt, which now accounts 
for less than 5% of the total programme. All markets now have their 
egypt programmes back on sale, however, demand is lower than last 
year. Overall mainstream bookings excluding egypt are down by 4%, 
with average selling prices up 5%. In Germany, bookings are down 9% 
excluding egypt, with the majority of this decline relating to the high 
volume but lower margin overland programme, whilst our core unique 
package holiday offering continues to deliver in line with expectations. 
Trading in Specialist & Activity is in line with expectations, whilst the 
Accommodation Wholesaler continues to grow strongly with TTV up 
by 24%, driven by the l atin American and Asian markets.

Tax 
The Group’s approach to tax 
The Group’s approach to tax matters is to comply with all relevant tax 
laws and regulations, wherever we operate in the world, whilst managing 
our overall tax burden. We look to pay the right and fair amount of taxes 
in accordance with the letter and spirit of the laws in the countries in 
which we do business. 
We consider the ‘right’ amount of tax as being in accordance with the 
letter of the law and the ‘fair’ amount of tax as being in accordance  
with the government policy intention for which the law was introduced.
Context
The effective tax rate on the Group’s underlying profit before tax for 
2013 was 27%. The Group paid cash income taxes of £110m. We 
consider the cash taxes that we pay to governments are an important 
source of revenue for them in providing a stable infrastructure and 
environment in which we operate our businesses.
The Group’s businesses operate in 180 countries. This geographical 
diversity leads to considerable complexity in our tax affairs, and tax 
authorities around the world are subjecting the tax affairs of large 
companies to ever greater scrutiny. We look to manage our tax affairs in 
a manner to support our business operations with the aim of ensuring 
that the tax consequences of our business operations match with the 
economic and commercial consequences of those business operations. 
For example, we look to ensure that the same profits are not taxed twice 
by different countries, and that transactions between subsidiary and 
associate companies are conducted on arm’s length terms and prices. 
Where a tax rule, regulation or incentive exists that may convey a tax 
advantage to our operations, such as using losses incurred in prior years 
or tax depreciation from investing in our business, we will use that rule, 
regulation or incentive to support our businesses. In many countries, 
such rules operate automatically by law, for example, using UK losses 
incurred in prior years to offset current year UK taxable profits.
The Group uses the services of external, expert tax advisors to provide 
input into the Group’s tax affairs, such as the management of compliance 
in some overseas jurisdictions and the impact of changes in tax 
legislation on the Group.
Tax governance
The Group’s tax strategy is determined by the Board of Directors  
as a sub-set of the Group’s overall business strategy and is approved 
annually by the Audit Committee. Operational responsibility for the 
execution of the Group’s tax strategy rests with the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Group Tax Director who report the Group’s tax 
position to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Group Risk Management Committee considers tax risks that  
may arise as a result of our business operations, on a quarterly basis, 
through the Group’s risk management framework. The consideration 
of such tax risks includes actions to mitigate the risks or to prevent 
their occurrence or recurrence.
The location of our businesses 
TUI Travel operates across 31 key source markets. These source 
markets are ‘home’ to our tour operators and airlines. It is from these 
source markets that our 30 million customers wish to travel. Our 
inbound services companies and associates operate in key leisure 
travel destinations. 
As a leisure travel group, we take people on holiday to some countries 
that have low or zero tax rates. This means that we may have 
subsidiary companies in such locations, for example, we have a legal 
entity in the British Virgin Islands which operates a yacht base for our 
Moorings business and is one of the island’s largest employers. We also 
have legal entities in other Caribbean islands for the same purpose and 
for operating hotels that our customers visit.

Payment of taxes
In the year ended 30 September 2013, the Group paid corporate 
income taxes of £110m as per the table below:
The amounts shown below represent the corporate income tax, or 
corporation tax and cash tax payments made by the Group and its 
subsidiary companies during the year ended 30 September 2013. 
Different countries have different rules as to how companies should 
make payments of cash taxes with some requiring payments on account 
to be made during the current year or the immediately following year or 
a combination of these methods, whilst others may use the immediately 
preceding year as the basis for cash tax payments. Cash tax payments 
may be lower than the tax charge for the year due to the utilisation of 
brought forward tax losses against current year profits.
With regard to UK cash taxes, £14m is the corporation tax paid in the 
year ended 30 September 2013. This is lower than may be expected 
due to the utilisation of losses brought forward from earlier years and 
tax depreciation (UK capital allowances) resulting from investment  
in our UK business. We expect the amount of UK corporation tax to 
increase in future years as these brought forward losses reduce.
r elationships with tax authorities
We look to develop and maintain good working relationships with tax 
authorities in the countries in which we operate. We communicate with 
them in an open, honest and positive manner. Where it is possible to 
do so, we seek to discuss our major commercial transactions and their 
tax consequences and treatment with tax authorities in advance of 
their execution or seek an advance ruling of the tax consequences and 
treatment of such transactions in order to provide us with certainty  
of the tax treatment. We are committed to transparent and prompt  
full disclosure in all tax matters. We pay our tax liabilities when they 
become due.
We recognise that there will be areas of differing legal interpretations 
between the Group and tax authorities. Where this occurs, we will 
engage with tax authorities to try to resolve the matters in a co-
operative and expedited manner. Where a conclusion cannot be 
reached in such a manner, the tax authority or the Group may choose 
to litigate the issue through the relevant legal system.
The Group reviews new tax law and regulations that governments 
around the world introduce from time to time. Where we believe that 
new laws would have a disproportionate or detrimental impact on the 
Group’s businesses or require amendment to achieve the intention of 
the new law, we will lobby the relevant government, either in our own 
name or as part of a trade association, to explain the potential issues 
and to suggest alternatives.

Board procedures/responsibilities
The Board’s primary responsibility is to promote the long-term success 
of the Company by creating and delivering sustainable shareholder 
value. The Board seeks to achieve this through setting out its strategy, 
monitoring its strategic objectives and providing oversight and 
direction to the management team. The Board considers the impact  
of its decisions on wider stakeholders including employees, suppliers 
and the environment.
The Board meets regularly, including visits to operational locations, 
and is responsible for the overall leadership, strategy and control of 
the Group. A full schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s decision, 
along with the terms of reference of the Board’s key committees 
and the individual roles of Board members can be found online at 
www.tuitravelplc.com and will be available for inspection at the AGM. 
The schedule of matters includes: 
•	 determining the strategy of the Group; 
•	 amendments to the structure and capital of the Group; 
•	 appr o val 	 of 	 financial 	 r epor ting ;	
•	 oversight of the Group’s internal controls;
•	 appr o val 	 of 	 capital 	 and 	 r e v enue 	 expenditur e 	 of 	 a 	 significant 	 siz e ;	
•	 acquisitions, disposals and share dealings; 
•	 Board membership and appointments; 
•	 approval of remuneration of Directors and certain 
senior management;
•	 corporate governance matters; and 
•	 approval of Group policies and risk management strategies. 
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management framework and 
this has been developed in accordance with the Code. This system of 
control is designed to manage and mitigate rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, 
int ernal 	 c ontr ols 	 – 	 which 	 include 	 financial, 	 operati onal 	 and 	 c omplianc e	
controls – and risk management can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material loss.
The role of management is to implement Board policies on risk and 
control and the Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the 
Company to the Chief Executive and, through him, to the other Executive 
Directors and members of the Group Management Board (GMB). 
For information on the GMB see ‘Our People’ on pages 34 and 35.
Chairman’s introduction
The Board of TUI Travel PLC believes its effectiveness, and that of 
the Group, should be underpinned by a strong corporate governance 
frame w ork. 	 W e 	 ha v e 	 put 	 in 	 pla c e 	 r obust 	 and 	 ef ficient 	 g o v ernanc e	
systems throughout the Group and, within this framework, have 
worked hard to establish and embed procedures and processes 
throughout all our operations. 
The Board’s main role is to work alongside the executive team to give 
support and advice but also to provide challenge, where appropriate, 
in order to drive continued and sustained improvement across all 
our businesses.
While we evaluate our performance and effectiveness formally as 
a Board each year, we ensure this is a continuing process so that we 
are able to react quickly in the fast-changing environment in which 
we operate.
We believe the Board is well balanced with a broad range of skills and  
a deep understanding of the challenges which face us now and in the 
future. We have made good progress across the governance agenda, 
some of which is highlighted in the following pages. During 2014, we 
will continue to review proactively the business decisions made and  
the governance framework in which we operate. 
Friedrich Joussen

Compliance – UK Corporate Governance Code Provisions
The Company has complied with all relevant provisions of The UK 
Corporate Governance Code (September 2012) (the “Code”) except in

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Following the introduction of a secure iPad-based paperless meeting 
system in 2012, its successful roll-out has progressively resulted in the 
replacement of hard copy packs with electronic versions. Paperless 
meetings are now the norm, not only for the TUI Travel PLC Board 
and its Committees, the Group Management Board and Sector Board 
meetings but also many other business meetings being held on a daily 
basis throughout the Group. The ease with which the system has been 
adopted and cascaded across many different areas of the organisation 
has been better than we could ever have anticipated – this supports 
our online drive across the Group and is consistent with reducing the 
impact of our operations on the environment.

meetings of the Non-Executive Directors
A meeting of the Non-Executive Directors took place in February 2013 
with Sir Michael Hodgkinson in the Chair. The main focus of the meeting 
was 	 t o 	 appraise 	 Dr 	 F r enz el 	 ( who 	 was 	 then 	 the 	 Chairman ) 	 and 	 discuss	
general operational matters.
Two meetings have been scheduled for 2014 and others will be held  
as the need arises.
The key elements of the control framework and review processes  
in place across the Group are as follows: 
•	 The Board sets corporate strategy and business objectives. 
The GMB and Sector management integrate these objectives  
int o 	 their 	 opera ti onal 	 and 	 financial 	 business 	 plans.	
•	 The GMB meets regularly, together with other senior executives, to 
c onsider 	 Gr o up 	 opera ti onal 	 and 	 financial 	 per f ormanc e 	 and 	 business	
development. The Chief Executive reports to the Board on behalf 
o f 	 the 	 GMB 	 on 	 sign ificant 	 chan g es 	 in 	 the 	 business 	 and 	 the 	 ex t ernal	
en vir onment . 	 The 	 Ch ief 	 Financial 	 Of fic er 	 pr o vides 	 the 	 Boar d	
with 	 financial 	 inf orma ti on 	 wh ich 	 includes 	 k e y 	 per f ormanc e 	 and	
risk indicators.
•	 The Group operates a risk management process which is integrated 
within the short and long-term business planning processes  
(see page 42).
•	 The Treasury position of the Group, including cash, foreign exchange 
and fuel hedging exposure, is managed centrally in accordance with 
policies appropriate for each Sector and is the responsibility of the 
Ch ief 	 Financial 	 Of fic er 	 and 	 Gr o up 	 T r easur er .
•	 Financial forecasts, providing predicted results with sensitivity analysis, 
are prepared routinely throughout the year for review by the GMB 
and the Board. These forecasts also include details of the Group’s 
ongoing compliance with its regulatory and banking requirements. 
•	 The Group has established investment appraisal and authorisation 
procedures and its capital expenditure is reviewed against budgets 
which have been approved by the Board.
•	 The Group also routinely assesses the capability of its people to 
deliver the business objectives set and responds accordingly. This  
is supported by the three lines of defence (see page 42).
Processes are in place to ensure appropriate action is taken where 
nec essar y 	 t o 	 r emedy 	 an y 	 deficiencies 	 identified 	 thr ough 	 the 	 Gr oup ’ s	
internal control and risk management processes (see page 42).
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the 
ef f ec tiv eness 	 o f 	 int ernal 	 c ontr ols 	 durin g 	 the 	 y ear 	 and 	 c onfirms 	 that :
•	 there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and  
mana gin g 	 the 	 sign ificant 	 risk s 	 fa c ed 	 b y 	 the 	 Gr oup ;
•	 this has been in place for the year under review and up to the  
date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts;
•	 the process is regularly reviewed by the Board; and
•	 the process accords with the Code.
In addition, the Board also reviewed the effectiveness of the risk 
management process.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive is clearly established, has been agreed by the Board and is 
reviewed by the Company Secretary on a regular basis. The Board

policy and practices.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and can take independent professional advice, if necessary, 
at the Company’s expense. To the Company Secretary’s knowledge, 
no such advice was sought by any Director during the year. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring Board procedures 
are followed, including the formal minuting of any unresolved concerns 
that any Director may have in connection with the operation of the 
Company. During the year there were no such unresolved issues.

In accordance with the Code, all Directors will be subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. To enable shareholders to make an informed 
decision, the 2014 Notice of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) includes 
biographical details and a statement as to why the Company believes 
the 	 Dir ec t ors 	 should 	 be 	 r e-elec t ed. 	 The 	 Chairman 	 int ends 	 t o 	 c onfirm	 
at the AGM that the performance of each individual continues to be 
effective and demonstrates commitment to the role. 
The Board recommends to shareholders the re-appointment of all 
Directors retiring at the meeting on the basis that they are all effective 
Directors of the Company and demonstrate the appropriate level of 
commitment in their respective roles. 
The terms of the Directors’ service contracts are disclosed in the 
Remuneration Report commencing on page 79. Directors’ interests 
in the shares of the Company are disclosed on page 93.
Directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
r egist er ed 	 of fic e 	 and 	 will 	 be 	 a vailable 	 at 	 the 	 A G M 	 which 	 is 	 scheduled	 
to take place on Thursday 6 February 2014. 
Following the appointment of any new Director, the Chairman, in 
conjunction with the Company Secretary, ensures that a full, formal 
and tailored induction to the Company is made available. The Company 
Secretary is on hand to answer any questions which may arise. All 
Directors have been given a detailed induction and training manual. 
During the year, Friedrich Joussen and Sebastian Ebel have had 
detailed overviews on all the Sectors across the Group as part of  
their induction programme. 
Directors’ conflicts of interests 
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Directors have a statutory duty  
to avoid a situation where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
int er est 	 that 	 c onflic t s,	 or 	 possibly 	 may 	 c onflic t,	 with 	 the 	 int er est s 	 of	
the 	 C ompan y . 	 Dir ec t ors 	 of 	 public 	 c ompanies 	 may 	 a uthorise 	 c onflic t s 	
and 	 pot ential 	 c onflic t s	 wher e 	 appr opriat e , 	 if 	 the 	 ar ticles 	 of 	 associati on	
contain a provision to this effect. 
The Board is aware of the other commitments of its Directors and is 
satisfied 	 that 	 these 	 do 	 not 	 c onflic t	 with 	 their 	 duties 	 as 	 Dir ec t ors 	 of	 
the 	 C ompan y . 	 The 	 pr oc ess 	 f or 	 monit oring 	 c onflic t s	 is 	 as 	 f ollo ws:
•	 changes to the commitments of all Directors are reported to 
the Board;
•	 the 	 Dir ec t ors 	 ar e 	 r equir ed 	 t o 	 c omplet e 	 a 	 c onflic t s	 questi onnair e

•	 an y 	 c onflic t s	 identified 	 ar e 	 pr esent ed 	 t o 	 the 	 Boar d 	 f or 	 c onsiderati on	
and, as appropriate, authorised in accordance with the Companies 
Act and the articles of association; and
•	 Directors are responsible for notifying the Company Secretary if 
the y 	 bec ome 	 a war e 	 of 	 an y 	 a c tual 	 or 	 pot ential 	 c onflic t	 situati ons	
or a change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation.
The Board believes that the procedures established to deal with 
c onflic t s	 of 	 int er est 	 ar e 	 operating 	 ef f ec tiv ely .
Company s ecretary 
As part of his retirement plan, and in line with the Company’s succession 
planning, Andrew John has decided to step down from his role as 
Group Legal Director & Company Secretary. Andrew will continue in 
a new role within the organisation and will remain on the GMB during 
a 12-month transition period. With effect from 1 October 2013 there 
are two new appointments – Mike Bowers (formerly General Counsel, 
Mainstream Tour Operating) as Group Legal Director and Joyce Walter 
(formerly Deputy Company Secretary) as Company Secretary. Joyce is 
a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
and has been Deputy Company Secretary since the merger in 2007.
Effectiveness
Board composition 
Our Board consists of 15 Directors – 13 of whom served throughout 
the year. At 30 September 2013, in addition to the Chairman, Friedrich 
Joussen, there were four Executive Directors and 10 Non-Executive 
Directors. Friedrich Joussen and Sebastian Ebel were appointed as 
Non-Executive Directors on 8 February and 25 March 2013 
r espec tiv ely . 	 On 	 2 5 	 Mar ch 	 2 0 1 3 , 	 Dr 	 Micha el 	 F r enz el 	 r etir ed 	 fr om 	 his	
position as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and was replaced  
by Friedrich Joussen. 
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman, Friedrich Joussen, did not comply with the independence 
criteria of the Code at the time of his appointment. This is because 
Mr Joussen is the Chief Executive of TUI AG – a 54.48% shareholder 
of the Company as at 30 September 2013.

Boar d 	 is 	 c onfident 	 tha t 	 he 	 has 	 suf ficient 	 time 	 t o 	 per f orm 	 his 	 duties	
as Chairman of the Company.
Of the other 10 Non-Executive Directors, Horst Baier and Sebastian Ebel 
are also not considered to be independent as they are both members 
of TUI AG’s Executive Board. 
The Non-Executive Directors considered to be independent are 
Sir Michael Hodgkinson, Tony Campbell, Janis Kong, Coline McConville, 
Minnow Powell, Dr Erhard Schipporeit, Dr Albert Schunk and 
Harold Sher. 
The Board recognises that the Code requires that at least half the 
Board, excluding the Chairman, should be independent Non-Executive 
Directors and was compliant with provision B1.2 of the Code 
throughout the year ended 30 September 2013. The Board is committed 
to ensure that its membership is refreshed on a regular basis. 
s kills and experience
Biographical details for each of the Directors are set out on page 66 
and can also be found online at www.tuitravelplc.com.
The Directors have collective responsibility for the Company’s 
direction. In particular Non-Executive Directors are responsible for:
•	 scrutinising and challenging performance across the 
Group’s business;
•	 bringing wide-ranging skills and experience, including 
independent judgement on issues such as strategy, 
performance and risk management;
•	 assessin g 	 risk 	 and 	 the 	 int egrit y 	 o f 	 the 	 financial 	 inf ormati on	
and controls; and
•	 constructively challenging the Chief Executive and 
Executive Directors.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Our 	 AB C 	 due 	 dilig enc e 	 ar ound 	 high-risk 	 pr ofile 	 c ontra c ting 	 has 	 been	
improved during the year. We are proud of our new Supplier Code of 
Conduct detailing the Group’s ethical and compliance expectations of 
suppliers. 	 This 	 is 	 one 	 of 	 the 	 first 	 of 	 it s 	 kind 	 in 	 our 	 industr y 	 and 	 has	
been in roll out to all our material suppliers since May 2013 (see 
Sustainable Development on page 26). Anti-Bribery responsibilities  
are now included in all new supplier contracts. 
Gr oup 	 Audit 	 Ser vic es 	 administ er 	 a 	 y early 	 C onflic t	 of 	 Int er est	
declaration for 2,000 senior managers which will extend to new joiners 
in 2014. 
Whistle-blowing 
Whistle-blowing hotlines are now fully operational in the UK, USA, 
Canada, 	 German y , 	 F ranc e , 	 Swit z erland, 	 P oland, 	 Bel gi um, 	 Nor way ,	
Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, China, 
Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, 
P eru, 	 P or tugal, 	 Brazil, 	 Singapor e , 	 South 	 A frica, 	 T urk e y , 	 Vietnam, 	 and	
the British v irgin Islands. 
This covers businesses in all major source and destination markets which 
have more than 50 employees. There is also a web-based whistle-
blowing reporting service in Cape verde, Cuba, Kenya, the Maldives and 
Tunisia. Austria is completing its Data Protection Authority’s approval 
pr oc ess 	 and, 	 ex cluding 	 Austria, 	 these 	 c onfidential 	 hotlines 	 and 	 w ebmail	
reporting facilities now cover 99% of Group Revenue.
Any matters arising from the use of the whistle-blowing channels are 
investigated as appropriate and a summary provided to the Audit 
Committee. The Legal & Regulatory Compliance Department works  
in conjunction with Group Audit Services to investigate and advise  
on any incidents around the Group.
The TUI Travel Code of Conduct makes it clear that employees can 
approach senior executives, or Group Audit Services, to make reports 
and emphasises that anyone making a report with honest intentions 
need not fear any adverse consequences even if the information 
provided proves to be unfounded.
Competition compliance
A comprehensive competition training, knowhow and support 
programme is in development to remind our senior management, 
purchasing teams and others of their obligations to foster healthy 
competition and protect against anti-competitive practice under EU 
and local legislation through the jurisdictions in which we do business. 
The training programme, which consists of face-to-face seminars for 
senior management, and e-learning for other colleagues, will be 
progressively rolled out during 2014 and will require them t o 	 r e-af firm	
their commitment to leading responsibly and competing vigorously  
in all our markets.
Performance evaluation
Each year the performance of the Board and its Committees (Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination) is evaluated. This year the evaluation 
was undertaken by an online survey and comprised a series of questions 
in relation to the running of, and business conducted at, Board meetings. 
The questions also covered the performance of individual Directors 
(including the Chairman of each Committee). Each Director was asked 
to place a score against the questions and the Directors were able to 
make additional comments where appropriate. 
Every third year the evaluation is facilitated by an independent external 
advisor (which was the case last year) in accordance with the Code.
Summary reports were produced following analysis of the responses by 
br oad 	 ca t eg or y 	 and 	 b y 	 r ef er enc e 	 t o 	 a 	 tra f fic -light 	 syst em 	 sho wing 	 the	
number of red, amber and green scores. The Board and its Committees 
considered the reports of their effectiveness at their meetings in 
Sept ember 	 2 0 1 3 	 and 	 w er e 	 sa tisfied 	 with 	 the 	 o v erall 	 sc or es. 	 A s 	 a 	 r esult	
of this year’s evaluation, the Board intends to:
•	 enhance further its contribution to, and focus on, strategic planning; 
•	 provide more opportunities for the Directors to meet with 
executives and senior managers to assist in succession planning; and
•	 continue to work towards ensuring that the composition of the 
Boar d 	 r eflec t s	 the 	 div ersit y 	 o f 	 the 	 C ompan y’ s 	 employ ee 	 base .	
In the year ahead, the Board will continue to review its effectiveness 
and procedures.

Legal and regulatory compliance 
A 	 t wic e- y early 	 Legal 	 & 	 R egula t or y 	 C omplianc e 	 self -c er tificati on 	 pr oc ess	
is in place, where all operational businesses across the Group certify 
their progress in benchmarking base-level to gold standard operational 
Legal & Regulatory controls against Group criteria in the areas of 
Anti-Bribery & Corruption (ABC), Competition, Data Protection and 
Health & Safety. Businesses answer detailed questions about their 
practices and provide extra information when required. Those responses 
inform a tailored, proactive and strategic approach to risk management. 
They are analysed, prioritised and used to monitor the progress of 
businesses in these vital areas. 
87% of employees across the Group have undergone risk-focused, 
tra v el-industr y 	 specific 	 tra in in g 	 on 	 their 	 r esponsibilities 	 under	
anti-bribery legislation. Updated ABC, Business Gifts & Hospitality and 
Investigation policies have been communicated. A Compliance intranet 
page has been created to give greater online visibility of our initiatives.

Relations with shareholders 
The 	 Ch ief 	 E x ecutiv e , 	 Ch ief 	 Financial 	 Of fic er 	 and 	 members 	 of 	 the	
Investor Relations’ team hold regular meetings with major shareholders 
to review the Group’s performance and prospects. The views of 
shareholders are communicated to all members of the Board following 
such meetings. During the course of these meetings the issue of 
governance is discussed. Presentations to major shareholders are 
made at least twice yearly, after the announcement of the interim and 
pr eliminar y 	 r esult s, 	 deta ils 	 o f 	 wh ich, 	 t o g ether 	 with 	 the 	 Gr oup ’ s 	 financial	
reports and other announcements, can be accessed via the Group’s 
website www.tuitravelplc.com/investors-media.
The Code recommends that the Senior Independent Director meets 
with a range of major shareholders to gain an understanding of their 
views. Sir Michael Hodgkinson (Senior Independent Director) and 
Coline McConville (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee) held 
meetings with several major shareholders during October 2013. They 
also met with shareholders in October last year to explain the changes 
in the Committee membership and to discuss remuneration policy 
generally (see page 88 for further details).
As a result of the extensive investor feedback provided by the  
Ch ief 	 E x ecutiv e , 	 the 	 Ch ief 	 Financial 	 Of fic er , 	 and 	 those 	 Non-E x ecutiv e	
Directors who did meet with shareholders, the remaining Non-
Executive Directors did not consider it necessary to meet with other 
major shareholders during the year. They believe that they are kept 
aware of all issues, which are fed back to them at Board meetings, and 
therefore additional meetings were not required. However, they have 
c onfirmed 	 the y 	 w o uld 	 be 	 happ y 	 t o 	 mak e 	 themselv es 	 a vailable 	 if 	 an y	
shareholder requested such a meeting.
Regular updates are produced by the Company’s brokers and 
circulated to the Board to keep them informed of market and industry 
views. The updates also include analyst views of TUI Travel’s position 
in the market.
There is an opportunity for shareholders to question the Chairman 
and other Directors (including the Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees) at the AGM. The AGM 
also provides a forum for the Non-Executive Directors to discuss  
the views of shareholders with them directly.
In respect of general meetings of the Company: 
•	 the Company prepares separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue and does not combine resolutions 
together inappropriately;
•	 proxy appointment forms provide shareholders with the option to 
vote for, against or to withhold their vote. The proxy form makes  
it clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not 
be counted;
•	 all postal proxy votes are returned to Equiniti (the Company’s 
Registrar) which is responsible for ensuring votes are properly 
received and counted;
•	 pr o x y 	 c o unt s 	 ar e 	 display ed 	 a t 	 the 	 close 	 o f 	 the 	 A G M 	 and 	 the 	 final 	 poll	
results are posted on the Company’s website www.tuitravelplc.com 
following closure of the meeting; and
•	 the Annual Report and Accounts is laid before shareholders 
at the AGM.

Audit c ommittee
t he audit c ommittee comprised four independent n on-executive 
d irectors – minnow Powell, Sir michael h odgkinson, Janis Kong and 
c oline mcc onville – throughout the year ended 30 September 2013  
of whom at least one had recent and relevant financial experience in 
compliance with the c ode provision c 3.1. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Director of 
g roup audit Services and the external auditor are invited to, and 
routinely attend, all meetings and other n on-executive d irectors  
may also attend.
Meetings
t he audit c ommittee met 10 times during the year – two of these 
meetings were specifically called to review and approve draft 
announcements, results and trading statements of the c ompany.  
t he c hairman of the audit c ommittee reported to the Board on  
how the c ommittee had discharged its responsibilities.
a s c hairman of the audit c ommittee it is my responsibility to ensure 
that the c ommittee is rigorous and effective in its role of monitoring 
and reviewing:
• the integrity of the financial statements of the Company (including 
formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance and the significant financial reporting judgements 
contained therein);
• the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management 
framework (including presentations from Group, Sector, regional 
and functional management);
• the effectiveness of Internal Audit (including agreeing in advance the 
work of g roup audit Services and reviewing the results of the work 
undertaken); 
• the arrangements by which employees may raise concerns regarding 
potential impropriety in confidence and ensuring these concerns are 
investigated appropriately; and
• the integrity of the g roup’s relationship with the external auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process, including reviewing the 
policy for the engagement of the external auditors to supply 
non-audit services, considering their appointment, re-appointment 
and removal and approving the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors.
t he audit c ommittee agenda is designed, in concert with the Board’s, to 
ensure that all significant areas of risk are considered during the course 
of the year. d uring the year we have continued to focus on improving 
key financial controls, processes and procedures across the organisation 
and i am pleased with another year of good progress that has been 
achieved in fulfilling our responsibilities in this regard. However, there 
are still improvements to be implemented and embedded across the 
g roup which will remain a key point of focus for the c ommittee. 
I am satisfied that the Audit Committee was presented with  
papers of good quality during the year, provided in a timely fashion  
to allow due consideration of the subjects under review. I am also 
satisfied that meetings were scheduled to allow sufficient time to 
enable full and informed debate. we also reviewed our t erms of 
r eference during the year, including comparing them against the  
c ode, and these were approved by the Board. t hese are available  
on www.tuitravelplc.com/investors-media. 
d uring the year we invited a number of members of management  
to present to the c ommittee on key areas of risk and control. i met, 
individually and in private, with management in order to understand 
more fully the context and challenges of their business operations and 
thereby ensure the c ommittee’s time was used most effectively. we, 
together and individually, visited various parts of the business and met 
informally with a number of members of management below Board 
level to gain a deeper insight into areas relevant to the role of the 
c ommittee.
t he activities of the c ommittee members during the last year  
have enabled us to gain a good understanding of the culture of  
the organisation, the risks and challenges faced and the adequacy  
and timeliness of the action being taken to address them. 
No major matters were raised in the annual evaluation of the 
c ommittee’s performance.
d uring the year activities of the c ommittee included the following:
The integrity of financial reporting 
We reviewed the integrity of the financial statements of the Company 
and all formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance. 
In last year’s Annual Report we reported on judgements relating to 
r evenue r ecognition and aircraft maintenance Provisions along with 
our annual review of g oing c oncern, impairment, Provision for c laims, 
Sdi s and t ax. t he key areas reviewed in the current year are set out 
below. in each case we reviewed and discussed detailed papers 
received from management and took account of the views of the 
external auditors.
Aircraft
2013 was a busy year for aircraft transactions with the following events 
occurring: 
• 737 ma X order signed with Boeing and approved by shareholders; 
and
• delivery of Boeing 787 aircraft commenced and finalisation of 
related credits in respect of entry into Service costs for this new 
type of aircraft.

t he f rench tour operating business has suffered an impairment of 
£59m this year, due to the continued downturn in the f rench economy 
and the difficult trading environment caused by the ongoing political 
unrest and violence in what has traditionally been the popular n orth 
african destinations for the f rench market. in the absence of any 
perceived recovery in these North African destinations (particularly 
egypt) in the near-term, management proposed an impairment of 
£59m of the goodwill attached to the f rench tour operator and we 
agreed with this judgement.
we also reviewed and approved the sensitivities used by management 
which were consistent with 2012 and ‘a reasonably possible’ change to 
model inputs including the related disclosure, as required by ia S 36.
Provision for claims
we examined the risks relating to the main legal cases facing the g roup 
and the adequacy of provisions made against them. management 
presented papers detailing the background to each case, the latest 
developments, their assessment of the respective risks, the mitigating 
action taken and amounts provided. 
We agreed with the judgements reached by management in each of the 
cases presented. 
Separately Disclosed Items (SDIs)
SDIs are those significant items which, in management’s judgement, 
are highlighted by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. We reviewed the 
items proposed by management to be reported as Sdi s each quarter 
to validate that it was appropriate for such items to be reported this 
way, and agreed with their judgement.
Tax
We reviewed the judgements together with any related provisions in 
respect of open areas together with assessments from independent 
experts. in respect of g erman t rade t ax we considered the disclosure 
as a contingency to be appropriate at this time. t he risks relating to 
the Spanish Tax case (Note 8) and the decision to settle rather than 
litigate were taken by the Board as a whole.
Communication of accounting policies
d uring the year we noted the continued development of our 
internal accounting policy manual including the review and re-issue 
of 15 accounting policies together with the related guidance. 
The effectiveness of internal controls and the 
risk management framework
we recognise that a robust and effective system of internal control 
is critical to achieving reliable and consistent business performance. 
On behalf of the Board, we review the effectiveness of the risk 
management and control systems in relation to the key financial, 
operational and compliance controls. we noted continued focus and 
improvement in this area during the year. 
t he c OSO framework of internal control continues to be implemented 
across the organisation. w hile this has focused primarily on f inancial 
Reporting with the review and documentation of the key financial 
processes, risks and controls, we have noted more focus now starting 
to be applied to non-financial operations in those parts of the 
organisation where the risk and control environment is more mature. 
In respect of the Shareholder Circular, we considered the profit 
forecast and working capital statement (including the related reports 
from Pwc ) before they were presented to the Board. in respect of  
the Boeing 787 aircraft, we reviewed the accounting treatment of 
entry into Service c osts and associated credits to ensure the most 
appropriate accounting treatment and we were satisfied with the 
judgements made.
Denied Boarding Compensation (DBC)
a s a result of a ruling by the european c ourt of Justice in October 
2012, there is a present obligation to past events in respect of delay 
compensation being due to passengers where they have been subject 
to a flight cancellation or a delay of more than three hours (subject  
to certain restrictions). accordingly, a provision is required. 
we reviewed the methodology for provisioning in relation to d Bc 
exposure, the input factors, the key assumptions being applied and  
the classification for financial reporting. We were satisfied that the 
resultant provision had been calculated on a reasonable basis in light  
of current claims experience. 
Going concern
we assessed our available facilities, facility headroom, our banking 
covenants and the sensitivity analyses on these items.
we challenged management’s forecasts including sensitivities to 
downturns in budgeted trading. r educed customer deposits were 
factored explicitly into the model and an assessment of the degree  
of flexibility in the payables ledger at the cash low point in December 
2013 was also taken into account.
We were satisfied that the going concern basis of preparation 
continues to be appropriate in the context of the g roup’s funding  
and liquidity position.
Annual goodwill impairment review
During the year we also considered the judgements made in relation  
to the valuation methodology adopted by management and the model 
inputs used, which include the approved three-year business plan, 
long-term growth rates and weighted average cost of capital.
t he annual impairment review has resulted in an impairment charge  
of £178m which, when added to the £10m charge taken earlier in the 
year, as a consequence of the closure of two businesses, results in a 
total impairment charge for the year of £188m.
£109m of the impairment charge has arisen from businesses within  
the Specialist & activity Sector. f ollowing the removal of the Sector 
management team at the start of the financial year, these businesses 
have been subjected to a thorough and detailed review, with the 
consequence that the latest assessment of their future profitability  
is lower than anticipated in the prior year. a s a consequence, the 
discounted cash flow was insufficient to support the previous level  
of goodwill for certain of the Specialist & activity Sector businesses 
– consequently an impairment has been taken against these specific 
businesses. Full details can be found in Note 10 of the financial 
statements.

Group Compliance 
we noted the continued development and strengthening of the 
g roup c ompliance functions during this year. t he c ommittee 
receives presentations from the three g roup c ompliance functions 
four times a year.
• g roup f inancial c ompliance. c reated in 2011 to provide assurance 
that individual company balance sheets across the g roup are fairly 
stated through a programme of site visit reviews to ensure that 
companies in the Group comply with existing financial reporting 
requirements. 
 – we received feedback on the individual visits, the ongoing 
programme of education, communication and independent 
validation of the financial minimum controls as well as feedback 
on quarterly self-assessment returns. 
•  Group Legal & Regulatory Compliance. Created in January 2012  
to manage legal and regulatory risk across the g roup, including 
Anti-Bribery & Corruption (ABC) and whistleblowing (see page 71).
 – we received feedback during the year on the progress being 
achieved in relation to existing legislation (for instance Anti-
Bribery & c orruption, c ompetition l aw, anti money l aundering, 
and Know Your Supplier) as well as preparations for new 
legislation (for instance the new EU Data Protection legislation 
due in 2014/15). 
 – we also received updates on the development and roll out of  
the Supplier Code of Conduct as well as risks identified by the 
six-monthly l egal & r egulatory c ompliance checklist. 
• g roup it c ompliance. c reated in march 2012 to provide a 
compliance framework across the g roup’s it function by producing 
and/or publicising appropriate standards and monitoring compliance 
to those standards using a mixture of self-assessment and a 
programme of review visits.
 – we received reports on the progress being achieved in relation to 
the development of minimum it controls and plans for the next 
year. we also reviewed the g roup’s compliance with Pci d SS 
along with updates on the effectiveness of Business c ontinuity 
Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR). We noted the 
progress made during the year in relation to Bc P and dr and 
deadlines set for completion during this coming year. 
we noted that the three g roup c ompliance functions and the three 
functions that make up Group Audit Services (Risk, Internal Audit  
and Fraud) have worked closely to ensure the free flow of relevant 
information between them and a co-ordinated and consistent 
approach across the g roup through the g roup c ompliance Steering 
c ommittee.
We reviewed the talent pool of senior financial management during  
the year, noting the continued roll-out of competency testing in 
conjunction with Korn Ferry for key finance management and the  
role of the f inance academy to educate and train our employees.
we have seen continued improvement in the transparency and active 
ownership of risk management throughout the organisation, driven 
and supported by a strong tone at the top. we have noted the growing 
strength of the three lines of defence. w hilst we are pleased with the 
progress achieved, there remains much still to do and work in these 
areas will be ongoing in 2014. 
First line of defence
Management 
we spent time with management below Board level in order to 
understand their concerns and the risks, controls and challenges in 
their respective business or functional areas. w ith good progress 
achieved in strengthening the financial controls across the organisation 
over the last two years, we are now able to broaden our review and are 
inviting the Managing Directors of Sector/Source Markets to join their 
f inance d irectors in attending the c ommittee in order to encourage 
wider debate and accountability. 
We continued to receive reports from Group Accounting (e.g. new 
accounting developments and controls over prepayments) and g roup 
Treasury (including Group Treasury policy and counterparty risks).  
we reviewed and approved the g roup’s overall taxation strategy 
during the year. t his covered the key factors for the g roup’s overall  
tax position and forecasts for the future tax charge and cash taxes.
During the year we received presentations relating to major projects  
as well as receiving presentations on the control environment existing 
within all key business areas. 
Local compliance functions
we noted the continued investment in local compliance functions 
within our key businesses during the year, which will serve to 
strengthen the control environment closer to the front-end of 
businesses across the organisation.
Second line of defence
Risk Management
we reviewed the work that the g roup r isk management function  
has undertaken to enhance the effectiveness of risk management 
processes throughout the organisation. we noted the impact of a 
well-defined risk methodology, effective risk software and improved 
infrastructure in supporting this improvement. in addition to reports 
received from the internal audit function on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of risk management in various business areas, we 
reviewed the g roup r isk function’s own assessment of stakeholder 
engagement and effectiveness by key business area. t his assessment 
is shared openly with management and the Board and is used as a 
focus for ongoing improvement. in addition, we have received regular 
updates on the work of the g roup r isk management c ommittee 
during the last year and noted the quality of the risk discussions that 
have taken place during the year. 
While significant improvements have been made in the year, further 
work to embed them into all our processes and procedures is planned 
for 2014.

The integrity of the Group’s relationship  
with External Audit and the effectiveness  
of the External Audit process
Effectiveness of External Audit
a gain this year we requested a review of the effectiveness of external 
audit as perceived by 12 senior financial personnel and senior 
management closely involved in the year-end reporting process as well 
as members of the audit c ommittee. t he approach was consistent 
with last year, involving 25 questions covering three key areas – the 
robustness of the audit process, the quality of delivery and the quality 
of people and service. Questions related to professional scepticism, 
integrity and competence, understanding of the business risks, issues 
and their impact, the clarity and appropriateness of the audit strategy, 
the efficiency and effectiveness of audit delivery, constructive 
relationships and control recommendations, good judgement and clear 
and timely communication. we noted a general improvement in the 
scores compared to the previous year and the perception that, overall, 
the 2012 audit process had worked well. we noted that all of the key 
actions identified from the previous year’s review had been addressed. 
Some further areas for improvement were identified during this year’s 
review and we will assess progress against these in 2014. in addition, 
we also noted the results of the Audit Quality Review Team (part of 
the f inancial r eporting c ouncil) assessment of the effectiveness of 
Pwc relative to its peers as well as Pwc ’s own transparency report. 
d etails of fees payable to the auditors and its associates are given in 
n ote 7. f urther information in respect of non-audit services is given 
on the next page. 
Audit plan and approach
d uring the year we reviewed Pwc ’s benchmarking of our organisation’s 
audit risk profile relative to the FTSE 350 and the audit strategy 
developed as a result. we noted the risk-based audit approach,  
key areas of audit focus and the audit plan produced as a result.  
t he annual plan takes account of size, complexity and the control 
environment of individual businesses as well as the overall coverage 
split by revenue, absolute eBita and absolute net assets. in addition, 
we noted and agreed with Pwc ’s emphasis on substantive as opposed 
to controls testing.
t he c ommittee holds a private session with the l ead Partner from our 
external auditor without management present once a year immediately 
prior to the publication of the year end accounts. in addition i meet 
with the l ead Partner on a regular basis throughout the year to 
provide the opportunity for open communication and the free flow of 
any concerns relating both to the openness, transparency and general 
engagement of management with the audit process as well as to 
understand PwC’s assessment of key judgements as they arise.
Re-appointment of external auditors
Based on the results of our annual review, and our experience during 
the year, we have recommended to the Board the re-appointment of 
the external auditors (who have completed their third audit). We will 
continue to review the performance of Pwc formally on an annual 
basis and, although not required by the u K c orporate g overnance 
c ode to undertake a formal tender process until 2020, will continue, 
during this remaining seven-year period, to keep this under close 
review in the best interests of our shareholders.
Third line of defence
Internal Audit
we noted further improvements in the development and  
effectiveness of the internal audit function during the year against  
the transformation plan set out by the d irector of the internal  
audit function in f Y2012. in particular, following the successful 
implementation of key infrastructure (methodology, systems, risk 
assessed auditable universe), we have noted a closer focus on 
restructuring, assessing and developing the internal audit team as  
an essential element in building a high-performance internal audit 
function. 
we also noted the close and constructive working relationship that  
has developed between internal audit and the key control functions  
of g roup c ompliance and external audit, which is producing a more 
efficient and integrated approach to the provision of risk and controls 
assurance.
t he c ommittee holds a private session with the d irector of g roup 
audit Services without management present once a year. i also meet 
with the d irector of g roup audit Services informally before each 
c ommittee meeting, without management present, in order to provide 
the opportunity for open and timely dialogue. t ypically we discuss the 
quality and content of papers due for discussion with the c ommittee, 
emerging business risks and the quality of management engagement 
with internal audit and any areas of concern therein.
The effectiveness of Internal Audit
a gain this year we requested a review on the effectiveness of internal 
audit. t he approach was consistent with last year, covering the 
effectiveness of the function (positioning, processes, systems and 
people) assessed both from an internal perspective (functional set-up 
benchmarked against best practice, file review, interviews of internal 
audit staff) and from an external perspective (the perception of  
12 senior financial personnel and senior management and six Board 
members responding to 12 questions). we noted a marked shift in 
effectiveness from both an internal and external perspective as the 
impact of the improvement plan has begun to work its way through 
into day-to-day operations. 
In addition, I selected a judgemental sample of 16 internal audit 
reports in order to validate that the control assessments made 
by the internal audit function were appropriate and in line with our 
guidelines. i reviewed these with the d irector of internal audit and 
invited the Chief Financial Officer to do the same and we were satisfied 
that the control assessments were appropriate in each case. 
The arrangements by which staff may raise 
concerns regarding potential impropriety in 
confidence and that these concerns will be 
investigated appropriately
we received updates during the year on the arrangements by which 
the business encourages feedback from management and employees 
on instances of potential impropriety. t his included presentations from 
g roup l egal on the development of the whistle-blowing hotlines across 
the Group (including number of calls, issues and benchmarking against 
other named companies), from g roup f inance on the development 
of HOT principles (Honesty, Openness and Transparency) and the 
communication thereof via the f inance academy and, from g roup hr , 
an analysis of responses by business/level of seniority to three key 
questions in the Your voice employee feedback survey relating to 
potentially unethical and/or dishonest behaviour.

Non-audit services
t he audit c ommittee has developed the c ompany’s policy on the 
engagement of the auditors to supply non-audit services and has 
sought to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair 
the independence and objectivity of the Company’s external auditors. 
we have achieved this by considering the auditing Practices Board 
Ethical Standard Number 5 (revised). This relates to non-audit services 
provided to audited entities and sets out six principal threats to 
objectivity and independence, for example, the auditors cannot act as 
management nor audit their own work. we have reviewed, monitored 
and approved, where appropriate, the nature and extent of non-audit 
services provided by the Company’s external auditor and are satisfied 
that their independence and objectivity has not been 
compromised.  We have also reviewed the fees (both individually and 
in aggregate relative to the audit fee) and management’s compliance 
with the approval thresholds set out in the c ompany’s non-audit 
services policy.
we acknowledge that, in some circumstances, the external auditors’ 
understanding of the business can be beneficial in improving the 
efficiency and effectiveness of advisory work and, therefore, it has 
been considered appropriate that the external auditors be engaged.
a summary of the policy is given below:
• non-audit fees are capped in any one year to no more than the audit 
fee itself; 
• routine tax compliance and advisory services may be provided up to 
a pre-approved maximum of £1m in any one financial year, subject 
to the overall cap noted above;
• any engagement where the value is expected to exceed £100,000, 
but be less than £250,000, should be pre-approved by the c hairman 
of the audit c ommittee; and
• engagements at or above £250,000, must be pre-approved by the 
audit c ommittee.
In total £2m was spent on non-audit fees during the year (being 28% 
of audit and audit related fees). in addition, £1m was spent for services 
to comply with legislation. f urther details of non-audit services are set 
out in Note 7. Significant expenditure that was authorised in the year, 
i.e. exceeding £250,000, is outlined below:

Talent management strategy
The September 2013 meeting focused on the current challenges we 
face to ensure that succession plans are in place for key roles, the 
mobility of the workforce and providing global career opportunities 
for our people. We confirmed our commitment to recognise and 
nurture talented individuals across the whole Group whilst ensuring 
that suitable development programmes are in place for key managers.
Diversity
Our diversity objectives were agreed in 2012 and these were considered 
again at the September 2013 meeting. These objectives recognise 
the importance of gender and international diversity and set out our 
aim to achieve at least 25% female representation among the Board’s 
membership by 2015. As at 30 September 2013, this percentage is 
13%. When making new appointments, the Board is committed to 
seeking directors with the right skillsets and gender balance in line 
with the 25% aspiration. 
Committee effectiveness survey
Also in September 2013, the Committee considered the results of the 
survey. Following a review of the comments made, it was concluded 
that there should be a greater focus during the coming year on 
succession planning for Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee will continue to review the membership of the Board 
and its Committees during the coming year and, as part of this process, 
will also take into consideration the diversity of business skills and 
experience gained from different cultural and geographical backgrounds.
Sir Michael Hodgkinson
Chairman & Senior Independent Director
9 December 2013
“The Committee’s main focus is on strengthening, balancing and 
understanding the range of skills, experience and diversity of the 
Board, its Committees and key roles below Board level.”
Composition of the Committee
As at 30 September 2013, the Committee comprised three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and one Shareholder Director (the latter 
being appointed in accordance with the Relationship Agreement). 
The Chairman is Sir Michael Hodgkinson (Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director) and the other members are Minnow Powell 
(Independent), Harold Sher (Independent) and Friedrich Joussen 
(Shareholder). Rainer Feuerhake and Dr Michael Frenzel (both 
Shareholder Directors) retired during the year on 8 February and 
25 March 2013 respectively and Friedrich Joussen was appointed  
as a Committee member on 25 March 2013 to replace Dr Frenzel.
Key objectives
• To identify, evaluate and recommend candidates for appointment 
as directors;
• To ensure that the Board has the right balance of skills, mix of 
knowledge and experience; and
• To review and contribute to the talent management strategy for 
the Board, its Committees and senior managers in order to attract 
a highly-qualified and diverse workforce.
Committee activities
During the year two new appointments were made to the Board. 
Following the retirement of Dr Frenzel (Chairman) and Rainer 
Feuerhake (Non-Executive Director), Friedrich Joussen and Sebastian 
Ebel were appointed as TUI AG’s Shareholder Directors (in accordance 
with the terms of the Relationship Agreement).
Two meetings of the Nomination Committee took place – in March 
and September 2013. The meeting in March was to consider the 
appointment of Sebastian Ebel and, in September, the focus was on 
succession planning, talent management across the Group, diversity 
and a review of the effectiveness survey.

Shareh Older inf Ormati On
i am pleased to introduce the d irectors’ r emuneration r eport for the 
year ended 30 September 2013. 
l ast year’s d irectors’ r emuneration r eport anticipated many of the 
new remuneration reporting requirements which were in draft form 
at that time. we received positive feedback from shareholders on the 
revised format and approach. This year we are one of the first companies 
to publish a report in the format required under the l arge and 
medium-sized c ompanies and g roups (accounts and r eports) 
(amendment) r egulations 2013 that came into force on 1 October 2013. 
We hope that you find our report comprehensive, clear and informative. 
The implementation of new legislation, coupled with a review of 
executive remuneration, has led to this being a particularly busy year 
for the r emuneration c ommittee (the c ommittee).
executive Director remuneration review
a s a c ommittee we believe it is essential that the d irectors’ 
r emuneration Policy (the Policy) is aligned with the c ompany’s Strategic 
Framework, the interests of shareholders and the external competitive 
market. we also recognise the current focus on executive pay and are 
mindful of investor expectations and best practice guidelines.
With this in mind, during 2013, the Committee undertook a review 
of the Policy and engaged in consultation with our key shareholders. 
i would like to take this opportunity to thank them for the helpful and 
constructive feedback which they provided. Following this process, we 
are proposing a number of changes to our remuneration framework.
In summary, these changes are intended to:
• simplify our remuneration structure;
• provide greater transparency for shareholders;
• reduce the overall quantum of long-term remuneration by the 
removal of the matching shares element of our deferred bonus 
arrangements;
• introduce malus provisions on unvested deferred bonus and 
long-term incentive awards; and
• create greater alignment with investors by increasing our 
shareholding guidelines for executive d irectors.
u nder the existing d eferred annual Bonus Scheme (da BS) executive 
d irectors may be given a matching share award of up to four times 
the deferred bonus amount. t he last grant of matching share awards 
will be made in d ecember 2013 (for performance in the year ended 
30 September 2013). t he change will simplify our incentive framework 
and provide greater transparency. we are also responding to feedback 
from some of our shareholders who have expressed concerns with 
matching share arrangements more generally.
maximum annual bonus opportunities will remain the same and 
the performance measures, which the Committee consider are 
appropriately stretching, are unchanged. Executive Directors will still 
be required to defer 25% of any bonus awarded, with the option of 
deferring a further 25% if they wish to do so.
t he removal of the matching share element will result in a reduction  
in overall incentive opportunity. in line with our aim of linking a 
substantial proportion of the total remuneration package to long-term 
performance measures, the Committee proposes to increase the 
maximum Performance Share Plan (PSP) award limit to 400%. 
However, it is envisaged that awards will generally be made of up to 300%.
we consider that the current stretching PSP performance measures 
continue to be aligned with our business strategy and are appropriate 
for the business at this time. Therefore, we are not proposing any 
changes to the performance measure framework.
Malus provisions
we have decided that it is an appropriate time to seek shareholder 
approval for the renewal and update of the c ompany’s two shareholder-
approved executive share plans – the PSP and da BS – at the annual 
g eneral meeting (agm ) to be held on 6 f ebruary 2014. t he current 
rules expire in July 2017. t he renewed versions will operate in the same 
way as the existing plans and also reflect the changes outlined above. 
r evising the rules now gives us the opportunity to ensure that they are 
completely in line with the Policy, and reflect current market practice, 
including the introduction of malus provisions. t he malus provisions 
will allow us to reduce or cancel unvested PSP and da BS awards in  
a number of specific circumstances when it is in the interests of 
shareholders to do so.

The Directors’ Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 
30 September 2013 has been prepared on behalf of the Board by 
the c ommittee.
t he report has been compiled taking into account the l isting r ules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority, the relevant sections of the 
c ompanies act 2006 and the l arge and medium-sized c ompanies 
and g roups (accounts and r eports) (amendment) r egulations 2013. 
t he c ommittee adopts the principles of good governance as set out 
in the u K c orporate g overnance c ode. 
t his report will be subject to two votes at the agm on 6 f ebruary 2014 
– a binding vote in relation to the d irectors’ r emuneration Policy and 
an advisory vote in relation to the statement by the r emuneration 
c ommittee c hairman and the annual r eport on r emuneration. 
In addition, there will be two separate votes to approve the renewed 
and updated versions of the c ompany’s two executive share plans.
As part of the remuneration review outlined previously, the Committee 
has reaffirmed the aims of the Policy as follows: 
• to set the total remuneration package at a level that reflects 
the competitive markets in which the g roup operates;
• to align the executive d irectors’ interests with those of shareholders 
over the long-term by building a significant shareholding in our 
business; 
• to link a substantial proportion of the total remuneration 
package to the achievement of demanding long-term financial 
performance targets;
• to provide an appropriate balance between fixed remuneration 
and variable ‘at-risk’ reward;
• to provide a package that is simple and transparent to shareholders; 
•  to enable recruitment, retention and stability; and 
• to reinforce a high-performance culture throughout the g roup.

executive d irectors will not receive a salary increase for the year 
commencing 1 October 2013. t he ce O has not received a salary 
increase since 2008.
Bonus awards and long-term share plan vesting
As you will have seen previously, we have had a very successful year. 
As stated earlier, the Committee closely aligns remuneration decisions 
to the delivery of our strategic plans and the achievement of stretching 
financial results. As detailed later, the Company’s strong profit and 
cash performance is reflected in the Executive Directors’ bonus 
awards. In addition, achievement of the Company’s EPS and TSR 
targets, together with significant share price growth over the last  
year, have resulted in the achievement of long-term incentive goals.
On behalf of the c ommittee i thank you for your support and trust 
that you find the new-style report informative.

element a nnual performance Bonus and Deferred a nnual Bonus s cheme
Purpose and link to strategy To encourage and reward the attainment of challenging financial and strategic performance targets during an 
annual period.
t he performance measures closely align to the strategy of the business as outlined on pages 14 to 25 and shareholder 
value creation as summarised in the investment case on page 4.
The deferred element drives and rewards delivery of sustained long-term performance, aligns Executive Director 
and shareholder interests and supports retention.
Operation Performance is normally assessed over one financial year.
25% of any bonus paid must normally be deferred into shares under da BS for three years. Participants may either 
voluntarily choose to defer up to an additional 25% or the Committee may, in certain circumstances, determine that  
an additional 25% of the bonus should be deferred on a compulsory basis. 
a s outlined in the n otes to this t able the last awards of matching shares under da BS will be made in d ecember 2013. 
The awards will relate to performance in the year ended 30 September 2013. These, and other previous DABS awards 
currently outstanding, will vest in subsequent years. The vesting of matching awards is subject to continued 
employment, achievement of performance conditions and compliance with the policy on payment for loss of office.
d ividend equivalent payments may be made equal to the amount of dividends that would have been payable during 
the period between the grant and vesting of an award.
Share awards are normally made in the form of nil-cost options but may be awarded in other forms if appropriate 
(such as conditional share awards). n il-cost options may normally be exercised until the tenth anniversary of the date 
of grant. Awards may also be satisfied in cash and may be granted to a Director’s personal service company at the 
discretion of the c ommittee.
For bonuses awarded in respect of the year commencing 1 October 2014, and subsequently, malus provisions will 
apply. These allow the Committee to cancel or reduce vesting of unvested awards in certain circumstances including:
• a misstatement of results that resulted in a bonus or award being paid at too high a level;
• a material failure of risk management or health and safety;
• serious reputational damage to the c ompany; and/or
• personal misconduct.
t he c ommittee may adjust and amend the terms of the awards in accordance with the plan rules.
maximum opportunity t he maximum bonus opportunity (as a percentage of salary) is up to 175% for the ce O and up to 140% for the 
other executive d irectors. 
t he last award of da BS matching shares will be made in d ecember 2013. t he award will relate to performance in  
the year ended 30 September 2013. t he maximum multiple awarded will be a ratio of four matching shares to one 
deferred share. 
Performance measures a nnual bonus
The annual bonus is based on a mix of financial and individual business objectives, with the majority of the weighting 
being given to financial metrics. 
• f inancial performance-related measures (typically 75% to 85% of total) are chosen carefully to ensure a strong link 
between reward and underlying Company financial performance. As an example, these measures may typically 
include profit, cash flow or other measures as appropriate.
• individual performance (15% to 25% of total) is measured through an assessment of comprehensive business 
deliverables, financial targets, personal performance and the achievement of specific individual objectives. 
The exact measures, weightings and targets are determined by the Committee each year taking into account the 
g roup’s key strategic priorities and the approved budget for the year. 
a sliding scale between 0% and 100% of the maximum award applies for achievement between threshold and 
maximum performance under the bonus plan.

• serious reputational damage to the c ompany; and/or
• personal misconduct.
t he c ommittee may adjust and amend the terms of the awards in accordance with the plan rules.
maximum opportunity The maximum award opportunity under the PSP is 400% of salary in any financial year. 
It is currently envisaged that awards will be made of up to an operational limit of 300% of salary, although a larger 
award may be made in exceptional circumstances. t he c ommittee also retains power to increase the operational limit 
to up to the maximum plan limit without shareholder approval if it considers it appropriate to do so, in which case the 
c ommittee will aim to engage with shareholders.
Performance measures Awards vest based on performance against EPS (as defined in the plan rules), relative TSR and ROIC measures over  
a three-year period.
Normally, these will be broadly weighted as below, although the Committee may vary the precise weightings, as well 
as setting the specific targets for each measure as appropriate to reflect business and strategic priorities.
• ePS – 50%
• r elative t Sr – 25%
• r Oic – 25%
To ensure that the PSP awards vest only when shareholder value is being created, awards will be subject to the 
achievement of an initial financial performance hurdle. This will normally be based on a return on capital measure. 
f ailure to achieve this hurdle will usually result in none of the award vesting.
Should the hurdle be achieved vesting for threshold performance will be up to, but no more than, 15% of the 
maximum award opportunity.
if events happen that cause the c ommittee to determine that the performance conditions are no longer a fair measure 
of the Company’s performance, the Committee can amend the conditions as it determines to be appropriate, with due 
regard to the best interests of shareholders.
n otes to the executive Directors’ Future policy t able
l egacy matters
t he c ommittee reserves the right to make remuneration payments 
and payments for loss of office (including the exercise of any discretions 
available to the c ommittee in connection with such payments) that fall 
outside the Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed before 
the Policy came into effect or at a time when the relevant individual was 
not a d irector of the c ompany and the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a d irector of the c ompany. 
For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards 
of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the 
terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted. t he 
share awards under the PSP and da BS held by the executive d irectors 
which were granted, or which are anticipated to be, prior to the Policy 
coming into effect are set out in the annual r eport on r emuneration.
matching shares
t he last award of da BS matching shares will be made in d ecember 2013. 
t he award will relate to performance in the year ended 30 September 
2013. t he maximum multiple awarded will be a ratio of four matching 
shares to one deferred share. t hese and other previous da BS awards 
that are currently outstanding will therefore vest in subsequent years.
matching awards are subject to performance measured over a three-year 
period. t he framework used for assessing performance is the same as 
that for PSP awards. if events happen that cause the c ommittee to 
determine that any target is no longer a fair measure of the c ompany’s 
performance, the Committee can amend the target if considered 
appropriate, with due regard to the best interests of shareholders.
Selection of performance measures – annual bonus
t he c ommittee will choose annual bonus performance measures and 
targets which will provide an appropriate balance between incentivising 
Executive Directors to achieve financial targets for the year and driving 
the delivery of specific business deliverables, strategic objectives and 
personal goals.
Selection of performance measures – PSP
t he c ompany aims to create sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
To encourage and reward this, the Company aims to align performance 
measures under the PSP with the strategy of the business and set 
stretching targets, achievement of which it considers should result in 
long-term value creation. In particular:
• financial performance measures – a direct measure of business health, 
reflecting the strength of our underlying financial performance. We 
take into account a number of internal and external reference points 
to ensure that targets are appropriately stretching; and
• share price performance measures – the most focused indicator of 
our ultimate delivery of shareholder returns and intended to promote 
alignment between investors and executive d irectors. t argets are 
set taking into account a number of factors, including reference to 
typical market practice. t hey are set at a level which the c ommittee 
considers represents stretching performance.

PSP and da BS rules
The Company’s existing PSP and DABS rules, approved by 
shareholders on 25 July 2007, can continue to be operated until 
25 July 2017. However, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 
6 February 2014, all future awards granted to Executive Directors will 
only be made under the renewed and updated versions of these rules.
n on-executive Directors’ Future policy t able
The Board aims to recruit high-calibre Non-Executive Directors, 
with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. 
t he remuneration policy for non-executive d irectors (with the 
exception of the c hairman) is set by the Board having taken account 
of the fees paid in other companies of a similar size and complexity 
and the limits set by the articles of a ssociation. t he policy for the 
c hairman is determined by the c ommittee (of which the c hairman 
is not a member). When recruiting Non-Executive Directors, the 
remuneration arrangements offered will generally be in line with 
those set out in the n on-executive d irectors’ f uture Policy t able.
a pproach to setting fees Basis of fees o ther items
f ees are set at an appropriate level to attract 
and retain high-calibre n on-executive d irectors. 
f ees are reviewed at appropriate intervals 
taking into account the time commitment 
expected and practice in peer companies  
of a similar size, sector and complexity.
each n on-executive d irector is paid a basic 
fee for undertaking n on-executive d irector 
and Board duties. a higher fee is typically 
paid to the c hairman of the Board and the 
d eputy c hairman. 
a dditional fees may also be paid for taking 
on c ommittee responsibilities and other 
Board duties. 
t he maximum aggregate fees for all n on-
executive d irectors allowed by the c ompany’s 
a rticles of a ssociation is £1.5m. 
n on-executive d irectors’ fees are not subject  
to claw-back or withholding arrangements.
t he n on-executive d irectors do not participate 
in the annual bonus or long-term incentive plans 
and do not receive any pension benefits. 
t he g roup provides each n on-executive 
d irector with relevant liability insurance  
for the duration of their appointment. 
n on-executive d irectors receive holiday 
concessions. t he maximum annual value is 
£2,500. There are currently no other benefits 
provided to Non-Executive Directors. However, 
the Board may introduce additional benefits 
if it is considered appropriate to do so. 
r emuneration arrangements across the g roup
Our reward philosophy is consistent across the Group, namely that 
reward should support our business strategy and be sufficient to 
attract and retain high-performing individuals. Only success is 
rewarded. Within this framework, there are differences for a range  
of reasons, including global location and the local talent market. 
• Salaries and benefits – a range of factors are considered including 
business and individual performance, the pay of other employees 
and external market data. 
• Annual bonus – consistent with the policy for Executive Directors, 
annual bonuses across the g roup are typically linked to local 
business performance with a focus on underlying profit growth  
and performance against key strategic business objectives. Key 
management team members may also receive some of their annual 
bonus in shares which have to be deferred for three years, in line 
with the policy for executive d irectors.
• PSP – a small number of seni or executives who provide significant 
strategic input may be invited to participate in the PSP in any year.
• all employee Share Plans – an hmrc -approved Share incentive Plan 
is open to all u K eligible employees (including executive d irectors) 
on the same terms, giving them the opportunity to become 
shareholders in the c ompany. Participation in a global plan may be 
offered in the future. Currently, over 3,200 employees participate  
in the Share incentive Plan and hold over 5.6 million shares. 
approach to the recruitment and retention of 
executive Directors
we have a strong track record of succession planning and growing  
and promoting talent internally. 
principles
When hiring a new Executive Director, or promoting to the Board from 
within the Group, the Committee will offer a package that is sufficient 
to retain and motivate and, if relevant, attract the right talent whilst at 
all times aiming to pay no more than is necessary. in determining an 
appropriate remuneration package, the Committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the 
impact on other existing remuneration arrangements, the candidate’s 
location and experience, external market influences and internal pay 
relativities.
Typically, the new appointment will be in line with, or be transitioned 
onto, the policy as set out in the Executive Directors’ Future Policy Table. 
f ollowing any executive d irector recruitment the c ommittee will include 
the rationale for the arrangements offered in the next r emuneration 
r eport.
c omponents and approach
t he package offered to a new executive d irector will typically include 
those elements listed within the executive d irectors’ f uture Policy 
Table. In certain circumstances, the Committee may use other elements 
if it considers it appropriate to do so with due regard to the best 
interests of the shareholders. In particular, in considering its approach, 
the Committee will take into account factors which include, but are not 
limited to, typical market practice, existing arrangements for other 
Executive Directors, internal relativities and market positioning.
Where expatriate appointments are made, the Committee may consider 
providing additional benefits where considered appropriate and in the 
c ompany’s best interests to do so.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee may, at its discretion, 
offer a service contract that contains a longer initial notice period, 
tapering down to 12 months over a set period of time, if it is deemed 
to be in the best interests of our shareholders.
Buy-outs
t he c ommittee may make awards on hiring an external candidate  
to ‘buy-out’ forfeited remuneration arrangements. In doing so, the 
c ommittee will typically take account of relevant factors including any 
performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which 
they were awarded (e.g. cash or shares) and the time over which they 
would have vested. g enerally it is the c ommittee’s intention that the 
buy-out of awards will be made on a comparable basis to those 
forfeited and will be share-based.

In determining whether it is appropriate to offer a buy-out, the 
c ommittee will ensure that any awards are made in the best interests 
of both the c ompany and its shareholders and will give due regard  
to all relevant factors.
Maximum level of variable pay
t he maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new 
executive d irectors is limited to 575% of salary. t his excludes any 
buy-out awards. 
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect 
of the previous role may either continue on its original terms or be 
adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
it is appropriate for the c ommittee to have discretion to make 
additional one-off cash or share-based awards to executive d irectors 
in order for the c ommittee to be able to respond in exceptional and 
unexpected circumstances. t he c ompany will make full disclosure  
of any such awards made, including the rationale, in the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts for the relevant financial year. 
illustrations of the application of the executive Directors’ 
r emuneration policy
Our remuneration arrangements have been designed so that a 
substantial proportion of pay is dependent on the achievement  
of stretching short and long-term performance targets.
As part of this process, the Committee reviews, on at least an annual basis, 
the impact of different performance scenarios on the potential reward 
opportunity and pay-outs to be received by the executive d irectors. 
t he charts show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for 
Executive Directors under three assumed performance scenarios:
• minimum performance (i.e. fixed elements of pay only, with no 
bonus pay-out or vesting of long-term incentives);
• performance in line with expectations (assuming 50% pay-out 
under the annual bonus, and threshold performance under the PSP, 
i.e. 10% vesting under the ePS element and 15% vesting under the 
t Sr and r Oic elements); and 
• maximum performance (assuming 100% pay-out under both the 
annual bonus and the PSP).
t he charts presented are in line with our remuneration policy effective 
from 1 October 2014. matching share awards under da BS are 
excluded as these will not be granted in respect of years commencing 
1 October 2013 and subsequently.

f inancial Statement S
 
Shareh Older inf Ormati On
executive d irectors are entitled to 12 months’ base pay and contractual 
benefits if served notice by the Company. The Company is entitled 
to six months’ notice of termination by u K executive d irectors and 
12 months by d r Böttcher. 
In the normal course of events, the Executive Director will work his 
notice period.
in the event of termination for cause (e.g. gross misconduct) neither 
notice nor payment in lieu of notice (Pil On) will be given and the 
executive d irector will cease to perform his services immediately.
in the event of termination for other reasons than cause (e.g. resignation) 
and the individual being requested to cease working before the end 
of his notice period Pil On may be payable. if a portion of the notice 
period is served, the payment will be reduced on a pro-rata basis. 
Payments may be made on a phased basis and may be subject to 
mitigation. Alternatively, rather than making a PILON, the Company 
may instead place an executive d irector on garden leave for the 
duration of some or all of their notice period.
in redundancy situations the c ommittee will comply with prevailing 
relevant legislation. In addition, and consistent with market practice, 
the c ompany may pay a contribution towards the executive d irector’s 
legal fees for entering into a statutory agreement and may pay a 
contribution towards fees for outplacement services as part of a 
negotiated settlement.
t here is no provision for additional compensation on termination 
following a change of control nor liquidated damages of any kind. 
Payment may also be made in respect of accrued benefits, including 
untaken holiday entitlement.
Executive bonus and share-based schemes will be managed as follows:
t he following table sets out a description of any obligations on the 
Company, contained in the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors, which could give rise to, or impact on, remuneration payments 
or payments for loss of office:

expiry date r olling appointment typically expected to last 
six years, save for Minnow Powell, Janis Kong 
and Coline McConville, whose letters 
of appointment are subject to a three-year 
fixed term. 
Fees and benefits Entitled to receive fees, together with such 
holiday concession arrangements as may 
from time-to-time be made available to 
d irectors. n on-executive d irectors are covered 
by the c ompany’s directors’ indemnity 
insurance.

all executive d irector service contracts and n on-executive d irector 
letters of appointment are available for inspection at the c ompany’s 
registered office during normal hours of business, and will also be 
available at the c ompany’s agm on 6 f ebruary 2014 until the close 
of the meeting.
Policy on payment for loss of office 
we are committed to ensuring a consistent approach so that we do not 
pay more than is necessary. in the event of an early termination of a 
contract, the policy is to seek to minimise any liability. When managing 
such situations, the Committee takes a range of factors into account 
including contractual obligations, shareholder interests, organisational 
stability and the need to ensure an effective handover.
‘g ood’ leavers o ther leavers
a nnual performance bonus t he c ommittee considers it appropriate for 
the c ompany to have discretion regarding the 
payment of a full or partial bonus in termination 
scenarios. 
w hen determining whether an executive 
Director is a good leaver, the Committee  
will consider contractual terms, personal 
performance, the generally accepted definition 
of a good leaver and other factors outlined 
below.
u nless the c ommittee exercises its discretion 
to treat the Executive Director as a good leaver, 
no bonus will be payable.
psp and matching awards under the 
existing DaBs
t he principles as described apply in respect  
of the current version of the PSP and, subject  
to shareholder approval, the renewed version  
as well as the existing version of the da BS.
Participants will be a good leaver on ceasing 
employment due to injury, disability, ill-health, 
death, redundancy or the sale of the Company 
or business in which the participant is employed.
awards held by good leavers will normally vest 
after three years pro-rated for time and subject 
to the relevant performance measures.
t he c ommittee has discretion to accelerate vesting 
to the date employment ends. 
t he c ommittee also has discretion to waive the 
time pro-rating requirement. 
u nvested awards will lapse in full where the 
termination is on grounds of gross misconduct.
in other circumstances unvested awards will 
lapse in full unless the c ommittee applies 
discretion to treat the executive d irector  
as a good leaver.
Deferred a nnual Bonus s cheme (DaBs ) 
t he principles as described apply in respect  
of the current version of DABS, and, subject  
to shareholder approval, the renewed version  
of this plan.
u nvested deferred share awards (which 
represent deferrals of earned bonus) vest in  
full on ceasing employment other than on 
grounds of gross misconduct either at the date 
of termination or on the normal vesting date,  
at the discretion of the c ommittee.
u nvested deferred share awards will lapse in full 
where the termination is on grounds of gross 
misconduct.

In considering the exercise of discretion as set out above, the 
Committee will take into account all relevant circumstances. In doing so, 
factors that the Committee may take into account shall include, but not 
be limited to, considering the best interests of the Company, whether 
the Executive Director has presided over an orderly handover, the 
contribution of the executive d irector to the success of the c ompany 
during their tenure, the need to ensure continuity, the need to 
compromise any claims that the Executive Director may have, whether 
the Executive Director received a PILON payment and whether, had 
the Executive Director served out their notice, a greater proportion  
of the outstanding award may have vested. 
On a corporate event affecting the Company, the rules of the current 
PSP and DABS, as previously approved by shareholders, and, subject 
to approval at the AGM on 6 February 2014, the rules of the renewed 
PSP and DABS, will apply. A corporate event will include:
• a takeover of the c ompany; 
• a company or a person, already having control, making a general 
offer to acquire shares in the c ompany; 
• a voluntary winding-up; and 
• under the rules of the new p lans if the Board so determines, 
a de-merger or other similar event materially affecting the value 
of shares. 
In summary, awards under the PSP and matching awards under the 
DABS will vest subject to the performance conditions and, unless the 
Board determines otherwise, time pro-rating. Deferred awards under 
the DABS, which represent previously earned bonuses, will vest in full. 
On a variation of share capital, a de-merger, a sale of a substantial part 
of the Group’s business or similar event, the Committee may make such 
adjustment to awards as it considers appropriate.
In respect of the Share Incentive Plan, the same leaver conditions will 
be applied as those applied to all employees.
In the event of death in service, the arrangements for the Executive 
d irectors provide lump sums for the purchase of dependants’ pensions 
of the greater of eight times salary or the value of the pension fund,  
in addition to which a lump sum of four times salary is payable. 
t he c ompany may enter into new contractual arrangements with an 
Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, 
including (but not limited to) settlement of claims, confidentiality, 
restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements, where  
the c ommittee determines it necessary or appropriate to do so. 
appropriate disclosure of any such arrangement will be made.
c onsideration of conditions elsewhere in the c ompany
t he c ommittee has oversight of the main compensation structures 
throughout the g roup and actively considers the relationship between 
general changes to employees’ remuneration and executive d irector 
reward. w hen considering potential changes to executive d irector 
remuneration the c ommittee is provided with comparative employee 
information, (e.g. average salary reviews across the Group).
t he c ommittee does not consider it appropriate to consult directly 
with employees when formulating executive d irector reward policy. 
However, it does take into account information provided by the Group 
hr d irector and feedback from our global employee satisfaction 
survey, which includes questions about remuneration.
c onsideration of shareholder views
t he c ommittee is strongly committed to an open and transparent 
dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters. we believe 
that it is important to meet regularly with our key shareholders to 
understand their views on our remuneration arrangements and 
discuss our approach going forward. 
d uring the year we consulted with the c ompany’s largest shareholders 
and the main shareholder representative bodies. t heir views have  
been instrumental in shaping the changes to the remuneration policy 
described elsewhere in this report. 
In particular, and as outlined in the letter from the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman, the Committee noted ongoing shareholder 
concern regarding the continued use of deferred bonus matching 
awards. a s a result these will no longer be awarded in respect of 
bonuses achieved for the year commencing 1 October 2013 and 
subsequently. 
t he c ommittee has also taken account of market practice and general 
investor views in recommending increased shareholding requirements 
and an update to the rules of the PSP and da BS that will include the 
introduction of malus provisions.
t he c ommittee will continue to engage with shareholders going forward 
and will aim to consult on any material changes to the application of 
the approved Policy or proposed changes to the Policy. 
t he c ommittee may make minor changes to the Policy that do not 
have a material advantage to executive d irectors without seeking 
shareholder approval.

1  a s stated in the 2012 a nnual r eport and a ccounts Johan l undgren and w illiam w aggott were awarded salary increases on 20 October 2011 and 2 d ecember 2011 respectively. t he year 
ended 30 September 2012 columns therefore include both pre-review and post-review data.
2 To comply with the new legislation, benefits for the year ended 30 September 2013 include (where used) holiday travel concessions.
3  Annual bonus figures include a cash element of up to 50% and a deferred element of the remainder. The deferred element is used to allocate nil-cost options over TUI Travel PLC shares, 
which are deferred for at least three years. t he deferred element is not subject to performance conditions.
4  a s required by the new legislation the anticipated value of the da BS and PSP shares that will vest for the three-year period ended 30 September 2013 has been calculated using a share 
price of 365p, this being the three-month average for the year ended 30 September 2013. The DABS and PSP values on pages 94 and 95 of this Report are based on the 30 September 2013 
share price of 367.7p as required by the l isting r ules of the f inancial c onduct a uthority. 
5  Awards vest after the approval of the financial statements for the year ending 30 September and such awards relate to a performance period ending on the same date as those financial 
statements. Therefore, the figures in the 2013 DABS and 2013 PSP columns relate to awards that will vest in December 2013.
6  In calculating remuneration for Dr Volker Böttcher, payments made in EUR during the year ended 30 September 2013 have been converted at 1.1902 to 1 GBP, being the average exchange 
rate for the period 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013. Payments made in EUR during the year ended 30 September 2012 have been converted at 1.2035 to 1 GBP, being the average 
exchange rate for the period 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2012.
alignment of pay with performance
t he remuneration policy at tui t ravel places substantial emphasis on 
variable pay. t he c ommittee considers that this is aligned with the best 
interests of shareholders and ensures that executive d irectors will only 
receive significant remuneration for exceptional performance.
Over the last three years, the Executive Directors have delivered strong 
Company performance, driven by growth in profit and cash generation. 
For example, our EPS (as defined in the plan rules) has increased by 
over 22% per annum since 2010. Shareholders have seen this reflected 
in our share price, which has increased by almost 60% over this period 
taking our market capitalisation from £2.2bn to £4.1bn. we consider that 
the remuneration received for the year ended, 30 September 2013 
recognises this performance. For example for Peter Long (see chart):
• Over 85% of his total remuneration was delivered in variable pay; and
• Of this variable amount, at least 30% was directly due to the 
significant increase in our share price over the last three years.

Retirement benefits
t otal pension contributions or allowances accrued to the year ended 
30 September 2013 were £952,000. Payments totalling £1,195,000 
have been made as at the date of this report. t hese payments 
include contributions for the year ended 30 September 2012 which 
were accrued but not paid at the date of the 2012 annual r eport 
and accounts.
w illiam w aggott has deferred pension entitlements under the f inal 
Salary section of the tui Pension Scheme (u K). h e ceased to be an 
active member on 3 September 2007 and therefore did not accrue 
further benefits during the year. The accrued benefits including 
deferred revaluation to 30 September 2013 are a pension 
of £60,837.45 per annum, payable from age 60. The transfer value as 
at 30 September 2013 calculated on the current basis is £1,402,198. 
t he transfer value as at 30 September 2012 calculated on the basis 
in force at that time was £1 ,503,860. The only change in accrued 
benefits over the financial year is another year of deferred revaluation 
(fixed at 5% per annum). The accrued benefits at the start of the 
year were £57,940.43 per annum so there has been an increase in 
pension of £2,897.02 over the year. No contributions were made in 
the year ended 30 September 2013.
annual bonus
The annual bonus is driven by the achievement of Group, business  
and individual targets which are weighted for each executive d irector. 
For the year ended 30 September 2013 the achievement of financial 
targets represented up to 80% of the bonus awarded with the balance 
being determined by the achievement of individual objectives. 
The financial element is weighted to the achievement of profit and 
cash targets. t hese are set by the c ommittee annually with reference 
to the Company’s five-year strategic plan, analyst profit forecasts and 
cashflow performance. The targets are designed to be stretching, drive 
improved results and align delivery with shareholders’ expectations. 
The specific financial targets are considered by the Committee to be 
commercially sensitive.
t he individual business objectives were determined with consideration 
to the strategic goals set for each executive d irector by the Board. a s 
is the case for all senior management in the Group, objectives were set 
under the strategic drivers described on page 15 – content, brands and 
distribution, technology, growth and scale and people. Performance 
against these objectives was reviewed by the c ommittee against 
quantifiable individual performance metrics.
a s reported earlier the c ompany has had a very successful year and 
this is reflected in the level of bonus awards. 
t he bonus weightings for the year ended 30 September are

 For the financial year ended 30 September 2010, the performance targets for the annual 
bonus were met in full. However, the Committee decided that, in the context of an 
appropriate claw-back of prior year bonus due to the profit restatement and substantial 
one-off costs during the year, the cash portion of the bonus would not be payable.

also determines, on behalf of the Board, and with the benefit of advice 
from external consultants and members of the HR Department, the 
remuneration of the executive d irectors and other members of the 
g roup management Board.
t he c ommittee formulates and applies the Policy with consideration 
to the prevailing economic climate in the major economies in which the 
g roup operates. it also observes the spirit of the g roup’s core values 
which cultivate responsible leadership in the external and internal 
social environment. c onsequently the c ommittee closely considers 
the c ompany’s performance in building both shareholder value and 
a secure future for all stakeholders.
t he activities of the c ommittee are governed by its t erms of r eference 
which were last revised on 25 march 2013 and can be found on the 
c ompany’s website.
t he c ommittee currently comprises three n on-executive d irectors

than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the Committee. 
The three independent members of the Committee have no conflicts of

have no day-to-day involvement in the running of the c ompany. 
t he c ommittee met six times during the year. d etails of attendance

advisors
w hile it is the c ommittee’s responsibility to exercise independent 
judgement, the Committee does request advice from management 
and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions 
are fully informed. advice or services were provided to the c ommittee 
during the year by: 
• d eloitte ll P (d eloitte);
• andrew John – c ompany Secretary; 
(now Group Director – Secretariat, Health & Safety and Risk);
• Peter l ong – c hief executive;
• Jacky Simmonds – g roup hr d irector; and
• t im t aylor – g roup r eward d irector.
t he g roup hr d irector has direct access to the c hairman of the 
Committee and, together with the Group Reward Director, advised the 
c ommittee on reward matters relating to the executive d irectors and 
members of the gm B and broader g roup hr strategy and policy. 
t he c hief executive attends meetings of the c ommittee to make 
recommendations relating to the performance and remuneration of 
his direct reports and the c ompany Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the c ommittee. executives are not in attendance when their own 
remuneration is considered. 
t he c ommittee is authorised by the Board to seek any information 
it requires from any employee of the g roup. t he c ommittee is also 
authorised to require the attendance of any d irector at any of 
its meetings.
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on 
executive remuneration matters from d eloitte. d eloitte received 
£128,000 in fees for these services. Deloitte is a founder member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates 
under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the u K.
t he c ommittee appointed d eloitte to the role of independent 
advisers to the Committee in 2008, following an interview process. 
t he c ommittee is comfortable that the d eloitte engagement partner 
and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, 
do not have connections with tui t ravel Plc that may impair their 
independence or objectivity. In addition, during the year ended 
30 September 2013, Deloitte also provided various tax services to 
the c ompany.
h erbert Smith f reehills ll P was appointed to provide advice on law 
and regulation in relation to share scheme matters (which is provided 
to the c ompany and is available to the c ommittee). l egal fees relate 
to advice provided to the Company and not the Committee, and are

Directors’ indemnity arrangements
Throughout the financial year and at the date of approval of these 
financial statements, the Company has purchased and maintained 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its 
d irectors whether in their capacity as d irectors of the c ompany 
or associated companies. The Directors also have the benefit of 
indemnity provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association. These 
provisions are qualifying third-party indemnity provisions as defined 
in section 234 of the c ompanies act 2006.
Significant agreements – change of control
The Companies Act 2006 requires us to disclose any significant 
agreements that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control 
of the c ompany.
Relationship Agreement with TUI AG 
The Relationship Agreement between TUI AG and TUI Travel, dated 
29 June 2007, includes the principle that TUI Travel will operate 
independently of tui ag and records the understanding between 
TUI AG and TUI Travel regarding the relationship between them and 
the governance of TUI Travel. The Relationship Agreement will remain 
in force until either the shares in TUI Travel are no longer traded on the 
London Stock Exchange, or TUI AG has less than 10% of the rights to vote 
at general meetings. In addition, in the event that another party acquires 
control of tui ag during the term of the r elationship a greement, tui 
ag will lose certain rights under the r elationship a greement including 
its rights in respect of the composition of the Board.
The Relationship Agreement contains restrictions on the acquisition by 
TUI AG of additional shares in TUI Travel which result in the increase of 
its shareholding to more than 55% of the voting rights on a fully-diluted 
basis (save where TUI AG makes a general offer to acquire all TUI Travel 
shares in issue). a number of bonds are held on tui ag ’s behalf and, 
if converted at the conversion price set on the launch date, would give 
rise to 52,309,463 new shares. On a fully-diluted basis (if shares held 
by all bondholders were converted), TUI AG would have had a holding 
of 50% as at 30 September 2013. a s a percentage of shares in issue, 
tui ag ’s holding as at 30 September 2013 was 54.48% (2012: 56.26%) 
– see page 98 for an explanation of the reduction.
TUI AG has anti-dilution rights in respect of further issues of shares in 
TUI Travel other than on a pre-emptive basis. TUI Travel has also agreed 
that certain matters will require the prior approval of 80% of the 
d irectors present at the meeting of the Board at which such matter is 
considered, including material changes to the business of any g roup 
company, acquisitions and disposals of a value which exceeds £10m, 
the entry into, variation or redemption prior to their due date of any 
borrowing facilities and the approval of the annual budget.
Pages 66 to 102 inclusive (together with the sections of the Annual 
r eport incorporated by reference) form part of the d irectors’ r eport 
which is presented in accordance with, and with reliance upon,

Powers for the Company issuing or buying back its 
own shares
t he c ompany was authorised by shareholders, at the agm held in 
f ebruary 2013, to purchase in the market up to 10% of the c ompany’s 
issued share capital, as permitted under the c ompany’s articles. 
No shares (2012: no shares) have been bought back under this 
authority during the year ended 30 September 2013. t his standard 
authority is renewable annually and the d irectors will seek to renew 
this authority at the agm to be held on 6 f ebruary 2014. t he d irectors 
were granted authority in 2013 to allot relevant securities up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £74,534,044.60. That authority will  
apply until the conclusion of the 2014 agm . 
at the agm in f ebruary 2014, shareholders will be asked to grant an 
authority to allot shares in the capital of the c ompany up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £74,534,044.60 representing the ABI guideline limit 
of approximately 66% of the c ompany’s issued ordinary share capital. 
Of this amount, 372,670,223 shares (representing approximately 33% 
of the c ompany’s issued ordinary share capital) can only be allotted 
pursuant to a rights issue. t he power will last until the conclusion of 
the AGM in 2015 or if earlier on 7 May 2015. The Directors have no 
present intention of exercising this authority but they consider it 
appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides.

funding and management of the pension schemes. u nder the partnership 
arrangements, the c ompany committed to making payments of up to 
£275 million in 2026, if and to the extent that the pension schemes 
remain in deficit at that time. The partnership agreements contain terms 
which give the pension schemes the right to wind-up the partnerships 
and require an injection of up to £275 million by the Company if there 
is a restructuring or reorganisation of the assets of the c ompany which 
results in a reduction of the c ompany’s consolidated net assets to less 
than £1,100 million following the occurrence of a change of control. 
f or the purposes of the partnership agreements a change of control 
occurs if:
• following a takeover offer for the Company a person or group of 
persons acting in concert acquire more than 30% of the voting rights 
in the c ompany; or
• TUI AG and any persons acting in concert with it acquires or acquire 
75% or more of the voting rights in the Company and/or the 
c ompany’s listing is cancelled.
Restricted shares 
235,391,523 ordinary shares of the c ompany, representing 20.87% 
of the c ompany’s share capital on an undiluted basis (of which 
206,488,962 shares had previously been transferred by TUI AG to 
two independent special purpose companies plus 28,902,561 shares 
which have over time been added under the Company’s Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan) were restricted from being transferred. TUI AG 
remained entitled to receive the dividend yields from these shares and 
also kept the voting rights attached to them. TUI AG was also entitled 
to repurchase 148,424,474 shares (2012: 146,399,656 with 2,024,818 
being added under the Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan) by

extension agreement taking effect as of 10 October 2013 and also 
replacing the first special purpose company with Deutsche Bank AG 
– by July 2016 at the latest. 
in april 2013, an exchangeable bond for which the 148,424,474 shares 
formed the exchange property, reached maturity. f ollowing the 
exchange process, 21,867,865 shares were returned to the market and 
126,556,609 shares were transferred back to tui ag . t his resulted in 
an overall reduction in the voting rights of TUI AG of 21,867,865, i.e. 
from 56.44% to 54.48%.

in June 2015;

• £300m bank syndicated facility which matures in April 2016 and 
which is only available in the event of a requirement to redeem

t he d irectors are responsible for preparing the annual r eport, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
r eporting Standards (ifr Ss) as adopted by the european u nion, and 
the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom g enerally accepted accounting Practice (u nited Kingdom 
accounting Standards and applicable law). u nder company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of  
the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether ifr Ss as adopted by the european u nion and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the g roup 
and Parent Company financial statements respectively; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the c ompany will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions  
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the c ompany and the g roup and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, a rticle 4 of the ia S r egulation. t hey are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the c ompany and the g roup and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
t he d irectors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
t he d irectors consider that the annual r eport and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the c ompany’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Independent Auditors’ report to the members of TUI T ravel PLC
Based on our professional judgement, we set materiality for the Group 
financial statements as a whole at £27.5 million. In arriving at this 
judgement we have had regard to the Group’s underlying operating 
profit as defined in Note 1(B)(ii) on page 112. We used the Group’s 
underlying operating profit in order to exclude the volatility from one 
off items, acquisition related expenses, impairment of goodwill, 
taxation and interest as in our view this is the most relevant measure 
for the members of the Company in assessing financial performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £1.4m as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group is structured along three business lines being Mainstream, 
Accommodation & Destinations and Specialist & Activity. The Group’s 
financial statements are a consolidation of its world-wide reporting 
units, comprising its operating businesses and centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall Group audit strategy and plan, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
reporting units by the group engagement team and by component 
auditors from other PwC network firms and from one other firm 
working under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we 
needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units so as to be 
able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had 
been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial 
statements as a whole. 
For each reporting unit we determined whether we required an audit 
of their complete financial information or whether higher level 
procedures would be sufficient. Those where a complete audit was 
required included the two largest reporting units (Mainstream UK & 
Ireland and Mainstream Germany), because they each make up more 
than 15% of the Group’s revenue or underlying profits. We included a 
further 17 reporting units due to the risk characteristics of those units, 
and another 18 reporting units so that the major mainstream source 
markets were covered. The total of these units gave us coverage of 
85% of the Group’s revenue. As a consequence of the maturing control 
environment and in consultation with the Audit Committee, we added 
a further 14 smaller units, principally made up of Accommodation & 
Destinations and Specialist & Activity reporting units.
In addition, we performed higher level procedures with respect to  
the remaining reporting units, including specific audit procedures on 
certain account balances and transactions. We also performed work on 
the consolidation of the reporting units. This gave us the evidence we 
needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors made a number of 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused our work in 
these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available 
evidence, forming our own independent judgements, and evaluating 
the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and 
other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained 
audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular 
focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all areas of focus 
identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the 
Audit Committee. Their report on those matters that they considered 
to be significant issues in relation to the Group financial statements is 
set out on pages 73 to 74.
Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
30 September 2013 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then 
ended.
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union.
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion must be read in the context of what we say below.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by TUI Travel PLC, 
comprise:
• The consolidated income statement for the year ended 
30 September 2013.
• The consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year 
ended 30 September 2013.
• The consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2013.
• The consolidated statements of changes in equity and cash flows  
for the year ended 30 September 2013.
• Notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation comprises applicable law and IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have 
been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report & Accounts (the 
‘Annual Report’), rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)). An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information  
in the Annual Report & Accounts (the “Annual Report”) to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to 
determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures  
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and  
on the financial statements as a whole.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
 
Fin Anci Al st Ate Ments
 
Sh AREh OLDER INFORMATION
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the risk
Goodwill and intangible impairment assessment
The Directors have booked an impairment charge of £188m, leaving a 
balance of £3.7bn of goodwill and £0.7bn of intangibles on the balance 
sheet.
We focused on this area because the determination of whether or not  
an impairment charge for goodwill was necessary involved significant 
judgements about the future results of many parts of the business,  
as set out in note 10 to the financial statements.
We evaluated and challenged the Directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and 
the process by which they were drawn up, including comparing them to the 
latest Board approved three year plans, and testing the underlying value in 
use calculations. 
We challenged 
• the Directors’ key assumptions for long term growth rates in the 
forecasts by comparing them to economic and industry forecasts; and
• the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the company and 
comparable organisations. 
We also performed sensitivity analysis around those cash generating units 
where the impairment review showed they were closest to impairment, 
including challenging the speed of recovery in the poorer performing 
businesses. h aving ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions 
that either individually or collectively would be required for the goodwill 
and intangibles to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such a 
movement in those key assumptions arising and the adequacy of the 
disclosures made in note 10 to the financial statements.
entry into service of new aircraft and related accounting
Significant costs have been incurred and credits received with respect  
to the introduction of the Boeing 787 aircraft to the fleet. We focused  
on this area because there is judgement involved in the accounting 
treatment of these costs and credits both in terms of timing of 
recognition and their classification in the income statement.
We read and understood the clauses in, and subsequent amendments to, 
the original contracts relating to the acquisition of these new aircraft. We 
evaluated the amounts and nature of the sums to be received by the Group 
and the costs incurred, or to be incurred, related to the introduction of a 
new aircraft type and tested a sample of these items. 
We evaluated the appropriateness of how the Directors have accounted  
for and presented such items in the financial statements.
Provision for taxes
We focused on this area because the actual or potential challenges by 
the tax authorities, particularly in Spain and Germany, involve a level  
of inherent uncertainty as to the amount of provision. There is also 
judgement required with respect to the adequacy of the disclosures 
made in the financial statements.
We obtained the latest correspondence between the Group and the 
relevant tax authorities, understood the judgements made by the 
Directors, held meetings with senior management and we consulted the 
Group’s external advisers and considered their views on these matters.  
We challenged the judgements made by the Directors and evaluated the 
appropriateness of the provisions and disclosures made.
Maturity of control environment
The financial controls, processes and procedures across the Group are  
at varying stages of maturity and there are a large number of different 
financial systems in operation. 
We focused on this area because financial information at locations  
where the control environment is less mature is inherently more at risk 
of misstatement. These locations tend to be the smaller businesses 
operated by the Group.
We evaluated the progress of the Group’s project that is designed  
to formalise certain controls, policies and processes to improve the 
robustness of the control environment throughout the businesses 
operated by the Group.
Given the on-going nature of this project our audit approach incorporated
• a greater focus on those reporting units with weaker control 
environments; and
• a greater emphasis on substantive testing of transactions/balances and 
key reconciliations. 
After discussion with the Audit Committee we included a greater number 
of smaller businesses in scope for an audit of their complete financial 
information.
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition
Most businesses face a risk of fraud in revenue recognition. 
We focused on the timing of recognition of revenue because there is a 
difference between the timing of receipt of cash from customers and the 
subsequent recognition of revenue on the holiday departure date and 
because the reservation systems and interfaces with the accounting 
records are complex.
We assessed and tested the design and operation of the controls over 
revenue systems and also tested key reservation system reconciliations at 
30 September 2013. We checked that revenue had been recognised at the 
correct time including testing deferred revenue balances with reference to 
departure dates.
Our work included testing a sample of manual journals and assessing the 
consistency of the application of the revenue recognition policy.
Risk of management override of internal controls 
Management in all businesses are in a position of authority that means 
they can override internal controls established to prevent fraud or error.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group and interviewed 
senior management and the Group’s legal, compliance and internal audit 
functions. 
We understood the key trigger points for incentive payments to senior 
management and examined the significant accounting estimates and 
judgements relevant to the financial statements for evidence of bias by  
the Directors. 
We also tested significant one-off transactions, performed some 
unpredictable procedures, and tested manual journal entries and key 
reconciliations.

Going c oncern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 101, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement the Directors have concluded that 
it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial statements using the 
going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis assumes 
that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and 
that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the  
date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit, we 
have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is 
appropriate.
h owever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Opinion on matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial 
statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law have not been made, and under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review certain elements of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.  
We have no exceptions to report arising from these responsibilities.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”). We have nothing to report having performed our review.
On page 102 of the Annual Report, as required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code Provision C.1.1, the Directors state that they 
consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for members 
to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. On 
pages 73 to 74, as required by C3.8 of the Code, the Audit Committee 
has set out the significant issues that it considered in relation to the 
financial statements, and how they were addressed. Under ISAs  
(UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• the statement given by the Directors is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
• the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit 
Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Group 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set 
out on page 102, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs  
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown  
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial 
statements of TUI Travel PLC for the year ended 30 September 2013 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
described as having been audited.

the operating result. For the purpose of this calculation, an underlying 
tax charge is used which excludes the tax effects of separately 
disclosed items, acquisition related expenses, goodwill and available  
for sale financial asset impairment charges and separately disclosed  
tax items.
It should be noted that the definitions of underlying items being used 
in these consolidated financial statements are those used by the Group 
and may not be comparable with the term ‘underlying’ as defined by 
other companies both within the same sector or elsewhere.

(iii) Separately disclosed items
Separately disclosed items are those significant items which in 
management’s judgement are highlighted by virtue of their size or 
incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance. Such items are included within the income statement 
caption to which they relate (Note 4). 
(iv) Business and financial review
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect  
its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Business and financial review section. In addition, Note 26 sets out  
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, 
financial risks, financial instruments and hedging activities as well as  
its exposures to credit and liquidity risk. 
(v) Funding and liquidity
The Board remains satisfied with the Group’s funding and liquidity 
position. At 30 September 2013, the main sources of debt funding 
included: 
• a total of £1,120m bank revolving credit facilities which mature  
in June 2015; 
• £185m of bonding and letter of credit facilities which mature  
in June 2015;
•  £350m convertible bond due October 2014;
• £400m convertible bond due April 2017;
• £300m bank syndicated facility which matures in April 2016 and 
which is only available in the event of a requirement to redeem  
the Group’s convertible bonds; and
• £275m of drawn finance lease obligations with repayments  
up to March 2023.
The ratio of earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, 
amortisation and operating lease rentals (EBITDAR) to fixed charges 
(being the aggregate amount of interest and any other finance charges 
in respect of borrowings and including all payments under operating 
leases) and the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), which the Board believes to 
be the most useful measures of cash generation and gearing, as well as 
being the main basis for the Group’s credit facility covenants, are well 
within the covenant limits at the date of the balance sheet. Forecasts 
reviewed by the Board, including forecasts adjusted for significantly 
worse economic conditions, show continued compliance with these 
covenants. For both covenants, earnings are calculated on an 
underlying basis as described in Note 1(B)(ii). 
1. Accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed  
in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements  
for the year ended 30 September 2012, except for the adoption of 
the amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements on  
OCI’ that is applicable for the year ended 30 September 2013. This 
amended standard has no significant impact on the consolidated 
results or financial position.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in the Group’s 
presentational currency of Sterling, rounded to the nearest million.
(A) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2013 have been prepared and approved by the 
Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European 
Union (Adopted IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable  
to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial 
statements were approved on 9 December 2013. 
(B) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical 
cost basis other than derivative financial instruments, financial 
instruments held for trading and financial instruments classified as 
available for sale, which are stated at their fair value. Non-current 
assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell. 
(i) Parent Company
TUI Travel PLC (the Company) is a company incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.  
The Registered Office of the Company is TUI Travel House, Crawley 
Business Quarter, Fleming Way, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 9QL.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
(ii) Underlying measures of profits and losses
The Group believes that underlying operating profit, underlying profit 
before tax and underlying earnings per share provide additional 
guidance to statutory measures to help understand the underlying 
performance of the business during the financial year. The term 
underlying is not defined under IFRS. It is a measure that is used by 
management to assess the underlying performance of the business 
internally and is not intended to be a substitute measure for adopted 
IFRS GAAP measures. The Group defines these underlying measures 
as follows:
Underlying operating profit is operating profit from continuing 
operations stated before separately disclosed items, acquisition 
related expenses, impairment of goodwill and available for sale 
financial assets and interest and taxation on the Group’s share  
of the results of joint ventures and associates. 
Underlying profit before tax is profit from continuing operations 
before taxation, acquisition related expenses, impairment of goodwill 
and available for sale financial assets, interest and taxation of joint 
ventures and associates and separately disclosed items included  
within the operating result.
Underlying earnings used in the calculation of underlying earnings  
per share is profit after tax from continuing operations excluding 
acquisition related expenses, impairment of goodwill and available  
for sale financial assets and separately disclosed items included within

in control. As such, these transactions do not result in goodwill or gains 
and losses being recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
When control is lost, any remaining interest in equity is remeasured to 
fair value and a gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement.
(iv) t ransactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains or income and expenses 
arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from 
transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains 
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(v) Acquisition in stages
Where the Group gains control of a subsidiary undertaking through 
a step acquisition, the existing interest owned is remeasured at fair 
value with the difference between fair value and book value being 
recognised in the income statement. The accounting impact of changes 
in share ownership which do not affect control is accounted for 
through reserves.
(vi) Acquisition related expenses
Acquisition related expenses comprise amortisation of business 
combination intangibles, other acquisition related expenses and 
remuneration for post-combination services. Directly attributable 
acquisition costs are expensed in the consolidated income statement 
as incurred. 
(vii) Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration is accounted for at fair value at the 
acquisition date with subsequent changes in the fair value being 
recognised in the income statement. Contingent consideration 
dependent upon continuing service of an employee is charged to the 
income statement over the related service period within acquisition 
related expenses (Note 13) and is included within operating profit. 
Contingent consideration is discounted to present value where the 
time value of money is material. 
(viii) n on-current assets held for sale
The Group classifies non-current assets or disposal groups containing 
a non-current asset as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. To be classified as held for sale, the assets must be 
available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only 
to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets, 
and their sale must be highly probable. Sale is considered to be highly 
probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the assets 
and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has 
been initiated, at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current 
fair value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed 
within one year from the date of classification. 
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal 
groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss.  
The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill 
and then to remaining applicable assets on a pro rata basis (except  
no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets 
or employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies).
On the basis of its forecasts, both base case and adjusted as described 
above, and available facilities, the Board has concluded that the going 
concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate. 
(C) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and 
its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity accounts 
for the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The Parent 
Company financial statements present information about the Company 
as a separate entity and not about the Group. Accounting policies  
of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are amended where 
necessary to be consistent with those adopted by the Group. Where 
audited financial statements are not coterminous with those of the 
Group, the financial information is derived from the last audited 
accounts available and unaudited management accounts for the period 
up to the Group’s balance sheet date.
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists 
when the Group has the power , directly or indirectly, to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial information from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
(ii) Joint ventures and associates
Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities whose activities the Group 
has the power to control jointly, established by contractual agreement. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has the ability to 
exercise significant influence, but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. The consolidated financial statements include the 
Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense and changes 
in equity of joint ventures and associates on an equity accounted basis, 
from the date that joint control or significant influence respectively 
commences until the date that it ceases. Associates and joint ventures 
are recorded at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the entity including goodwill net of 
accumulated impairment loss. When the Group’s share of losses 
exceeds the carrying amount of the joint venture or associate, the 
carrying amount is reduced to £nil and recognition of further losses  
is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint 
venture or associate.
(iii) n on-controlling interests
In the consolidated balance sheet, the share of net assets attributable 
to non-controlling interests is disclosed as a separate component 
of equity after share capital and reserves. The consolidated income 
statement discloses the amount of the result for the year attributable 
to non-controlling interests.
Where the Group has a written put option in respect of a non-
controlling interest and has an unavoidable obligation to purchase 
the shareholding, the obligation is recorded as a financial liability at fair 
value, rather than being reported as a separate component of equity. 
Changes to the fair value of the financial liability are recorded at each 
period end in the income statement within financial income or financial 
expenses.
On purchase or sale of a non-controlling interest held in a Group 
subsidiary, the Group recognises increases or decreases in the value  
of its interest directly in equity providing there is no overall change

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
receivables, loans, trade and other investments (including financial 
deposits within the Group’s control), derivative financial instruments 
and other receivables, but exclude financial deposits outside the 
Group’s control, prepayments and taxes. The Group determines the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Financial assets 
are recognised initially at fair value, normally being the transaction 
price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through  
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The subsequent 
measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as 
follows:
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such 
assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised 
in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, 
as well as through the amortisation process. This category of financial 
assets includes trade and other receivables.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial 
assets that are not classified as loans and receivables or financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss. After initial recognition, available  
for sale financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses 
recognised within other comprehensive income until the investment 
is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, 
at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other 
comprehensive income is included in the consolidated income statement. 
Note 1(W)(iii) describes the basis on which fair value is determined.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at 
fair value after initial recognition. The gain or loss is included in the 
consolidated income statement. Note 1(W)(iii) describes the basis 
on which fair value is determined.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits 
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original 
maturity of three months or less. Where the Group operates centrally 
pooled accounts and has the intention and ability to pool account 
balances, the net cash or overdraft position is disclosed. Where the 
intention or ability to pool balances together is absent, the cash and 
overdraft are disclosed on a gross basis in the consolidated balance 
sheet and the overdraft is excluded from cash and cash equivalents  
for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Where cash and cash equivalent balances are not available for use  
by the Group, for example to meet regulatory requirements, this fact  
is disclosed and the balances are excluded from available net debt.
Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the 
rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset 
in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest 
in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the 
Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
(ii) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are either classified as financial liabilities measured 
at amortised cost, or financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss. Financial liabilities include trade and other payables (excluding 
tax and social security and deferred income), accruals, finance debt  
and derivative financial instruments. The Group determines the 
classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. Financial 
1. Accounting policies continued
Certain assets and liabilities are excluded from the measurement basis 
of IFRS 5 including deferred tax assets (IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’), assets 
arising from employee benefits (IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’) and 
financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and measurement’. 
(ix) Business combinations between entities under common 
control
The results of business combinations between entities under common 
control are incorporated as if the acquired entity had always been 
combined. This is also known as ‘predecessor accounting’. Where  
this applies, all necessary comparatives for the prior year financial 
statements are restated to reflect the inclusion of results from the 
commencement of the earliest comparative period, in accordance 
with IAS 8. 
(D) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised 
in the income statement (except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net 
investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges, 
which are recognised directly in equity). Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated 
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were 
determined.
(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill 
and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to 
Sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of overseas operations are translated at 
rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of 
the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation 
have been recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve, a 
designated foreign exchange reserve, since 1 January 2007. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item 
receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement 
of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are 
considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation  
and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve. 
(iii) n et investment in foreign operations
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a  
financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a  
foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective and 
are presented within equity in the translation reserve. To the extent 
that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognised in profit 
or loss. When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed, the 
relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit  
or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
(e) Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
Financial assets are either classified as loans and receivables, available 
for sale financial assets, or financial assets at fair value through profit

SHAREHOLDER INFORmATION
(iv) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share awards are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
(F) Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges of highly 
probable forecast transactions. 
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), 
including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking 
the hedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used 
to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group 
makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship 
as well as on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments 
are expected to be ’highly effective’ in hedging cash flows during the 
period for which the hedge is designated and whether the actual 
results of each hedge are within a range of 80-125%. The transaction 
being hedged should be highly probable to occur and should present 
an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect 
reported net income. 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows arising from a recognised asset or liability, or  
a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any fair 
value gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised 
directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge 
is recognised immediately within the consolidated income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is 
included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial 
asset or liability. If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, 
the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity 
are reclassified into the consolidated income statement in the same 
period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed 
affects profit or loss.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two 
paragraphs, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from 
equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement in the 
same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction 
affects the consolidated income statement.
Prospective hedge testing is performed at the inception of the hedge 
relationship and subsequently at each balance sheet date, through 
comparison of the critical terms of the hedged forecast transaction 
and the hedging instrument using regression analysis. Retrospective 
hedge testing is performed at each reporting date principally using 
a dollar offset analysis, comparing the cumulative changes in the fair 
values of the forecast hedged transaction and the hedging 
instrument.
When a hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity 
revokes designation of the hedge relationship, hedge accounting is 
discontinued prospectively. If the hedged forecast transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in 
equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the 
transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately. 
liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, normally being the 
transaction price plus, in the case of financial liabilities not at fair 
value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.  
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on 
their classification, as follows:
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. For interest-
bearing loans and borrowings this is the fair value of the proceeds 
received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial 
recognition, financial liabilities other than those at fair value through 
profit or loss are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. 
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation 
of liabilities are recognised respectively in interest, other revenues and 
finance costs. This category of financial liabilities includes trade and 
other payables.
Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are separated into three components: liability, 
issuer call option and equity at inception. Each component is 
recognised separately.
The initial fair value of the liability component of the convertible  
bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent 
non-convertible bond and is subsequently recorded at an amortised 
cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on 
conversion or maturity of the bonds. The issuer call option is fair 
valued using a valuation model and is measured at each balance sheet 
date with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. 
The remainder of the proceeds are recognised in shareholders’ equity 
in a separate convertible bond reserve.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity 
components of a convertible bond based on the allocation of proceeds 
to the liability and equity components when the instruments are first 
recognised.
Derivatives
Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the policy in  
Note 1(E)(iii).
Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial liability when the contractual 
obligations to pay the contractual cash flows on the financial liability 
are discharged, cancelled or expire. 
(iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure 
to foreign exchange and fuel price risks arising from operational, 
financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury 
policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial 
instruments for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain 
or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged. The gain  
or loss on remeasurement to fair value on derivatives not designated 
as a hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income 
statement against the opposite line of income or expense. The 
accounting policy for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting  
is included in Note 1(F).

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
(iii) marketing and other direct sales costs
marketing, advertising and other promotional costs, including those 
related to the production of brochures, are expensed when the benefit 
of the goods or services is made available to the Group. In particular, 
brochure and advertising costs are expensed to the consolidated 
income statement when the Group’s suppliers have delivered the 
relevant material. 
(I) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans  
are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement  
as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service  
in current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair 
value of any plan assets is deducted in calculating the overall liability. 
The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on 
AA credit-rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and having 
the same maturity dates approximating to, the terms of the Group’s 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using 
the projected unit credit method.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset 
recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan which are 
under the control of the Group.
When the benefits of a plan are amended, the portion of the  
increase/decrease in benefit relating to past services by employees 
is recognised as an expense/income in the consolidated income 
statement on a straight line basis over the average period until 
the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest 
immediately, the expense/income is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated income statement.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur 
through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Either 
monthly or annual contributions are made to funded schemes. The 
current service cost is included in the consolidated income statement 
as a personnel expense. Any change in the present value of pension 
scheme liabilities relating to employee service in prior periods but 
arising in the current period as a result of benefit amendments is 
charged/credited to operating expenses over the period during which 
such amendments vest.
The expected return on the schemes’ assets and the increase during 
the period in the present value of the schemes’ liabilities arising from 
the passage of time are included in financial income and financial 
expenses, respectively. 
(iii) Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share award programmes allow certain Group employees 
to acquire shares of the Company. These shares are awarded by the 
Company. For equity-settled transactions, the fair value of services 
is measured by the fair value of the shares at the time awarded and 
is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase  
in equity. The fair value is spread over the period during which the 
employee becomes entitled to the awards.
1. Accounting policies continued
(G) Revenue
Revenue represents the aggregate amount earned from inclusive tours, 
scheduled and charter flying, provision of incoming agency destination 
services, travel agency and intermediary commission received and 
other services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of 
business. Revenue excludes intra-group transactions and is stated 
after the deduction of trade discounts and sales taxes. Revenue  
is reported gross of fixed charges which are a liability of the tour 
operator or airline. These include Air Passenger Duty and other  
per passenger charges and levies, including the ATOL Protection 
Contribution in the UK.
(i) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement when  
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the buyer. Travel agency and intermediary commissions and other 
revenues received from the sale of third party product are recognised 
when they are earned, typically on receipt of final payment. Revenue  
in respect of in-house product is recognised on the date of departure. 
Revenue from individual travel modules directly booked by the 
customer with airlines, hotels and incoming agencies is recognised 
when the customer departs or uses the respective service. Revenue 
from the sale of travel insurance is recognised at the point of sale.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding 
recovery of the consideration due or associated costs.
(ii) Client monies received in advance (deferred income)
Client monies received at the balance sheet date relating to holidays 
commencing and flights departing after the year end are deferred 
and included within trade and other payables.
(iii) measurement of revenue
Where the Group acts as principal, revenue is stated at the contractual 
value of goods and services provided.
Where the Group acts as an agent between the service provider  
and the end customer, revenue is presented on a net basis as the 
difference between the sales price to the customer and the cost  
of the services purchased and not the total transaction sales value. 
Businesses are identified as intermediaries dependent on a number of 
criteria, principally including the control exercised over the provision  
of service, inventory risk and customer credit risk.
(iv) Aircraft lease income
Operating lease rental income is recognised in operating income  
as earned, on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
(H) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the term of 
the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over 
the term of the lease.
(ii) Finance lease payments
minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge 
and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
liability.

SHAREHOLDER INFORmATION
of deferred tax asset recognised is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using the tax rate at which the asset or liability is expected to 
reverse in future periods, based on tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(l ) Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as  
a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and 
are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Interim dividends are 
recognised when paid. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these 
criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
(m) earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data 
for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit 
or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. EPS measures for continuing operations 
have been presented in accordance with IAS 33. The Group also 
presents a basic and diluted underlying EPS measure based on 
underlying earnings as defined in Note 1(B)(ii) above. Further details  
of the EPS calculation are presented in Note 33.
(n ) investments
Unless designated at fair value through profit and loss, trade 
investments are classified as available for sale assets and are 
included under non-current assets. They are recorded at fair value 
with movements in value taken to other comprehensive income. 
Any impairment to value is recorded in the income statement.
Short term investments in debt and equity securities which are held 
for trading are classified as current assets and are stated at fair value, 
with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.
(O) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase 
method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates. Goodwill represents the difference 
between the fair value of consideration paid or payable and the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired. Identifiable intangibles, such as brands and customer 
relationships, are those which can be sold separately or which arise 
from contractual or legal rights regardless of whether those rights 
are separable, and the fair value can be reliably measured. Goodwill 
is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units (CGUs) expected 
to benefit from the business combination and is not amortised but 
tested annually for impairment. Impairment testing is based on assets 
grouped at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. In respect of joint ventures and associates, the 
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment in the joint venture or associate.
For cash-settled transactions, the resulting liability for the Group is 
charged to expenses at its fair value as at the date of the performance 
of the service by the beneficiary. Until payment of this liability, the 
fair value of the liability is remeasured at every reporting date and 
all changes are included in the consolidated income statement.
For both types of share-based payment transactions, the fair value  
of the awards is measured using option valuation models, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made, 
including market performance conditions and the impact of non-vesting 
conditions. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of share awards that vest except where forfeiture  
is due only to market based performance conditions not meeting the 
threshold for vesting.
(iv) Own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust 
Transactions of the Group-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust (the 
Trust) are included in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  
In particular, the Trust’s purchase of shares in the Company is debited 
directly in equity to retained earnings/accumulated losses.
(v) Short term benefits
Short term employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis 
and are expensed as the related service is provided.
(J) Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises interest income on funds invested 
(including available for sale financial assets), dividend income, gains 
on the disposal of available for sale financial assets and changes in the 
fair value of financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using 
the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit 
or loss on the date the Group’s right to receive payment is established 
which, in the case of quoted securities, is the ex-dividend date. Foreign 
currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, 
unwinding of the discount on provisions and changes in the fair value 
of financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. All 
borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective 
interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on  
a net basis.
(K) Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income, or directly in equity, as appropriate.
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for  
the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous periods.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided or recognised using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill 
not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that 
they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
Software in development is not amortised. Upon completion of 
development and bringing the software into use, the costs are 
re-categorised into computer software and amortisation commences.
(P) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable 
to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Where significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment 
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
(ii) l eased assets
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Leased assets 
acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to 
the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments at the inception of the lease, less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Lease payments are accounted  
for as set out in Note 1(H)(ii) above.
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of each 
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Freehold land is 
not depreciated. The useful economic lives are as follows:
Freehold properties Up to 50 years
Short leasehold improvements Lease period or useful 
economic life if shorter
Owned aircraft Up to 18 years
Finance leased aircraft and equipment Lease period or useful 
economic life if shorter
Aircraft spares 12 years
Cruise ships 40 years
Yachts 5-15 years
motor boats 15-24 years
Computer equipment including  
retail computer equipment
3-5 years
Retail fixtures and fittings Up to 10 years
Other assets Up to 7 years
The cost of major overhauls of owned airframes and engines is 
capitalised and depreciated over the period until the next scheduled 
major overhaul. 
The depreciation methods, useful economic lives and residual 
values are reassessed annually. Revisions to useful economic lives 
and residual values are accounted for prospectively from the date 
of change.
Freehold land, assets under construction and advance payments 
(including capitalised borrowing costs for future aircraft) are not 
depreciated. Upon delivery of the aircraft, advance payments for 
aircraft that are subsequently owned are re-categorised to aircraft 
assets and depreciation is commenced. Advance payments for 
aircraft that are sold and leased back on delivery under an operating 
lease are accounted for as a disposal. Where the aircraft is leased 
back on a finance lease, as well as the disposal of the advance 
payment, an addition to aircraft is recorded at an amount equal  
to the lower of fair value of the aircraft and the present value  
of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
1. Accounting policies continued
Fair value adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions. If, at  
the balance sheet date, the amounts of fair values of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets and liabilities can only be established provisionally, 
then these values are used. Any adjustments to these values are taken 
as adjustments to goodwill and must be recorded within 12 months  
of the acquisition. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is 
recognised in the income statement upon acquisition.
(ii) Computer software, software in development and other 
intangible assets
Computer software consists of all software that is not an integral  
part of the related computer hardware and is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes  
are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that 
are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and 
unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised 
as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that 
it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product and use 
or sell it;
• there is an ability to use o r sell the software product;
• it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate 
probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the software product are available; 
and
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its 
development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software 
product include the software development employee costs and an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are 
recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously 
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a 
subsequent period.
Separately acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical 
cost. Licences and order books assets acquired in a business 
combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date, as 
detailed in Note 1 W(ii). Licences have a finite useful life and are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
(iii) Brands and customer relationships
Brands and contractual customer relationships acquired in a business 
combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Both intangibles have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. 
(iv) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life of each type 
of intangible asset as follows:
Computer software 3-10 years
Brands 15-20 years
Order book at date of acquisition Over the period until travel occurs
Customer relationships Over the period during which value will  
be obtained by the Group (up to 15 years)
Licences Over the term of licence

STRATEGIC REPORT
 
BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REv IEW
 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
 
Fin An CiAl St Atement S
 
SHAREHOLDER INFORmATION
If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each 
balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of 
an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. A CGU is the 
smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that 
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets. The largest unit to which goodwill is allocated is 
an operating segment level as defined in IFRS 8 before applying 
aggregation criteria.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses 
recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect  
of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the 
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation,  
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(R) inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated 
costs incurred until the sale and the estimated variable costs required 
to sell. All inventories are written down individually where the net 
realisable value of inventories is lower than their carrying amounts. 
The measurement method applied to similar inventory items is the 
weighted average cost formula.
(S) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the 
Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation and the outflow of economic benefits can be 
reliably estimated. If the effect is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the liability.
(i) maintenance provision for leased aircraft
To reflect the legal obligations placed upon the Group under the terms 
of certain operating leases, provision is made for the maintenance, 
overhaul and repair costs of operating leased airframes, engines and 
certain other components. The provision is based on the present  
value of the anticipated external costs of the next maintenance  
event calculated by reference to costs experienced and published 
manufacturers’ data. The charge to the consolidated income statement 
is calculated by reference to the number of hours and cycles flown and 
by reference to the length of the full overhaul cycle. Costs incurred are 
charged against the provision. Neither the timing nor the value of the 
expenditure can be precisely determined but they can be averaged 
over time and over a fleet. The unwinding of discounted values is 
charged to the consolidated income statement as a financial expense.
(iv) Borrowing costs
In respect of borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets, the Group 
capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost 
of that asset. 
The Group has capitalised borrowing costs with respect to pre-delivery 
payments relating to aircraft.
(v) Sale and leaseback transactions
When a sale and leaseback results in a finance leaseback, any gain 
on the sale is deferred and recognised as income over the lease term. 
Any loss on the sale is immediately recognised in the profit and loss 
account if there is evidence that the asset’s carrying value exceeds 
the fair value. 
If the leaseback is classified as an operating lease, then any gain 
is recognised immediately if the sale and leaseback terms are 
demonstrably at fair value. Otherwise, the sale and leaseback  
is accounted for as follows:
• If the sale price is below fair value, then the gain or loss is recognised 
immediately, other than to the extent that a loss is compensated for 
by future rentals at a below-market price, then the loss is deferred 
and amortised over the period that the asset is expected to be used.
• If the sale price is above fair value, then any gain is deferred 
and amortised over the useful life of the asset.
• If the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount 
of the asset at the date of the transaction, then that difference 
is recognised immediately as a loss on the sale.
(Q) impairments
(i) Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial 
asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that 
one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future 
cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset is calculated as the 
difference between its carrying amount and its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss in respect of an available for sale financial asset 
is calculated by reference to its fair value. The recoverable amount 
of the Group’s receivables which are carried at amortised cost is 
calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets). 
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted. 
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment 
on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed 
collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any cumulative 
loss in respect of an available for sale financial asset previously 
recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss. An impairment  
loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets 
measured at amortised cost and available for sale financial assets that 
are debt securities, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss. For 
available for sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal 
is recognised in other comprehensive income.
(ii) Non-financial assets
The carrying amount of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than 
inventory and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
made in determining fair values is disclosed in the note specific to that 
asset or liability.
(i) Property, plant and equipment
The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result 
of a business combination is based on market values. The market value 
of property is the estimated amount for which a property could be 
exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a 
willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing 
wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and 
without compulsion. The market value of items of plant, equipment, 
fixtures and fittings is based on the quoted market prices for similar 
items.
(ii) Intangible assets
The fair value of intangible assets recognised as a result of a business 
combination, including brands, customer relationships and the 
customer order book at the date of acquisition, is valued by reference 
to external market values or income-based methods. Income-based 
methods estimate the future economic benefits to be derived from 
ownership of the asset by identifying, quantifying and separating cash 
flows attributable to the asset and capitalising their present value.
(iii) Investments in equity and debt securities
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and 
available for sale financial assets is determined by reference to their 
quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, where available. If there 
is no market price available the fair value is calculated based on other 
valuation techniques, including assessments of future cash flows, 
estimated selling price and other available information. The fair value 
of held to maturity investments is determined on initial recognition 
and thereafter for disclosure purposes only.
(iv) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently 
recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there  
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The 
amount of allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
(v) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently 
recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(vi) Derivatives
The fair value of foreign currency contracts, fuel forward contracts and 
option contracts is their forward market price at the balance sheet date, 
based on external valuations or internal valuations using market data. 
(vii) Non-derivative financial liabilities
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated 
based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For 
finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference 
to similar lease agreements.
(viii) Share-based payments
The fair value of the shares awarded is measured using option 
valuation models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the awards were made. The valuation basis is identical whether 
the awards will be settled in cash or shares.
1. Accounting policies continued
(ii) Restructuring provision
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group  
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced  
publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(iii) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected 
benefits to be derived by the Group from the contract are lower than 
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  
The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the 
expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost  
of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the 
Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with 
that contract. 
(t ) Related parties
For the purpose of these consolidated financial statements, parties  
are considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability, 
directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant 
influence over the party making financial and operating decisions, or 
vice versa, or where the Group and the party are subject to common 
control or significant influence. Related parties may be individuals or 
entities.
(U) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of an entity that:
• engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues 
and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating 
to transactions with other components of the same entity);
• whose operating results and financial position are regularly  
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions 
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance; and
• for which discrete financial information is available.
As described in Note 3, all underlying operating items are allocated 
to the segment’s underlying profit except central costs and net 
financial expenses.
(V) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management  
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
Details of critical judgements, significant estimates and assumptions 
are disclosed in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial 
statements. The key accounting estimates and judgements are 
described in Note 2.
(W) Determination of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require 
the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial 
assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for 
measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following 
methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions

IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ To be announced
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ replaces all of the guidance 
on control and consolidation currently within IAS 27 and SIC 12 and 
builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the 
determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the 
consolidated financial statements. This new standard is not expected 
to have a material impact on the Group’s results but may affect the 
Group’s accounting treatment for its non-consolidated entities. 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ establishes principles for financial 
reporting by parties to a joint arrangement. The IFRS supersedes 
IAS 31 and SIC-13 and is concerned principally with both the structure 
of the arrangement and that an entity had a choice of accounting 
treatment for interests in jointly controlled entities. The adoption 
of this new standard is not expected to have an impact on the 
Group’s results. 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ sets out the required 
disclosures for entities reporting under the two new standards, 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’, and IFRS 11 ’Joint 
arrangements’ and replaces the disclosure requirements currently 
found in IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates’. The IFRS requires an entity 
to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to 
evaluate both the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests  
in other entities and the effects of those interests on its financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows. 
The amendment to IFRSs 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance provides 
additional transitional relief in IFRSs 10, 11 and 12 limiting the 
requirement to provide adjusted comparative information to only the 
preceding comparative period. The amendment also requires certain 
comparative disclosures under IFRS 12 upon transition.
IAS 27 (revised) ‘Separate financial statements’ includes the provisions 
on separate financial statements that are left after the control 
provisions of IAS 27 have been included in the new IFRS 10.
IAS 28 (revised) ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ 
includes the requirements for joint ventures, as well as associates, 
to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11.
(X) New Standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards are applicable to the Group and will be applied 
to the accounting period beginning on 1 October 2013:
• IAS 19 (revised 2011) ‘Employee benefits’. The amendment to IAS 19 
‘Employee benefits’ makes significant changes to the recognition and 
measurement of defined benefit pension expense and termination 
benefits and enhances the disclosures for all employee benefits. 
The most significant impact for the Group is that interest expense 
will be calculated on the net defined benefit liability by applying 
the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. This replaces 
the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation and the expected 
return on plan assets and will increase the Group’s employee 
benefit expense. Had the standard been applied in the current 
financial year, the Group’s profit before tax would have been £12m 
lower, equating to a decrease in the statutory and underlying 
earnings per share of 1.1p. 
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’. This standard aims to improve 
consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition 
of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and 
disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements 
do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance 
on how it should be applied where its use is already required or 
permitted by other standards. The impact on the Group is expected 
to be mainly in relation to the fair values of assets and liabilities 
on acquisition of businesses and in fair valuing derivative financial 
instruments, although these are not expected to materially alter 
the Group’s results and balances. 
• The IASB’s Annual improvements project (2011) contains seven 
amendments affecting five standards, which are all effective from 
1 January 2013. Only the amendment to IAS 16 ‘Property, plant 
and equipment’ is expected to have an impact on the Group’s year 
end balances and disclosures, although the impact on the Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet is not expected to be material. The 
previous wording of IAS 16 indicated that servicing equipment 
should be classified as inventory, even if it was used for more than 
one period. The amendment clarifies that spare parts and servicing 
equipment are classified as property, plant and equipment rather 
than inventory when they meet the definition of property, plant 
and equipment.
• Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption on government grants’ 
and ‘Exemption for severe hyperinflation and fixed dates for EU 
entities‘. These amendments are not expected to have an impact 
on the Group’s results or balances.
• Amendments to IFRS 7 on Financial instruments asset and liability 
offsetting. The amendments to IFRS 7 on offsetting financial 
instruments and liabilities clarify some of the requirements for 
offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance 
sheet. The amendments clarify that the right of set-off must be 
available today and not contingent on a future event. It also must  
be legally enforceable for all counterparties in the normal course of 
business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy. 
This amendment is not expected to have an impact on the Group’s 
results, balances or disclosures.
The following standards, revisions and amendments to current 
standards have been issued and, unless stated, are considered 
applicable to the Group in future years. They have not been voluntarily 
adopted early by the Group.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
most, these being in relation to the discount rate and earnings growth 
(both within the long term plans and thereafter). Further details, 
including sensitivity analysis, are given in Note 10 and the accounting 
policy is set out in Note 1(Q)(ii).
Defined benefit pension plans
A qualified independent actuary undertakes the estimation of the 
present value of the Group’s obligations under defined benefit pension 
schemes using assumptions taken from a range of possible actuarial 
assumptions. These assumptions may not be borne out in practice, 
especially due to the long timescales involved. In particular, the 
valuation of scheme assets is based on the fair value at the balance 
sheet date. As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short 
term, their value may change significantly prior to realisation. In 
reviewing the work of the qualified independent actuary, management 
was required to exercise judgement to satisfy itself that appropriate 
weight had been afforded to macroeconomic factors. Details of the 
actual assumptions used, including sensitivity analysis, are set out in 
Note 6(C).
Derivative financial instruments
Judgement is required in the assessment of prospective effectiveness 
and specifically in the assessment of the probability of forecast 
transactions, both at hedge inception and during the period over which 
hedge accounting is adopted. The fair value of derivative financial 
instruments can also involve judgement. Where appropriate, external 
valuations from financial institutions are undertaken to support the 
carrying value of such items. Details of sensitivity analysis are set out 
in Note 26(K).
(B) Judgements
Entry into service of new aircraft and related accounting
This financial year saw the Group incur costs to enable a new type of 
aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to be brought into service. As part 
of the funding of these costs, the Group is entitled to certain credits 
from Boeing which in some cases are taken directly to the income 
statement and in others are used to offset against the cost of each 
aircraft. These are therefore reported as sale and leaseback profits in 
the income statement when the aircraft is delivered and the sale and 
leaseback transaction is executed. Significant judgement is involved in 
the accounting treatment of these credits both in terms of recognition 
and classification in the income statement, since entry into service 
costs will continue to be incurred in the next financial year as further 
Boeing 787 deliveries occur and more aircraft are brought into service. 
Separately disclosed items
Separately disclosed items are those significant items which in 
management’s judgement are highlighted by virtue of their size 
or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance. Such items are included within the income statement 
caption to which they relate (Note 4).
Revenue recognition
In recognising revenue, judgement is required in the consideration 
of whether each individual business acts as a principal or agent and 
whether revenues should be recognised on a gross or net basis, in 
accordance with IAS 18. Judgement is required when considering 
the balance of risk and rewards of the sale, including delivery and 
non-performance risk, credit risk, inventory risk and the ability to 
establish prices. 
Business combinations
In the case of business combinations, judgement and estimation is 
required in the identification and valuation of separable assets and 
liabilities on acquisitions. In particular, judgement and estimation is 
required in the identification and valuation of separable intangible 
assets (including brands and customer databases) and determining 
appropriate useful economic lives for these assets. Judgement and 
1. Accounting policies continued
The revisions to IAS 27 and IAS 28 are not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s results. 
The amendment to IAS 36 in respect of recoverable amount 
disclosures for impairment of non financial assets is only expected 
to impact disclosures where a cash generating unit is assessed on 
the basis of fair value less costs to sell, as opposed to value in use.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ was reissued in 2010 and includes 
guidance on the classification and measurement of financial assets 
and financial liabilities and the de-recognition of financial instruments. 
The standard is being added to as the IASB endorses different 
phases of the project to replace IAS 39 and its effective date is yet 
to be announced.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of these and 
other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed 
by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future 
accounting periods.
2. Key accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under adopted 
IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue 
and expenses during the year. The Directors evaluate the estimates 
and judgements on an ongoing basis. Such estimates and judgements 
are based upon historical experience and other factors they believe to 
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from 
estimates. The Directors have discussed with the Audit Committee  
the selection, development and disclosure of the Group’s critical 
accounting policies and estimates and the applications of these policies 
and estimates. Key estimates and judgements have been made in 
respect of the following areas:
(A) estimates
Intangible assets – Goodwill carrying value
A full impairment review has been performed of all goodwill, together 
with intangible and tangible balances held across the Group on a CGU 
basis. In the current year, the impairment review has been performed 
on a ‘value in use’ basis for all CGUs, which requires estimation of 
future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will 
occur and appropriate discount and growth rates. 
Significant estimates for revenues and costs are required in building 
financial budgets extending over a five year period, which are based 
upon internal and macroeconomic factors such as the Group’s strategy 
for each CGU, the brand strength within that CGU, consumer demand, 
supplier cost increases, oil prices and the penetration of differentiated 
holidays. All inputs into the Group’s long term plans are challenged and 
considered by the Group management Board until achievable and 
realistic budgets are approved. For example, in the Specialist & Activity 
Sector, following the removal of the sector management team at the 
start of the financial year, the outcome of the assessment of those 
businesses’ future profitability was considered to be less than that 
used in last year’s impairment review, thereby causing impairments 
within that Sector to total £109m. In the French tour operating 
business, there is significant and inherent uncertainty over the speed 
of recovery (and therefore the timing of return to profitability) due 
to the ongoing political unrest and violence in the North African 
destinations. Delaying the return to profitability and reducing the 
absolute levels of profits within a five year timescale relative to last 
year has led to a £59m impairment charge in the year.
For the purpose of the Group’s impairment testing, we have then 
considered the key inputs that can impact discounted cash flows the

Belgium & morocco, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, 
Southern Europe and the Hotels division (comprising hotel 
management companies and joint ventures in hotel assets).  
Each source market represents an individual operating segment. 
Aggregation criteria is then used to combine certain of these operating 
segments into reported segments.
The Specialist & Activity Sector operates under six divisions: 
Adventure, Education, marine, North American Specialist, Sport and 
Specialist Holidays Group. The Sector has over 100 international 
specialist and activity brands delivering a range of unique customer 
experiences. The Specialist & Activity Sector is considered to be one 
operating segment, in line with internal management reporting.
The Accommodation & Destinations (A&D) Sector provides a range  
of services in destinations to tour operators, travel agents, corporate 
clients and direct to the consumer worldwide. A&D consists of  
Online Accommodation (comprising Accommodation Wholesaler  
and Accommodation OTA) and Inbound Services. The A&D Sector  
in total is considered as one operating segment, in line with internal 
management reporting. 
The Emerging markets Sector is a growing portfolio of travel 
businesses in the source markets of Russia, the Ukraine, India  
and China and is considered to be one operating segment.
Reportable and reported segments
The results of the UK & Ireland, Germany, Nordics and the French  
tour operator are reported separately due to the size and importance 
of these source markets and which meet the threshold for being 
individual reportable segments. The results for the French scheduled 
airline, Corsair, are shown separately to that of the French tour 
operator as it has a different business model to the rest of the Group’s 
integrated tour operators. All of the other mainstream Sectors, except 
for the Hotels division, meet the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 
and are reported as one segment, the Rest of mainstream. All of the 
aggregated businesses are considered to be similar in nature and 
economically similar over the long term. The Hotels division is reported 
separately as this does not meet the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8. 
Emerging markets, the Specialist & Activity and A&D Sectors are all 
reported as separate Sector totals as this is consistent with internal 
management reports.
All reportable segments derive their revenues from the sale of leisure 
travel and ancillary services. Segmental information for both the 
current and prior year has been presented using this structure, with 
the prior year‘s information being restated. Corporate costs are in 
respect of central costs including finance, human resources, legal, 
facility costs and some information technology costs that do not  
relate to each business segment and hence are not allocated.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is 
provided below. Segmental performance is evaluated based on 
underlying operating profit and is measured consistently with 
underlying operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial 
statements and as defined in Note 1(B)(ii). Intersegmental sales and 
transfers reflect arm’s length prices as if sold or transferred to third 
parties. Financial income and expenses are not allocated to the 
reportable segments as this activity is managed by the Group’s 
treasury function which manages the overall net cash/debt position  
of the Group. No one customer exceeds 10% of entity revenues in  
any segment. Goodwill impairment losses arising are detailed in 
Note 10 and are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Segment assets comprise capital expenditure (as this is the only 
measure of assets reported monthly to the G mB) and represent the 
amounts purchased in the year.
estimation is also required in determining the fair value of deferred  
tax assets and retirement benefits acquired, as well as the contingent 
consideration payable in respect of each acquisition. Details of 
acquisitions are set out in Note 13.
Liabilities
In accounting for provisions, judgement is required in determining 
occurrence probability, maturity and level of risk. Judgement and 
estimation is required in determining aircraft maintenance, 
restructuring, legal (including denied boarding compensation) and 
onerous lease provisions. It is also required to determine the provision 
methodology and for certain provisions, considering external 
information on which to base the amount of provision. Due to the 
volume of transactions and the materiality of period end accruals, 
judgement is also required in respect of the recognition and 
derecognition of airline and accommodation operating accruals. Details 
of provisions made and the basis on which the provisions have been 
calculated are disclosed in Note 22 and the accounting policy is set  
out in Note 1(S).
Taxation
The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising  
from trading and corporate transactions in the UK and overseas 
jurisdictions. After taking appropriate external advice, the Group 
makes provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of 
economic loss that may be incurred and which is reliably measurable. 
Items relating to open areas often require significant judgement, 
including the probability, timing and size of any amounts that may 
become payable. Judgements in respect of significant tax liabilities are 
given in Note 8. Judgement is also required in the assessment of the 
future recoverability of tax losses and recognition of deferred tax 
assets. Details of unrecognised tax losses are given in Note 14.
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments
Judgements have been made in respect of the volumes of future 
trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in 
order to assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments 
made to those hoteliers. Judgement can often be based upon an 
understanding of the financial strength of those hoteliers and the 
quality of, and demand for, each hotel over the coming seasons.
Fair value measurements
management has to make judgements regarding the valuation of some 
financial instruments that use inputs that are not observable in active 
markets. These are disclosed in Note 26(H). 
3. Segmental information
IFRS 8 requires segmental information to be presented on the same 
basis as that used for internal management reporting. Segmental 
information is reported by the Group’s business sectors to the Group 
management Board (GmB). The GmB consists of tour operating and 
functional experts drawn from across the Group who execute TUI 
Travel’s day-to-day operations, allocate resources to and assess the 
performance of the operating segments. Consequently, the G mB is 
considered to be the chief operating decision maker for the purposes 
of IFRS 8.
Group structure
The Group presents segmental information in respect of its Sectors. 
As disclosed in the Group’s 2012 Annual Report & Accounts, with 
effect from 1 October 2012, the businesses within our mainstream 
Sector are reported via each key source market instead of regionally. 
Emerging markets remains outside of the mainstream Sector for 
internal management reporting purposes and is reported separately. 
The mainstream Sector consists of the following source markets: UK  
& Ireland, Germany, France, Corsair, the Nordic countries, Canada,

Restructuring and other separately disclosed items
The overall charge of £59m includes £54m of restructuring costs. £29m of the restructuring costs arise in the Mainstream business, with £25m 
occurring in France from the ongoing restructure of the tour operator and the airline. In particular, a £19m charge has been taken in the final 
quarter of the year as a result of a voluntary redundancy programme being announced in the French tour operator, to reduce overhead costs 
further given the difficult trading environment it is experiencing at present.
There has been a total of £18m of restructuring costs incurred in the Specialist & Activity Sector in the current financial year due to the removal  
of the Sector management team, the closure of a business in the Education division, further restructuring of the PEAK adventure business based 
in Melbourne, Australia and rationalisation of overseas bases in the Marine division. w ithin the Accommodation & Destinations Sector, £7m of 
restructuring costs have arisen due to several programmes aimed at rationalising the business structure and moving to a number of regional 
shared service centres in Europe, Asia and the Americas.
In addition to these restructuring costs, the most significant other item is a £4m charge due to the change in value of unhedged foreign currency 
derivative instruments relating to future seasons.
Included in the year ended 30 September 2012 were Mainstream restructuring costs of £66m which principally related to: the restructuring 
programmes in the French tour operator and airline, being £66m in total; the £5m restructure of the Moroccan airline, Jet4You; and offset by a 
£7m release of unused provision in the German tour operator. In addition, a total of £24m restructuring costs were incurred across the Specialist 
& Activity and Accommodation & Destinations Sectors. £8m of this total arose from restructuring actions taken in the Adventure division; £6m 
arose from the write-down of specific ski chalet assets; £4m arose from actions taken in the Marine division; and £3m from the finalisation of 
restructuring programmes in Greece, Morocco and Tunisia. A total of £12m of costs were incurred in Group head office companies, being primarily 
to support the various restructuring programmes around the Group.
aircraft and other assets
During the year ended 30 September 2013, a total credit of £18m has been recognised which arises from various aircraft transactions. 
Significantly, this is the first year in which the Group has incurred costs to enable a new type of aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to be brought 
into service. As part of the funding of these costs, the Group is entitled to certain credits which in some cases are taken directly to the income 
statement and in others are used to offset against the cost of each aircraft. These are therefore reported as sale and leaseback profits in the 
income statement when the aircraft is delivered and the sale and leaseback transaction is executed. The entry into service costs, the associated 
credits and sale and leaseback profits have all been included in separately disclosed items due to the size and nature of the items and the 
imperfect matching between costs being incurred and credits being recognised in the income statement. Entry into service costs will continue  
to be incurred in the next financial year as further Boeing 787 deliveries occur and more aircraft are brought into service.
In addition to the aircraft items, a credit of £5m has been recognised from uplifting the value of the Group’s total investment in The Airline Group 
Limited to reflect the fair value agreed under the terms of the disposal agreement announced on 19 November 2013.

Pension related credit 
In the Netherlands, the management and Works Council of TUI Nederland NV agreed to close the existing defined benefit pension scheme and 
replace it with a defined contribution scheme. This change is classified as a curtailment under IAS 19 and the resultant reduction in accrued 
pension liabilities of £14m has been recognised in the income statement in the period in which it occurred. 
The management of TUI Nederland Nv and the pension scheme trustees also agreed to transfer the existing pension fund assets and liabilities to 
AEGON, a multinational life insurance, pensions and asset management company headquartered in the Netherlands. This transfer of the pension 
assets and liabilities has been approved by the Dutch pension regulator and has now been accounted for, generating a further credit in the income 
statement of £11m. Further details of these transactions are disclosed in Note 6(c ).
l itigation provisions
At the year end the Group has continued to assess the likely outcome of the legal actions in which it is involved and, in accordance with IAS 37, 
has recognised provisions where it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. This year the 
process has resulted in a charge to the income statement of £13m (€15m) in respect of the penalties agreed with the Spanish tax authorities  
on 11 October 2013 under the terms of the settlement reached (Note 8).
In the year ended 30 September 2012, the Group’s assessment of the likely outcome of the legal actions in which it was then involved resulted  
in a charge to the income statement of £17m.
c hange in accounting estimates
During the year ended 30 September 2012, the Group reviewed the estimates used in calculating aircraft maintenance provisions and empty leg 
provisions to ensure consistency of application of the latest estimates across the Group. This process resulted in a credit to the income statement 
of £27m, which due to its size was included as a separately disclosed item.

redundancy costs that are included within separately disclosed items in Note 4. 
(C) Pension costs
The Group operates pension schemes for employees eligible and wishing to participate in the schemes. These comprise both defined contribution 
and defined benefit schemes. Pension obligations vary reflecting the different legal and market conditions in each country of operation. Defined 
contribution schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to private and state-run organisations, whilst defined benefit schemes comprise 
both funded and unfunded schemes. The assets of all the funded defined benefit schemes are held separately from the assets of the Group.
Defined contribution schemes for employees and Directors 
c urrent contributions are recognised as an expense in the year and once paid the Group has no further liability. Pension costs of £29m (2012: 
£27m) relating to defined contribution schemes were charged to the income statement.
Defined benefit pension schemes 
The movement of defined benefit pension obligations and assets is detailed below, summarised as UK, Germany and Other. Other includes funded 
schemes in Ireland, the Netherlands (up until the date of closure of this scheme), Switzerland and Norway, whilst the main unfunded arrangements 
are in Austria and France. Almost all UK schemes are funded whilst German schemes are unfunded. 
The funded schemes in the UK are closed to new members.
The Group has established a Pension Funding Partnership arrangement (PFP) including TUI Travel Amber Scot l P (Sl P) and TUI Travel Amber 
E&w ll P (ll P), together the Partnerships (the Partnerships). The main operating brands of the UK business, namely Thomson and First c hoice, 
were transferred to the ll P and three pension schemes subscribed for interests in the ll P via the Sl P . TUI UK l imited pays a royalty to the ll P 
for the use of the brands. The Britannia Airways l imited Superannuation and l ife Assurance Scheme, the TUI Pension Scheme (UK) and the 
Thomson Airways Pension Scheme in aggregate are entitled to an annual income distribution of approximately £17m. The PFP has a life of 15 
years from inception, after which the schemes will receive a payment equal to their outstanding funding deficit, up to a maximum of £275m in 
aggregate, in return for their interest in the PFP .
The Partnerships are controlled by the Group and their results are consolidated by the Group. There is no net impact on the Group balance 
sheet, the IAS 19 deficit or income statement. The investment held by the pension schemes does not meet the definition of a scheme asset 
under IAS 19, and is therefore not included within the fair value of scheme assets disclosed in the Group financial statements. The recognition of 
the brand assets in the Group financial statements remains unaffected by the establishment of the PFP, although the Thomson and First Choice 
brands, the latter of which is recognised on the Group balance sheet, are now being held as security for the PFP. See Note 10 for more 
information.

In September 2013, the c ompany and the Trustees of the Britannia Airways l imited Superannuation and l ife Assurance Scheme, the TUI 
Pension Scheme (UK) and the Thomson Airways Pension Scheme reached agreement on the 2012 scheme valuations and associated funding 
contributions. As part of this settlement, £30m was paid into an escrow account on behalf of the schemes, ahead of year end. This was a 
performance related payment in respect of the current year. The level of payments in subsequent years is dependent on the rate of growth in 
underlying earnings. Following the completion of formal legal documentation, the £30m was released from the escrow account to the schemes  
in October 2013. This amount is reported within prepayments at year end, since it met neither the definition of scheme assets within IAS 19 nor 
cash. Details of the current funding commitments of these three UK schemes are shown below, excluding the performance related element 
which is not quantifiable in advance.

Britannia Airways l imited Superannuation

TUI Pension Scheme (UK) 31 March 2012 11.5% plus £13.7m per annum deficit contribution and £4.2m PFP income 7.2%
Thomson Airways Pension Scheme 31 March 2012 19.8% plus £3.0m per annum deficit contribution plus £0.5m PFP income 14.6%
Where there is more than a single class of membership, contribution rates reflect weighted average values within the scheme. Contribution rates 
are stated before adjustment for salary sacrifice arrangements where applicable.
The principal unfunded schemes in Germany are shown below. These were all subject to a full actuarial valuation within three months preceding 
the balance sheet date:

Within Other territories, TUI Nederland NV and the Works Council agreed to close the existing defined benefit pension scheme and replace it with 
a defined contribution scheme. This change is classified as a curtailment under IAS 19 and the resultant reduction in accrued pension liabilities of 
£14m has been recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year. 
The management of TUI Nederland Nv and the pension scheme trustees have also agreed to transfer the existing pension fund assets and 
liabilities to AEGON, a multinational life insurance, pensions and asset management company headquartered in the Netherlands. The agreement 
was contingent on approval by the Dutch pension regulator, which was received in April 2013. This transfer of the pension assets and liabilities 
generated a further credit in the income statement of £11m which is accounted for as a settlement gain under IAS 19. The gains on curtailment 
and settlement are recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Valuations of the schemes are made by qualified actuaries using market based valuations for the assets and the projected unit method for 
the liabilities. The Group recognises all actuarial gains or losses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and liabilities in each territory have been calculated using the following principal

(D) Share award schemes
The c ompany operates three principal share award schemes which are designed to link remuneration to the future performance of the Group. 
The schemes are the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme (DABS) and the Deferred Annual Bonus l ong-Term 
Incentive Scheme (DABl IS). All shares under these schemes involve both service and performance conditions and are awarded at nil cost to 
participants.
The DABl IS scheme is described below and the other two schemes are described in the Remuneration Report along with the relevant vesting 
criteria.
At 30 September 2013, the shares allocated and outstanding in respect of ordinary shares, were as follows:

The number of share awards at the beginning and end of the year is as follows:

Outstanding at the beginning of the year – excluding deferred shares 28,249,566 26,346,949

Reclassified as share appreciation rights – (219,552)
Exercised during the year (5,076,118) (5,882,575)
Granted during the year 7,799,568 12,789,239
Outstanding at the end of the year – excluding deferred shares 27,126,085 28,249,566
In addition to the above shares, there are 3,118,873 (2012: 2,491,300) deferred shares outstanding in relation to the Deferred Annual Bonus 
Scheme. These are due to vest between 6 December 2013 and 6 December 2015.
In respect of the Deferred Annual Bonus l ong-Term Incentive Scheme there are an additional 4,465,568 (2012: 4,406,287) deferred shares. 
These are due to vest between 6 December 2013 and 6 December 2015. 
No material awards have been made to date under the Group’s HMRc approved Share Incentive Plan which is an all-employee share plan. 
The fair value of services received in return for shares awarded during the year is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded. 
The fair value at the date the shares were awarded has been estimated using a binomial methodology for all schemes except where there is a 
market-based performance condition attached to vesting, in which case a Monte c arlo simulation was used. The principal assumptions required  
by these methodologies were: 
2013 2012
Information relating to fair values of shares awarded
Fair value at measurement date £1.45-£2.45 £0.85-£1.46
Share price £2.84 £1.66
Expected volatility 35.5% 36.1%
Award life 3 years 3 years
Expected dividends 4.94% 4.47%
Risk free interest rate 0.42% 0.54%
Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to vesting. Expected volatility is based on historic volatility adjusted for changes to future volatility 
indicated by publicly available information. Shares were awarded under a service condition.

c ertain participants (other than Board Directors) are eligible to receive their awards on a cash settled basis, the calculation of which exactly 
replicates the formal share-based scheme. 
Deferred annual Bonus l ong-Term Incentive Scheme
The Deferred Annual Bonus l ong-Term Incentive Scheme (DABl IS) is for participants below the GMB level and requires a 25% deferral of any 
annual performance bonus award into shares. Matching shares may also be awarded up to four times the deferred amount and are subject to the 
achievement of stretching performance conditions over a three year period. Awards of deferred and matching shares are subject to forfeiture 
conditions until the release date. The earliest point at which the shares are eligible for release is at the end of three years following deferral. 
For awards of matching shares made during the year, no shares will vest unless the annual average of the ratio of the Group’s return on invested 
capital (ROIc ) to the weighted average cost of capital (wAcc ) meets or exceeds one over the three year period. A hurdle of ROIc , being at least 
equal to wAcc , is used to ensure that the relevant long term incentive awards pay out only when shareholder value is being created over the 
performance periods. If the ROIC/WACC hurdle is met, shares will only vest to the extent to which three further performance conditions are 
satisfied over the three year period as follows:
• Up to half of the matching shares will vest based on achievement of an aggregate EBITA profit target for the participants’ Sector over the three 
year performance period.

been reflected in the current year income statement tax charge.
(ii) Reconciliation of effective tax rate
The total tax charge (2012: charge) for the year is higher (2012: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.5% (2012: 25%). 
The differences are explained below:

The underlying effective rate of taxation for the year ended 30 September 2013 is calculated based on the underlying profit before tax 
(excluding separately disclosed items, acquisition related expenses and impairment charges) and is calculated at 27%. The actual tax rate of  
72% differs from the underlying effective tax rate primarily due to the tax effect of the non-recognition of tax losses in France and goodwill 
impairment charges of £188m on which no tax deduction is available.

(iv) Factors affecting future tax charge
A) At the balance sheet date, the Finance Act 2013 had been enacted confirming that the main UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21% with 
effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. Therefore, at 30 September 2013, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated 
based on a rate of 20% where the temporary difference is expected to reverse after 1 April 2015. These reductions may also reduce the 
c ompany’s future current tax charges accordingly.
B) During 2012, the German tax authorities issued new guidance on how certain items of expenditure should be treated for the purposes of 
German trade tax. In 2013 the German tax authorities provided some additional clarification and informed the Group that, in their opinion, the 
guidance is applicable to tour operating activities in Germany. The Group continues to disagree with this interpretation. It is possible that the  
issue will have to be litigated through the German tax courts and it could take a considerable amount of time to bring it to a resolution.
It is difficult to estimate accurately the potential liability should the German tax authorities challenge successfully the Group’s interpretation of  
the guidance, due to the differing nature of the contracts which could be impacted by any such challenge. As a result there is a range of possible 
outcomes. If the Group is successful in its arguments there would be no exposure. However, it is possible that the liability over the previous six 
years (2012: five years) could be up to a total of approximately £80m (2012: £64m), although the Group believes that German trade tax law should 
not apply to standard tour operating contracts and that any liability would be substantially less than this.
C) Other factors which may affect the future tax charge include the mix of jurisdictions with different tax rates in which profits and losses arise, 
changes in tax rates and the potential future recognition of tax losses for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised at the year end 
(Note 14).
(v) Spanish tax case
In the Group’s financial statements for 2010, 2011 and 2012, it was disclosed that the Spanish tax authorities were contesting the Spanish 
corporate income tax treatment of two transactions undertaken by two of the Group’s Spanish subsidiary companies during the period 2002 to 
2006. Throughout the tax audit process, the Group has engaged fully and openly with the Spanish tax authorities and has supplied considerable 
documentary support and Spanish technical tax analysis to explain the commercial and economic rationale and Spanish corporate income tax 
treatment for the transactions. These transactions were implemented after the Group had taken specialist external advice.
On 11 October 2013 agreement was reached on the terms of a settlement with the Spanish tax authorities. The total of tax, interest and penalties 
is €50m. The disputed tax of €30m has been lodged with the authorities in earlier financial years whilst the case was progressing, meaning that 
the settlement involves a further payment of interest and penalties totalling €20m. The tax (€30m) and interest (€5m) amounts have been 
provided in previous years within tax charges and financial expenses respectively, whilst the penalties of €15m (£13m) have been accrued within 
administrative expenses in the year ended 30 September 2013 and included within separately disclosed items (Note 4).

The interim dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2013 of 3.75p per share was paid on 4 October 2013 and this dividend of £42m 
will be recognised as a deduction from equity in the year ending 30 September 2014.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Directors have proposed a final dividend of 9.75p per share (2012: final dividend of 8.3p per share) 
payable on 9 April 2014 to the holders of relevant shares on the register at 7 March 2014. The final proposed dividend amounts to £108m and will, 
after approval by shareholders, be recognised in the consolidated financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2014. The final ordinary 
dividend of 9.75p per share, together with the interim dividend of 3.75p per share, makes a total dividend of 13.5p per share relating to  
the year ended 30 September 2013. 
A dividend reinvestment plan is in operation. Those shareholders who have not elected to participate in this plan, and who would like to participate 
with respect to the 2013 final dividend, may do so by contacting Equiniti directly on 0871 384 2030 or via the overseas helpline on +44 121 415 
7047. The last day for election for the final proposed dividend is 19 March 2014 and any requests should be made in good time ahead of that date.

Additions to computer software and software in development totalling £101m includes costs relating to major IT development projects across  
all Sectors within the Group, including the implementation of SAP across certain Mainstream Sectors and the development of digital solution 
platforms for our customers.
Goodwill impairment charges are discussed below. A £2m impairment charge to brands has been recognised in the year following the decision  
to close one small business within the UK & Ireland. A £9m impairment charge to computer software and software in development has been 
recognised following a decision to streamline certain IT infrastructure projects and reservation systems within the Group, in light of the Group’s  
IT projects mentioned above. The impairment charge to computer software and software in development is included within cost of sales.
Disposals of computer software during the year with a net value of £4m follows an extensive verification exercise undertaken by the Group  
to write out of the books fully depreciated and unutilised software assets in preparation for the Group’s major IT development projects. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised within cost of sales in the consolidated income statement. Amortisation of business combination 
and other intangibles combined with depreciation of property, plant and equipment is disclosed by segment in Note 3.

In 2011, the Group established a Pension Funding Partnership arrangement (PFP). The main operating brands of the UK business, namely 
Thomson and First Choice, were sold into the PFP and three UK pension schemes subscribed for interests in the PFP . The recognition of the two 
brand assets in the Group financial statements remains unaffected by the establishment of the PFP, although the Thomson and First Choice 
brands, the latter of which is recognised on the Group balance sheet at a value of £94m (2012: £101m), are now being held as security for the PFP .

The First Choice and Marmara brands are major brands of the UK & Ireland and French businesses respectively and have a remaining 
amortisation period of 14 years (2012: 15 years). The customer relationships within the Accommodation & Destinations (Accommodation 
w holesaler) Sector are in respect of commercial contractual relationships with travel agents and have a remaining amortisation period of 9 years 
(2012: 10 years). The landing slots are in respect of the UK & Ireland business for airports in the UK and have a remaining amortisation period  
of 14 years (2012: 15 years). 
Goodwill impairment testing
IAS 36 requires that impairment tests are carried out on CGUs, following the level at which the Group’s management measures returns on 
operations. Once every year, or more frequently if events or a change in the economic environment indicate a risk of impairment, the Group 
assesses the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to its CGUs as required by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’. The recoverable value of goodwill 
for all CGUs has been determined to be ‘value in use’. 
The calculation of recoverable value for CGUs based on value in use includes the following assumptions:
• Cash flow projections based on the Group’s latest Board approved three year business plan, which management has extended by two years  
to create a five year plan.
• Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a real growth rate of between 1.0% and 3.9% (2012: between 1.0% and 3.9%).  
The growth rate used is less than or equal to third party estimates of the medium term GDP growth rates of the key geographic markets  
in which the specific CGU operates at the time the projections are prepared. 
• Cash flows are discounted using the Group’s WACC adjusted as appropriate for business specific factors, such as geographic risk. 
• Cash flows exclude planned enhancement capital expenditure, together with the associated benefit that the expenditure is expected  
to produce.
• Cash flows include the impact of working capital in both the asset base and the impact on cash flows over the plan period.
• Central Group overheads are borne in full by CGUs and are allocated pro rata to the CGU’s underlying operating profit. 
Assumptions used in the five year plan take past experience into account with CGU specific and central contingencies in the five year plan being 
allocated to all CGUs. 
Since determination of an appropriate Group wACC is judgemental, sensitivities also address how increases in the base Group wACC might impact 
the results of the impairment tests. The Group’s wACC is based on a capital asset pricing model calculation using a mixture of in-house data and 
externally available information.
An analysis of the aggregate and material carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each principal CGU, together with the growth rates being 
applied to cash flows beyond the plan period and the pre-tax discount rates used for each CGU or group of similar CGUs is as follows:

Goodwill impairment charges
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is estimated to be less than the total of its operating non-current assets, goodwill and other intangibles, an 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets on a pro rata basis. The total impairment loss recognised in the year of £188m is equal 
to the difference between the net book values and the recoverable amounts and is analysed as follows:

Goodwill impairment charge arising from the annual impairment test 178
Goodwill impairment charge recognised on closure of businesses 10
t otal goodwill impairment charges recognised in the year 188
All of the impairment charges arising from the Group’s annual impairment test, which total £178m, have arisen as a result of a deterioration in 
forecast trading results within the five year plans, relative to the prior year. The impairment test for all of these CGUs was based on the value  
in use calculation. The impairment charges are disclosed within administrative expenses and shown separately on the face of the consolidated 
income statement. The impairments arise since the cash flow model based on the current five year plan did not support the carrying amount  
of goodwill for these CGUs. 
A further £10m goodwill impairment was recognised in the first half of the financial year in respect of two small businesses within the Specialist  
& Activity Sector that were identified as non-core to the Group, which are in the process of being closed, thereby providing an indication that the 
goodwill attached to those businesses is no longer supportable. As such, the goodwill relating to these businesses has been fully impaired.
All CGUs for which an impairment charge has been recognised are tour operating businesses. The CGUs within the Mainstream Sector represent 
the source geographical markets. The Sport CGU within Specialist & Activity Sector specialises in the sports tour market for spectator and 
corporate clients whilst the two Education CGUs offer specially designed travel packages for schools and universities, including educational tours, 
student ski trips, adventure holidays and language courses. In 2012, the Education division was considered to be one CGU incorporating both 
experience education and North American education. During the current year, the UK based experience education businesses have been 
separated from the North American education businesses following a restructure in the operational management and separation of the day-to-
day running and internal reporting of these businesses as from 1 October 2012. As such these businesses are considered to be two separate CGUs 
and their assets have been tested on this basis.
s ensitivity analysis for goodwill
The calculation of recoverable amount is particularly sensitive to forecast future earnings, the discount rate and the long term growth rate. The 
Directors have considered the separate impacts of: i) increasing WACC by 0.5%; ii) a reduction in underlying earnings of 5% across all years; and 
iii) a reduction in the long term percentage growth rate beyond the five year plan to nil as being reasonably possible changes.

Sh Areh OLDer INFOr MATION
In respect of Accommodation OTA, the recoverable amount equals the carrying amount and therefore any change to an assumption used in  
the test will cause an impairment. For the r ussian CGU, the recoverable amount would equal the carrying amount if, independently, the wACC 
increases by 0.25%, underlying earnings fall by 1% or the long term growth rate used falls from 3.75% to 3.45%. For Adventure, a reduction  
in the long term growth rate from 2.78% to 1% would cause the recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount. 
The values for all other CGUs in the table above represent additional impairment charges that would be incurred following a reasonably possible 
change in an assumption as the goodwill in these CGUs has already been impaired. As such, for these CGUs, the remaining carrying amount equals 
the recoverable amount.
The sensitivities disclosed immediately above do not take account of any mitigating action that management would take should earnings decrease. 
No other material impairments to goodwill or assets would arise following these reasonably possible changes in these key assumptions. 
Based on all of the calculations undertaken, the Directors consider that the recoverable amount of goodwill in each CGU is at least equal to its 
current carrying value.

Impairment charges
Of the £3m impairment charge in the year ended 30 September 2013, £1m relates to the impairment of an aircraft engine owned within the 
Belgium operating segment, £1m relates to the impairment of an aircraft engine owned within the UK & Ireland operating segment and £1m 
relates to the impairment of buildings owned within the UK & Ireland operating segment. The impairment charges are included within cost of 
sales.
Of the £12m impairment charge in the year ended 30 September 2012, £6m related to the impairment of one aircraft owned within the UK  
& Ireland operating segment, £5m related to the impairment of motor vehicles within the Specialist & Activity Sector and £1m related to the 
impairment of office leasehold improvements within the French tour operating segment. 
Additions to aircraft and equipment
Additions of £187m (2012: £109m) to aircraft and equipment relate to five aircraft (2012: three aircraft) purchased during the year including  
four aircraft (2012: three aircraft) purchased on finance leases as well as fleet improvements and capitalised maintenance on owned aircraft.
Advance payments for future delivery of aircraft
Additions of £140m (2012: £133m) to advance payments for future delivery of aircraft were due to payments made for the future delivery  
of 76 aircraft (2012: 16 aircraft) and interest of £8m (2012: £9m) that has been capitalised during the year at a rate of 5.4% (2012: 5.4%). 
The disposal of £136m (2012: £80m) from advance payments for future delivery of aircraft arises from the delivery and then sale and leaseback  
of 13 aircraft (2012: eight aircraft).
During the year advance payments for future delivery of aircraft with a value of £8m were transferred to assets held for sale prior to their 
subsequent disposal. 
Disposals
In addition to the disposal of £136m advance payments for future delivery of aircraft, other major disposals in the year consisted of £18m of net 
book value of aircraft of which the most significant element was two 747s operated by Corsair that were disposed of during the year, and £14m of 
disposals of other equipment of which the most significant element related to buyer furnished equipment on aircraft that were delivered and then 
subject to sale and operating lease back. 
Significant cost and accumulated depreciation across all property, plant and equipment categories were also disposed of during the year, with little 
impact on net book value, due to an exercise performed by the UK & Ireland operating segment to identify and retire unutilised assets, most of 
which were already fully depreciated.
Other disclosures
Other equipment with a combined net book value as at 30 September 2013 of £174m (2012: £163m) includes £94m (2012: £101m) of fixtures  
and fittings, £55m (2012: £42m) of property, plant and equipment under construction and £23m (2012: £20m) of motor vehicles.
Land and buildings comprise freehold and long leasehold properties with net book values of £116m (2012: £120m) and short leasehold properties 
with a net book value of £50m (2012: £51m) respectively.
The net book value of assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 30 September 2013 was £315m (2012: £224m). This 
includes £89m (2012: £94m) of yachts, motor boats and cruise ships, £210m (2012: £115m) of aircraft, £6m (2012: £6m) of land and buildings  
and £10m (2012: £9m) of other assets, mainly vehicles.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment with restrictions on title, being pledged as security for bank loans, amounted to £161m 
(2012: £32m).

holding company, owned 51% by SGCM and 49% by the Group. The joint venture owns four subsidiary tour operators and travel agency groups  
in Russia and Ukraine. All major decisions have to be agreed by both shareholders and under IAS 31 ‘Interests in joint ventures’ the entity is 
therefore accounted for as a joint venture.
SGCM is owned by a significant shareholder of TUI AG and is therefore considered to be a related party. Togebi Holdings Limited and its 
subsidiary undertakings are therefore considered to be related parties by virtue of SGCM being the joint venturer to this investment.
Details of loan and other balances with Togebi Holdings Limited and its subsidiary undertakings are disclosed in Note 31.

During the year the Group revalued its 14.3% shareholding in The Airline Group Limited (which in turn has a 42% shareholding in NATS Holdings 
Limited) upwards by £5m to fair value through profit and loss with the credit being included in separately disclosed items (Note 4). The basis of 
valuation was the offer received during the year for the majority of this investment. In view of the impending disposal of 87.4% of this investment, 
the element being disposed of has been reclassified as a current asset investment. Further disclosure regarding the valuation of The Airline Group 
Limited is provided in Note 26 (H).
The remaining trade and listed investments at 30 September 2013 represented the Group’s 4.4% (2012: 4.4%) shareholding in Air Berlin PLC and  
a 10% (2012: 10%) holding in the Atlantica Leisure Group Limited. 
The Group’s investment in Air Berlin PLC is carried at fair value, determined by reference to its equity share price at the balance sheet date. 
Non-consolidated entities are recorded at cost and reflect the Group’s net investment held in circa 50 subsidiaries which, due to the immaterial 
size of their revenues, result and financial position, have not been consolidated. Balances between these entities and consolidated subsidiaries 
have not been eliminated.
13. Business combinations
(A) Acquisitions in the year ended 30 September 2013
Acquisitions were made in the year for a total investment value of £30m in order to expand business operations in line with the Group’s growth 
strategy. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 (revised), incidental acquisition costs of £2m have been expensed within administrative 
expenses (and disclosed as an acquisition related expense) in the consolidated income statement in the year. These acquisitions gave rise to 
provisional goodwill of £24m. The one significant business acquired in the year was the remaining 50.1% of the voting equity shares of TUI Infotec 
GmbH (‘Infotec’) that the Group did not already own, this business being reported as an associate in the year ended 30 September 2012.

Other individually insignificant businesses acquired during the year include nine European-based travel agency businesses and the entire share 
capital of JBS Group, Inc, Isango! Limited and TT Visa Services Pte. Limited.
The relative size of the acquisitions made is set out in the table below:

The total consideration for these acquisitions of £30m comprised £12m of initial cash consideration, £5m of deferred consideration, £4m of 
contingent consideration and £9m of non-cash consideration for the Group’s share of Infotec that it previously owned.

All acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method, as required by IFRS 3 (revised). Certain non-significant fair value adjustments 
have necessarily been prepared on a provisional basis due to the recent timing of certain acquisitions. Experience may result in revisions to fair 
values in the subsequent accounting period. No material amount of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. There are no material 
accounting policy adjustments nor any significant differences between the book and fair values of assets and liabilities acquired. No single 
acquisition in the current year is considered material to goodwill and, as such, the provisional net asset table shown above has been presented as  
a total for all acquisitions in the year.

Residual goodwill
A consistent process is undertaken for each acquisition to identify the fair value of separable assets and liabilities acquired, including the fair value 
of intangible assets, such as brands, order books, licences, customer relationships and other intangible assets that may exist. The residual goodwill 
on acquisition represents the value of assets and earnings that do not form separable assets under IFRS 3 (revised) but nevertheless are expected 
to contribute to the future results of the Group.
Residual goodwill in respect of current year acquisitions predominantly relates to the acquisition of Infotec and represents the ability to control 
fully that business with a view to drive cost reduction and economies of scale in the Group’s IT infrastructure.
Acquisition related expenses
IFRS 3 (revised) requires consideration that is contingent on future service by the vendor to be expensed over the service period and acquisition 
costs to be expensed as incurred. In this respect, £8m (2012: £3m) has been expensed in the year and included in the acquisition related expenses 
in the consolidated income statement.

Contingent consideration payable is dependent on the results of the businesses over a number of future periods and in some cases is also 
dependent upon the previous owners or management of those businesses remaining in employment with the Group during the earn out period.
No adjustments to amounts recognised in respect of prior year acquisitions have been made during the year. This follows the latest assessment  
of expected earnings figures for these acquired entities, with the consideration payable being based upon a multiple of the appropriate earnings 
figures. 
An estimate of the range of undiscounted amounts of contingent consideration payable for acquisitions in the current year and in prior years, 
where the consideration remains payable, is listed below. The amounts payable will be dependent on the results of the acquired businesses over

If the results of the acquired businesses had been included in these consolidated financial statements from 1 October 2012 until each of their 
respective acquisition dates, the Group‘s revenue would have been approximately £7m higher. There would have been no significant impact  
on the Group’s results after adjusting for amortisation of business combination intangibles had those intangible assets been recognised since  
1 October 2012.
Since the respective acquisition dates, the acquired businesses contributed revenues of £26m, underlying earnings of £2m and loss after tax 
(including the amortisation of business combination intangibles) of £1m.
(D) Prior period revisions to fair values
In the year ended 30 September 2012, the Group acquired various businesses for a total consideration of £16m. The finalisation of the acquisition 
balance sheets for these businesses has not led to a material adjustment to goodwill presented in the 2012 accounts and therefore there is no 
restatement of the results for the year ended 30 September 2012, or balance sheet as at 30 September 2012 in respect of these finalisations.

c apital losses 3 2
Other tax losses 267 259

These assets have not been recognised principally because the Directors are not certain of the timing of any benefits that might arise in the 
future. Other tax losses are primarily trading losses and include £6m which are subject to a four year expiry period. The balance of losses are not 
subject to time expiry and are available for utilisation against profits arising in future periods in the territories in which they have arisen. There are 
no other unprovided deferred tax liabilities nor unrecognised deferred tax assets.

Intangible asset temporary differences arise in respect of assets recognised on acquisition. Property, plant and equipment temporary differences 
principally relate to tax depreciation in the UK, France and Germany. Employee benefits temporary differences arise in respect of defined benefit 
pension scheme liabilities and future deductions available on the vesting of employee awards. Financial instruments and foreign exchange 
temporary differences arise in respect of financial instruments accounted for under IAS 39 and principally reflect the fair value at 30 September 
2013 of cash flow hedging derivatives that will be settled against future transactions. Other short term temporary differences relate to operating 
expenses and related accruals and provisions for which a tax deduction has not yet been recognised.

No individually material bad debt provision movements or charges have been recorded in the year. Based on past experience and the post balance 
sheet period to the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the Group considers that the provision allowance recorded is 
adequate. Within the provision there are no individually material amounts held. Trade receivables not overdue and not impaired include amounts 
due from travel agencies, tour operators and hoteliers in respect of Mainstream, Specialist & Activity and Accommodation & Destinations Sectors. 
Provisions for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed by each underlying business unit where the debts arise and are 
based on local management experience. Factors considered include the age of the receivable, previous experience with the counterparty and the 
economic environment in which the counterparty is located. 
Credit exposure to individual customers booking holidays directly is limited as full payment is required before the issue of tickets and holiday 
departure. In the case of travel services sold by third party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this 
risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit. The Directors do not consider there to be significant concentration of credit risk 
relating to trade and other receivables.

16. t rade and other receivables continued
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those 
supplies. There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during the period over which the supplies are made. 
The provision against overdue receivables of £44m (2012: £44m) relates to gross receivables of £74m (2012: £78m). 
There are £118m of receivables that are overdue and not impaired at 30 September 2013 (2012: £199m). 
Amounts owed by related parties are disclosed further in Note 31.

For the year ended 30 September 2013, cash and cash equivalents have been shown gross of specific overdraft balances within the Group’s 
pooling facilities where the Group does not currently have the intention to exercise its right to settle these particular balances simultaneously. The 
amount of cash balances presented gross of the related overdraft position is £491m. In the year ended 30 September 2012, the Group had both 
the contractual right as well as the intention to settle these balances on a net basis and therefore the related overdraft and cash balances were 
presented on a net basis. 
Cash and cash equivalents includes £47m (2012: £34m) that is not available for immediate use by the Group. This is made up of monies held to 
meet regulatory requirements, together with cash balances on short term deposits, held on a restricted basis by the Group’s captive insurance 
funds as part of their ongoing operations.
In addition to the above restricted cash balance, the Group is involved in a long-running VAT case with the Belgian government. During the current 
financial year a total of £98m has been received from the Belgian government in relation to the disputed VAT for the years up to and including 
30 September 2011, to stop the interest charge from accumulating should they lose the case eventually. The outcome of the case remains 
uncertain and is not expected to be finalised in the near future. Given the uncertainty, the Group continues to accrue VAT payable on the existing 
basis. If the Group were to win the legal case, the amount recovered would be subject to corporation tax in Belgium. This money is currently held 
on a bank deposit account in order that a collateralised bank guarantee can be provided to the Belgian government for the duration of the legal 
proceedings to give them assurance that they will be paid the money back should they win the case. This receipt is shown in the consolidated 
statement of cash flows as the item fulfils the IAS 7 criteria for cash and cash equivalents and therefore the balance is included in cash and cash 
equivalents. In view of the guarantee provided to the Belgian government, the Group’s ability to use this cash is restricted.

For the year ended 30 September 2013, bank overdrafts have been shown gross of specific cash balances within the Group’s pooling facilities 
where the Group does not currently have the intention to exercise its right to settle these particular balances simultaneously. The amount of bank 
overdrafts presented gross of the related cash position is £491m. In the year ended 30 September 2012, the Group had both the contractual right 
as well as the intention to settle these balances on a net basis and therefore the related overdraft and cash balances were presented on a net 
basis.
Other financial liabilities mainly comprise the fair value of two put options written by the Group to the sole remaining non-controlling interest 
shareholder in L’TUR Tourismus AG that may require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest shareholding totalling 30%. The first put 
option over 20% of the shares may be exercised at any time until 2015. A second put option written by the Group to the same non-controlling 
interest shareholder for the remaining 10% shareholding has no time limit. Details of the fair value of these options are included in Note 26(H).
Fair value changes in the put option liability are included within financial expenses or financial income.

The Group has two convertible bonds in issue, details of which are as follows:
• A £350m fixed rate 6% bond was issued in October 2009 raising £341m net of issue costs. The bond is convertible at the option of the holder, 
before or upon maturity in October 2014. Conversion into ordinary shares will occur at a premium of 33% to the Group’s share price on the date 
of issuance.
• A £400m fixed rate 4.9% bond was issued in April 2010 raising £391m net of issue costs. The bond is convertible at the option of the holder, 
before or upon maturity in April 2017. Conversion into ordinary shares will occur at a premium of 33% to the Group’s share price on the date  
of issuance.
The Group holds an Issuer call option to redeem the convertible bonds at their principal amounts, together with accrued interest, upon fulfilment 
of certain pre-determined criteria. The fair value of this option was negligible at 30 September 2013. The equity portion of the bonds of £114m 
(2012: £114m), gross of deferred tax of £23m (2012: £26m), is included in the convertible bond reserve.

Aircraft maintenance
In respect of aircraft, provision is made for maintenance, overhaul and repair costs of operating leased airframes, engines and certain other 
components based on the anticipated external costs of the next maintenance event calculated by reference to costs experienced and published 
manufacturers’ data. The charge to the consolidated income statement is calculated by reference to the number of hours and cycles flown and  
by reference to the length of the full overhaul cycle. Costs incurred are charged against the provision. Neither the timing nor the value of the 
expenditure can be precisely determined but they can be averaged over time and over the number of aircraft in the fleet.
The provision is expected to be utilised within 12 years of the balance sheet date depending upon the timing of maintenance events or end of 
lease dates where compensation is payable.
Restructuring
Restructuring, which includes severance payments, relates to provisions arising as a result of reorganisation and restructuring plans that are 
irrevocably committed. Further details of significant restructuring projects in the current year are set out in Note 4.
The provision is expected to be utilised within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
Other
Other provisions relate to litigation, obligations under denied boarding compensation regulations, onerous lease contracts that have been entered 
into in the ordinary course of business and other future obligations, the amount or timing of which is uncertain. A significant portion of the 
provision is anticipated to be utilised within 12 months of the balance sheet date, while the remainder is expected to be utilised within one to four 
years of the balance sheet date, although the timing and payments related to individual litigation claims are estimated and are inherently 
uncertain.
The Group has a policy to mitigate the financial risk of litigation and disaster through insurance with third party providers and the use of captive 
insurance companies. The Group’s exposure to risk is capped by single event and aggregate limits, with insurance in place for exposures above 
these limits. 
The Group provides for outstanding claims, including settlement expenses, using a consistent methodology based upon historical claims patterns, 
average claims amounts, external legal advice and future expectations.

26. Financial instruments
(A) Treasury risk overview
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks:
• Market risk (in respect of foreign currency rate risk, jet fuel price risk and interest rate risk);
• Liquidity risk (in respect of the Group’s ability to meet its liabilities); 
• Credit risk (in respect of recovery of amounts owing to the Group); and
• Capital risk (in respect of its capital structure and cost of capital).
The Group’s key financial market risks are in relation to foreign currency rates and jet fuel prices. Currency risk results from the substantial 
cross-border element of the Group’s trading and arises on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currencies of individual Group businesses. The risk is managed by the use of foreign exchange forward, swap and option contracts.  
The Group’s exposure to jet fuel prices results from the aircraft fleet operations and is managed using commodity swaps and options.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk that arises principally from the Group’s floating rate aircraft leases and floating rate bank loans and cash 
balances. Certain finance leases and loans have fixed interest rates.
Credit risk and liquidity risk are considered in Notes 26(D) and 26(F) respectively. Capital management, including capital risk and cash 
conversion, is considered in Notes 34 and 27(B) respectively.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework and for ensuring 
that the Group has adequate policies, procedures and controls to successfully manage the financial risks that it faces. These form part of the 
Group’s overall Risk Management Framework (the framework). 
Incorporated within the framework’s terms of reference are the determination of all treasury policies and the monitoring of the effectiveness 
of those policies. g roup Treasury implements the agreed policies on a day-to-day basis. The procedures also stipulate the levels of authority 
applied to approving and to dealing the types of hedging financial instrument used to manage these exposures. Transactions are only undertaken 
to hedge underlying exposures. Financial instruments are not traded, nor are speculative positions taken.
The treasury position of the Group, including liquidity, foreign exchange and fuel hedging exposure, is managed centrally in accordance with 
policies appropriate to cover specific risks faced by each business unit and is the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer.
Group Treasury conducts regular reviews of financial risks with business unit management teams and receives regular cash flow forecasts and, 
where relevant, jet fuel usage forecasts from each business unit to ensure hedging instruments match the currency or fuel requirements of each 
operating business. Reports and forecasts for the Group, showing hedging instruments and forecast requirements, are submitted monthly to the 
g MB and to each Board meeting of Tui Travel Pl C.
In line with its established policy, the Group has monitored throughout the year its counterparty exposure with individual financial institutions. 
Such counterparty risk can arise by way of cash deposited or derivative instruments traded.
(B) Currency risk management
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies 
of individual Group businesses (which are principally Sterling, US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona). 
The Group hedges its foreign currency exposures on a seasonal basis, that is Winter and Summer, with each season comprising a six-month period. 
At the start of a season the Group will have hedged substantially all of its foreign currency exposure (forecast sales and purchases and related 
assets and liabilities) for that season, using predominantly forward exchange contracts and option based instruments, most with a maturity of less 
than one year from the reporting date. 
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an 
acceptable level, principally by using forward contracts in respect of non-Sterling denominated airline maintenance provision balances, loan 
balances and deposits.
The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and, as a result, it is also subject to foreign currency exchange translation risk 
in respect of the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into Sterling.
The following significant exchange rates to the Group’s Sterling presentation currency (excluding the impact of hedged transactions) are illustrative 
of the rates applied during the current and prior year:

w inter 2014 principally relating to w inter 2013 and Summer 2014.

(C) Commodity risk
Fuel commodity risk arises from the Group’s operation of aircraft.
The Group hedges its fuel commodity exposures on a seasonal basis, being Winter and Summer, with each season comprising a six-month period. 
At the start of a season the Group will have hedged substantially all of its fuel commodity exposure for that season, using predominantly 
commodity swaps or options, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. 
As at 30 September 2013, the Group has hedged transactions for fuel of 1.7m metric tonnes (2012: 2.0m metric tonnes) for periods up until 
w inter 2014. 
Details of fuel forward derivative instruments are set out in Note 26(I).
(D) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises 
from cash balances (including bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents) and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to 
customers, including outstanding receivables, financial guarantees and committed transactions. Credit risk is managed separately for treasury and 
operating related credit exposures. 
The Group minimises its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the Board. While 
counterparties are limited to major banks and financial institutions, Group policy ensures that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and 
that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk. The only exception to this at 30 September 2013 was the £98m received from the 
Belgian government in relation to the long running VAT case (Note 17). This money is currently deposited with one financial institution to enable  
a collateralised bank guarantee to be provided to the Belgian government. The Group monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties (where 
applicable) as part of its ongoing assessment of its credit exposure. Material financial instruments are only transacted with major financial 
institutions with a strong credit rating of A1/P1 or A2/P2. 
Loans and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate 
for the customer. There is no material concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables as the Group has a large number of 
internationally dispersed customers. 
The maximum credit exposure to the carrying amount of financial assets at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for total trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date and by geographic region as well as their 
ageing is disclosed in Note 16. Trade and other receivables are shown net of provision for bad and doubtful debts of £49m (2012: £49m).
Cash, cash equivalents and other investments principally comprise money market deposits and other short term investments. The investments 
are predominantly with counterparties with a strong credit rating of A1/P1 or A2/P2. At 30 September 2013, approximately 42% (2012: 27%) of 
the Group’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were invested with counterparties based in the United Kingdom, and 38% (2012: 53%) were 
based with counterparties based in the Republic of Ireland. 
Trade and other receivables exclude prepaid accommodation and other prepayments which do not meet the definition of a financial instrument. 
Prepayments for hotel accommodation, whilst not meeting the definition of a financial asset under IAS 39, give rise to a risk sim ilar to credit 
risk due to the inherent risk of the Group not recovering the prepayment through full delivery of the related goods and services. From time  
to time prepayments can concentrate risk with specific counterparties which are based overseas. The carrying amount of prepayments  
(which are presented within current and non-current assets) forms their maximum credit exposure, before taking into account any security  
or collateral held by the g roup. w here appropriate, the g roup obtains security collateral over the related accommodation property to mitigate 
credit risk. At 30 September 2013, prepaid accommodation which is recoverable after more than one year was £108m (2012: £122m).

(E) Interest rate risk
The Group manages interest rate risk by fixing interest rates for the majority of the Group’s longer term debt. Variable interest generally applies to 
shorter term debt and that which fluctuates with working capital flows. Variable rate interest on pooled bank overdrafts is offset by similar credit 
interest on cash held elsewhere in the currency pools. The Group has exposure to interest rate risk arising principally on Sterling, US Dollar, and 
Euro floating interest rates that are attached to the Group’s floating rate aircraft leases and floating rate bank loans and cash balances.
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. 
The Group’s loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost with the exception of the other financial liabilities which are carried at fair value 
as follows:

The interest rate applicable to bank overdrafts above is the amount charged in respect of the balance shown. Any balances offsetting this in the 
Group’s pooling arrangements are credited at a similar rate to the entities concerned.
(F) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach is to ensure that  
it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed circumstances. 
The Group’s liquidity peaks in July and August, during the European summer holiday season, with the liquidity low point being in December and 
January. To manage the liquidity position the Group is able to draw cash advances under its existing bank facilities which, at 30 September 2013, 
principally comprised the following main sources of long term debt funding:
• The external bank revolving credit facilities totalling £1,120m (2012: £970m) plus bonding and letter of credit facilities totalling £185m 
(2012: £185m) which all mature in June 2015. From these facilities, £136m has been utilised for letter of credit purposes at 30 September 2013 
(2012: £162m);
• A £350m convertible bond (due October 2014) issued in October 2009; 
• A £400m convertible bond (due April 2017) issued in April 2010; and
• A £300m bank syndicated facility which matures in April 2016 and which is only available in the event of a requirement to redeem the Group’s 
convertible bonds.
The external bank revolving credit facility is used to manage the seasonality of the Group’s cash flows and liquidity. Cash positions, liquidity  
and available facility headroom are monitored daily by the Group Treasury Department.
The Board remains satisfied with the Group’s funding and liquidity position. Fixed charges cover and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, which the 
Board believes to be the most useful measures of cash generation and gearing, as well as being the main basis for covenants in the external credit 
facilities, were met at the year end and throughout the year. Fixed charges cover is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and operating lease rentals charge (EBITDAR) divided by net interest plus operating lease rentals. EBITDA is defined as earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Both covenants are measured on an ‘underlying basis’ as defined in Note 1(B)(ii).
In respect of the delivery of new aircraft, the Group’s established strategy is to refinance new aircraft in advance of their delivery dates and 
therefore the Group does not forecast to use internal cash resources for new aircraft purchases. Details of aircraft purchase commitments at the 
year end are given in Note 29.

The timing reflected in the tables above is based on the first date that the Group can be contractually required to settle the liability. In respect of 
revolving credit facilities, the timing of repayments will vary. 
Trade and other payables exclude customers’ monies received in advance, deferred income, contingent consideration and other non-contractual 
payables.
At 30 September 2013, the Group had available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £1,192m (2012: £1,018m), comprising letters of credit, 
guarantees and revolving, floating rate credit facilities for cash borrowings. Any non-compliance with covenants underlying the Group’s financing 
arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements. The Group was in full compliance with its 
financial covenants throughout both years.

The basis for fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities is set out in Note 1(W).
Fair value measurements
IFRS 7 requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements of financial instruments through the use of a three level fair value hierarchy 
that prioritises the valuation techniques used in fair value calculations.
The levels can be broadly described as follows:
• Level 1 – use of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2 – use of observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  
in active markets
• Level 3 – use of inputs not ba sed on observable market data but reflecting management’s own assumptions about pricing the asset or liability.
The g roup maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the most relevant data available. if there are multiple inputs available that 
fall into different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the lowest level input.

Trade and listed investments
As at 30 September 2013, £42m (2012: £36m) of trade and other investments were categorised as level 3 instruments. These consist of the 
Group’s £35m (2012: £30m) investment in The Airline Group Limited and other trade investments in the equity of unlisted companies of 
£7m (2012: £6m). Of the £35m in respect of The Airline Group Limited, £30m (2012: £nil) is disclosed as an other investment in current assets 
(Note 18) and £5m (2012: £30m ) is disclosed as an other investment in non current assets (Note 12). 
The Group’s investment in The Airline Group Limited is valued using the offer received during 2013 for the majority of the investment, the 
conditional disposal for which was agreed post year end and announced on 19 November 2013. In the absence of any robust market valuation, in 
2012, the investment was valued by a third party using a discounted cash flow methodology. The key assumptions included estimates of future 
operating results and the level of future contributions to its pension schemes, the latter of which was a key uncertainty in the valuation.
The level 1 trade investment mainly consists of the Group’s holding in Air Berlin PLC. See Note 12 for further details of this investment.
Derivative assets and liabilities
Derivatives are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate inputs at level 2, such as interest rates 
and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are used in the discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instrument’s term, 
notional amount, volatility, discount rate and taking credit risk into account. As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in external 
markets, these instruments are categorised as level 2 in the hierarchy.

Other financial liabilities
The principal element of the put options to acquire the remaining equity stake in L’TUR Tourismus AG (£38m) (2012: £38m) are classified as an 
other financial liability with changes in fair value included in operating profit. They have been valued using the minimum price stipulated in the 
contracts plus adjustments based on estimated operating results in the three years preceding any exercise of the options. Contingent 
consideration of £7m is also measured at fair value based on the relevant contracts. 
There are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions which would materially alter the value of these level 3 financial instruments.
(I) Derivative instruments

Ineffectiveness
Ineffectiveness in respect of cash flow hedges has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year. Ineffectiveness for the year 
ended 30 September 2013 comprised a debit of £3m (2012: £3m credit) relating to fuel hedging and this is included within cost of sales in the 
consolidated income statement. In respect of foreign exchange hedging ineffectiveness, this comprised a credit of £1m (2012: £2m debit) which is 
included in cost of sales in the consolidated income statement.

Deferred tax on the above items recognised outside of the consolidated income statement is shown in Note 8(iii).
(K) Sensitivity analysis
This sensitivity analysis is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and gains or losses.
This sensitivity analysis includes the following assumptions:
• changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense of variable financial instruments;
• changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are 
recognised at fair value;
• changes in market interest, currency and fuel rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments 
and the majority of hedges are expected to be highly effective; and 
• changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets or liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash 
flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the consolidated income statement and equity of a 1% 
(100 basis points) difference in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in Sterling against all other currencies and in fuel prices, 
from the rates applicable at the balance sheet date, with all other variables remaining constant, these being considered to be reasonably possible 
changes to interest rates, Sterling rates and fuel prices.
interest rate risk
Under the above assumptions, a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would result in a less than £1m increase in interest expense in the 
consolidated income statement and equity (2012: increase of £3m). A 100 basis points reduction in interest rates is not considered reasonably 
possible.
Currency risk
The g roup hedges substantially all of its foreign currency exposures not denominated in the functional currency of individual g roup companies. 
This mitigates the sensitivity impact of fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates.
The vast majority of hedging instruments used by the Group qualify for hedge accounting with the fair value movements booked to equity. 
However, the Group uses structured foreign exchange instruments to hedge a small proportion of its Euro and US Dollar requirements. As these 
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, the fair value movements are recognised in the consolidated income statement. A 10% 
strengthening or weakening of Sterling against the Euro and US Dollar on these instruments would have reduced profit before tax by £21m or 
increased it by £21m respectively.
Similarly, under the above assumptions, a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all principal exchange rates would have reduced 
profit before tax by £16m (2012: reduced profit before tax by £5m) or increased it by £18m (2012: increased profit before tax by £6m) 
respectively. Equity (before tax) would have decreased by £226m (2012: £207m) or increased by £276m (2012: £253m) respectively. 
Fuel price risk
The sensitivity analysis is based on a 10% increase or decrease in fuel prices and the sensitivity will differ correspondingly if the fuel markets are 
more or less volatile. Under these assumptions, with a 10% increase or decrease in the unit price of fuel, profit before tax would neither increase 
nor decrease materially, because of the fuel price hedging policy and appropriate pricing adjustments. Equity (before tax) would increase by £97m 
(2012: £110m), or decrease by £96m (2012: £109m) respectively.

As set out in Note 17, cash and cash equivalents included £145m (2012: £34m) of restricted cash.
The 2013 non-cash movement of £22m (2012: £21m) in convertible bonds primarily relates to the accretion of the equity portion of the 
convertible bonds. 
The 2013 non-cash movement of £491m (2012: £nil) between cash and cash equivalents and bank loans and overdrafts reflects the impact of 
specific overdraft balances being presented on a gross basis. Further details are provided in Notes 17 and 20. Other non-cash movements in 2013 
within bank loans and overdrafts and finance leases predominantly relate to advances in respect of additions to property, plant and equipment.
(B) Cash conversion – n on-GAAP measure
The Group targets conversion of underlying profit before tax to free cash flow of at least 70%. ‘Underlying’ as a measure of operating profit is 
defined in Note 1(B)(ii). ‘Free cash flow’ is defined as the movement in available cash net of debt during the year before restricted cash, dividend 
payments, acquisitions and business disposal proceeds, net of pre-delivery payments for aircraft and acquisitions of shares for share-based 
payments. Calculations for the current and prior year are:

The 2012 figures have been restated to exclude:

ii) restricted cash
from the movement in available cash as management considers this to be a better measure of performance in respect of free cash flows. 
Investments in joint ventures, associates and other investments of £14m (2012: £25m) excludes the Group’s investment of £27m (2012: £nil) into 
Blue Diamond Hotels and Resorts Inc, which was funded by way of a £28m (2012: £nil) dividend from Sunwing Travel Group Inc, a related party to 
Blue Diamond Hotels and Resorts Inc. As these transactions are considered to be linked, this investment has been excluded from the calculation 
of free cash flow. Further details of these transactions are included in Note 12.

Operating lease commitments in respect of land and buildings comprise commitments in respect of the g roup’s retail estate, its hotel estate, 
including those commitments that are required to be disclosed as leases under IFRIC 4, and its office premises.
The future commitment under the Group’s floating rate aircraft operating leases at 30 September 2013 was £80m (2012: £100m) and is included 
within the table above.
In total the Group operates 123 aircraft on operating leases at 30 September 2013 (2012: 129 aircraft), a minority of which contain purchase 
options. Yachts are held on operating leases in TUI Marine as part of the Group’s Sunsail and The Moorings fleets, whilst cruise ships are held 
on operating leases in the UK & Ireland source market.

In addition to the above items, at the year end the Group had contracted to purchase 79 (2012: 31) aircraft with initial deliveries to start in the first 
quarter of the financial year 2013/14. At list price, the total order value was US$9,772m (2012: US$4,067m) before discounts.
The Group intends to finance these aircraft in advance of their delivery dates and therefore does not expect to use its own cash resources for 
their purchase.
The Group’s share of the capital commitments of its joint ventures and associates at 30 September 2013 was £13m (2012: £nil).
30. Contingent liabilities
The g roup is at any time defending a number of actions against it arising in the normal course of business. Provision is made for these actions 
where this is deemed appropriate. The Directors consider that adequate provision has been made for all known liabilities. See Note 8 for more 
details on contingent tax exposures and Note 22 for details on provisions.

31. Related party transactions
Apart from with its own subsidiaries which are included in the consolidated financial statements, the Group, in carrying out its ordinary business 
activities, maintained direct and indirect relationships with related parties including consolidated or related companies of its ultimate parent 
company, Tui Ag . These companies either purchased or delivered services to companies in the g roup.
Convertible bond
In April 2010, the Company issued a £400m fixed rate 4.9% convertible bond, of which Antium Finance Ltd, an independent special purpose 
company, subscribed for 50%. TUI AG entered into a forward purchase agreement with Antium Finance Ltd for these £200m convertible bonds,  
in order to prevent dilution of its majority shareholding. TUI AG is entitled to receive the interest coupon on these bonds and to repurchase these 
bonds by July 2014 at the latest.
Trademark l icence Agreement
The Trademark Licence Agreement incorporates trademark licences granted from TUI AG to members of the TUI Tourism Group in relation  
to TUI Tourism’s use of the TUI name and logo and other trademarks from within TUI AG’s portfolio of trademarks used in the former TUI 
Tourism’s business. Licence fees payable under each licence are an annual fee equal to 0.02% of the average annual gross turnover of the relevant 
licensee under the relevant trademarks measured over a three year period. Total licence fees charged for the year ended 30 September 2013 were 
£3m (2012: £3m). Each licence’s standard terms are for five years with an option for the relevant licensee to extend for a further five years on the 
same terms.
Hotel Framework Agreement
TUI Deutschland has signed an exclusivity agreement with TUI AG’s Robinson hotel portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, TUI Deutschland 
paid €8m in the financial year ended 30 September 2012, €10m in the financial year ending 30 September 2013 and must pay €12m per year 
thereafter. The contract also contains performance related elements linked to occupancy rates under which either more can be paid or refunds 
received.

Spanish tax case 
In connection with the settlement of the tax dispute in Spain described in Note 8, on 5 August 2013 arrangements were entered into between the 
Company, one of its subsidiaries, Tui Travel Accommodation and Destinations S.l .u ., and a former director of that subsidiary. That individual, a 
related party of the Company by virtue of their position as a key member of management, intends to plead guilty to a number of tax offences as 
part of the conclusion of the overall settlement. At that time, the subsidiary will have settled the outstanding balance of claimed tax, interest and 
penalties. The arrangements include agreement to indemnify the individual against, and not to seek future recovery of, the amounts payable, 
agreement to pay the individual’s legal costs, and certain variations to the individual’s terms of service. The indemnity and agreement regarding 
recovery from the individual in relation to the penalties was given as the Board considered these to be matters for the companies involved. In 
reaching the settlement in Spain and concluding these arrangements, the Board took account of the fact that when the transactions were 
executed, the law in Spain permitted the tax authorities to take action only against individuals and not companies. The Board considered this to  
be a corporate liability and not an individual liability, and therefore because the individual could have been any director of the relevant subsidiaries, 
the identity of the individual is not considered to be relevant. This legislation was changed in 2010. 
For the purposes of related party transaction disclosure, the aggregate value ascribed to the arrangements with the individual, including the 
indemnity and waiver, is £16.7m, of which £13.1m is ascribed to the waiver (i.e. the €15m penalty referred to in Note 8), £0.1m represents legal 
costs paid and the balance is remuneration under the revised service contract payable in the ordinary course of their service over its anticipated 
life. Cash payments to the individual directly related to the settlement totalled approximately £0.1m for their legal costs.

33. earnings per share
The basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result attributable to ordinary shareholders by the applicable weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Benefit Trust. The diluted earnings per share is calculated on the result 
attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the adjusted potential weighted average number of ordinary shares, which takes account of the 
outstanding share awards and the impact of the conversion of the convertible bonds, where their conversion is dilutive. The additional 
underlying earnings per share measures have been presented to provide the reader of the accounts with a better understanding of the results.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

For the statutory measure of diluted earnings per share, the effects of including the convertible bonds are anti-dilutive in both years and therefore 
this is not included within the calculation.

34. c apital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the Parent Company. The Board’s policy 
has been to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the 
business. The Board’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure. This includes maintaining the level of 
dividends at a level commensurate with underlying operating profitability of the Group and obtaining sufficient long and short term debt facilities 
that are appropriate for the seasonality of the business. 
The Group has a roadmap to deliver sustainable long term value to shareholders with a return on invested capital (ROIC) greater than the Group’s 
post-tax weighted average cost of capital. Progress in achieving this objective has been made during this year by improving underlying operating 
profit, which increases ROIC to 14.8% (2012: 12.2%).
The Group is required to comply with external banking credit facility covenants, with compliance being tested twice a year. The Group has 
complied with these covenants throughout the year and up to the date of signing these financial statements. Further information on these 
covenants is provided in Note 1(B)(v).
ROIC is defined as ‘Underlying NOPAT’/‘Average Invested Capital’. Underlying NOPAT is underlying net operating profit after tax charged at the 
effective annual rate. ‘Underlying’ as a measure of operating profit is defined in Note 1(B)(ii). As such, ROIC is considered to be a non-GAAP 
measure of performance. Average Invested Capital comprises an average of the net assets (at the start and end of the year) of the Group, 
adjusted to add back net debt, cumulative goodwill impairment charges and defined benefit pension scheme net deficits. There is also an 
adjustment to net debt to reflect a seasonal average cash balance. Calculations for the current and prior years are:

The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the levels of debt borrowings undertaken and the advantages and security afforded by a sound 
capital position. An analysis of net cash/debt at the year end is in Note 27(A).
Certain subsidiaries have external capital requirements as a result of applicable travel industry regulations in their jurisdictions. Compliance 
with these regulations is mandatory for the relevant operating businesses in those countries in order that they are able to continue trading. 
Key countries with such mandatory capital requirements are France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia. The capital requirements 
in these countries stipulate maintaining minimum equity/net asset levels in operating subsidiaries. All such capital requirements were complied 
with as at 30 September 2013. None of these requirements place any significant restriction on the Group’s funding or operations.
35. Post balance sheet events
On 19 November 2013, the Group announced that it had agreed to sell 87.4% of its interest in The Airline Group Limited, a shareholder in UK Air 
Traffic controller NATS Holdings Limited, for cash consideration of approximately £38 million. The transaction is expected to complete during the 
first quarter of calendar year 2014 subject to clearance from the European Commission. Also on 19 November 2013, the Group announced that it 
had completed an order for two additional Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft from The Boeing Company (Boeing) at a significant discount to the 
list price as a result of various concessions, allowances and support from Boeing. At current list prices, the value of two Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner 
aircraft is $422 million (£264 million). 
36. Ultimate parent company
The ultimate parent company is considered to be TUI AG, a company registered in Berlin and Hanover (Federal Republic of Germany). 
At 30 September 2013, TUI AG was the beneficial owner of 54.48% of the ordinary share capital of the Company. 
In addition, a number of bonds are held indirectly by TUI AG and, if converted, would give rise to 52,309,463 of new shares. On a fully diluted basis, 
if all bonds were converted, TUI AG’s shareholding would be 50% at 30 September 2013.
TUI AG prepares consolidated financial statements which include the results of the Group. TUI AG is the parent undertaking of the smallest 
and largest group to consolidate these financial statements. The accounting reference date of TUI AG is 30 September. Copies of the TUI AG 
financial statements are publicly available and can be obtained from the registered office of TUI AG situated at Karl-Wiechert-Allee 4, 30625 
Hanover, Federal Republic of Germany.

c onvertible bonds
t he convertible bonds are split into two components: a debt 
component and a component representing the embedded derivatives 
in the bond. t he debt component represents the g roup’s liability 
for future interest coupon payments and the redemption amount.  
t he embedded derivatives represent the value of the option that 
bondholders have to convert into ordinary shares of the c ompany. 
t hese derivatives were valued on inception and recognised in the 
convertible bond reserve in equity.
t he debt component of the convertible bonds is measured at 
amortised cost and therefore increases as the present value of the 
interest coupon payments and redemption amount increases, with a 
c orresponding 	 charge 	 t o 	 financ e 	 c ost . 	 The 	 debt 	 c omponent 	 decreases	
by the cash interest coupon payments made. t he embedded 
derivatives are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date 
and changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. 
issue costs are apportioned between the liability and derivative 
components of the related convertible bond based on the allocation  
of proceeds to the liability and derivative components when the 
instrument s 	 ar e 	 first 	 r ec o gnised.
s hare-based payments
t he c ompany operates share-based payment schemes for the 
employees of the c ompany and its subsidiaries. t he fair value of 
shares awarded to employees is an employee expense and is borne by 
fellow g roup subsidiaries. t he fair value is measured at the award date 
and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes 
unconditionally entitled to the awards. c alculating the fair value takes 
into account various factors including the expected volatility of the 
shares, the dividend yield and the risk free interest rate.
t he c ompany makes awards of its own shares to the employees  
of its subsidiaries and as such recognises an increase in the cost  
of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled 
shar e-based 	 payment 	 charg e 	 r ec o gnised 	 in 	 it s 	 subsidiaries ’ 	 financial	
statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in 
equity. t he increase in investments and credit to equity for the year 
ended 30 September 2013 is £15m (2012: £11m). f urther information 
on the share schemes is provided in n ote 6(d) to the consolidated 
fi n a nc i a l 	 st a t e me n t s .

significant 	 influenc e .	 R elat ed 	 par ties 	 may 	 be 	 individuals 	 or 	 entities.	 
t he c ompany has taken advantage of the exemption contained within 
fr S 8 and has not therefore disclosed transactions or balances with 
entities which are wholly-owned subsidiaries.
a . accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
t he following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
C ompan y’ s 	 financial 	 sta t ement s. 	 The 	 C ompan y’ s 	 financial 	 stat ement s	
are presented in the c ompany’s presentational currency of Sterling, 
rounded to the nearest million.
accounting convention
The 	 financial 	 sta t ement s 	 ha v e 	 been 	 pr epar ed 	 in 	 a c c or danc e 	 with 	 the	
c ompanies act 2006 and applicable u K accounting standards and 
under 	 the 	 h ist orical 	 c ost 	 c on v enti on 	 as 	 modified 	 f or 	 derivativ e 	 financial	
instrument s 	 and 	 c on v er tible 	 bonds. 	 The 	 financial 	 stat ement s 	 ha v e	
been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the 
c ompany will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. t he c ompany has taken advantage of the exemption under 
Section 408 of the c ompanies act 2006 from presenting its own  
pr ofit 	 and 	 loss 	 a c c o unt . 	 The 	 pr ofit 	 a f t er 	 tax 	 included 	 in 	 the 	 financial	
statements of the c ompany determined in accordance with the act, 
was £270m (2012: £114m). 
Foreign currencies
t ransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
that date. f oreign exchange differences arising on translation are 
recognised in the income statement. n on-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. n on-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to  
Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values 
were determined. 
investments
investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. d ividends received and receivable are credited to the 
C ompan y’ s 	 pr ofit 	 and 	 loss 	 a c c o unt 	 on 	 the 	 da t e 	 of 	 r ec eipt .
interest-bearing borrowings
interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
differences between cost and redemption value being recognised  
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an 
effective interest rate basis.
Classification of financial instruments issued
f inancial instruments issued by the c ompany are treated as equity 
only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions. t he 
fir st 	 c ondition 	 is 	 that 	 the y 	 include 	 no 	 c ontr ac tual 	 oblig ation 	 upon 	 the	
Compan y 	 t o 	 deliv er 	 c ash 	 or 	 other 	 financial 	 as set s 	 or 	 t o 	 ex change	
financial 	 as set s 	 or 	 financial 	 liabilities 	 with 	 another 	 par t y 	 under	
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the c ompany. t he 
second condition is that where the instrument will, or may be settled 
in the c ompany’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative 
that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the 
c ompany’s own equity instruments, or is a derivative that will be 
set tled 	 b y 	 the 	 Compan y , 	 ex changing 	 a 	 fix ed 	 amount 	 of 	 c ash 	 or 	 other	
financial 	 as set s 	 f or 	 a 	 fix ed 	 number 	 of 	 it s 	 o wn 	 equit y 	 instrument s .

additions in the year of £145m comprise the following increases in 
investments: £88m increase in the cost of investment into tui f rance 
Sa S during the year, for the purposes of recapitalising the g roup’s 
f rench business, £42m increase in the cost of investment into tui 
t ravel Overseas h oldings l imited and £15m of share-based payment 
liabilities incurred. t he costs of the share-based schemes, which are 
operated for employees of the c ompany’s subsidiaries, are borne by 
the subsidiaries, subject to local accounting standards. t he c ompany 
recognises an increase in the investment in the subsidiary and a credit 
to other reserves in accordance with fr S 20 ‘Share-based payments‘. 
d etails of the principal operating subsidiaries held directly and 
indirectly by the c ompany in the year ended 30 September 2013  
can 	 be 	 f ound 	 in 	 Not e 	 3 2 	 of 	 the 	 c onsolidat ed 	 financial 	 stat ement s.	
included within the total impairment charge of £139m is a £6m 
impairment charge of the investment in r eal t ravel l imited due to the 
fall in value of this company as the demand for gap year travel has 
decreased over the last year and the future outlook for this business  
is 	 c onsider ed 	 t o 	 be 	 less 	 pr ofitable 	 than 	 pr e vi ously 	 expec t ed. 	 An	
impairment of £133m (2012: £300m) has been charged in the year in 
respect of the cost of investment into tui f rance Sa S, following the 
recapitalisation during the year and the outcome from the g roup’s 
annual impairment exercise.
t he investment into tui f rance Sa S principally relates to two cgu s 
that are the same as those used in the g roup’s annual impairment test. 
t hese two cgu s are the f rench tour operator and the f rench airline, 
c orsair. d etailed disclosure of the impairment test and the basis for 
calculati on 	 ha v e 	 been 	 set 	 out 	 in 	 Not e 	 1 0 	 of 	 the 	 c onsolidat ed 	 financial	
statements. t he cost of investment has been compared against the 
value in use of c orsair and the f rench tour operator, using discounted 
cash 	 flo ws	 as 	 a 	 basis 	 of 	 measur ement .	
t he calculation of recoverable value for these two cgu s uses the 
following assumptions:
•	 Cash 	 flo w	 pr o jec ti ons 	 based 	 on 	 the 	 Gr oup ’ s 	 lat est 	 Boar d 	 appr o v ed	
three year business plan which management has extended by two 
y ears 	 t o 	 cr eat e 	 a 	 fiv e 	 y ear 	 plan ;	
•	 Cash 	 flo ws	 be y ond 	 the 	 plan 	 peri od 	 ar e 	 ex trapolat ed 	 using 	 a 	 r eal	
growth rate of 1.75% (2012: 1.8%); 
•	 Cash 	 flo ws	 include 	 the 	 impa c t 	 of 	 w orking 	 capital 	 in 	 both 	 the 	 asset	
base 	 and 	 the 	 impa c t 	 on 	 cash 	 flo ws	 o v er 	 the 	 plan 	 peri od ; 	 and
•	 Cash 	 flo ws	 ar e 	 disc ount ed 	 using 	 the 	 Gr oup ’ s 	 W A C C 	 adjust ed 	 as	
appr opriat e 	 f or 	 business 	 specific 	 fa c t ors, 	 such 	 as 	 business 	 risk .	 
t he risk-adjusted pre-tax wacc for these two cgu s was 10% 
(2012: 11%).
t he calculation of recoverable value for r eal t ravel l imited uses the 
same 	 assumpti ons 	 as 	 abo v e , 	 ex c ept 	 that 	 the 	 cash 	 flo ws	 be y ond 	 the	
plan period are extrapolated using a real growth rate of 2.2%.
t axation
The 	 charg e 	 f or 	 taxa ti on 	 is 	 based 	 on 	 the 	 pr ofit 	 or 	 loss 	 f or 	 the 	 peri od	
and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences 
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting 
purposes. except as otherwise required by accounting standards, full 
provision without discounting is made for all timing differences which 
have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. t iming 
differences arise when items of income and expenditure are included 
in tax computations in periods different from their inclusion in the 
fi n a nc i a l 	 st a t e me n t s .
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
d ividends distributed to the c ompany’s shareholders are recognised  
as 	 a 	 liabilit y 	 and 	 deduc t ed 	 fr om 	 equit y 	 in 	 the 	 C ompan y’ s 	 financial

l . c ontingent liabilities
t here were contingent liabilities at 30 September 2013 in respect 
of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary 
course of the g roup’s business. t hese guarantees cover payables 
by the c ompany’s subsidiaries for items such as insurance and 
credit facilities, car leases, aviation fuel, ground handling and 
airport services. t he c ompany has also guaranteed the contractual 
obligations of various subsidiary companies in respect of the supply 
o f 	 a 	 number 	 o f 	 the 	 Gr o up ’ s 	 a ir cra f t 	 fleet .	 No 	 mat erial 	 losses 	 ar e	
currently expected to be incurred by the c ompany from such 
contingent liabilities. 
Where 	 the 	 Compan y 	 ent er s 	 int o 	 financial 	 g uar ant ee 	 c ontr ac t s 	 in	
order to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its 
g roup, the c ompany considers these to be insurance arrangements 
and accounts for them as such. in this respect, the c ompany treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it 
becomes probable that the c ompany will be required to make a 
payment under the guarantee. at 30 September 2013, the c ompany 
had contingent liabilities in respect of counter-guarantees for letters 
of credit amounting to £136m (2012: £162m).
t he c ompany is an obligor to the g roup’s revolving credit facilities 
totalling £1,120m, details of which are set out in n ote 26(f ). at 
30 September 2013, the drawndown portion of this facility was £nil 
(2012: £nil). 
u nder the terms of guarantees given to the c ivil aviation authority 
and other relevant authorities by the c ompany in respect of certain 
subsidiaries, in the event of default the c ompany could be held liable 
to the extent of the subsidiaries’ net trading liabilities at the time of 
default.
n o amount is recognised in the c ompany’s balance sheet in respect  
of any of the above guarantees as it is not probable that there will be 
an 	 o ut flo w	 o f 	 r eso ur c es.
t he c ompany may be required to recapitalise direct subsidiaries in 
certain countries where there is a legal requirement to do so in the 
event that the net assets or reserves fall below a determined level. 
w here recapitalisation is required, the recapitalisation will be 
accounted for as an increase in the cost of investment in that 
subsidiary, and subsequently tested for impairment (see n ote d).
t he c ompany, and its subsidiaries, is at any time defending a number 
of actions against it arising in the normal course of business. 
Provision is made for these actions where this is deemed appropriate. 
t he d irectors consider that adequate provision has been made for  
all known liabilities.
t he c ompany has provided certain wholly owned u K subsidiaries 
with guarantees such that they can take an exemption from the 
requirement 	 t o 	 ha v e 	 their 	 single 	 entit y 	 financial 	 st at ement s 	 audit ed. 	
t hese guarantees cover all outstanding liabilities of the following 
subsidiaries as at 30 September 2013: eac activity c amps l imited, 
iexplore l imited, manchester academy h oldings l imited, 
manchester academy t eacher t raining (u K) l imited, Student 
Skiing l imited, t ravel c lass t ransport l imited and world c hallenge 
h oldings l imited. 
m. Related party transactions
apart from with its own subsidiaries which are included in the 
c onsolidat ed 	 financial 	 stat ement s, 	 TUI 	 T ra v el 	 P L C , 	 in 	 carr ying 	 out 	 it s	
ordinary business activities, had transactions with its ultimate parent 
company, tui ag , which delivered services to companies in the g roup. 
expenses and interest payable to tui ag amounted to £nil in the year 
(2012: £2m).
in addition to the above, a ntium f inance l td purchased £200m 
(nominal value) of the c ompany’s convertible bond 4.9% april 2017. 
antium f inance l td is a special purpose entity, independent of tui 
ag . tui ag entered into a forward purchase agreement with a ntium 
f inance l td for these £200m convertible bonds, in order to prevent 
dilution of its majority shareholding. tui ag is entitled to receive the 
interest coupon on these bonds from antium f inance l td (amounting 
to £10m per annum) and to repurchase these bonds by July 2014 at 
the latest. f urther details of the convertible bonds are given in n otes

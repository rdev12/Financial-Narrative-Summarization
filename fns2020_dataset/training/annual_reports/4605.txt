significantly improved operating profit and operating 
cash flow. The Group’s businesses were resilient to 
the worsening global economic conditions, and the 
Group ended the year in a strong financial position. An 
important step forward also was made toward de-risking 
and de-scaling the Delta Pension Plan.

OVERVIEW OF 2008 RESULTS
Overall trading performance during the year was excellent. Profit before 
tax and before exceptionals of £41.9 million was up 66%. Cash flow 
generated from operations at £49.0 million was up 82%, assisted by 
reductions in working capital levels.
Engineered Steel Products made strong progress across the Australian 
and Asian operations. Galvanizing Services was resilient, despite the 
impact of remarkable commodity price volatility on its marketplace. 
Delta EMD produced a significant turnaround from last year’s operating 
loss, benefitting from the decision to reduce production capacity.
Following a competitive market auction, some £450 million of Pensioner 
liabilities were transferred to Pensions Insurance Corporation via the 
purchase of an insured bulk annuity. Delta funded some £50 million 
in cash to facilitate the transaction, which I am relieved to report was 
negotiated and signed prior to the most recent turmoil in the financial 
markets. This represents an important step forward for shareholders 
in reducing the scale and risks associated with the Delta Pension Plan 
(DPP), albeit further action is desirable as and when market conditions 
permit.
Despite funding the above transaction, Group consolidated net cash 
at year end amounted to £109.6m. This, alongside healthy underlying 
cash generation, provides Delta with the ongoing flexibility to continue 
to invest in the core operations, fund add-on acquisitions and when the 
time is right to consider further actions on the DPP.
Key Priorities for 2009
Inevitably, trading conditions will be tougher over the coming year, 
with even the relatively resilient Australian economy having recently 
reported GDP contraction. These impacts are already apparent in some 
businesses to a degree, albeit we expect much of Delta’s portfolio to 
demonstrate defensive characteristics during a downturn. A strong 
operational focus will therefore be high on management’s list of 2009 
priorities. 
The ongoing programme to upgrade plant in existing markets and add 
capacity in new markets will continue so long as these continue to 
demonstrably add to medium and long-term value. Add-on acquisitions 
are likely to become available to cash buyers at more realistic prices 
than previously. These will be actively considered, provided they have 
strategic logic as part of the Delta Group.
“Many businesses would 
envy Delta’s current 
position as we enter a 
downturn, with relatively 
diverse businesses, 
many with defensive 
characteristics, and net 
cash in the bank . . . To 
enhance the marketability 
and attractiveness 
of Delta as an equity 
investment, the Board 
remains keen to pursue  
all options for enhancing 
long-term value for 
shareholders.”

Many businesses would envy Delta’s current position as we enter a 
downturn, with relatively diverse businesses, many with defensive 
characteristics, and net cash in the bank. In the short term, these are 
indeed important assets. Yet the options for the strategic development 
of the Group continue to be limited by the scale, risks and regulatory 
constraints imposed by the DPP. To enhance the marketability 
and attractiveness of Delta as an equity investment, the Board 
remains keen to pursue all options for enhancing long-term value for 
shareholders.
For 2009, operational management’s exclusive focus will be on 
optimising trading performance during the downturn, and on the 
active longer term development of the businesses. At the centre, 
efforts will also focus on further simplifying the Group’s portfolio of 
businesses, generating further net cash in the balance sheet, and on 
monitoring market opportunities to further de-risk and de-scale the 
DPP at fair value. 
DIVIDEND
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 4.6p per share 
(2007: 3.4p per share) which would provide a full year 2008 dividend 
of 6.5p per share (2007: 5.0p per share).

Chief Executive
2008 RESULTS
We are pleased to report that the Group’s revenue improved during the 
year by 24.2% to £330.8 million (2007: £266.4 million) and the Group’s 
profit after tax for the year from continuing operations and before 
exceptional items improved by 53.3% to £32.2 million (2007: £21.0 
million), providing basic earnings per share from continuing operations 
and before exceptional items of 17.0 pence (2007: 13.9 pence).
The Group’s total profit included exceptional items, including a £48.8 
million charge related to the de-scaling and de-risking of the Delta 
Pension Plan, a £2.8 million charge for closure costs and a £6.0 million 
gain on sale of surplus property. Including exceptional items and 
discontinued operations, the Group’s loss for the year attributable to 
equity holders was £3.2 million (2007: profit of £17.2 million), providing 
basic losses per ordinary share attributable to equity shareholders of 
5.7 pence (2007: basic earnings per share of 14.2 pence).
The Group’s year-end net cash balance decreased to £109.6 million 
from £128.9 million with the payment of £50.2 million toward the 
de-scaling and de-risking of the Delta Pension Plan.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 4.6 pence per share, 
which would provide a full year dividend of 6.5 pence per share (2007: 
5.0 pence per share).
REVIEW OF 2008 TRADING
Engineered Steel Products
The Group’s Engineered Steel Products division performed very well and 
improved upon the prior year’s performance. Operating profit increased 
by 39.2% to £21.3 million (2007: £15.3 million) on continuing revenue 
that increased by 36.3% to £200.9 million (2007: £147.4 million).
Ingal Civil Products (ICP) performed very well during the year with 
improved sales volumes and the effective management of higher steel 
costs. Further benefits were realised from ICP’s recent commissioning of 
new more automated roll forming equipment and a bespoke galvanizing 
facility, resulting in improved revenue and operating profit. The sale of 
ICP’s former site was concluded during the year, resulting in a 
£6.0 million exceptional gain and an additional £8.6 million cash 
inflow. ICP continued to benefit from a strong market position as well 
as highway refurbishment and infrastructure investments funded 
by the Australian government. The expansion of ICP’s business with 
additional product technologies also progressed with the development 
of alternative barrier systems, as well as the successful introduction of 
complementary products. ICP’s market position against foreign imports 
also improved during the year, as difficulties with competitors’ imported 
product were experienced in the marketplace, and the Australian dollar 
weakened.
The performance of Ingal EPS was disrupted during the year by 
difficulties with product sourced from China. The rectification required 
on imported poles at the beginning of the year disrupted production 
at Ingal EPS’s two Australian manufacturing plants and required 
considerable additional effort to assure timely supply, resulting in 
extra costs and poor efficiencies. The Australian market for power 
transmission and distribution poles and lighting poles remained strong 
during the year. Our market-leading supply of poles to the Australian 
“The Group’s 2008 
ﬁ nancial performance 
was exceptionally 
good, and a substantial 
reduction in the Group’s  
pension liabilities was 
achieved.”

market will require a combination of domestically produced 
products as well as imported products. Ingal EPS’s market strategy 
and operations will be focused during the coming year to properly 
service the Australian pole market, and improve Ingal EPS’s financial 
performance.
Webforge Australia performed very well during the year by 
maintaining its strong market position and effectively managing higher 
steel costs. Revenue and operating profit improved substantially 
on similar volumes, providing exceptional financial performance. 
Webforge management also successfully integrated Hi-Light 
Industries following acquisition at the beginning of the year, and have 
begun to realise the planned synergies between Webforge’s and Hi-
Light’s architectural products businesses. Webforge management also 
made further progress toward enlarging Webforge’s market shares 
in complementary products such as expanded metal products, civil 
products and planking.
Webforge Asia performed exceptionally well during the year. Sales 
volumes improved modestly and selling prices were successfully 
managed against volatile Asian steel prices and increasingly 
competitive markets. Revenue and operating profit improved over 
the prior year. Further progress toward the development of greenfield 
plants in Western China and the Middle East was made, and an 
additional forge welder will soon be commissioned at Webforge’s 
plant in Guangzhou, China. The greenfield plant in Chengdu, China is 
under construction and should be commissioned during the coming 
year. Efforts to develop Webforge Asia’s market positions in the Middle 
East, Vietnam and India also continued during the year with success.
Donhad’s volumes sold improved substantially during the year as 
Australian mining activity continued to be strong, and Donhad’s 
market position improved against foreign imports. Steel supply and 
costs were managed successfully, and markedly improved revenue 
and operating profit resulted. Donhad management also successfully 
managed the challenges of satisfying additional demand whilst 
continuing to develop opportunities to participate in developing 
market segments, such as Australia’s planned development of 
substantial magnetite iron ore mining capacity.
Market conditions for Investment Tooling International (ITI), the 
Group’s remaining business in the United Kingdom, continued to be 
difficult during the year; nonetheless, a small operating profit was 
achieved. At year end, one of ITI’s UK operations was closed at a cost 
of £0.7 million, and efforts to sell the other operation are now under 
way. 
Galvanizing Services
The Group’s Galvanizing Services division performed well during the 
year but didn’t match the very good performance of 2007. Zinc prices 
declined substantially during the year which pressured selling prices 
at the Group’s hot-dip galvanizing operations, and also particularly 
affected the financial performance of AusZinc, the Group’s zinc 
reclamation business. Galvanizing Service’s operating profit declined 
by 17.1% to £10.2 million (2007: £12.3 million) on continuing 
revenue that increased by 2.5% to £86.6 million (2007: £84.5 million).

capacity, as well as by difficulties recruiting and retaining labour in 
Australia’s labour market. Selling prices were managed effectively 
against substantial declines in zinc prices, resulting in improved 
value added per tonne, which offset higher labour costs. Revenue 
and operating profit consequently improved, and cash flows were 
enhanced as the value of zinc inventories declined. The development 
of a greenfield plant in Melbourne progressed, and the plant will be 
commissioned shortly. Upgrades to plants in Newcastle and Brisbane 
also progressed to plan, and Galvanizing management’s efforts to realise 
incremental improvements toward improved energy efficiencies and 
improved chemical utilisation continued with success.
US Galvanizing’s market position continued to improve during the year, 
and provided sales volumes similar to 2007 in softer market conditions. 
Economic conditions deteriorated during the year in the United States 
and adversely affected galvanizing volumes toward the end of the year. 
Whilst lower zinc prices heightened price competition in the United 
States, selling prices were well managed. FIFO zinc costs, as well 
as higher energy and labour costs, reduced margins and resulted in 
reduced operating profit. 
The performance of the Group’s Asian galvanizing operations varied 
during the year. Market volumes declined with deteriorating economic 
conditions and uncertain political environments, and price competition 
intensified with lower zinc prices and reduced market volumes. The 
Group’s two Malaysian operations performed reasonably well in 
difficult market conditions, but fell short of 2007’s very good result, 
whilst operating profit from the Group’s Philippine operation improved 
modestly. The performance of the Group’s galvanizing operation in 
Indonesia improved over the prior year, with good volumes and reduced 
zinc costs. Management’s efforts to optimise efficiencies and reduce 
costs also assisted, whilst necessary improvements were made to plant 
and equipment. 
AusZinc’s input costs and selling prices are determined with reference 
to the LME zinc price; consequently, AusZinc’s financial performance 
remains closely tied to movements in the LME zinc price. The year’s 
substantial decline in the LME zinc price significantly reduced AusZinc’s 
selling prices and margins on products produced with zinc residues 
sourced at higher prices. Consequently, AusZinc’s revenue and 
operating profit declined. AusZinc management nonetheless succeeded 
in realising good sales volumes and operational efficiencies. AusZinc’s 
share of the galvanizing zinc market was maintained, agricultural 
zinc oxide sales volumes improved, and zinc oxide export volumes 
were improved substantially. Management also successfully reduced 
inventories providing good cash flow and reducing AusZinc’s exposure 
to future zinc price movements. 
Manganese Materials
Delta EMD
The global market for electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) settled 
during the year with the closure of Delta EMD’s Australian production 
site, and the resolution of anti-dumping investigations in Europe, Japan 
and the United States. Demand for EMD for use in the manufacture 
of disposable batteries remained strong, and market selling prices 
reflected a more balanced market, affording recovery of higher input 
“We should be relatively well 
positioned to weather the most 
difﬁ cult economic conditions 
in 2009 and to continue 
investment in the Group’s 
core businesses.”
costs, particularly substantially higher manganese ore costs, as well as 
better margins. 
Consequently, 2008 was a markedly better year for Delta EMD: 
revenues increased by 25.5% to £43.3 million (2007: £34.5 million), 
and pre-exceptional operating profit improved to £9.2 million (2007: 
operating loss of £4.9 million). Sales revenue increased with improved 
selling prices and favourable exchange rate movements; however, total 
sales volumes declined during the year with the closure of Delta EMD’s 
Australian production site at the end of March 2008. Nonetheless, all of 
Delta EMD’s Australian stock that was on hand at the beginning of the 
year, or produced prior to closure of the Australian production site, was 
sold by year end, and sales volumes of South African product increased 
by 6% and exceeded production. Selling prices for EMD produced at 
the Group’s South African plant were increased at the beginning of the 
year by approximately 20% and by approximately 60% during April 
2008 when a substantial manganese ore cost increase was announced. 
Delta EMD’s remaining Australian stock was produced prior to the 
manganese ore cost increase and selling prices for that stock were not 
increased.
The operating profit reported by the Group for Delta EMD does not 
include £1.8 million of additional rehabilitation provisions required 
for Delta EMD’s Australian residue disposal and production sites, or 
£0.3 million of additional impairment charges related to Delta EMD’s 
Australian assets, both of which have been treated as exceptional 
closure costs. However, it does include £0.9 million of costs incurred 
managing the Australian production site since production ceased in 
March 2008, which is net of gains realised on the sale of certain supplies 
and raw materials, as well as £0.4 million of one-off costs associated with 
defending anti-dumping investigations (2007: £0.8 million). 
As planned, production at Delta EMD’s Australian production site 
ceased during March 2008. The plant was decommissioned during 
the year, and surplus supplies and raw materials were sold. Delta EMD 
continues to explore the possible sale of the 9 hectare production site 
with certain plant and equipment whilst also preparing for demolition 
and rehabilitation of that site. Discussions also continue with parties 
interested in purchasing Delta EMD’s Australian residue disposal site, a 
25 hectare site located on Kooragang Island.
Manganese Metal Company (MMC)
The financial performance of MMC during the year was exceptionally 
good. Market selling prices for electrolytic manganese metal (EMM)

were high, and MMC maintained its market niche and price premium 
with superior quality and service. Demand for use of EMM as an 
alloying agent by steel and aluminium makers was high and provided 
good sales volumes. MMC management successfully managed 
disruptions to electrical power, and realised good operational 
efficiencies. Exceptionally good operating profit and cash flow 
resulted.

in 2005, which was partially reversed in 2007, was reversed in full 
during the year, resulting in a £6.4 million exceptional credit, and 
MMC’s fourth quarter results have been included in the Group’s 
accounts. 
Efforts to dispose MMC progressed during the year, and should be 
concluded shortly, provided a reasonable valuation can be funded. 
MMC has been reclassified to an asset held-for-sale on the balance 
sheet and thus accounted for as a discontinued operation.
Cash Flow and Balances
The Group’s cash generated from operations before tax totalled 
£49.0 million (2007: £26.9 million) and reflects improved operating 
profit and favourable working capital movements. The value of zinc 
inventories held by our Galvanizing Services businesses reduced with 
the lower zinc prices, and Delta EMD’s inventories reduced as the 
inventories remaining from Delta EMD’s Australian plant were sold. 
As described more fully below, the Group committed £50 million 
during the year toward the de-scaling and de-risking of the Delta 
Pension Plan.
Capital expenditure increased to £13.1 million during the year (2007: 
£7.5 million) and exceeded depreciation, which totalled £6.5 million. 
The total expenditure included expenditures toward Australian 
Galvanizing’s greenfield plant in Melbourne, Australia and Webforge 
Asia’s greenfield plant in Chengdu, China.
The Group’s net cash balance decreased to £109.6 million (2007: 
£128.9 million), of which £87.7 million is held by the Company or in 
wholly owned subsidiaries. The balance was enlarged during the year 
by favourable foreign exchange movements.
Delta Pension Plan
During the year the Delta Pension Plan (DPP) completed the 
purchase of a bulk annuity from Pension Insurance Corporation 
(PIC). The Group contributed £50 million to that purchase, and the 
DPP transferred specifically identified assets to PIC, all in exchange 
for a bulk annuity that insured the DPP’s obligations to participants 
who were retirees on 31 December 2007. Before year end, individual 
annuities were issued to those retirees, discharging any further liability 
to them. As the pensions payable to those retirees have now been 
secured through another source, and the Group’s pension liabilities 
have been reduced substantially, as indicated by the Group’s year 
end IAS 19 total liability of £197.2 million (2007: £631.2 million).
The participant population remaining in the DPP now includes only 
active and deferred participants, as well as those participants who 
retired after 31 December 2007. As the average age of the participant

population is much younger, the mortality assumptions employed to 
determine the Group’s IAS 19 liability have been revised, and now 
include a medium cohort (i.e. PxA92MC). 
 These more prudent mortality assumptions contributed to a modest 
year end IAS 19 net deficit of £2.5 million (2007: net surplus of £9.5 
million). The Group’s IAS 19 total liabilities were determined with an 
assumed inflation rate of 2.5% (2007: 3.1%) and a 6.3% discount rate 
(2007: 5.8%), which estimates the year end investment return for AA 
corporate bond with durations similar to the DPP liabilities.
In anticipation of the DPP’s purchase of the PIC bulk annuity, the 
trustee Board revised the DPP’s investment strategy. As at 31 December 
2008, the DPP’s assets included £5.3 million of equity investments, 
£175.7 million of investment grade corporate bonds, and £13.7 
million of property and cash. The DPP fortunately avoided most of the 
consequences of the financial markets’ recent volatility.
Strategic Development
The Group’s core businesses remain attractive platforms for investment, 
and increasingly attractive opportunities for the development of those 
businesses through acquisition should be available during 2009. 
Our investment strategy remains to invest in businesses that provide 
complementary products or services, and that can be effectively 
integrated into a core business.
As importantly, the Group will continue to invest in our core businesses 
through organic investment to increase capacity where appropriate, 
to expand our geographic footprint, and to develop complementary 
products and services. 
The Group’s profits, cash flow and accumulated capital should allow 
such investment activities to continue during 2009 notwithstanding 
deteriorating economic conditions.
The geographic spread and diversity of the Group’s businesses remain 
unusually broad for a relatively small group, and the ownership of 
several of the Group’s business remains complicated by minority 
interests. The Delta Pension Plan, whilst substantially smaller following 
the PIC transaction, also remains an uncertain, long-term liability for 
the Group. As a consequence, the Group’s shares are not as actively 
followed or traded as would be desired. To increase the attractiveness 
of the Group, our strategic focus therefore remains to further de-scale 
and de-risk the Delta Pension Plan, and to simplify the Group around 
businesses with appropriate strategic focus.
2009 Prospects
Whilst the effects of deteriorating global economic conditions and the 
credit crunch are not presently apparent at all the Group’s businesses, 
our outlook for 2009 remains cautious. 
The Australian economy appears to be relatively resilient, and the 
Group’s core businesses remain relatively well positioned to endure 
deteriorating economic conditions. Nonetheless, we foresee some 
decline in sales volumes at the Group’s core businesses from the levels 
achieved in 2008. The benefit of continuing, and perhaps increased, 
government spend in Australia on infrastructure development and 
improvement is expected to be offset by the deferral or cancellation of 
projects requiring private funding, most likely resulting in reduced sales 
volumes. 
Mining output in Australia also is likely to reduce during the year, and 
Donhad’s sales volumes are expected to reduce. Donhad’s margins 
are likely to be affected by pressure on selling prices, as mining 
houses seek cost savings, and will be dependent upon sourcing cost 
competitive steel.
The markets served by the Group’s businesses in Asia and the United 
States will be affected by deteriorating global economic conditions 
and are not likely to benefit as immediately from government spend 
on infrastructure development and improvement. Asian markets also 
are likely to be affected by political instability and reduced foreign 
investment. Consequently, we expect sales volumes in Asia and the 
United States to reduce from 2008 levels and selling price competition 
to heighten. 
Input costs at the Group’s core businesses are expected to reduce 
during the year with reduced costs for energy, steel and zinc likely to 
reduce production costs. Inflationary pressures also are expected to 
reduce. Business unit management are prepared to reduce fixed cost to 
the extent possible should sales volumes reduce during the year.
“The Group’s core businesses 
remain attractive platforms 
for investment.”

Delta EMD is a leading global supplier of electrolytic 
manganese dioxide (EMD) used in the manufacture 
of disposable batteries worldwide. Manganese Metal 
Company (MMC) is a leading global supplier of 
manganese metal used in the production of steel, 
aluminium and electronic components.
Reduced battery sales and production are expected to reduce 
global demand for electrolytic manganese dioxide during the year. 
Consequently, Delta EMD does not expect to sell sufficient volumes 
during 2009 to fully utilise its South African plant, and does not intend 
to invest in stocks. The selling price increases necessary to recover 
higher conversion costs and to recover the overhead costs arising from 
plant under-utilisation were announced at the beginning of the year and 
have been implemented. Consequently, Delta EMD’s South African plant 
is expected to perform in line with 2008.
Reduced steel and aluminium production are expected to reduce 
demand for electrolytic manganese metal during 2009, and volumes 
produced and sold by MMC are expected to decline from 2008 levels. 
MMC’s selling prices also are likely to be affected by declines in market 
selling prices. Nonetheless, whilst MMC is not expected to match 2008’s 
exceptional result during the year, it is expected to perform well. 
In summary, the Group’s 2008 financial performance was exceptionally 
good, and a substantial reduction to the Group’s pension liabilities 
was achieved. Given the nature of the Group’s businesses and our 
geographic footprint, as well as the Group’s strong financial position, 
we should be relatively well positioned to weather the more difficult 
economic conditions in 2009, and to continue investment in the Group’s 
core businesses.

Financial Review

Jon Kempster
Finance Director
The other exceptional items within continuing operations were (see 
note 12):
(i) Business closure costs of £2.8 million, of which £2.1 million related 
to the EMD Australian closure. The major part of the cost was an 
additional provision for the rehabilitation of the residue site, taking 
into account of updated input prices. £0.7 million relates to the 
closure of the Kirkby operation of the ITI business in the UK.
(ii) A £6.0 million profit on the sale of land at Kirrawee in Australia. The 
consideration was £8.6 million.
(iii) £1.5 million tax credit giving rise to a deferred tax asset arising from 
an increase in the depreciable tax asset values in our Australian 
business group.
 
The exceptional items within discontinued operations comprised:
(i)  A £6.4 million credit reflecting the completion of the reversal of 
a previous impairment in the Group’s investment in Manganese 
Metal Company (MMC). Following the initiation of a sale process 
for MMC by the majority owner, Samancor, Delta has reclassified its 
investment in MMC to “Held for Sale”, and its share of MMC results 
to discontinued operations.
(ii)  A credit of £0.5 million, of which £0.3 million relates to release of 
provisions established at the time of former disposals and 
£0.2 million tax refund in South Africa related to the sale of the 
Industrial Supply business in 2005.
OPERATIONS
The Group revenue from continuing operations increased from 
£266.4 million to £330.8 million. Operating profit before exceptional 
items, from continuing operations, increased from £17.6 million to 
£36.7 million, a 109% increase. Of the total increase in operating profit 
of £19.1 million, £14.1 million arose from the return to profit of the EMD 
business. The translational impact of foreign exchange rates on the 
2008 operating profit on the same basis (as compared to 2007 rates) 
was £2.3 million. The operating profit performance of the individual 
segments is more fully discussed in the operations reviews within the 
Chief Executive’s Review.
The Group has had a good year, and has benefited both from the 
buoyant economic conditions in Australia and the turnaround of the 
fortunes of the majority owned EMD business. The commodity price 
position in 2008 had major impacts on the Group. Zinc prices reduced 
as the year progressed and saw the replacement cost of zinc release 
working capital. There was some pressure on selling prices, but an 
emphasis on service and quality meant the majority of the businesses 
managed to maintain value-added in this declining price environment. 
Steel prices had a major impact as they increased dramatically mid-
year. Selling prices were increased and gave rise to major revenue 
increases, and in some instances stock profits. The EMD business saw 
major changes to its business following the closure of the Australian 
plant, and the finalisation of all the anti-dumping duty issues. 
Selling prices were increased to minimise the likelihood of any future 
anti-dumping investigations and to pass on the increased input costs, 
especially manganese ore. This gave rise to more acceptable margins in 
addition to stock profits. 
INCOME STATEMENT — PRESENTATION
The Group’s Consolidated Income Statement reflects a number 
of exceptional items that have been separately disclosed in order 
to provide increased clarity to the performance of the Group. The 
largest of the exceptional items relates to the pension scheme. 
As mentioned in the Chief Executive’s Review, the completion of 
the pensioner buyout transaction led to a settlement charge being 
expensed and shown separately of £48.8 million. The transaction 
consisted of two stages. The first was the purchase of the bulk 
annuity policy into the Delta Pension Scheme from PIC. The 
second stage occurred in the second half and culminated in the 
individual annuity policy documents being issued by PIC just prior 
to the year end. The last stage was a key part of the transaction 
structure as this element allowed the Group to discharge fully 
the liability of that portion of the pension scheme population 
and to show a much reduced pension scheme in terms of both 
assets and liabilities (as detailed in note 40). In order to achieve 
this outcome a data verification exercise was undertaken in the 
second half and a further premium adjustment amount of 
£0.8 million was paid to PIC by the pension scheme.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share from continuing business on a pre-exceptional 
basis has increased 22% from 13.9p to 17.0p. On a pre-exceptional 
basis for the continuing and discontinued operations the earnings per 
share increased from 13.8p to 18.2p. 
INTEREST
The Group’s net interest income (before the IAS 19 pension net 
expense) was flat at £6.6 million, despite the payment of the pension 
contribution of £50 million paid mid-year. The better rate environment 
in the majority of the year offset the impact of this payment on the 
average cash balances. 
The IAS 19 net pension expense of £1.6 million in 2008 compared to 
a net pension credit of £0.7 million in 2007.
TAXATION
The Group’s 2008 net tax expense (including deferred tax), excluding 
exceptional items and discontinued operations, was £9.7 million 
(2007: £4.3 million), and the effective tax rate for 2008 was 23% 
(2007: 17%). The Group operates in many countries, and the 
effective rate reflects this, with various applicable statutory rates, on 
average around 28%. The utilization of tax losses in certain territories, 
and positive adjustments to prior year tax benefited the effective tax 
rate, and overall, brought it below the average rate for the territories in 
which we operate.
Information upon the Group’s accumulated tax losses is provided 
within note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
GROUP CASH FLOW AND BALANCES
The cash generated from operations before tax was £49.0 million, 
increased from £26.9 million in 2007. The overall greater profitability 
in the current year aided by a working capital inflow has led to the 
substantial increase in the operating cash flow. Working capital 
benefited from a declining zinc price and the sale of the EMD stocks 
following the closure of the Australian plant. This was offset by the 
greater cost of steel included in our stock balances and the impact of 
the increased selling prices on the receivables at year end.
Capital expenditure was £13.1 million (2007: £7.5 million) which 
compared to a depreciation charge of £6.5 million (2007: £7.6 
million). As set out in Note 5, £8.7 million of the total capital 
expenditure related to the previously disclosed expansion and 
redevelopment of our Galvanizing operations specifically in Australia. 
A new site is being commissioned in Melbourne in the first quarter 
2009, while other plants have and are being upgraded in order 
to be able to work more efficiently, and to enable more volume to 
be processed. It is expected that this programme will be largely 
complete in 2009, and capital expenditure will then return to more 
normal levels. In Engineered Steel Products, we have commenced 
the construction of the new Webforge site in Chengdu, China. This 
is expected to commence operational production in the second half 
of 2009. The Group acquired the Hi-Light business in January for a 
cash outflow of £2.9 million.
Overall the cash flow in the year benefited from the sale of the former 
Ingal Civil Products site in Sydney for £8.6 million. In the year DEI 
paid a dividend and also made a capital distribution. The cash flow 
reflects the minority portion of those payments (£1.4 million and £3.2 
million respectively), as these reduce the overall cash reported by 
the Group. It is expected that DEI will make further distributions once 
certain asset sales are realised and tax matters resolved.
Dividends paid to equity holders totalled £8.2 million 
(2007: £7.2 million).
The Group ended the year with a net cash position of £109.6 million, 
a decrease of only £19.3 million in the year from £128.9 million 
after paying a pension settlement of £50 million. The cash within 
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries totalled £87.7million 
(2007: £113.4 million). The net cash position provides the Group with 
significant funds with which to look at possibilities to de-scale and/
or de-risk the pension scheme further, and to continue to invest in 
acquisitions and organic growth opportunities. 
TREASURY POLICY 
The Group’s treasury policy remains one of risk management and 
control. No speculative transactions are undertaken. Group treasury 
activities are closely monitored by the Group Finance Department, 
who make recommendations to the Board on matters of treasury 
policy and implement the policies approved by the Board. 
Material currency exposures arising from trading transactions at most 
of the Group’s businesses are covered as they arise. Delta EMD and 
our associate Manganese Metal Company do not cover currency 
exposures. 
The Group does not normally use translational hedging to protect the 
sterling value of its non-sterling assets.
The sterling value of operating profits arising in other currencies 
are not hedged. Consequently, the sterling value of overseas profits 
remains subject to currency exchange movements. The US dollar is 
used as the functional currency for MMC. 
No instruments are entered into to mitigate the impact of interest 
rates, although this is reviewed regularly. 
Due to the significant cash balances held by the Group, the Group 
is exposed to credit risks with counterparty banks. In particular, the 
Group has cash balances with banks located in the UK, Republic of 
South Africa, Australia, and the United States, and consequently has 
an exposure to those banking sectors. The balances are held with 
large commercial banks. At year end the large balances were held 
in Australia and the UK. In order to minimise market risk, Treasury 
policy dictates that surplus cash in the UK must be deposited in AAA-
rated money market funds, whilst in Australia it must be deposited 
with AA-rated banks.

Board of Directors / Directors’ Report
Directors’ Report
The directors submit their report together with the audited financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
A review of the Group’s principal activities and likely future 
developments can be found in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Review and Financial Review. 
BUSINESS REVIEW 
The Company is required to set out in this report a fair review 
of the business of the Group during the financial year ended 31 
December 2008, the position at the end of that financial year and 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group. The Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and 
Financial Review, together with the following review, address these 
requirements.
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could 
have an impact on the Group’s financial performance.
Global, Political and Economic conditions
The Group operates from sites in 12 countries and has either sales 
or sourcing arrangements with various other countries within Asia, 
Africa and South America. Whilst the Group benefits from the 
growth opportunities in these continents, it is similarly exposed to 
the economic, political and business risks associated with such 
international operations. Throughout its operations the Group 
encounters different legal and regulatory requirements including 
those for taxation, exchange control (including repatriation of profits), 
environmental, operational and competitive matters. A large part of 
the Group’s operations are dependent on the construction, public and 
private infrastructure and mining markets in Australia. Such markets 
are impacted by a number of factors including government policy, 
interest rates and commodity prices.
As highlighted in note 25 to the Financial Statements, the Group 
meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through cash and 
cash equivalents. The current economic conditions create uncertainty 
particularly over the level of demand for the Group’s products 
and services and the exchange rates we transact in, and thus the 
consequences for the cost of the Group’s raw materials.
Management monitor such risks and conditions, maintaining 
insurance cover and amending business procedures as appropriate to 
attempt to mitigate any exposure whilst remaining in compliance with 
local and Group requirements.
Foreign exchange
The Group operates in many countries, with substantially all of the 
Group’s operating profit earned outside the UK. As such, the Group is 
exposed to movements in exchange rates between sterling and other 
world currencies, particularly the South African rand and the US and 
Australian dollars, which could adversely or positively impact results.
Raw material and energy prices
The Group’s products and services utilise a range of raw materials 
most notably zinc, steel and manganese ore. Our operations 
also require substantial quantities of electricity and natural gas. 
The pricing for these raw material inputs is largely determined 
by international or national factors beyond the Group’s control or 
influence. Short-term volatility in the pricing of such inputs and any 
decrease in availability can significantly impact the Group’s financial 
performance.
The Group has developed strong relationships with its suppliers 
and uses contractual means where possible to minimise the risk. 
Contingency plans exist where availability of energy is an issue to 
ensure production is not disrupted.
Pensions
The Delta Pension Plan (DPP), the Group’s UK defined benefit plan, 
had an IAS 19 valuation net deficit of £2.5 million at 31 December 
2008 (2007: surplus of £9.5 million), with the DPP’s assets totalling 
£194.7 million and its liabilities totalling £197.2 million (2007: assets 
of £640.7 million and liabilities £631.2 million). 
Notwithstanding, the financial position of the DPP is exposed to the 
risk of changes in expected returns, the market value of investments, 
expected inflation and changes in the expected longevity of its 
members. The DPP is also exposed to changes in UK laws and 
regulations with regard to pension plans.
The next triennial valuation of the DPP liabilities is due as at 31 March 
2009 and we expect the Trustee Board will review the assumptions 
used for the 2006 valuation.  We also expect to discuss with the 
Trustee Board the best means possible to achieve their long term aim 
of funding the buy-out cost of the DPP.  In the meantime the Group’s 
financial position and performance has strengthened the Group’s 
employer covenant.  The buy-out cost of the DPP varies significantly 
with market conditions, particularly expected investment returns and 
inflation, as well as with mortality assumptions, and unfortunately, 
current market conditions do not afford an attractive buy-out cost.  
Nonetheless the Group continues to investigate means to further 
de-scale and de-risk the DPP in anticipation of improved market 
conditions.
Litigation and investigations
As with any business, the Group is subject to the risk of litigation from 
third parties. The Group seeks to address such claims proactively. 
In accordance with accounting requirements, provision is made 
where required to address such litigation and the consequent costs of 
defence.
Potential liabilities re disposed businesses
The Group’s divestment programme during the late 1990s and early 
2000s resulted in certain liabilities being retained pursuant to various 
agreements to dispose of those businesses and assets. Many, but not 
all, of these liabilities expire with the passage of time.
The Group proactively seeks timely resolution of such liabilities and 
estimates on a regular basis the expected financial outcome of such 
retained liabilities, and includes such estimates within provisions. 
Environmental liabilities
The Group conducts its operations with an aim to ensure compliance 
16498DELTAPLC.indd   15 16498DELTAPLC.indd   15 10/04/2009   10:56 10/04/2009   10:56 16 Delta plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2008     www.deltaplc.com
16498 08/04/2009 Proof 1
with all environmental laws and regulations. If necessary, the Group 
will commit the resources necessary to address non-compliances.
The Group has obligations to remediate contaminated sites both 
currently owned and in some cases those that have been sold. The 
Group maintains provisions for these liabilities which are reviewed 
regularly. 
Employees
The Group’s operations are typically based on small sites and 
are geographically disparate. The management teams employed 
are typically small and as such, the Group has a reliance on the 
management teams employed. The Group recognises the importance 
of this resource and as such, reviews its remuneration policy together 
with its recruitment and training policy on a regular basis in order to 
ensure the Group continues to retain and attract the best possible 
management teams. The Group also strives to implement successful 
management development and succession plans.
Key performance indicators
Given the range and geographical spread of businesses within the 
Group, key performance indicators are generally specific to the 
nature of the operations of each business. Additionally, a number 
of segment-based key metrics regarding financial and operating 
performance are focused upon at Group level.
With regard to health and safety, the Group employs Lost Time 
and Medically Treated Injury metrics, together with collecting near 
miss data. This data is reported to divisional and Group senior 
management on a monthly basis, together with commentary regarding 
remedial, corrective and continuous improvement actions. Given the 
spread of businesses within the Group and local country definitional 
differences, it is not possible to meaningfully aggregate such data. 
Consequently, this data is compiled at a business unit level only. 
In terms of environmental compliance, the Group employs key 
performance indicators through its varied businesses capturing 
performance against pre-defined benchmarks or targets for items 
including waste product tonnes per tonne of final product, energy 
use per tonne, scrap produced per tonne of final product, etc. The 
Group is actively seeking alternate uses for its waste streams. Similar 
to the health and safety measures described above, it is not possible 
to provide meaningful and accurate Group or segment-wide data 
as the challenges and opportunities in relation to environmental 
management are largely driven by local directives and objectives, 
which differ markedly throughout the Group. 
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of the structure of the Company’s share capital and changes 
in the share capital during the year are disclosed in note 30 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The ordinary shares in issue 
represent 93.2% of the issued share capital by nominal value, 
whereas the 6% Cumulative first preference shares in issue represent 
2.1% and the 4.5% Cumulative second preference shares in issue 
represent 4.7%.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares and preference shares are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House 
or by writing to the Deputy Secretary at the Company’s registered 
office. Voting at a general meeting is by a show of hands unless a poll 
is duly demanded.
Resolution 7 will be proposed at the annual general meeting to renew 
the directors’ authority to allot shares subject to the limits set out in 
the resolution.
The voting rights in respect of shares held by the Delta plc Employee 
Share Ownership Trust are exercisable by the Trustees. However, in 
accordance with investor protection guidelines, the Trustees abstain 
from voting and would take independent advice before accepting any 
offer for the Company in a takeover bid situation.
DIVIDENDS
The directors declared an interim dividend of 1.9p (2007: 1.6p) 
per ordinary share which was paid on 17 October 2008. They now 
recommend a final dividend of 4.6p (2007: 3.4p) per ordinary share 
making a total for the year of 6.5p (2007: 5.0p). 
ACQUISITION OF HI-LIGHT INDUSTRIES
On 7 January 2008, Delta acquired 100% of the shares of Hi-Light 
Industries Pty Ltd (“Hi-Light”) from its former private owners for a 
total consideration plus expenses of £2.9 million, including deferred 
consideration of £0.3 million. The deferred consideration is due to be 
paid in 2009 and 2010 in two equal instalments. 
Hi-Light is a manufacturer and installer of architectural sunscreen 
systems, and a supplier of aluminium walkways and handrails. The 
business is reported in the Engineered Steel Products segment. 
DONATIONS
During the year the Group donated £22,000 (2007: £5,000) to

GOING CONCERN
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going 
concern. The Group has considerable financial resources, with net 
cash of £109.6 million at 31 December 2008. As highlighted in the 
Chief Executive’s Review, our outlook for 2009 remains cautious, 
however, the Group continues to trade profitably, and is expected to 
be cash-generative for the year.
Consequently, after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and to successfully manage the identified business risks 
disclosed in note 25 to the Group’s financial statements. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements.
AUDITORS AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
So far as each person currently serving as a director of the Company 
at the date this report is approved is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and 
each director hereby confirms that he has taken all the steps that he 
ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditors to the Company will 
be proposed at the annual general meeting.
This report was approved by the Board of directors on 25 March 
2009 and is signed on its behalf by: 
Todd Atkinson
Director
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group spent £0.6 million during 2008 (2007: £0.6 million) 
on research and development primarily associated with product 
development and the improvement of production processes. The 
criteria in IAS 38 for capitalising such expenditure were not met and 
consequently all such expenditure was expensed as incurred.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND TREASURY POLICIES
Details of the Group’s financial risk management and treasury policies 
are contained in notes 2 and 25.
PAYMENT OF CREDITORS
The Group’s policy in respect of the majority of its trade creditors 
is to negotiate terms and conditions and, provided these are met, 
payments are made accordingly. Where payment terms are not 
specifically agreed, trade creditors are paid in accordance with local 
commercial practice.
Trade creditor days for the Group for the year ended 31 December 
2008 were 43 days (2007: 37 days), based upon the average daily 
amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
INSURANCE OF DIRECTORS
The Company maintains insurance for its directors and officers 
against liabilities and has entered into qualifying third party 
indemnities with its directors, as permitted by the Companies Act 
2006. The indemnities are available for inspection during normal 
business hours at the Company’s registered office and will be 
available at the annual general meeting. 
APPOINTMENT / REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS
Details governing the appointment and replacement of directors are 
contained in the Corporate Governance Report under the heading 
“The Board, its directors and operations”. 
POWER TO PURCHASE OWN SHARES
The directors believe that it remains advantageous for the Company 
to be able to purchase its own ordinary shares in the market. 
Accordingly, resolution 9, which will be proposed as a special 
resolution at the annual general meeting, seeks to renew the existing 
general authority to make market purchases. The Company did not 
purchase any of its own shares during the year and the directors have 
no present intention of utilising this authority.

Corporate Governance Report
described below. Where considered appropriate, training is made 
available to directors and training needs are assessed as part of the 
Board evaluation procedure referred to below.
All Non-Executive directors are appointed for an initial three year 
period following which the appointment is renewable at the option of 
the Board for two further terms of three years. The maximum period 
of appointment is nine years. However, directors must stand for 
election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting following 
their initial appointment. Terms and conditions of appointment for 
Non-Executive directors are available for inspection upon request 
during normal business hours and at the annual general meeting and 
are referred to in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Each year the number nearest to but not exceeding one-third of 
the directors (excluding those directors retiring and not seeking 
re-election and those retiring and seeking election following their 
appointment during the year) retires by rotation. Whilst the Company’s 
articles of association do not expressly provide that each director will 
offer himself for re-election at no more than three-year intervals, the 
directors, being cognisant of developing best practice, undertake to 
ensure that each director will offer himself for re-election at no more 
than three-year intervals.
BOARD COMMITTEES
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee presently comprises Steven Marshall 
(Chairman), Mark Lejman and Andrew Walker.
The Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of 
the Board and recommends changes thereto to the Board for its 
consideration. The Committee meets as and when required and 
engages external consultants to identify candidates to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee presently comprises Andrew Walker (Chairman) 
and Mark Lejman. The Board has determined that Andrew Walker 
has recent and relevant financial experience for the purpose of the 
Combined Code.
The Chief Executive and other senior executives, whilst not members 
of the Committee, are invited to attend meetings of the Committee 
when required. 
The Committee is responsible for:
n monitoring the financial reporting process by reviewing interim 
and annual accounts before their submission to the Board;
n reviewing and monitoring the independence of the statutory 
auditor by advising the Board on the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of external Auditors and their remuneration both for 
audit and non-audit work;
n monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control, 
internal audit function and risk management systems; and
n monitoring the statutory audit of the annual and consolidated 
accounts.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
which it considers are critical to business integrity and to maintaining 
investors’ trust in the Company. This statement, together with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, seeks to demonstrate how the 
principles of good governance, advocated by the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (2006) (“Code”) have been applied. 
The Company has complied with Section 1 of the Code for the 
duration of the year.
THE BOARD, ITS DIRECTORS AND OPERATIONS
As of the date of this report, the Board comprises three Non-
Executive directors and two Executive directors, whose names and 
brief biographies appear on page 14. All the Non-Executive directors 
are considered independent.
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
were clearly separated.
The Board is the principal decision-making forum of the Group and 
exercises overall control of the Group’s affairs by addressing matters 
reserved for its decision. These include responsibility for the Group’s 
strategy, the approval of financial and other public statements, 
acquisitions and disposals, treasury and risk management policies 
and the appointment and removal of Executive management and the 
Company Secretary. Various operational matters of a specified size or 
importance are referred to the Board for approval in accordance with 
an established delegation of authority.
Comprehensive briefing papers are distributed to Board members by 
the Company Secretary, sufficiently in advance of each Board meeting 
to enable detailed review. Such papers address strategic matters, 
items reserved for Board review and approval, forecast, budget and 
actual financial results, changes to risks and controls, and various 
other matters which should reasonably be considered by the Board. 
This practice ensures that the Board is supplied with information on 
the Group’s businesses in a timely manner, and that the directors 
are properly briefed to discuss such items at Board meetings. A 
statement of the directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual 
Report and Accounts is set out on page 28.
The Group’s procedures allow directors to seek both independent 
professional advice, at the Group’s expense, and the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary in order to fulfil their duties.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of 
directors’ and officers’ liabilities.
During the year, the Chairman met with the other Non-Executive 
directors without the presence of the Executive directors. The 
independent Non-Executive directors also met during the year without 
the presence of the Chairman.
The Non-Executive directors play a leading role in corporate 
accountability and governance through their membership on the 
various committees of the Board. The membership and remit of 
each committee, together with a record of directors’ attendance, is

Corporate Governance Report
The Committee reviewed written confirmation from Deloitte LLP’s of 
its independence and objectivity, relating to external audit services, 
within the context of applicable regulatory requirements and 
professional standards. A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as 
auditors until the conclusion of the annual general meeting in 2010 
will be proposed at the Company’s 2009 annual general meeting. 
In addition, the Committee reviewed the appointment, remuneration 
and utilisation of the Group’s internal audit function, which during the 
year was outsourced to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. A review of the 
Group’s internal audit function is provided in the internal control and 
risk management disclosure statement below. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee presently comprises Mark Lejman 
(Chairman), Steven Marshall and Andrew Walker.

are shown in the table below:
on a regular basis. Significant points from such meetings are 
communicated to the Board on a regular basis.
Shareholders are afforded an opportunity to meet or converse with 
the Senior Independent Director to address any items regarding the 
Group.
During the year shareholders were kept informed of the progress of 
the Group through trading statements and other announcements 
of significant developments that were released through the London 
Stock Exchange and which are available on the Company’s website.
Additionally, individual shareholders were afforded the opportunity to 
question the Chairman and the chairmen of the Board committees 
at the annual general meeting. The Annual Report and Accounts 
and notice of the annual general meeting are sent to shareholders at 
Procedures exist within the Group to promptly identify any potential 
non-audit services for pre-approval.
In fulfilling its responsibility of monitoring the integrity of the financial 
reports to shareholders, the Committee reviewed the accounting 
principles, policies and practices adopted in preparing financial 
information. The annual report, interim report and preliminary 
announcement were reviewed, as was the accounting treatment of 
material transactions open to different approaches. The Committee 
considers reports from management and the external Auditors in 
determining the accounting treatment of material transactions open to 
different approaches. 
Information on the internal control and risk management systems 
and the review thereof is provided in the internal control and risk 
management disclosure statement below. 
The Committee approved the external Auditors’ terms of engagement, 
scope of work, the process for the 2008 interim review and the 
applicable levels of materiality. The Committee reviewed all matters 
of significance with the external Auditors based on their findings and 
confirmed that all matters had been satisfactorily resolved. 
The audit partner of Deloitte LLP has a direct line of communication 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Committee reviewed the 
external Auditors’ performance and concluded that it was satisfactory. 
BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
During the year a formal evaluation of the performance of the Board, 
its committees and individual directors was carried out by means of 
detailed questionnaires.
The results of the questionnaires were discussed by the Board. 
The process confirmed that the Board and its committees were 
functioning correctly, and that all the directors continued to contribute 
positively to the Board.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Communication with shareholders is given priority and a number of 
methods are used to promote greater understanding and dialogue 
with investment audiences.

(iv) Annual statements of compliance
The Group has an established framework of policies and procedures 
laid down by the Board to which senior management are expected 
to comply and attest such compliance on an annual basis. These 
policies cover key issues including authorisation levels, segregation of 
duties, ethical and legislative compliance as well as health, safety and 
environmental issues.
(v) Internal audit
The Group has an internal audit function, which during the year 
was outsourced to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Business units are 
selected for internal audit using a risk-based approach, with one or 
more locations of each business unit audited on at least a three year 
rotational basis. The scope and results of internal audit’s work are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee, and the resolution of points raised 
is overseen by Group senior management and reported to the Audit 
Committee to ensure resolution in a timely and satisfactory manner. 
Internal audit reports and reports monitoring the resolution of points 
raised are shared with the external auditors. The Group’s internal 
audit resource has a direct line of communication to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee.
The internal audit function has been reviewed by the Audit 
Committee, which has concluded the function effective in achieving 
its objectives.
(vi) Whistle-blowing procedures
The Group has whistle-blowing procedures in place providing 
employees with a means of communicating, independent of Executive 
management, any concern relating to perceived malpractice, 
improper business practices, management impropriety or other 
similar matters. No reports were received during the year.
least 20 working days prior to the meeting. The Company indicates 
the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of each resolution proposed 
at the annual general meeting, together with the number of proxy 
votes for and against each resolution and the number of shares 
withheld, following each vote on a show of hands. Abstentions are 
also disclosed.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for the operation and effectiveness of 
the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management 
(excluding associates and joint ventures) and undertakes to direct the 
identification, evaluation and management of significant risks faced 
by the Group. This process is regularly reviewed and is in accordance 
with Turnbull guidance.
Internal control systems are designed to meet the Group’s particular 
needs and the risks to which it is exposed. By their nature, the 
Group’s internal control systems provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against misstatement or loss.
The effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control has been 
reviewed by the Board during 2008 and up to the date of this Annual 
Report. The key procedures which the directors have established to 
provide effective internal control are as follows:
(i) Regular review of risks and compensating controls
The Group’s schedule of risks and compensating controls is formally 
considered by the Board twice a year. All areas of the business are 
required to undertake risk-profiling exercises to formally review 
their principal areas of risk, which forms the basis for the schedule 
reviewed by the Board.
Risks and controls are discussed during business unit half-year and 
profit plan reviews, which are attended by the Chief Executive and 
members of senior divisional and Group management. Changes to 
such risks and controls are identified in each business unit’s monthly 
report. Any changes of significance are reported to the Board. 
Schedules of pending litigation and potential liabilities pertaining to 
disposed businesses are circulated to the Board.
(ii) Delegation of authority
The Group’s delegation of authority details authority, referral and 
reporting requirements with respect to certain transactions, events 
or occurrences. The delegation of authority forms part of the Group 
Policy Manual.
(iii) Detailed budgeting and subsequent review
Each business unit is required to prepare, on an annual basis, a 
detailed plan covering the next three years, addressing both financial 
and non-financial objectives. Such plans are reviewed at divisional 
and Group levels, and ultimately approved by the Board, as part of 
the Group’s profit plan.
Actual performance against budget and detailed forecasts is reported 
on a monthly basis. Written monthly reports accompany monthly 
financial schedules and contain variance analyses (in the case of 
financial data) and commentary (in the case of non-financial data).

Corporate Governance Report / Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate Social Responsibility
COMMUNITY
We continue to recognise the importance of our relationship with the 
communities in which we operate and encourage our businesses 
and employees to provide support to their communities. Given the 
structure of the Group, community contact is currently organised 
by the site managers who place a high value in establishing and 
maintaining good relationships.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Group is committed to providing a safe workplace for our 
employees, and to ensuring that contractors, customers or other 
visitors to any of our sites are entering a safe environment.
The Group has increased its efforts to achieve an environment 
which does not tolerate accidents. This year a great deal of effort 
and training has taken place to increase the understanding of the 
importance and significance of this subject. 
All lost time injuries or medically treated injuries are investigated and 
fully documented. This helps us to ensure that each site is moving 
towards an environment that minimises any possibility of a repeat 
incident or any other incident that may be closely aligned to it. Our 
aim and desire is to achieve a zero tolerance philosophy towards 
accidents in the workplace. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Group is committed to best environmental practice. We seek to 
minimise the impact on the environment of the Group’s operations by 
means of environmentally sound practices which take practical steps 
to control effectively or eliminate any known pollution.
The nature of some of our manufacturing processes potentially 
exposes the environment to risks that require careful and appropriate 
management. The Group proactively pursues compliance, and targets 
best practice in all areas of environmental compliance. Environmental 
policies and practices are tailored to local regulatory requirements, 
with best practice developments shared between our facilities where 
appropriate. Employees are briefed by management in matters of 
policy and procedure relating to potential environmental risk that 
may concern their particular area of operation. Internal reporting 
and review procedures that apply to health and safety also apply to 
environmental matters to ensure that actual or potential issues are 
reported promptly for action. Environmental incidents are reported to 
the Board through the divisional monthly reports.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The following sections of the Directors’ remuneration report are unaudited.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended) and the relevant requirements of the UK Listing 
Authority’s Listing Rules. A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the Company.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE (THE “COMMITTEE”)
Role and composition of the Committee
The role of the Committee includes:
(a) determining and agreeing with the Board the policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chairman, Executive directors, and members of 
senior management;
(b) approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance related pay schemes operated by the Company and approving the total 
annual payments made under such schemes; 
(c) reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders; and
(d) determining the remuneration for the Company’s Chairman, Executive directors and senior management.
The Board, within the limits prescribed by the Company’s articles of association, determines Non-Executive directors’ remuneration. 
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the Company’s website at www.deltaplc.com and copies are available on request.
The Committee presently comprises Mark Lejman (Chairman), Steven Marshall and Andrew Walker.
The Committee met three times during the year. The Chief Executive attends Committee meetings by invitation when required. The Chairman and 
Chief Executive are excluded from matters regarding their own remuneration. No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration. 
In order to remain informed of the latest developments and market trends in remuneration best practice, the Committee has access to survey 
information and advice from independent remuneration consultants where the Committee determines this is required. During the year, the 
Committee considered market remuneration data produced by Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants. Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants also 
reviewed and confirmed whether the performance conditions under the Performance Share Plan had been met in respect of awards vesting during 
the financial year. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
General remuneration policy
The Committee, in setting remuneration policy for executive directors and senior management, recognises the need to be competitive in an 
international market. The Committee’s policy is to set remuneration levels which ensure that Executives are fairly and responsibly rewarded in 
return for high levels of performance. The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to support key business strategies, align the interests of 
Executive directors and senior management with those of shareholders and create a strong, performance-oriented environment and at the same 
time attract, motivate and retain talent. Accordingly, all Executive directors and senior management receive competitive basic salaries comparable 
with companies of a similar size and international scope and have the opportunity to earn enhanced total remuneration for performance measured 
against targets set by the Committee. 
Components of Executive Directors’ Remuneration
REMUNERATION MIX
The key components of the remuneration of the executive directors are basic salary, annual performance-related bonuses, share-based incentives 
and pensions.
The Group has an on-going strategic challenge to re-shape its business portfolio and actively manage legacy matters including the Delta Pension 
Plan. With such challenges in mind, the Committee determined in 2006, in consultation with shareholders, that executive directors’ remuneration 
would place more emphasis on annual incentives rather than longer-term incentives with a total remuneration package that is broadly market 
competitive. Within this mix, the equity related component is significant with 50% of the annual incentive and the entire longer-term incentive 
being equity based. 
In 2008, 47.3% of the Chief Executive’s remuneration on an expected-value basis was performance related; for the Finance Director the figure was 
49.5% (see illustrative charts below).

Directors’ Remuneration Report
BASIC SALARY 
The basic salary of the Executive directors is reviewed annually by the Committee and is targeted at the upper quartile of companies of comparable 
size. This is in line with the Committee’s objective to attract and retain Executive directors who have the right skills and experience and are of the 
highest calibre. Basic salaries are the only pensionable element of remuneration.
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUSES AND THE DEFERRED BONUS PLAN (DBP)
The maximum potential annual performance related bonuses for the Chief Executive and Finance Director are 150% and 140% of basic salary 
respectively. One-half of any bonus payable is paid in cash and the other half is deferred in ordinary shares in the Company through the Deferred 
Bonus Plan, which provides a substantial portion of the executive directors’ equity based incentive compensation.  
Annual performance related bonuses are determined by the Committee with reference to the Group’s financial performance (50% of total bonus) 
and the achievement of agreed specific personal objectives (50%).
Group financial performance is measured with reference to two separate tests of financial performance: (i) earnings per share from continuing 
operations, excluding exceptional items, and (ii) cash flow generated prior to acquisitions, disposals, dividends and shares issues and/or buy 
backs. The earnings test is given a two-thirds weighting, and the free cash flow test is given a one-third weighting.
The Committee reviews the Group’s actual financial performance against the Group’s approved annual budget, taking into account unforeseen 
circumstances to the extent the Committee in its sole discretion considers appropriate.
The 2008 bonuses payable to the Chief Executive and Finance Director were determined by the Committee in line with the foregoing, and their 
2009 bonuses will be determined in the same manner. For purposes of 2008 bonuses, a full payout was awarded in respect of the Group’s 
financial performance.
Deferred bonus share awards are determined with reference to 50% of the total bonus payable as determined by the Committee and calculated 
with a share price equal to the average of the middle-market quotation of shares over the five dealing days immediately preceding the grant date.
Deferred bonus share awards are forfeited on cessation of employment prior to the normal vesting date (the third anniversary of grant) except in 
the case of “good leavers” in which case the deferred shares are vested upon cessation of employment. The deferred shares would also be vested 
early on a change of control of the Company
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
Under the terms of the PSP, selected individuals may be granted a conditional award of ordinary shares in the Company, ordinarily vesting on 
the third anniversary of grant subject to continued employment within the Group and the satisfaction of performance conditions. Awards also 
rest on a change of control of the Company, and if an employee leaves the Group as a “good leaver”.
Vesting of awards granted during 2008 is subject to performance targets relating to the Company’s relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
compared to that of the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding investment trusts) (Comparator Group) over a fixed three-year 
period. 
Shares will vest, subject to the Committee confirming that the Company’s underlying financial performance has been satisfactory over the 
performance period (“Financial Underpin Condition”), as follows:
Rank of the Company’s TSR Performance against the Comparator Group 
  % 
 of award vesting
Below median 0
Median 25
Upper quartile 100
Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between median and upper quartile.
The Committee considers that a combination of the relative measure TSR and the Financial Underpin Condition suitably aligns participants’ 
interests with investors.
Awards under the PSP are limited to a total number of shares having a market value at the date of grant of no more than 50% of the grantee’s 
salary, except in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, where a grant may be as much as 100% of the grantee’s salary. 
The market value is the average of the middle-market quotation of the shares over the five dealing days immediately preceding the date of 
grant. 
Share Award Scheme for Chief Executive
A one-off share award of 264,961 ordinary shares in the Company was granted to Mr Atkinson on 4 January 2006 at an option price of £nil. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the shares vested on 30 September 2008 and upon exercise of the option Mr Atkinson was also entitled 
to shares equal in value to the dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the period between the date of grant and the 
date of vesting.

EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME (ESOS)
Grants under the ESOS, approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting held in May 1999, were made annually until 2005 and 
had values of up to one times annual salary. No further grants are to be made under the ESOS.
Options granted before 29 June 2001 are subject to the following performance conditions: 
(i)  on or before the tenth anniversary of the grant date, earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive years must equal 
or exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum; and 
(ii)  earnings per share before exceptional items must equal or exceed 20 pence.
Options granted on or after 29 June 2001 are subject to the following performance condition: on or before the sixth anniversary of the grant 
date, earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive years must equal or exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 
3% per annum.
All options are granted for £nil consideration. The exercise price for options is the five day average price preceding the date of grant. 
Subject to the fulfilment of the foregoing performance conditions, options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date 
and also on a change of control of the Company.
All performance conditions are measured against earnings per share before exceptional items for the financial year preceding option grant. The 
performance conditions for the ESOS options granted in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 have been satisfied, whilst the performance conditions 
for the options granted in 1999 and 2000 have not been satisfied. 
PENSIONS
Executive directors are invited to participate in the Delta Pension Plan. The plan is a funded, HM Revenue & Customs approved, final salary 
occupational pension scheme, and provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to completion of 20 years’ 
pensionable service and retirement at normal retirement age. Final pensionable salary is calculated with reference to basic salary and not other 
elements of remuneration and is limited by HM Revenue & Customs limits including HM Revenue & Customs earnings cap. The Delta Pension 
Plan introduced a “notional” Earnings Cap (Notional Cap) from 6 April 2006 to ensure that, for members impacted at the time by the Earnings 
Cap, benefits and contributions continue to be calculated in the same way. 
The Delta Pension Plan also provides lump sum life assurance cover of up to four times pensionable salary and makes provision for spouses’ 
and dependants’ pensions and early retirement provisions, including ill health. All plan benefits are subject to HM Revenue & Customs limits.
By Deed dated 23 October 2003 the Company established a retirement benefits scheme for Mr Atkinson known as the Delta plc Funded 
Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme (the “FURB Scheme”).  The FURB Scheme is a sponsored superannuation scheme as defined in 
Section 624 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, and obligated the Company to make contributions to the scheme equal to forty 
percent (40%) of the portion of Mr Atkinson’s basic salary that exceeded the equivalent of the cap formerly imposed by section 590C of the 
Income and Corporations Taxes Act 1988.  The FURB scheme was amended effective 1 April 2006 such that no further contributions have been 
made to the scheme since that date and instead the Company has made supplemental salary payments to Mr Atkinson in the same amount.  
Those supplemental salary payments are subject to tax withholdings.  In due course, the FURB Scheme will be dissolved and the investment 
account will be distributed to Mr Atkinson in lieu of any pension entitlement under the Scheme.
Messrs Atkinson and Kempster receive a supplement to their annual salaries equal to 40% and 20% respectively of the portion of their basic 
salaries that exceeds the equivalent of the Notional Cap referred to above. 
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive directors, whereby the Committee expects them to retain 50% of shares acquired under 
the Company’s share incentive plans (after tax and any financing costs), until a holding of 100% of salary is achieved.
Components of Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Remuneration for Non-Executive directors consists of an annual fee for their services on the Board and Board committees and where 
appropriate for devoting additional time and expertise for the benefit of the Group. Non-Executive directors do not participate in any of the 
Group’s performance-related bonus or share-based incentives nor are they eligible for membership of any of the Group’s pension plans.
The remuneration of Non-Executive directors and Chairman are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain market-competitive. Non-Executive 
directors’ remuneration is reviewed by the Chairman and the Executive directors and approved by the Board as a whole. The remuneration of 
the Chairman is reviewed and set by the Committee. 
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
It is the Company’s policy that the period of notice for Executive directors will not exceed 12 months.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The service contracts of Messrs Atkinson and Kempster provide for no additional termination payments beyond statutory payments that may be 
applicable.
The Non-Executive directors have no formal service contracts, but have letters of engagement that do not provide for notice periods or for 
compensation payable upon termination.
The Committee strives to achieve an appropriate balance between ensuring continuity, minimising termination payments and limiting notice 
periods to no more than 12 months.
The following sections of the Remuneration Report are audited.

PENSIONS
Pension entitlements under defined benefit pension schemes
Retirement benefits on a defined benefit basis are accruing to two directors as at 31 December 2008 (2007: two directors). The accrued pension 
entitlements shown in the table immediately below are the amounts that would be paid in each year on retirement at normal retirement age, based 
on pensionable service to the end of the financial year. The normal retirement age for Messrs Atkinson and Kempster is 60 and 65 respectively. 
The Plan also provides spouse’s pension, which is 50% of the deceased director’s prospective pension or, in the case of death in service, one-
third of final pensionable salary if greater. Following retirement, pensions increase at an annual rate in line with RPI up to 5%. The Company 
has the discretionary power to grant early retirement pensions but a member does not have an absolute right to an early retirement pension. No 
discretionary benefits are allowed for in the transfer values.
The following Executive directors had accrued entitlements under the Delta Pension Plan as follows:

 The pension entitlement is that which would be paid annually on retirement at normal retirement age, based on service to the end of the year or date of leaving, whichever is earlier.

 The increase in the accrued pension during the year has been adjusted to remove any distortion due to inflation over the year.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
n select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
n make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
n state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
n prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent 
Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We Confirm To The Best Of Our Knowledge:
1. The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
2. The management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties they face.
By order of the Board
Chief Executive Finance Director
Todd Atkinson Jon Kempster
25 March 2009 25 March 2009 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. The directors are required by the IAS 
Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The Group financial statements are also required by 
law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires 
the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance 
with all applicable IFRSs. However, directors are also required to:
n properly select and apply accounting policies;
n present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and 
n provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). The parent Company financial statements are 
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its 
risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited Group financial statements. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further 
information outside the Annual Report. 
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as 
having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation 
of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance 
that the consolidated financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
n the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of 
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its 
loss for the year then ended; 
n the consolidated financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation;
n the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as 
having been audited has been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985; and
n the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with 
the Group financial statements.

statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial 
statements give a true and fair view, whether the consolidated 
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
whether the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described 
as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our 
opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the consolidated financial statements. The information given in 
the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in 
the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Financial 
Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the 
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 FRC 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board’s statement on internal 
control covers all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2008
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Delta plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985 (as amended). The 
principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) are described in the ‘Group at a Glance’ section of the Annual Report and 
listed in note 19.
The reporting currency of Delta plc is sterling. The functional currency of Delta’s subsidiaries, associates and joint venture have been 
determined in accordance with IAS 21 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates” to be the currency of the country in which each 
operation is incorporated, with the exception of Manganese Metal Company, an associate, whose functional currency has been determined 
to be the United States dollar. 
Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has elected to implement IFRS 8: Operating Segments in advance of its effective date of 1 January 2009. Two interpretations 
issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) are effective for the current year. They are:
IFRIC 11: IFRS 2 — Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
IFRIC 14: IAS 19 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Group’s accounting policies in these consolidated financial 
statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:
IAS 1 (Revised) Presentation of financial statements
IAS 23 (Revised) Borrowing Costs
IFRS 2 (Revised) Share-based payments vesting conditions and cancellations
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements
The directors continue to evaluate the impact of these Standards and Interpretations but do not currently anticipate that the future adoption 
of them will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted in the European Union, and they therefore 
comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for 
the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis (see the Directors’ Report on page 17 of this Annual 
Report for further details).
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all years presented in these financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the results, cash flows, assets and liabilities of Delta plc and all its subsidiaries, recognising 
any minority interest in those subsidiaries, together with the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its associates and joint venture. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint venture are prepared as of the same reporting date using consistent accounting 
policies. Intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries, including any unrealised profits arising from intercompany 
transactions, are eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries are entities where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanied by a share 
of more than 50% of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are 
included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them. Where a subsidiary is less than 100% owned by the Group, the minority 
interest share of the results and net assets are recognised at each reporting date. Where a company with minority interests has net liabilities, 
no asset is recorded within minority interests unless the minority shareholder has an obligation to make good its share of the net liabilities. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has the power to exercise significant influence but not control or joint control, generally 
accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Joint ventures are entities subject to joint control, that is when the 
strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. If the Group’s share of losses in an associate or 
joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 
obligations in relation to or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. The cost of a business combination is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and any equity instruments issued by 
the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, together with any costs directly attributable to the combination. The identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or 
disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
16498DELTAPLC.indd   34 16498DELTAPLC.indd   34 10/04/2009   10:56 10/04/2009   10:56 35
16498 08/04/2009 Proof 1
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
which are recognised at fair value less costs to sell. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the identifiable assets (including any intangibles recognised), liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Business combinations continued
The interests of minority shareholders in the acquiree are initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in business combinations represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the identifiable assets (including any intangibles recognised), liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, associate or joint 
venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment loss. Goodwill is tested at least annually for 
impairment or if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is calculated in accordance with IAS 36 
“Impairment of assets” and is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Goodwill 
subsisting on disposal of the related operation is taken to the consolidated income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. They are amortised in accordance with 
the relevant income stream over their useful lives from the time they are first available for use. The estimated time useful lives vary according 
to the specific use of the asset but are typically: 1 to 3 years for customer relationships; up to 1 year for customer order backlogs; and 1 to 5 
years for trademarks and brand. Intangible assets which are not being amortised are subject to annual impairment reviews. 
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control 
over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, 
except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets 
held for sale and discontinued operations. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet 
at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of 
individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the 
investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
relevant associate.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset 
(or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and is recognised when the Group has transferred 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and services to the buyer, when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably 
and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue is measured net of 
discounts, value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue is typically recognised once the Group has performed its services for the customer, evidenced either by delivery of finished goods or 
other evidence of completion of work.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.

For the year ended 31 December 2008
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the liability and finance charge to produce a constant rate of interest on the 
finance lease balance outstanding. Assets capitalised under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life of the 
asset or the lease term. 
Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in 
the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any incentives to enter into operating leases are recognised 
as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
Foreign currencies
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency. The 
functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. 
The functional currency of all the Group’s subsidiaries and joint venture is the currency of the country in which that subsidiary or joint 
venture operates. Manganese Metal Company, the Group’s 49% South African associate, uses the US dollar as its functional currency.
The presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of Delta plc is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the entity using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into pound sterling using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the 
income statements are translated into pound sterling using the average exchange rate for the year. Where this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, the exchange rate on the transaction date is used. 
Exchange differences arising upon consolidation are taken to the cumulative translation reserve in equity. The cumulative exchange 
difference held in shareholders’ equity in respect of an operation is transferred to the consolidated income statement upon disposal.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
Operating profit
Operating profit is defined as revenue from continuing operations less related expenses and is stated before the share of post-tax profits/
(losses) of associates and joint venture and before investment income, other gains and losses, finance costs and tax. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered by the directors, either individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, as being 
material and which require disclosure in order to provide additional information to assist the understanding of the financial information. 
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans. 
A defined benefit pension plan is one that specifies the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. The 
Group operates a number of funded defined benefit pension plans, where actuarially determined payments are made to trustee-
administered funds. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
The Group accounts for actuarial gains and losses in full through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in the year 
in which they occur. Where the actuarial valuation of the plan demonstrates that the plan is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to 
that for which the Group can benefit in the future. 
The current service cost is included in distribution costs and administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. Past service 
costs, if any, are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period. Gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are taken to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expenses.
The expected return on assets of funded defined benefit pension plans is recorded in other gains and losses in the consolidated income 
statement. The expected interest on pension plan liabilities is recorded in finance costs in the consolidated income statement.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Retirement benefit costs continued
A defined contribution plan is one under which fixed contributions are paid to a third party. The Group has no further payment obligations 
once these contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised in the consolidated income statement when they are due.
Taxation
The Group’s liability for current tax, including UK and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from reported profit in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and 
liabilities used in the computation of taxable profit and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is provided for on unremitted 
earnings within the Group where it is expected that these earnings will be distributed in the future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred 
tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to corporate taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises 
purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated on 
a straight-line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings  50 years
Leasehold property Term of lease
Plant and machinery, including motor vehicles 4 to 25 years
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5 years
Research and development
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred. Expenditure incurred on 
development projects is capitalised as an intangible asset from the point that it is probable that the expenditure will generate sufficient 
future economic benefits and the costs can be measured reliably. Previously expensed development expenditure is not reinstated in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis for our Galvanizing 
Services’ related businesses or otherwise a weighted average cost basis. Cost comprises directly attributable purchase and conversion 
costs and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less 
estimated costs of completion and marketing, selling and distribution costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items 
where appropriate. 
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, the Group makes an estimate of recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the 
asset is written down to its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use and is 
determined for an individual asset. If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets

 or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. The present value of 
estimated future cash flows is calculated using discount rates reflecting the risks specific to that asset and the current market assessment of 
the time value of money for the value in use calculation. Impairments are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of the recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised in income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation increase. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, money market 
deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities at acquisition of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
•  Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching maturities of the contracts.
•  Foreign currency options are measured using quoted foreign exchange rates, yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching 
maturities of the contracts and foreign currency volatilities derivied from quoted prices for similar foreign currency options.
•  The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid 
markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices.
•  The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted 
pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes 
for similar instruments.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair 
value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at 
fair value. 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-
maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and 
purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets through profit and loss (FVTPL)
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks 
and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host.
‘Held-to-maturity’ investments
Bills of exchange and debentures with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent and 
ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method less any impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis.
‘Available for sale’
The Group has an investment in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market that was formerly classified as an associate. However, 
following the initiation of a formal sales process by the majority shareholder, the Group has re-classified the investment as ‘available-for-sale’.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in income when there is objective evidence that the asset is 
impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks 
and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealised gains 
or losses reported in profit or loss.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees on points paid or 
received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life 
of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL. The Group 
chooses not to disclose the effective interest rate for debt instruments that are classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained 
interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing 
for the proceeds received.
Trade payables
Trade payables, loans and other payables are measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of 
foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign 
exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along 
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. 
Note 25 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. 
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss immediately, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged 
risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the ‘other gains and losses’ 
line of the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line 
of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of 
a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in 
the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Cash flow hedges continued
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a present obligation (legal or constructive) exists in respect of a past event, it is probable that a transfer 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated by the directors. Where the 
impact is material, provisions are discounted to present value.
Share-based payments
The Group operates various equity-settled incentive schemes for certain employees. For equity-settled share options and awards, the 
services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options or awards granted. Fair value is calculated 
at grant date and recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options or awards that will eventually vest. Vesting 
conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating fair value. 
Fair value is measured using either the Black–Scholes option pricing or Stochastic model. The expected life used in the model has been 
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
Investments in own shares (held through an Employee Share Ownership Trust) are shown at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity 
and shown under the heading “Employee Share Ownership Trust” in the consolidated balance sheet. The costs of administration of the 
Employee Share Ownership Trust are included in the consolidated income statement as they accrue. Dividends on shares held by the Trust 
have been waived.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies which are described above, management has made various judgements that 
potentially have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. These judgements relate primarily to the 
following items:
Pensions (see note 40)
The obligation in respect of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to 
mortality, inflation, salary increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. Any change in these assumptions would impact the 
retirement benefit obligation recognised. 
Provisions in respect of disposed entities (see note 28)
Provisions in respect of disposed entities relate to the current estimate of future liabilities expected to arise as a result of businesses 
disposed, where the Group has retained responsibility for items including product warranty, product liability and environmental remediation. 
At the end of each reporting period management performs a detailed assessment of expected future cash outflows relating to these 
obligations, and adjusts remaining provisions accordingly. In reviewing these provisions consideration is given to the historical utilisation of 
such provisions, and the expected costs of works either ongoing currently or reasonably expected to be undertaken for which the Group 
would be liable.
Carrying amount of certain assets and goodwill (see note 16)
In reviewing the carrying value of certain assets and capitalised goodwill, estimates of future financial performance of the assets and 
businesses concerned are taken into account. The estimates inherently include assumptions of internal and external factors that, whilst 
considered reasonable at the date of these accounts, may change in the future from those levels currently expected.
Intangible assets arising on acquisition (see note 17)
In determining the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisition the directors are required to make judgements regarding the timing 
and amount of future cash flows applicable to the businesses being acquired, discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The directors 
estimate the appropriate discount rate using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the businesses being acquired.
The useful life used to amortise intangible assets relates to the future performance of the assets acquired and management’s judgement of 
the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. 
Deferred tax assets (see note 29)
Deferred tax has only been recognised where it has been assumed that the deferred tax asset is recoverable. The accumulated losses 
reported by the Group for tax purposes in various tax jurisdictions have not been recognised as deferred tax assets where the directors hold 
the view that it is improbable that the Group will be able to utilise them in the future. The future use, if any, of these accumulated losses will 
depend upon applicable tax rules and regulations, and upon the Group generating appropriate taxable income in those jurisdictions.

5 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in advance of its effective date, with effect from 1 January 2008. IFRS 8 requires 
operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief 
Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. In contrast, the predecessor Standard (IAS 14 Segment 
Reporting) required the Group to identify two sets of segments (business and geographical), using a risks and rewards approach, with 
the Group’s system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as a starting point for the identification of 
such segments. However, as the Group is organised into three operating divisions, Engineered Steel Products, Galvanizing Services and 
Manganese Materials, and these operating divisions were both the basis on which the Group reported its primary segment information under 
IAS 14 and the basis for internal reporting to the Chief Executive, no fundamental change in segments has been required.
The details of the principal activities are as follows: 
 Engineered Steel Products Manufacture and distribution of galvanized steel products, grinding media and engineered tooling. 
 Galvanizing Services Provision of hot-dip galvanizing and zinc reclamation services. 
 Manganese Materials Manufacture and distribution of electrolytic manganese dioxide for use in the manufacture of primary 
batteries and producer of electrolytic manganese metal.
 Information regarding the Group’s operating segments is reported below. Amounts reported for the prior year have been restated to conform 
with the requirements of IFRS 8.

(a) The exceptional profit on sale of property of £6.0 million in the year ended 31 December 2008 relates to the disposal of a former site of 
an Australian Engineered Steel Products business on 27 June 2008. Total net consideration amounted to £8.6 million.
 The 2007 exceptional profit on sale of property of £1.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2007 relates to the disposal of adjacent 
land to the Group’s EMD plant in Australia. The consideration received amounted to £3.3 million.
(b) The settlement costs in relation to the Delta Pension Plan constitute a one-off contribution by, and charge to the Group of £49.9 million 
to the Trustees toward a total bulk annuity purchase of £450.9 million, incremental settlement-related credit of £2.1 million, together 
with associated advisers’ costs of £1.0 million. The purchase of the bulk annuity was in relation to the funding of DPP liabilities 
pertaining to the pensioner population. This pensioner population substantially relates to former employees of UK businesses no longer 
owned by the Group. For more details, see note 40.
(c) On 12 December 2008 the Group announced the closure of its machine tool manufacturing site at Kirkby, Nottinghamshire, UK. The 
expected costs associated with this closure amounted to £0.7 million.
(d) On 18 December 2007, the Group announced the closure of its EMD Australian business, as part of a co-ordinated plan to address the 
ongoing loss-making nature of that business. Additional liabilities of £2.1 million were recognised in 2008 as follows: 
(i) Site restoration and rehabilitation costs of £1.8 million (2007: £3.9 million).
(ii) Impairment of plant and equipment to its recoverable amount of £0.3 million (2007: £5.7 million)
(iii) Impairment of inventories of £nil relates to the impairment of inventories value to their recoverable amount (2007: £1.3 million).
(iv) Rationalisation, redundancy and retrenchment costs of £nil (2007: £2.0 million). 
(v) Impairment of goodwill of £nil (2007: £0.6 million). 
In 2007 a deferred tax amount of £0.5 million for the EMD Australian operations relating to future tax losses was no longer considered 
recoverable, and was impaired to zero.
(e) In 2008 the Australian operations claimed a one-off tax credit arising from the establishment of a consolidated tax group for the 
Australian entities.

impaired by £8.5 million to a £nil carrying value in the year ended 31 December 2005. This impairment is now fully reversed.
(g) During the year, an exceptional item was charged to profit for the year from discontinued operations of £0.3 million related to net 
adjustment of provisions pertaining to disposed businesses (2007: £3.1 million credit) (see note 13). 
(h) The exceptional profits on sale of discontinued operations for the year ended 31 December 2007 consist of: £0.3 million profit after tax 
for the disposed business of Machin & Ewen Pty Ltd, £nil gain/loss for the disposal of Vingal Industries Co. Ltd and £1.7 million profit 
after tax following the disposal of Delta Group Overseas Holdings GmbH, a former Group holding company, together with its subsidiary 
Kele GmbH. More details are provided in note 13.

from the South African tax authorities in respect of the disposal of the former South African Industrial Supplies businesses in 
September 2005. 
13 PROFIT FOR THE YEAR FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Share of post-tax profits of an associate relate to MMC which is currently undergoing a sales process, and so has been re-classified as “held 
for sale” and reported as a discontinued operation (see note 20 for more details).
The table below details the operating results through to disposal and the consequent post-tax gain on sale of the disposed businesses. All 
revenue shown is from parties external to the Group.

classified from Continuing to Discontinued (see note 20 for more details).
Discontinued operations included a net receipt of £1.6 million (2007: £2.1 million) to the Group’s net operating cash flows, net receipt of £nil 
(2007: £4.5 million) in respect of investing activities and net receipt of £nil (2007: £0.1 million) in respect of financing activities.

15 EARNINGS PER SHARE
In addition to the IAS 33 measure of earnings per share, underlying earnings per share have been shown because the directors consider that 
this gives a more meaningful indication of the core performance of the Group by excluding those items that may distort comparability. 
The calculation of the earnings per share figures is based on the earnings and weighted average number of shares tables presented below.

The number of ordinary shares represents the weighted average for the period. The average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes those held in the Delta plc Employee Share 
 Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
(2) 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. Where basic 
 earnings per share are at a loss, the anti-dilutive effect of any further shares is ignored.

 Reversal arose on adoption of IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as at 31 December 2007. 
(2)
  Before impairment testing, goodwill of £0.6 million was attributable to the Manganese Materials business at the current year end. Due to the events and circumstances outlined in 
 note 12(d), the Group has recorded an impairment loss against this goodwill of £0.6 million, bringing the carrying amount to £nil. 
Goodwill at 31 December 2008 related to the following business segments: Engineered Steel Products £5.9 million (2007: £4.0 million); 
Galvanizing Services £2.5 million (2007: £2.1 million); and Manganese Materials £nil (2007: £nil). 
The Group’s goodwill at 31 December 2008 totalled £8.4 million, being approximately 3% of the Group’s total assets. 
The Group’s accounting policy regarding impairment testing of goodwill is stated in note 2 and includes testing annually for impairment or 
more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The goodwill impairment testing uses a methodology similar to that described below.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years 
and extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity based on an estimated growth rate not in excess of the average long-term growth rate for the 
relevant countries and markets in which the respective Cash Generating Unit participates.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is based on an estimate of Delta’s weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for factors 
specific to the particular CGU.

Following the initiation of a sale process for the Group’s associate, MMC, by the majority shareholder, the Group’s interest in its associate has 
been reclassified and is presented as ‘held for sale’. (See the Chief Executive’s Review on page 9, and the Financial Review on page 12 for 
details.)
Following a regular review of the Joint Venture in 2008, the Directors concluded that significant influence over the operations of PT Bukit 
no longer existed, and so, from 30 June 2008, the Joint Venture has been reclassified as an Other Investment on the Consolidated 
balance sheet.

Impairment charges of £0.7 million (2007: £1.6 million) against Group inventories were made in the Consolidated income statement (see 
note 6). The directors consider that there is no material difference between the balance sheet value of inventories and their replacement 
cost.
22 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
£ million   2008 2007
Amounts falling due within one year:
Trade receivables   59.2 47.0
Allowance for doubtful debts   (1.8) (1.6)
   57.4 45.4
Other receivables   0.7 2.3
Corporate tax receivables   1.0 0.1
Prepayments and accrued income   2.3 2.1
Trade and other receivables   61.4 49.9
Amounts falling due after one year:
Other receivables   0.4 0.8
Prepayments and accrued income   0.1 —
Other receivables   0.5 0.8
The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value. 
The average credit period on sale of goods is 39 days (2007: 45 days). The time periods from date of invoice from which interest is charged 
on trade receivables varies from business to business within the Group. The Group has provided fully for all trade receivables over 120 days 
overdue. Trade receivables between 30 and 120 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, 
determined by reference to the past default experience of the business concerned. 
Included in the Group’s aggregate trade receivable balance are trade receivables with a carrying amount of £13.1 million (2007: £9.1 million) 
which are overdue at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality 
and the Group believes that these amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. 
The average age of these receivables is 54 days (2007: 59 days). 
Included within trade receivables are amounts which are past due but for which no allowance is made. Past due up to 30 days £9.6 million 
(2007: £5.8 million); past due between 30 and 60 days £3.5 million (2007: £2.4 million); past due between 60 and 90 days £nil million 
(2007: £0.8 million) and past due greater than 90 days £nil million (2007: £0.1 million). 
The movement in the aggregate allowances for doubtful debts is as follows:
£ million   2008 2007
Balance at the beginning of the year   1.6 1.4
Exchange differences   0.4 0.1
Reclassified from assets held for sale   — 0.3
Amounts written off during the year   (0.6)  (0.3) 
Increase in allowances recognised in profit and loss   0.4 0.1
Balance at the end of the year   1.8 1.6
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from 
the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large, diverse and unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the aggregate 
allowances for doubtful debts detailed above.

 Capital risk management
 The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes 
the borrowings disclosed in note 27, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 24, other financial assets disclosed in note 23 and equity 
attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 30 to 32.
 Gearing ratio
 The Board reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the 
risks associated with each class of capital. The Group does not have significant debt, and does not therefore set a target gearing ratio.
 Externally imposed capital requirement
 The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
 Significant accounting policies
 Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the 
basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.

 Financial risk management objectives
 The Group’s fundamental treasury policy remains one of risk management and control, and not to undertake speculative transactions. 
Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre, and all activities are closely monitored by the Group Finance Department, who make 
recommendations to the Board on matters of treasury policy and to implement policies approved by the Board. 
 Liquidity risk
 Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining 
adequate cash reserves and monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, as well as ensuring that the maturity profiles of the financial assets 
adequately provide for capital spending. Liquidity risk management is discussed in the Treasury Policy section of the Financial Review on 
page 13.
 Credit risk
 The Group’s financial assets include investments, trade and other receivables, derivatives and cash and cash equivalents.
 Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its obligations in respect of these instruments to the Group.
 With regard to trade receivables, Group policy is only to deal with counterparties with an appropriate credit rating. Furthermore, credit 
risk relating to trade receivables is considered lower than average due to the nature of our clients being large blue chip corporates and 
companies involved in government-funded infrastructure work. Our clients are also spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. 
Appropriate credit checks are undertaken on potential customers before sales commence.

 Market risk
 The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
 
 Foreign currency exchange risk
 Material currency exposures arising from trading transactions at most of the Group’s businesses are covered as they arise. However, the 
Manganese Materials businesses do not cover trading currency exposures. 
 The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The derivative instruments used 
are foreign exchange swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group does not trade in financial instruments, so there are no 
derivatives held for trading purposes.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as 
follows:
 Liabilities Assets
£ million    2008 2007 2008 2007
Australian dollar    (1.1) — 50.9 55.0
US dollar    — — 7.4 3.2
South African rand    — (0.5) 9.5 10.9
Other    (0.1) (1.4) 13.1 7.8
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents by currency is set out above. As none of these balances are hedged, the Group’s sensitivity to 
currency gains or losses upon these balances is proportional to their values. Significantly all such translation gains or losses would be 
reported 
within equity.
The Group is mainly exposed to Australian dollars, US dollars and South African rand. 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivites to a 10% increase and decrease in pound sterling against the respective foreign 
currencies. The 10% is the rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel, and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates in a normal year. The sensitivity analysis includes 
only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items, and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in 
foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the 
denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number in the table indicates an 
increase in other equity where the pound sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the pound sterling 
against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the other equity, and the balances in the tables would be 
negative.

Forward foreign exchange contract
The sterling values of operating profits arising in other currencies are not hedged. Consequently, the sterling value of overseas profits remains 
subject to currency exchange movements. The Group does not normally use net investment hedging to protect the sterling value of its non-
sterling assets and no such hedging was used in 2007 or 2008.

At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed was 
£7.8 million (2007: £5.6 million).
Positive fair values for derivative financial instruments are disclosed as assets in the Consolidated balance sheet and negative fair value 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed as liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet.  
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates.  
Due to the significant cash balances held by the Group, the Group is exposed to credit risks with counterparty banks. In particular, the Group 
has cash balances with banks located in the Republic of South Africa, Australia, China and the United States, and consequently has an 
exposure to those banking sectors. The balances are held with large commercial banks.
The Group has no outstanding interest rate hedges. The Group’s only significant interest rate exposures are in respect of interest receivable 
on cash balances.
The weighted average interest rates applied are as follows:
Year ended 31 December 2008
Interest rate (%)  GBP AUD ZAR USD Other Total
Cash  5.5% 6.5% 12.7% 1.1% 1.2% 6.1%
Year ended 31 December 2007
Interest rate (%)  GBP AUD ZAR USD Other Total
Cash  5.6% 6.7% 10.6% 3.9% 1.9% 6.3%
Bank overdrafts  5.6% — 12.7% — — 9.4%
All Group cash balances and borrowings attract interest at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest risk. A 1% change in 
interest rate would impact income by some £0.1 million.
The directors estimate that the fair value of the Group’s cash balances and borrowings are equal to the book value shown. 
The other principal features of the Group’s cash balances and borrowings are as follows:
 (i) Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
 (ii) No overdrafts (2007: £nil) have been secured by a charge over certain of the Group’s assets.
 
 Intra-Group loan economic hedges
 The Group has taken out financial instruments to economically hedge the sterling value of loans granted (or payable) by Delta plc and other 
Group companies, where the loan is not in Delta plc’s functional currency (pounds sterling). The financial instruments used are forward 
foreign exchange contracts. The fair values of these contracts at the balance sheet date are set out in the table above.

The average credit period on purchases of supplies is 43 days (2007: 37 days). Arrangements differ between business units regarding the 
payment of interest on outstanding balances. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that payables are paid 
within credit timeframes.
At the year end, the intrinsic value of vested cash-settled share-based payments for the Group was £nil (2007: £nil).

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. The following is the analysis of 
the deferred tax balance (after offset) for balance sheet purposes:
£ million   2008  2007
Deferred tax liabilities   4.6 2.2
Deferred tax assets   (6.0) (2.4)
   (1.4) (0.2)

Retirement benefit obligations   (10.9) —
Other timing differences   — (0.9)
Unremitted foreign earnings   33.9 28.7
   (69.7) (4.9)
Deferred tax has not been recognised where it has been assumed that the deferred tax asset is not recoverable. The amount of deductible 
temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax is recognised at the balance sheet date is 
£246.0 million (2007: £13.1 million), together with Virginia, USA state tax losses of £8.7 million at a tax rate of 6% (2007: £nil at 6%). 
The substantial increase in capital losses arose in connection with the liquidation of a subsidiary. This crystallised a loss partly originating 
from the sale of Netherlands electrical trades in 2003 and partly from transactions in earlier years. However, the relevant submissions have 
not yet been agreed with HM Revenue and Customs.
The accumulated losses reported by the Group for tax purposes in various tax jurisdictions include the following, most of which were incurred 
by disposed businesses. The following figures are subject to audit by tax authorities and do not include amounts recognised as deferred tax 
assets that are expected to be utilised in future: £44 million in the UK (2007: £34 million) and £3 million in Australia (2007: £5 million). The 
UK and Australian tax losses have no applicable expiry date. The future use, if any, of these accumulated losses will depend upon applicable 
tax rules and regulations, and upon the Group generating appropriate taxable income in those countries. Consequently, the figures include 
losses which it is improbable that the Group will be able to utilise in the future. 
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of temporary differences in the UK as there is insufficient evidence that the asset 
will be recovered. The amount of the deductible temporary differences not recognised relates to capital allowances in excess of depreciation: 
£23.9 million (2007: £29.8 million). The asset would be recovered if there were sufficient UK profits in the future.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint venture. No deferred tax 
liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences of £120.9 million (2007: £95.8 million) associated with retained profits in 
overseas subsidiaries. These temporary differences are not expected to reverse because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the

arising in connection with interests in associates and joint venture are insignificant.

Shares in the ESOT are valued at their original cost and deducted from equity. The dividends on the shares held in the ESOT are waived 
except to the extent of 0.01p per share. 
In lieu of issuing new shares, it is intended that all share-based incentives will be satisfied through the Delta plc ESOT by way of market 
purchase. During the year, 962,500 shares were purchased to satisfy share-based incentives at an average share price of 119p. 
(2007:928,700 shares at 121p). At 31 December 2008, the 1,537,197 shares (2007: 1,265,911 shares) held by the ESOT had a market 
value of £1.3 million (2007: £1.4 million).

During the year, the Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) satisfied options granted under the 1999 Delta Executive Share Option 
Scheme (“ESOS”) totalling 617,670 shares (2007: 142,556 shares) and awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan 2006 (“DBP”) of 
7,203 shares (2007: 34,842 shares), and 66,341 shares in regards to the Save As You Earn and International Save As You Earn share option 
schemes (2007: nil). However, no shares were satisfied by the ESOS (2007: 111,475 shares) or any cash settled shares in relation to the 
DBP (2007: 6,032 shares). In addition, the Company did not issue any ordinary shares pursuant to the ESOS (2007: 219,816 shares); and 
did not issue shares in regards to the Save As You Earn and International Save As You Earn share option schemes (2007: 42,088 shares), so 
there was no consideration (2007: £0.3 million). This resulted in no increase to share capital or to the share premium account (2007: £0.1 
million and £0.2 million respectively).  For 2007, the 42,088 ordinary shares of 25p each under the Save As You Earn share option scheme 
at 82p and 108p and the International Save As You Earn share option scheme at 82p had an aggregate nominal value of £10,522 and

35 ACQUISITION OF HI-LIGHT INDUSTRIES PTY LTD
On 7 January 2008, Delta acquired 100% of the shares of Hi-Light Industries Pty Ltd (“Hi-Light”) from its former private owners for a total 
consideration plus expenses of £2.9 million, including deferred consideration of £0.3 million. The deferred consideration is due to be paid 
in 2009 and 2010 in two equal instalments, subject to the satisfaction of certain warranties and achievements of a number of sales-related 
and profitability targets. These consideration figures were subject to a purchase price adjustment following the finalisation and completion of 
completion accounts as at 31 December 2007. 
Hi-Light is engaged in the manufacture of galvanized steel products in Australasia and will be reported in the Engineered Steel Products 
segment. This transaction has been accounted for in 2008 using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3: Business 
Combinations. All assets and liabilities have been recognised at their provisional fair values. The residual over the net assets acquired has 
been recognised as goodwill.
In the year to 31 December 2008, Hi-Light contributed operating profit of £0.4 million on revenues of £5.1 million.

39 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
IFRS 2: Share-based payments has only been applied to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and that had not 
vested before 1 January 2005.
Included within staff costs are IFRS 2 expenses related to share-based payments totalling £0.4 million (2007: £0.5 million). 
Save As You Earn schemes
The Company has a scheme in place known as “Save As You Earn” (SAYE), and its international equivalent, known as “International Save 
As You Earn” (ISAYE). There have been no SAYE or ISAYE grants since October 2002 (and thus this share-based payment scheme does not 
fall under the provisions of IFRS 2). Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on 
the date of grant. In normal circumstances the options mature either 36, 60 or 84 months following grant and can be exercised within six 
months of the relevant maturity date. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests.
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The Company has a share option scheme for executives of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted 
market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The options are exercisable between three and ten years after the date on 
which the options were granted subject to performance criteria being met. Options are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group before the 
options vest.
ESOS was approved by shareholders at the May 1999 Annual General Meeting. The scheme was amended in 2002 to reflect the preferences 
of certain institutional investors. Grants under the ESOS were made annually and had values of up to one times annual salary. No grants 
have been made since 2005. 
ESOS options are subject to the following performance conditions:
(a) granted before 29 June 2001, on or before the tenth anniversary of the grant date:
— earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive years must equal or exceed the growth in the Retail Prices 
Index plus 3% per annum; and
— earnings per share before exceptional items must equal or exceed twenty pence.
(b) granted on or after 29 June 2001, on or before the sixth anniversary of the grant date:
— earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive years must equal or exceed the growth in the Retail Prices 
Index plus 3% per annum.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 111.8p (2007: 137.4p).
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.8 years (2007: 5.8 years) and have 
exercise prices ranging from 83p to 154p.
There were no options granted under this scheme in 2008, 2007 or 2006. The scheme was replaced by the Performance Share Plan which 
was approved by shareholders on 28 April 2006. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over six years prior to the year of grant. 
The expected life used in the model was adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
The Group recognised total expenses of £nil (2007: £0.1 million) relating to the above equity-settled ESOS during the year.

The Group recognised an expense of £0.1 million (2007: £0.1 million) related to the above equity-settled share award scheme during 
the year.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan was introduced in 2006 to replace the ESOS. The conditional awards generally have a three year vesting period 
and an exercise price of £nil. The extent to which an award under the plan may vest will be determined by the Company’s Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance over the three year period commencing the start of the financial year in which the grant was made against 
the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts) over the same period. For median 
performance, one quarter may vest, rising proportionally to full vesting for upper quartile performance. 
Regardless of the Company’s TSR performance, no part of an award under the plan will vest unless the Financial Underpin Condition is met, 
the Financial Underpin Condition being that the Remuneration Committee considers that the Company’s underlying financial performance 
over the same measurement period is satisfactory.
Awards are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group before the awards vest.

The awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.7 years and have an exercise price of 
£nil (2007: 2.2 years and have an exercise price of £nil).
In 2008, an award was granted on 28 March (2007: 22 March and 10 April). The estimated fair values of the award granted on this date was 
46.5p (2007: 55.3p and 52.0p respectively). The total fair value was £355,172 (2007: £140,423 and £64,629 respectively. The fair values 
were calculated using a stochastic model. The inputs used for fair valuing awards granted during 2008 were as follows:

Weighted average expected volatility   28.6% 25.2%

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over a historical period commensurate 
with the expected performance period for the award. Participants are entitled to receive the dividends that would have been received on the 
vested shares therefore the dividend yield does not impact on the valuation of the awards.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.2 million (2007: £0.2 million) related to the above equity-settled share-based Performance 
Share Plan during the year. 
Deferred Bonus Plan
The Deferred Bonus Plan was introduced in 2006. One half of any bonus payable under the scheme is paid in cash with the other half 
being deferred in ordinary shares in the Company. 
Deferred bonus share awards are forfeited on cessation of employment prior to the third anniversary of award, except in the case of 
“good leavers” in which case the deferred shares are released early.

Under the DPP, participants are entitled to pension retirement benefits of 1.67% of final salary per year of service on attainment of a 
retirement age of 65 years. The Group had a further defined benefit scheme in Australia, the Delta Australia Superannuation Fund (DASF) 
until the DASF was closed and proceedings commenced to dissolve the pension fund as at 1 December 2006. 
The Group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the consolidated statement of recognised income 
and expense. 
Details of valuation assumptions for the purposes of this Annual Report
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPP’s assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes was performed at 31 December 2008 
by independent actuaries Xafinity Consulting Limited. The projected unit credit method was used for valuation purposes. The projected unit 
credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities make allowance for projected earnings. 
The actuarial valuation used the following principal assumptions:
   2008 2007
Discount rate   6.3% 5.8%
Inflation rate   2.5% 3.1%
Expected return on equity instruments   7.0% 7.0%
Expected return on debt instruments   6.3% 4.5%
Expected return on property and cash   6.0% 6.0%
Expected rate of salary increases   3.5% 4.1%
Future pension increases   3.0% 3.1%
Mortality assumptions:
Life expectancy at age 65
Non-pensioners, currently aged 45   PxA92MC PxA92c2020
—Male   23.1 19.8
—Female   25.9 22.8
Pensioners, currently aged 65   PxA92MC PxA92c2006
— Male   22.0 18.6
—Female   24.9 21.5
The expected return on DPP assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes. Asset class returns are 
based on a forward looking building block approach. Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above 
the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with yields on government bonds. Returns on property are assumed to be 1% per annum 
lower than those on equities. Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the 
DPP holdings of these instruments.

  The IAS 19 valuation conducted for the year ended 31 December 2007 produced a net defined benefit pension surplus of £9.5 million. The directors considered that there was sufficient 
uncertainty so as to not warrant recognition of the net defined benefit surplus as a retirement benefit asset in the consolidated balance sheet. 
The cumulative amount of net actuarial gains taken to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense is £38.1 million since 
the date of transition to IFRS.

We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Delta plc for the year ended 31 December 2008, and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our

Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS 
AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company financial statements have been properly prepared

whether in our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements. The information given in the 
Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in 
the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Financial 
Review that is cross-referred from the Business Review section of the 
Directors’ Report.
In addition, we also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company

all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, 
as described in the contents section, and consider whether it is

of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance 
that the parent company financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of 
the presentation of information in the parent company financial 
statements.

Notes to the Individual Company Financial Statements
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THE COMPANY
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985, as amended. As permitted by that 
Act, the parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK Financial Reporting Standards.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost accounting convention, modified to include the revaluation of 
certain fixed assets, and in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and law in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). 
The principal accounting policies for the Company are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and 
the preceding year.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the 
year. The Company reported a loss for the year ended 31 December 2008 of £5.4 million (2007: profit of £4.4 million).
Amounts payable to Deloitte LLP by the Company for its audit amounted to £0.1 million (2007: £0.1 million).
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (revised) — Cash Flow 
Statements. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the 
Delta plc Group.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
The Company accounts for its investments in subsidiary undertakings by the equity method, whereby the original cost of the investments is 
adjusted for the movement in underlying net assets applicable to the investments since their date of acquisition with an adjustment to the 
Company’s revaluation reserve, except where any diminution in the value of the investment is considered permanent. In such cases the 
permanent diminution is recorded as a reduction in the Company’s profit and loss account.
Foreign currency
Transactions in overseas currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward 
foreign exchange contracts have been taken out, at the contractual rates.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates and monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate.
Pensions
The Company operates a defined benefit pension plan.
A defined benefit pension plan is one that specifies the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. The Company 
operates a funded defined benefit pension plan, where actuarially-determined payments are made to a trustee-administered fund. 
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
The Company accounts for actuarial gains and losses in full through the profit and loss account reserve in the year in which they occur. 
Where the actuarial valuation of the plan demonstrates that the plan is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the 
Group can benefit in the future.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in the Company profit and loss account.
Past service costs, if any, are similarly included where the benefits have vested otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period.
The expected return on assets of the funded defined benefit pension plan and the expected interest on pension plan liabilities are recorded 
in the Company profit and loss account.
Further details of the Company’s defined benefit pension plan are given in note 10.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when a present obligation (legal or constructive) exists in respect of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated.

Notes to the Individual Company Financial Statements
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THE COMPANY continued
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Company. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the liability and finance charge to produce a constant rate of interest on 
the finance lease balance outstanding. Assets capitalised under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset 
or the lease term.
Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense 
in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any incentives to enter into operating leases are recognised as a 
reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Tax
The profit and loss account tax charge is calculated at current rates of corporation tax on the taxable profits/losses for the year. Deferred tax 
is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a 
future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of 
items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding contract to dispose of 
these assets. Deferred tax is not provided on un-remitted earnings where there is no binding commitment to remit those earnings. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are not discounted.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the Company profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.
Financial instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The derivative financial 
instruments used are foreign exchange swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value in the balance sheet with changes charged to the profit and loss account.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account. The 
Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Dividends
Dividends declared after the year end represent a non-adjusting balance sheet event and therefore no liability is recognised until the 
dividend is declared.
Share capital
Ordinary shares and preference shares are classified as equity instruments, and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs.
Investments in own shares (held through an Employee Share Ownership Trust) are shown at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. 
The costs of administration of the Employee Share Ownership Trust are included in the Company profit and loss account as they accrue. 
Dividends on shares held by the Trust have been waived.
Share-based payments
The Company operates various equity-settled incentive schemes for certain employees. For equity-settled share options, the services 
received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted in accordance with FRS 20. Fair value is 
calculated at grant date and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other 
than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating fair value.
Fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes and Stochastic option pricing models. The expected life used in the model has been 
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

10 PENSIONS
The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme for qualifying employees in the United Kingdom, being the Delta Pension Plan 
(DPP). The DPP is a final salary scheme. Additional information regarding DPP is contained in the consolidated financial statements of 
Delta plc.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPP’s assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes was performed at 31 December 2008 
by independent actuaries Xafinity Consulting Limited. The projected unit credit method was used for valuation purposes. The projected unit 
credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the plan liabilities make allowance for projected earnings. The actuarial 
valuation used the following principal assumptions:

— Male   22.0 18.6
—Female   24.9 21.5
The expected return on DPP assets is a blended average of projected long-term returns for the various asset classes. Asset class returns are 
based on a forward looking building block approach. Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above 
the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with yields on government bonds. Returns on property are assumed to be 1% per annum 
lower than those on equities. Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the 
DPP holdings of these instruments.
The estimated sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities as above are set out as follows:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.5% Decrease/increase by 10%
Inflation rate Increase/decrease by 0.5% Decrease/increase by 6%
Rate of salary growth Increase/decrease by 0.5% Increase/decrease 0.1%

 The FRS 17 valuation conducted for the year ended 31 December 2007 produced a net defined benefit pension valuation surplus of £9.8 million. However,
 in accordance with FRS 17 paragraph 37, this DPP surplus is limited to the Company’s ability to recover that surplus, whether by reduced contributions in
 the future or through refunds of DPP. The directors consider that there is sufficient uncertainty so as to not warrant recognition of the net defined benefit
 valuation surplus as a pension surplus on the Individual Company balance sheet.

in total, comprising 197 pensioners (including any dependants’ pensions in payment), 7,114 deferred participants and 57 current 
participants.
Further additional information concerning the DPP is provided in the Consolidated financial statements’ Retirement benefit schemes note

Triennial valuation
The next triennial valuation for the DPP is due as of 5 April 2009. At the last valuation, as of 5 April 2006, the DPP’s assets totalled 
£658.1 million and its liabilities totalled £663.5 million, resulting in a net deficit of £5.4 million as at 5 April 2006. The following 
assumptions were employed: discount rate 5.2%; annual increase in pensionable earnings: 3.75%; annual pension increases: from 2.55% 
to 3.0%; cash commutation: 25%; and price inflation: 2.75%. Mortality tables used were PxA92c2007 for pensioners and PxA92c2020 for

Notes to the Individual Company Financial Statements
13 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
FRS 20: Share-based payments has only been applied to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and that had not 
vested before 1 January 2005.
Included within staff costs are FRS 20 expenses related to share-based payments totalling £0.4 million (2007: £0.5 million).
Save As You Earn schemes
The Company has a scheme in place known as “Save As You Earn” (SAYE), and its international equivalent, known as “International Save 
As You Earn” (ISAYE). There have been no SAYE or ISAYE grants since October 2002 (and thus this share-based payment scheme does not 
fall under the provisions of IFRS 2). Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on 
the date of grant. In normal circumstances the options mature either 36, 60 or 84 months following grant and can be exercised within six 
months of the relevant maturity date. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests.
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The Company has a share option scheme for executives of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted 
market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The options are exercisable between three and ten years after the date on 
which the options were granted subject to performance criteria being met. Options are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group before the 
options vest.
ESOS was approved by shareholders at the May 1999 Annual General Meeting. The scheme was amended in 2002 to reflect the 
preferences of certain institutional investors. No grants have been made since 2005. 
Grants under the ESOS are made annually and have values of up to one times annual salary.
ESOS options are subject to the following performance conditions:
(a) granted before 29 June 2001, on or before the tenth anniversary of the grant date:
— earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive years must equal or exceed the growth in the Retail Prices
 Index plus 3% per annum; and
— earnings per share before exceptional items must equal or exceed twenty pence.
(b) granted on or after 29 June 2001, on or before the sixth anniversary of the grant date:
—  earnings per share growth over a period of at least three consecutive years must equal or exceed the growth in the Retail Prices 
Index plus 3% per annum.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 111.8p (2007: 137.4p).
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.8 years (2007: 5.8 years) and have 
exercise prices ranging from 83p to 154p.
There were no options granted under this scheme in 2008, 2007 or 2006. The scheme was replaced by the Performance Share Plan which 
was approved by shareholders on 28 April 2006.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over six years prior to the year of grant. 
The expected life used in the model was adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Share Award Scheme for Chief Executive
The Company has a Share Award Scheme for the Chief Executive of the Group. This is a one-off award of shares in the Company. The 
shares vest three years after the date on which the shares were granted. The shares were issued for £nil consideration. The shares are 
forfeited if the Chief Executive leaves the Group before they vest. The exercise price is £nil.
Details of the share award outstanding during the year are as follows:

 The share award was granted on 4 January 2006, but effective 28 September 2005. The estimated fair value of the shares awarded was 
109.5p at the date of grant. The total fair value at date of grant was £290,000. 
The fair value of these options was deemed to be the share price on the date of grant based on a discounted cash flow valuation of the 
future dividend stream, as dividends will be payable on these shares during the period between the date of grant and the date of vesting.
The Group recognised an expense of £0.1 million (2007: £0.1 million) related to the above equity-settled share award scheme during the 
year.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan was introduced in 2006 to replace the ESOS. The conditional awards generally have a three year vesting period 
and an exercise price of £nil. The extent to which an award under the plan may vest will be determined by the Company’s Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance over the three year period commencing the start of the financial year in which the grants are made, against 
the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts) over the same period. For median 
performance, one quarter may vest, rising proportionally to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
Regardless of the Company’s TSR performance, no part of an award under the plan will vest unless the Financial Underpin Condition is met, 
the Financial Underpin Condition being that the Remuneration Committee considers that the Company’s underlying financial performance 
over the same measurement period is satisfactory.
Awards are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group before the awards vest.

13 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued
In 2008, an award was granted on 28 March (2007: 22 March and 10 April). The estimated fair value of the award granted on this date was 
46.5p (2007: 55.3p and 52.0p respectively). The total fair value was £355,172 (2007: £140,423 and £64,629 respectively). The fair values 
were calculated using a stochastic model. The inputs used for fair valuing the award granted during 2008 were as follows:
   2008 2007
Weighted average share price at date of grant   92.0p 138.5p
Weighted average exercise price   £nil £nil
Weighted average expected volatility   28.6% 25.2%
Weighted average expected life   3.0 years 3.0 years
Risk-free rate   4.0% 5.3%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over a historical period commensurate 
with the expected performance period for the award. Participants are entitled to receive the dividends that would have been received on the 
vested shares therefore the dividend yield does not impact on the valuation of the awards.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.2 million (2007: £0.2 million) related to the above equity-settled share-based Performance Share 
Plan during the year.
Deferred Bonus Plan
The Deferred Bonus Plan was introduced in 2006. One-half of any bonus payable under the scheme is paid in cash with the other half being 
deferred in ordinary shares in the Company.

The awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.0 years and have an exercise price of 
£nil (2007: 2.2 years and have an exercise price of £nil).
In 2008, an award was granted on 27 March (2007: 22 March). The estimated fair value of the award granted on this date was 83.6p 
(2007: 127.0p). The total fair value was £286,988 (2007: £283,995).
 
The fair values were calculated using Black–Scholes option pricing model. The inputs used for fair valuing awards granted during 2008 
were as follows:
   2008 2007
Weighted average share price at date of grant   91.5p 139.0p
Weighted average exercise price   £nil £nil

Weighted average expected life   3.0 years 3.0 years
Risk-free rate   4.5% 4.7%

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over a historical period commensurate 
with the expected performance period for the award. Participants are not entitled to receive the dividends that would have been received on 
the vested shares. The share awards were issued for £nil consideration and the exercise price is £nil.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.1 million (2007: £0.1 million) related to the above equity-settled Deferred Bonus Plan during 
the year.

Currency derivatives
The Company utilises currency derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The derivative instruments used 
are foreign exchange swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company does not trade in financial instruments, so there are no 
derivatives held for trading purposes.
Intra-group loan economic hedging
The Company has taken out financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange movements on loans granted by (or payable 
to) Delta plc and other Delta Group companies, where the loan is not in Delta plc’s functional currency (pound sterling). The financial 
instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts. The fair values of these contracts at the balance sheet date are set out in the 
table above and are accounted for in the profit and loss account.
The following methodology has been used to establish estimated fair values:

Notice of Annual General Meeting / Shareholders’ Information
Shareholders’ Information
EXPLANATORY NOTES
The directors believe that the proposed resolutions are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and unanimously recommend 
shareholders to vote in favour of the proposed resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.
RESOLUTION 4 — Re-election of director
Full biographical details of each director are set out on page 14 of this report.
All directors are subject to an annual performance review and the Board confirms that Steven Marshall, who is proposed for re-election, continues 
to perform effectively and to demonstrate commitment to his role. 
RESOLUTION 7 — Authority to allot shares
This ordinary resolution is proposed in order to provide a measure of authority to the directors to allot ordinary shares, limited to approximately 
22% of the issued share capital of the Company at 25 March 2009, in circumstances defined by the resolution so as to enable them to respond, in 
the interests of the Company, to any appropriate opportunities that may arise.
RESOLUTION 8 — Power to waive pre-emption rights
This first special resolution seeks authority, limited to approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the Company at 25 March 2009, regarding 
allotments, other than to members proportionately to their respective shareholdings and for which payment is to be wholly in cash. Additionally, the 
resolution seeks authority for the Company to sell or otherwise deal with treasury shares (being shares acquired and held by the Company) without 
necessarily involving shareholders.
This limited authority will enable the directors to issue shares, in the interests of the Company, in response to any appropriate opportunities that 
may arise. For transactions of a substantial nature involving the allotment of shares, it is normal for the UK Listing Authority or company law to 
require shareholder approval for the specific transaction notwithstanding this general authority.
RESOLUTION 9 — Authority for market purchases
This authority renews the authority granted at last year’s AGM and represents not more than 10% of the ordinary issued share capital as at 
25 March 2009. The directors will only exercise this authority if they consider it is in the best interest of shareholders generally and if the purchase 
could be expected to result in an increase in earnings per shares. 
If any ordinary shares purchased pursuant to this authority are not held by the Company as treasury shares then such shares would be 
immediately cancelled, thereby reducing the number of ordinary shares in issue. 
RESOLUTION 10 — Authority to Retain a Notice Period of Fourteen Clear Days for General Meetings
Resolution 10 is required to reflect the proposed implementation in August 2009 of the Shareholder Rights Directive. The regulation implementing 
this Directive will increase the notice period for general meetings of the company to 21 days. The Company is currently able to call general 
meetings (other than an Annual General Meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice and would like to preserve this ability. In order to be able to do so after 
August 2009, shareholders must have approved the calling of meetings on 14 days’ notice. Resolution 10 seeks such approval. The approval will 
be effective until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. 
 
VOTING ARRANGEMENTS
Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, a person must be registered as the holder of ordinary shares by 
6 pm on 4 May 2009 in order for such person to be entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of those shares. Changes to entries on the 
register after 6 pm on 4 May 2009 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote (and the number of votes cast) at 
the meeting. A person must be registered as the holder of preference shares by the same time in order for such person to be entitled to attend the 
meeting in respect of those shares. Preference shares do not entitle their holders to vote at the meeting. 
A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint one or more proxies, whether a member of the Company or not, to exercise all or 
any of his rights to attend and to speak and vote on his behalf. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided that each proxy is appointed 
to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by the member. A form of proxy is enclosed for the use of members who may 
wish to vote but who are unable to attend the meeting. To be valid, forms of proxy must reach the registrars no later than 48 hours prior to the 
time set for the meeting. Completing and returning a form of proxy will not prevent a member from attending and voting at the meeting should the 
member so wish.
An indirect investor who is not a registered member (“Nominated Person”) may have the right to be appointed as a proxy, or have someone else 
appointed as his proxy, if agreed with the member who holds the shares on his behalf. Alternatively, the Nominated Person may have a right to 
give voting instructions to the person holding the shares. A Nominated Person does not have the rights of a member to appoint a proxy as 
described above.

Shareholders’ Information (continued)
In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if a corporate 
shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with 
directions of all the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give 
voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those direction; 
and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed 
the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those representative 
who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representatives. 
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate 
representatives — www.icsa.org.uk — for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation letter if the 
Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.

Shareholders’ Information
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS
Are you still receiving communications in hardcopy? Why not take advantage of electronic communications and thereby enable the 
Company to communicate in a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner.
You can elect to receive documents and information electronically by viewing them on the Company’s website. In this case a hard copy 
notification that documents and information have been published on the Company’s website will be sent to you. If you would like to 
take advantage of this option, please write to our Registrars at the above address advising them that you would like to receive future 
documentation and information electronically by viewing them on the Company’s website.
Alternatively, you can elect to receive notification by email that documents and information have been published on the Company’s 
website, by registering on Shareview at www.shareview.co.uk/shareholders/Pages/Paperfreecommunication.aspx. You will need your 
Shareholder Reference Number, found on share certificates, dividend tax vouchers and proxy cards.
ELECTRONIC VOTING
In line with market practice and as stated in Delta’s Annual Report and Accounts for 2007, we have considered the introduction of 
electronic voting in respect of this year’s annual general meeting. It has been decided not to introduce this facility at present and a 
further review will take place in 2009.
DIVIDEND PAYMENTS
Do you still receive your dividend payments in the form of a cheque? Why not have your future dividends paid directly into your bank 
account. Paying your dividends into your bank account is more secure and convenient than payments by cheque. To take advantage 
of this method of payment you can either:
• log on to www.shareview.co.uk/shareholders/Pages/Dividends.aspx; 
• write to the Registrars providing your bank details; or
• complete the “Direct Payment Request Form” which will be attached to your next dividend cheque.
SHAREGIFT
The Company supports ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme administered by the Orr Mackintosh Foundation (registered 
charity number 1052686). Through ShareGift, shareholders with very small numbers of shares which might be considered 
uneconomic to sell are able to donate them to charity. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift, the proceeds being 
passed on to a wide range of charities.
For those shareholders who wish to use ShareGift, transfer forms are available from the Registrars and further details of the scheme 
can be found on the website www.sharegift.org.
 
WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. 
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation and make a record of any other information they may give 
you, e.g. telephone number, address, etc.
• Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/register
• The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK investors 
and any approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date and any other 
appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive payment under 
the Financial Compensation Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/
regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml or, if you do not have access to the Internet, on 0845 606 1234.
• Inform our Registrars on 0871 384 2528. They are not able to investigate such incidents themselves but will record the details 
and pass them on to the Company and liaise with the FSA.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in Company mailings.

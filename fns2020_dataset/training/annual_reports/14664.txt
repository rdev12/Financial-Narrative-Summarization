INTEGRATE
ACQUIRE SpiriT el is a fully integrated business communications group 
which enables its customers to take advantage of the opportunities 
created by rapidly changing telecoms markets as the migration 
to Internet Protocol (IP) based services accelerates.
The Group is a consolidator of the highly fragmented UK telecoms 
reseller market and is building a substantial customer base and scale 
through selective acquisitions. We are organised into two divisions: 
SpiriT el T echnologies, which focuses on networking and IP products  
and services and SpiriT el Business, which provides services directly  
to our Business customers.

Financial highlights I am pleased to report on a further year  
of growth and development at SpiriT el.  
The Company has made significant  
progress despite an increasingly tough 
operating environment which has seen several 
competitors fall by the wayside. 
SpiriT el made its sixth acquisition during  
the year to 30 April 2009, acquiring and fully 
integrating ED Communications (“EDC”)  
into the SpiriT el Business Division. The Group 
is now a well established, fully integrated 
business communications provider. During the 
year the Company has proven the value of its 
integrated offering to the enlarged customer 
base by successfully cross-selling its 
expanded range of products and services. 
These results include full year contributions 
from all six acquisitions with the exception  
of EDC, which is included for the eight months 
since acquisition. 
Results
As a result of both acquisitive and organic 
growth – including initial sales from over  
£7 million of cross-selling contract wins signed 
during the year – revenues are up markedly,  
by 18% to £19.7 million (2008: £16.7 million). 
Most significantly, underlying EBITDA (defined 
as operating profit after adding back charges 
for depreciation, amortisation, share-based 
payments and exceptional costs) increased  
by 61% to £1.5 million (2008: £0.9 million).  
The results, and in particular the impressive 
growth in earnings, demonstrate ongoing 
success in the execution of the Company’ s 
“Acquire, Integrate, Grow” strategy.  
The economies of selectively bolting on 
acquired assets are now evident.
“During the year the Company has proven the 
value of its integrated offering to the enlarged 
customer base by successfully cross-selling its 
expanded range of products and services.”

Lord St John of Bletso, Chairman
Chairman’ s statement The previously reported decline in profitability 
from the T echnologies Division continues  
to adversely impact Group profits. However, 
this decline, combined with rapid growth in  
the Business Division, has reduced our 
exposure to riskier and more volatile wholesale 
markets. 52% of overall Group revenues in 
2009 result from the Business Division’ s higher 
quality, contracted B2B revenues, compared 
to 40% in 2008. This trend has continued 
since the year end.
Dividend 
SpiriT el is still pursuing its acquisition, integration 
and growth strategy and is continuing to  
invest funds into the business. The Directors 
are therefore not recommending the payment 
of a dividend for the year to 30 April 2009.
Proposed debt conversion 
Since the year end, we have agreed a further 
planned restructuring of the indebtedness  
to Penta Capital Partners (“Penta”) in our 
balance sheet, the terms of which will be 
communicated to shareholders in a circular 
that also convenes a shareholder meeting to 
approve the transaction. The proposals include 
Penta converting up to £6.9 million of debt into 
equity at a price of 0.6p per ordinary share. 
The Directors consider that the proposals will 
significantly strengthen the balance sheet and 
better position the Company to raise capital for 
acquisitions. This is an important step for the 
Group and we value Penta’ s support through 
their proposed debt for equity conversion.
Outlook
Whilst the Business Division has continued  
to perform in line with expectations, trading 
remains challenging for the T echnologies 
Division and we do not foresee a significant 
turnaround in its core wholesale markets. 
However, the T echnologies Division continues 
to add significant value through managing  
our IP-based infrastructure, on which several  
of the Business Division’ s product solutions  
are based.
The Group now benefits from much higher 
levels of earnings visibility, due to the  
Business Division’ s emphasis on contracted 
and recurring revenues from SMEs and larger 
corporate customers. This, combined with  
a wide range of business-critical products  
and services, means SpiriT el is well positioned 
to weather the ongoing economic storm. 
Through a combination of further earnings 
enhancing acquisitions for the Business 
Division and organic growth, driven by the 
cross-selling of an integrated product portfolio, 
we expect to continue to increase revenue  
and earnings for the benefit of all shareholders.
Lord St John of Bletso
Chairman 
30 September 2009
“Through a combination of further earnings 
enhancing acquisitions we expect to continue  
to increase revenue and earnings for the  
benefit of all shareholders.”
03 “We operate in a dynamic sector and the Board 
believes that we now stand at a particularly 
exciting point in the Company’ s development.”
SpiriT el has matured considerably in the year 
under review. Our sixth acquisition further 
enhances our reputation as a leading 
consolidator of the telecoms reseller sector 
and together with our success in cross-sales 
demonstrates our ability to deliver organic  
and acquisitive growth. As a management 
team, we are constantly reviewing acquisition 
opportunities that can grow earnings,  
enhance the product set and provide more 
cross-selling opportunities. We operate in  
a dynamic sector and the Board believes that 
we now stand at a particularly exciting point in 
the Company’ s development. The accelerating 
migration to converged communications  
is a driving force behind increased levels of 
corporate activity in the sector. Convergence  
is also changing customer behaviour with 
more businesses insisting that their supplier 
offers the full range of fixed, mobile, voice  
and data services. For those companies that 
have capital to deploy for acquisitions and  
an integrated product range to sell to business 
customers, these are exciting times.
Financial highlights
The year to 30 April 2009 represents  
a full year’ s contribution from all of SpiriT el’ s 
acquisitions to date, apart from EDC. This  
is reflected in significantly improved financial 
results despite one of the most challenging 
trading environments seen for many years, 
particularly in the T echnologies Division’ s 
wholesale markets. Performance was improved 
in each of the following key financial metrics:
Our acquisition strategy involves buying quality 
businesses with attractive customer bases, integrating 
them swiftly and driving forward the resulting synergy 
benefits of cost savings and new sales opportunities.

Alastair Mills, Chief Executive
Chief Executive’ s review –  Revenue up 18% to £19.7 million  
(2008: £16.7 million).
–  Gross profit up 19% to £7.6 million  
(2008: £6.4 million).
–  Underlying EBITDA* up 61% to £1.5 million 
(2008: £0.9 million).
The 18% increase in Group revenue is pleasing 
given the difficult economic conditions, but 
even more so is the 53% growth in Business 
Division revenues largely offsetting a 5% 
decline in the lower margin, wholesale services 
from the T echnologies Division. The increasing 
contribution from our Business Division 
represents a significant change in the Group’ s 
earnings profile. The majority of the Business 
Division’ s revenues are generated from 
long-term contracts, of up to seven years, 
providing a greater level of earnings visibility  
to the Group as a whole. 
The 61% increase in underlying EBITDA* 
demonstrates the success of our “Acquire, 
Integrate, Grow” model. 
 In particular, we are able to convert significant 
elements of gross profit directly into EBITDA 
by bolting acquisitions quickly and efficiently 
onto our already established operations and 
existing cost base. By effective profiling of 
newly-acquired customers, we then identify 
and pursue cross-sale opportunities.
The loss before taxation for the year was 
£1.7million (2008: £4.0million loss), after 
deducting non-cash finance charges of 
£0.8million (2008: £3.1million). The non-cash 
finance charges relate to IFRS costs on 
modification and conversion of indebtedness 
to Penta.
Since the year end we have agreed a 
proposed balance sheet restructuring with 
Penta converting up to £6.9 million of debt into 
equity at a price of 0.6p per ordinary share. 
This follows on from a similar £2.6 million debt 
to equity conversion by Penta in May 2008. 
The Directors believe that the proposed 
conversion of Penta debt will benefit SpiriT el  
in a number of ways. The Company will have a 
much stronger balance sheet, unencumbered 
by £6.9 million of Penta indebtedness and, at 
the conversion price, the proposed conversion 
will significantly increase the market 
capitalisation of the Company. In addition,  
the Company will not be liable for the £550,000  
annual interest cost which is due to accrue 
from May 2010. With a stronger balance sheet 
SpiriT el will be better positioned to raise capital 
and continue its recent successful acquisitive 
strategy, focusing on earnings enhancing 
transactions. Penta’ s support for SpiriT el is 
invaluable and we thank them for their 
continued faith in our business model and 
management team. 
We also continue to benefit from the support 
of Clydesdale Bank. During the year under 
review we secured an extension to our loan 
facility to fund the acquisition of ED 
Communications and at the year end we had 
a total facility of £3.4million with the bank. In 
May 2009 the Group’ s facilities were increased 
to £4.5million, repayable over five years. 
Strategy
Despite the ongoing consolidation in our 
sector, the UK telecommunications market 
remains highly fragmented. This, alongside  
the accelerating demand from customers  
for converged, IP-based services, provides  
the opportunity for us to further execute  
the Group’ s “Acquire, Integrate, Grow” strategy.  
Our strategy is to grow shareholder value 
through selective, earnings enhancing 
acquisitions, followed by consistent organic 
growth being driven by cross-selling our 
integrated product portfolio.
* Operating profit after adding back charges for depreciation, 
amortisation, share-based payments and exceptional costs.
05 SpiriT el continues to pursue selective 
acquisitions as we look to build a business  
with the operational scale and the broad 
product offering that business and corporate 
consumers increasingly demand. Having 
completed six acquisitions, led by the same 
management team, not only are we clear  
on the type of businesses that we are looking 
for in terms of quickly adding value to the 
Group, but we are also experienced in the 
critical phase of integration, which commences  
well in advance of completion of the deal.  
All acquisitions now follow the same integration 
framework which was developed internally  
to meet our corporate objectives. The process 
is led by a senior member of the management 
team and helps ensure that we maximise  
both cost and revenue synergy opportunities, 
whilst minimising disruption to the Group  
and the newly-acquired business.
We expect to continue to target growth 
through earnings enhancing acquisitions and 
following the proposed restructure of our 
balance sheet, we expect to be well positioned 
to raise new capital to deploy in the acquisition 
of new customers and products in order  
to enhance earnings. 
 In recent months we have been particularly 
encouraged by our successes in cross-sales 
of our growing product range to existing 
customers. During the 12 month period to 
April 2009, we secured cross-sales contracts 
valued at more than £7 million. This is 
contracted and recurring revenue and delivers 
a new level of earnings visibility to the Group. 
During the year we profiled our expanded 
customer base and estimated that our existing 
customers are spending a total of over  
£80 million on telecoms services that SpiriT el 
could potentially provide from our current 
product portfolio. Although rapidly growing, 
our penetration of this spend is currently less 
than 15% which illustrates the upside 
opportunity which we intend to exploit by 
deploying our successful cross-selling strategy. 
The quick and efficient integration of our acquisitions  
is key to the rapid delivery of their earnings potential 
and the successful cross-selling of our broadening 
product offering into existing and new customers.  
We have demonstrated our ability to speedily integrate 
new businesses into the SpiriT el Business 
infrastructure, creating cost savings and generating 
new cross-selling opportunities.

Alastair Mills, Chief Executive
Chief Executive’ s review continued Acquisitions
SpiriT el continued its recent series of 
acquisitions this year with the purchase of ED 
Communications, which added approximately 
700 business customers who were rapidly 
integrated into our Networks line of business. 
This acquisition provides a typical example  
of how the Group is now able to bolt on a 
customer base efficiently and then enhance  
its contribution through cost synergies and 
cross-selling. The total consideration for  
this company will total £1.4 million, including 
earn out.
The full year contribution from mobile business 
WN1, acquired in April 2008, proved even 
more successful than we had hoped and this 
line of business continues to deliver strong 
organic growth. WN1 is highly profitable and,  
by adding a range of mobile voice and data 
services, the transaction completed our 
integrated product portfolio. Since the year 
end, converged voice and data mobile 
solutions have grown to over one third of our 
total mobile sales. Not only are we delighted 
with the earnings contribution from WN1, now 
integrated as SpiriT el Mobile, but the mobility 
offering is a differentiator in comparison to 
many competitors who are limited to a fixed 
line offering. 
During the year we looked closely at a number 
of acquisition opportunities, including several 
larger companies. We believe we have 
demonstrated our ability to grow shareholder 
value from the selective addition of bolt on 
acquisitions and we continue to actively 
pursue opportunities which deliver short-term 
earnings enhancement benefits and cross-sell 
opportunities. 
Operations
SpiriT el’ s customer base now numbers some 
2,300 separate accounts for business and 
public sector companies and organisations. 
Greater customer numbers result in increased 
cross-selling opportunities and although we 
focus on larger customers more than many  
of our competitors, the size of the base is an 
obvious, yet important key performance 
indicator for the Business Division. The current 
customer base is 53% larger than at April 
2008 and 227% above 2007 levels. 
Our customers are served by our two 
complementary Divisions: SpiriT el Business 
and SpiriT el T echnologies – working alongside 
and supporting each other. The Business 
Division has three lines of business: IP 
Communications, Networks and Mobile. 
SpiriT el IP Communications provides an 
advanced range of IP networking services  
to business customers alongside traditional 
structured cabling, equipment and 
maintenance services. SpiriT el Networks offers 
fixed line services including calls, lines and 
broadband. SpiriT el Mobile provides mobile 
voice and data services, including BlackBerry 
and other converged voice and data services.
SpiriT el has achieved the highest O2 
accreditation and is one of just a few O2 
Centre of Excellence (CoE) partners in the UK.  
The O2 Centre of Excellence is an industry 
leading programme which continues to set 
demanding qualifying criteria, including 
exceptional customer service and commitment 
to the business sector. 
SpiriT el is also a member of the BlackBerry 
Alliance. SpiriT el provides the BlackBerry® 
solution allowing users to stay connected  
with wireless access to email, corporate data, 
phone, web and organiser features. With  
a BlackBerry solution, you can enhance the 
productivity of your organisation by pushing 
data out to where it’ s needed most – your 
mobile workforce.
SpiriT el has a longstanding relationship  
with Mitel, one of the world’ s leading providers  
of IP based communications solutions for 
business customers. After a continued period 
of investment in training and support on  
both sides, SpiriT el has achieved the highest 
accreditation possible – Premier Partner.  
Using a Mitel 3600 platform, SpiriT el also  
rolled out two of the UK’ s largest hosted VoIP 
contracts for Regent Inns and Youngs. We are 
also an accredited Mitel Hospitality specialist.
07 SpiriT el has experienced rapid growth in revenues, 
earnings and customer numbers. Among our 
expanding customer base are a number of diverse  
blue chip companies with whom we have longstanding 
relationships. Our organic growth strategy includes 
selling more products into each of our customers.
GROW
Whilst ensuring our team delivers an 
exceptional level of customer service, during 
the year we have focused on cost control  
and despite the EDC acquisition and the 
associated addition of 700 new customers 
staff numbers have only risen to 109 at the 
year end. (2008: 104). We continue to offer 
nationwide engineering coverage to our 
customers along with 24/7/365 support.  
We have also been able to reduce our cost 
base through the utilisation of our own 
technological expertise in the remote 
management of customer sites. Over 70%  
of customer faults reported to our IP 
Communications service team are now  
fixed remotely from our operations centres  
in London and Wigan, with no employee  
visit to the customer’ s site being required. 
A key aspect of our Business Division is  
its ability to act as a one stop shop for 
business customers by providing a fully 
integrated product offering. Whilst we remain 
cautious on heavy investment in the research 
and development of new technology, our 
strategic partnerships with leading vendors 
such as O2 and Mitel enable us to remain  
well positioned to capitalise on the rapidly  
changing telecoms market. 
Of particular note is the continued growth  
of our hosted VoIP offering, where extensions 
sold and supported grew by 86% over the 
year. Major contract wins included hosted 
VoIP , as part of a managed services contract, 
across Young & Co Brewery’ s estate and 
SpiriT el’ s success was recognised when we 
won the VoIP Solution of the Year award in 
October 2008 at the National Comms 
Business Awards. SpiriT el also won a number 
of other industry awards over the past year 
and continues to build on the excellent 
relationships that we have forged with industry 
leading partners including 02, BlackBerry and 
Mitel. Our newly acquired Mobile business also 
achieved 02 Centre of Excellence status in 
August 2008. 
T o support integration of acquisitions and 
ensure we maximise the cross-sell opportunity 
for all acquired customer bases, we 
implemented a Group-wide CRM facility during 
the year. Following several notable cross-selling 
wins in early 2009, we achieved our largest 
cross-sale to date in May 2009, a 30 month 
network services deal with a global hotel group 
that is expected to generate up to £4 million  
in revenue over the contract term. The deal 
involved SpiriT el replacing BT , who still has  
an estimated 50% total market share, as 
supplier. The contract win provides evidence  
of our ability to service major corporates  
as well as our 2,300 SME customers and  
also illustrates clearly the steps we are taking  
to maximise the significant cross-sell 
opportunities we are identifying.

Alastair Mills, Chief Executive
Chief Executive’ s review continued Summary and outlook
The year to 30 April 2009 was a year of 
significant progress for SpiriT el. We delivered 
strong revenue growth and an even greater 
uplift in underlying EBITDA*. We also continued 
to gain widespread recognition for the quality 
of our IP-based services and the innovation  
we have demonstrated in the delivery of 
converged communications services. 
Our strategy of targeted acquisitions  
which bring immediate earnings enhancement, 
and ongoing cross-sell opportunities, has seen 
revenue and profits rise substantially in the 
past year, as we start to benefit from full 
contributions from acquisitions. We have a 
highly scalable model where we can bolt  
on new, earnings enhancing assets whilst 
maintaining the delivery of consistent  
organic growth.
Whilst we have felt the challenges of a severe 
economic downturn and more specifically an 
ongoing, declining profitability in the wholesale 
markets, the contribution from our rapidly 
growing Business Division is very encouraging. 
We have demonstrated our ability to enhance 
earnings through acquisitions, followed up by 
significant cross-selling successes from our 
range of converged products and services  
into both new and existing customer bases. 
Although we are not immune to the impact  
of a recessionary economic environment,  
our product set is naturally defensive and our 
downside exposure is mitigated. We are 
witnessing a renewed and growing interest  
in cost savings that are prompting new  
sales opportunities. Our ability to add value  
to our customers through innovative and cost 
effective solutions, gives us confidence about 
our prospects through the economic downturn.
SpiriT el has an experienced and energised 
management team, and a highly skilled  
and committed staff who have together 
proved their ability to execute strategy.  
The foundations are in place to deliver ongoing 
value to shareholders and I look forward to  
the coming year with confidence.

Report of the Directors 
 
SpiriTel plc  
Annual report and accounts 2009 
The Directors submit their report and financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2009.  
Results and dividends 
The Group loss for the year after taxation amounted to £934,000 (2008: loss £3,758,000), after exceptional costs of £663,000  
(2008: £620,000).  
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2008: £nil). 
Principal activities and review of business 
The principal activity is the provision of telecommunication services. 
SpiriTel is a business communications group which is taking advantage of the opportunities created by rapidly changing telecoms markets  
in the UK as the migration to Internet Protocol (IP) based services accelerates. The Group is a consolidator of the highly fragmented UK 
telecoms reseller market and is building a substantial customer base and scale through selective earnings-enhancing acquisitions. The Group  
is organised into two divisions, SpiriTel Technologies – focused on our infrastructure and IP products and services – and SpiriTel Business, 
which provides our fully integrated range of voice and data services directly to our business customers. 
SpiriTel offers a broad range of voice and data communications products and services to a customer base of small and medium sized 
enterprises and an increasing number of larger national and international organisations. We are a recognised leader in the provision of new,  
but proven, Voice over IP (VoIP) solutions that are firmly based on the old-fashioned service values which run throughout the Group. 
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s review on pages 2 to 9 provide further information about the Group’s principal activities,  
the business and financial performance during the year. 
Due to the embryonic stage of development the Directors do not consider it appropriate to provide information on Key Performance Indicators. 
Key risks 
Economic downturn 
The success of the business may be affected by any downturn in the general economic environment. In particular, this could influence the 
availability of bank finance and the cost of that finance, customers’ willingness and ability to invest in capital goods, customer settlement 
patterns and the incidence of bad debts. 
In response to this risk, senior management aim to keep abreast of economic conditions. Effective relationships are established with the 
Group’s bankers and other debt providers and there are regular reviews of customers’ credit worthiness and debt levels.  
Product obsolescence 
Telecommunications is a fast moving market sector and the pace of technological change is rapid. As a result, products may become obsolete 
following the development and introduction of new technology. 
The Company maintains partnerships with those of its potential suppliers which it believes will keep it to the forefront of product development  
on a sustained basis and regularly monitors trends in technological advancement so as to anticipate and plan for future changes. 
Regulatory change 
Governmental agencies, in particular Ofcom, may seek to implement or amend regulations which could affect product pricing or the nature and 
scope of activities of major industry players, such as BT. Such action could affect the Group’s profitability either directly or indirectly. 
Currently, governmental regulation only affects the Technologies division and a limited number of products within the Networks line of business. 
The Directors constantly monitor regulatory change so as to mitigate this risk. 
Future prospects 
Future prospects are outlined in the Chairman’s statement and CEO review at pages 2 to 9. 
Post balance sheet events 
Post balance sheet events are disclosed in note 29 to the financial statements. 
Political and charitable contributions 
No political contributions were made during the year (2008: £nil). Charitable contributions made during the year amounted to £8,000  
(2008: £6,000).

Notes: 
1) S Scott’s interest is non-beneficial, as a Director of the manager of the Penta funds. 
Employees 
The Group aims for fair reward and recognition for all employees.  
The Group has continued its practice of keeping employees informed of matters affecting them as employees and the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the Group. 
Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full and fair consideration for all vacancies in accordance with their particular 
aptitudes and abilities. 
In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is given to retrain them in order that their employment with the Group may continue. 
It is the policy of the Group that training, career development and promotion opportunities should be available to all employees. 
Financial risk management objectives and policies 
The Group uses various financial instruments which include cash, bank and other loan facilities and items such as trade debtors and trade 
creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. The Directors review and agree 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged from previous years.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely 
and profitably. The Group finances its investment in tangible fixed assets primarily through cash balances. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group finances its operations through a combination of cash balances and loans. The Group manages its exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations by entering into fixed rate agreements with the lender where possible and, with the majority of its loans by value has secured a 
waiver of interest by agreeing with the lender fixed redemption premium terms and conversion rights into ordinary shares of the Company. 
Similar arrangements have been secured in relation to the outstanding preference shares. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors. The principal credit risk arises from trade debtors. The Directors manage 
credit risk by setting limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits, debtor 
ageing and collection history are reviewed by the finance department on a regular basis. 
Currency risk 
The Group has limited exposure to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk.

Supplier payment policy 
The Group’s policy, in relation to all its suppliers, is to settle the terms of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction and to abide  
by those terms provided that it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and 
conditions. The Group does not follow any specific code or statement of payment practice. The number of days’ billings from suppliers 
outstanding at 30 April 2009 was 27 days (2008: 39 days). 
Corporate governance 
The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. Although, as an AIM listed company, the Company is  
not required to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code, the Board recognises the importance of, and is committed to, ensuring  
that effective corporate governance procedures relevant to smaller listed companies are in place. 
The Board 
The Board consists of a Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors and meets approximately every 
four to six weeks throughout the year. 
The Board reviews the performance of the Company and its subsidiaries through the use of management accounts and other regular reports 
and information presented to it by the executive team. A formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision is in place, including 
overall strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and general and risk management policies. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties all Directors have full access to all relevant information and to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. In addition, there is a procedure in place for Directors to take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their 
duties, if necessary at the Company’s expense. 
The Board has established the following committees to which it has delegated specific responsibilities: 
The Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee, consisting of the Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors, is responsible for reviewing the size, structure and 
composition of the Board, succession planning and identifying and monitoring candidates for all Board vacancies. Appointments to the Board 
of Directors are made by the Board of Directors. The Non-Executive Directors currently serving on the Committee are Lord St John of Bletso, 
Steven Maine and Steven Scott. 
The Remuneration Committee 
The composition and activities of the Remuneration Committee are described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 15 to 17. 
The Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee, which comprises the Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors, meets on a six-monthly basis. The Committee 
considers all aspects of the Group’s system of internal control and reviews the interim and annual financial statements before submission to the 
Board for approval. The Committee has unrestricted access to the Group’s auditor and ensures that auditor objectivity and independence has 
not been compromised. It will also recommend the appointment of and review the fees of the external auditor. The Committee does not believe 
an internal audit function can be justified for the Group at the current time. The Non-Executive Directors currently serving on the Committee are 
Lord St John of Bletso, Steven Scott and Steven Maine. 
Relations with shareholders 
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. The Company encourages the participation of both institutional and private  
investors. There is a regular dialogue with shareholders and potential shareholders including presentations after the Company’s preliminary 
announcement of its year end results. The Board also uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and maintains an  
up-to-date record of news releases and other information of interest to shareholders on its web site at www.spiritelplc.com. 
Going concern 
The current economic conditions create uncertainty over the level of demand for the Group’s services and the availability of bank finance in the 
foreseeable future. The Group currently meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through bank facilities which comprise term loan, 
overdraft and invoice discounting facilities. These facilities were renewed in May 2009, July 2009 and March 2009 respectively. There are no 
matters which have been drawn to the Directors’ attention to suggest that the continued provision of these facilities may not be forthcoming on 
acceptable terms. In addition to these bank facilities, the Group is also funded by various loan instruments from Penta Capital, as disclosed in 
note 20. The Group has received confirmation from Penta that they do not intend to seek repayment of these facilities until 31 October 2010 at 
the earliest. However, as disclosed in note 29 to the financial statements, the outstanding Penta loans will become convertible into equity share 
capital, subject to approval from the Takeover Panel and the Group’s shareholders at the forthcoming EGM. 
The Directors have prepared forecasts and projections for the Group, which take account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance and show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities, and comply with all financial covenants. 
On this basis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and 
financial statements for the parent company in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).  
The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
– state whether applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and UK GAAP for the preparation of the parent company financial statements, subject to  
any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.  
In so far as each of the Directors is aware: 
– there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and 
– the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of that information. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s web site. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. 
Auditors 
Grant Thornton UK LLP, have expressed willingness to continue in office. In accordance with Section 489(4) of the Companies Act 2006  
a resolution to reappoint Grant Thornton UK LLP will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 30 October 2009.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
 
SpiriTel plc  
Annual report and accounts 2009 
General information 
The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of Non-Executive Directors. None of them has any personal financial interest in the matters to 
be decided (other than as shareholders or holders of options over ordinary shares), potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships 
nor any day-to-day involvement in running the business. The names of the Directors who have served on the Remuneration Committee during 
the year are as follows: 
Lord St John of Bletso 
S Scott 
S Maine 
The Committee’s role is to review the performance of the Executive Directors and to set the scale and structure of their remuneration, paying 
due regard to the interests of shareholders as a whole and the performance of the Group. Specifically, the Remuneration Committee agrees  
the principal terms of their service contracts, including salaries and other benefits, such as bonuses and share options, and other terms and 
conditions of employment. 
General policy 
The Committee’s executive remuneration policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate individuals to ensure the success of the Group 
relative to other UK businesses of similar size and complexity. External comparisons look at comparable roles in similar organisations, in terms 
of size, market sector, and business complexity. Remuneration packages are designed to reward Directors and Executive Group members 
fairly for their contributions whilst remaining within the range of benefits offered by similar companies in the sector. The Remuneration 
Committee seeks to structure total benefits packages which align the interests of shareholders and senior executives. Executive remuneration 
will continue to be the subject of regular review in accordance with this policy. 
Bonus schemes 
The Group operates discretionary bonus schemes for certain senior managers and other employees. Individual payments made under the 
schemes are partially dependent on the achievement of financial targets and also on the achievement of predetermined individual objectives. 
The Group also tailors bonus arrangements for certain Directors and staff members so as to provide incentivisation for the achievement of  
On Target Earnings commensurate with comparable roles within the industry sector. The Executive Directors and certain senior managers  
also participate in a long-term incentive plan, details of which are given on page 17. 
Policy on service contracts 
The Directors all have service contracts, which require between one and six months’ notice of termination.  
Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for remuneration in the form of salary, bonus and other customary benefits, such as permanent 
health insurance and life assurance as appropriate. The Company also facilitates contributions to personal pension schemes for Directors 
wishing to take part of their benefits in that form. 
Directors’ service contracts

2. Accounting policies 
The accounting policies adopted in relation to IFRS are set out below. There have been no changes to these accounting policies during the 
current financial year.  
Significant accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management makes certain judgements and estimates. Estimates focus on areas such as the 
carrying values and estimated lives of non-current assets. 
The accounting policy descriptions include descriptions of areas where judgement is exercised and in consequence might have a significant  
risk of causing material adjustment within the next financial year. In this regard, the key areas are impairment of goodwill, revenue recognition, 
intangible assets, valuation of financial liabilities and share based compensation.  
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated. The “value in use” calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating  
unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value (see note 11). 
The carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £5,695,000 (2008: £5,292,000). 
Revenue recognition 
In making their judgement, management has considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods as outlined  
in IAS 18 “Revenue” and, in particular, where the Group has transferred to the customer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
goods and whether the Group has fulfilled its contractual obligations. Management is satisfied that recognition of all such revenue in the current 
year is appropriate. 
Intangible assets 
In establishing the initial values of intangible assets separately identified on acquisition as required by IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” 
management has estimated the future cash flows attributable to assets acquired and their estimated useful economic lives and applied  
a suitable weighted average cost of capital to calculate present values. 
The carrying value of intangible assets at the balance sheet date was £4,484,000 (2008: £4,392,000). 
Share-based compensation 
The assumptions on the expected life of share options, volatility of share price, risk free yield to maturity and expected dividend yield on shares 
are used in the fair value calculation of the Group’s share options outstanding at the balance sheet date (see note 27). 
Financial instruments 
The valuation of embedded derivatives contained within the Group’s borrowings is performed using option modelling techniques and requires 
assumptions to be made including expected life of options, volatility of share prices, risk free yield to maturity and expected dividend yields  
on shares. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings, together  
with the Group’s share of the net assets and results of joint ventures. The financial statements of all Group companies are adjusted, where 
necessary, to ensure the use of consistent accounting policies. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included in the Group 
income statement from or up to the date that control passes respectively.  
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. The acquisition of Spiritel Technologies during 2005 has been accounted for 
under the reverse acquisition method, on the basis that the substance of the business combination was that Spiritel Technologies Limited 
acquired Spiritel Plc by a reverse acquisition.  
For business combinations completed prior to the date of transition to IFRS (1 May 2006) the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3  
“Business Combinations” retrospectively.  
Accordingly, the classification of the combination (acquisition, reverse acquisition or merger) remains unchanged from that used under  
UK GAAP. Assets and liabilities are recognised at date of transition if they would be recognised under IFRS, and are measured using  
their UK GAAP carrying amount immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires fair value measurement. 
Deferred tax and minority interest are adjusted for the impact of any consequential adjustments after taking advantage of the  
transitional provisions.  
The transitional provisions used for past business combinations apply equally to past acquisitions of interests in associated and joint ventures.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Revenue  
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Group and can be reliably measured.  
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:  
Managed services  
Revenue from managed services is recognised in the month in which the services are provided. Services provided in the year but not billed  
are accrued within receivables as accrued income.  
Call termination  
Revenue from call termination is recognised in the month in which it occurs. Call termination services provided in the year but not billed  
are recognised within receivables as accrued income.  
Networks services 
Revenue from telephony network services is recognised in the month in which the services are provided. Calls made in the year but not billed 
are recognised within receivables as accrued income.  
IP Communications 
IP Communications revenues comprise the sale of goods, including installation, and the provision of maintenance and hosting services. 
Revenue from the sale of goods, including installation, is recognised when the significant risks and benefits of ownership of the product have 
transferred to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or completion of the installation as determined by the contract terms. Revenue from 
maintenance and hosting contracts and other fixed term service agreements is recognised evenly over the period of the contract with revenue 
for the unexpired period of the contract being recognised as deferred income. 
Mobile 
Mobile revenue comprises connection commissions received from mobile network operators and a share of the network operators’ ongoing 
revenue. Connection commissions are recognised when the customer is connected to the mobile network after providing for expected future 
rebates. Ongoing revenue share, based on end user call volumes, is recognised in the period in which it is earned.  
Goodwill 
Goodwill representing the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any excess of the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities in comparison to cost is recognised 
immediately after acquisition in the income statement. 
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to the date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves. There is no re-instatement of goodwill that was 
amortised prior to transition to IFRS. Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not written back to profit and loss on subsequent disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are included at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided 
on these assets on a straight-line basis to write off their historical cost, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful economic lives 
as follows: 
Leasehold improvements  – over the period of the lease 
Office and computer equipment – 10% to 33% straight line 
Plant and equipment  – 20% to 33% straight line 
Motor vehicles   – 33% straight line 
Intangible assets  
In accordance with IFRS 3 – “Business Combinations”, an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is deemed to have a cost to  
the Group of its fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of the intangible asset reflects the market expectations about the probability 
that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the Group. 
Acquisitions during the current and prior financial years have resulted in the following categories of intangible assets being identified: 
Customer relationships 
Marketing assistance 
Customer order backlog 
Trade names

Amortisation 
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are as follows:  
Customer relationships  – 6 years 
Third party marketing assistance – 3 years 
Customer order backlog  – over the period that the orders will be invoiced    
Trade names   – 1 or 2 years 
Impairment testing of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment  
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows  
(cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. 
Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and 
represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors the related cash flows. 
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested 
for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an internal 
discounted cash flow evaluation. Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited 
initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. 
With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no 
longer exist. 
Leased assets 
Finance leases and hire purchase agreements 
Where the Group enters into a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee, the lease is 
treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments and is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the asset’s useful economic life. Future instalments under such 
leases, net of finance charges, are included in creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to  
the income statement at a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding, and the capital element, which reduces 
the outstanding obligation. 
Operating lease agreements 
Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are treated as operating leases.  
Rentals under operating leases are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after provisions are made in respect of obsolete and slow moving items.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all further costs to complete and all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution. Cost is assigned on a first-in, first-out basis. 
Current tax 
The current tax charge is based on the profit or loss for the year and is measured at the amounts expected to be paid based on the tax  
rates and laws substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement for the  
period except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or loss that is or has been recognised directly in the statement of total recognised 
gains and losses.   
 27 
 
 
SpiriTel plc  
Annual report and accounts 2009 
2. Accounting policies continued 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an obligation to pay more tax  
in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided that they are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction  
is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and 
joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not 
occur in the foreseeable future. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable  
on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand. 
Foreign currency 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of 
monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the income 
statement in the period in which they arise. 
Contributions to pension schemes 
The Group contributes to the personal pension schemes of certain Directors and employees. The pension costs are charged against operating 
profit in the relevant accounting period. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are material items which individually, or if a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence 
in order to understand the Group’s financial performance. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are 
obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recorded initially at fair value and all transaction costs  
are recognised immediately in the income statement. All other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs. 
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are re-measured at each reporting date at fair value, with changes in fair 
value being recognised in the income statement. A financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is a derivative that is not designated and 
effective as a hedging instrument. 
All other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an 
expense in finance cost in the income statement. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue 
costs, are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of 
the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

Classification as equity or financial liability 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
A financial liability exists where there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities under potentially unfavourable conditions. In addition, contracts which result in the entity delivering a  
variable number of its own equity instruments are financial liabilities. Shares containing such obligations are classified as financial liabilities. 
Finance costs and gains or losses relating to financial liabilities are included in the income statement. The carrying amount of the liability  
is increased by the finance cost and reduced by payments made in respect of that liability. 
Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding liability. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.  
Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited directly to reserves. 
Compound instruments 
Compound instruments comprise both a liability and an equity component. The elements of a compound instrument are classified in 
accordance with their contractual provisions. At the date of issue, the liability component is recorded at fair value, which is estimated using  
the prevailing market interest rate for a similar debt instrument without the equity feature. Thereafter, the liability component is accounted for  
as a financial liability in accordance with the accounting policy set out above. 
The residual is the equity component, which is accounted for as an equity instrument. 
Embedded derivatives 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at their fair value with changes  
in fair value recognised in profit or loss. 
Where there have been significant modifications to the terms of existing financial liabilities these are accounted for as an extinguishment of  
the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The gain/loss arising on the modification is included in the income 
statement and is calculated as the fair value of the new financial liability compared to the fair value of the original financial liability immediately 
prior to the modification. Where equity instruments have been issued as part of the modification, the issue of the equity is accounted for as  
a transaction with equity holders and no gain/loss is recognised in that respect. 
Equity 
Equity comprises the following: 
– Share capital represents the nominal value of equity shares. 
– Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the 
share issue. 
– Other reserves represent equity-settled share-based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised and the equity 
component of financial instruments. 
– Reverse acquisition reserve represents the amount recognised in respect of the reverse acquisition accounting treatment of the acquisition  
of Spiritel plc by Spiritel Technologies Limited (formerly Expo Communications Limited) in 2005. 
Government grants 
Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are held in liabilities and released to the income statement to match against the 
depreciation on the related assets.

2. Accounting policies continued 
Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payment 
The Group issues equity-settled benefits to certain Directors and employees. All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 July 2005 
that had not vested prior to 1 May 2006 are recognised in the financial statements. Where employees are rewarded using share-based 
payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the 
employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions. All equity-settled share-
based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a corresponding credit to other reserves. 
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number of  
share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. 
No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised. 
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributed transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where appropriate, 
additional paid in capital 
Cash-settled share-based payment 
For cash-settled share-based payments the goods and services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability 
and allocated as an expense over the vesting period. The liability is then re-measured until settlement with changes being recognised in the 
income statement.  
3. Revenue and segmental information

The addition to purchased goodwill in the current financial year relates to the acquisitions of ED Communications Limited (see note 15). 
The other adjustment to goodwill relates to (i) fair value adjustments to the book value of liabilities acquired on the acquisition of WN1 Limited  
of £145,000 to account for unrecorded liabilities; and (ii) a completion accounts reduction to the consideration of £49,000.

11. Goodwill continued 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value  
may be impaired. Goodwill was allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units (CGUs), based on the following  
acquired businesses: 
– SpiriTel Mobile 
– SpiriTel IP Communications 
– SpiriTel Networks  
These CGUs, and specifically the separable acquisitions inherent in each CGU, represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill 
was monitored by management for internal reporting purposes, and the level that represented the smallest identifiable group of assets which 
generated largely independent cash inflows. 
The recoverable amount of all the CGUs was based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on the 2010 forecast  
which was approved by the Board and extrapolated for a further 6 – 15 years by a growth rate applicable to each unit. The projections are 
based on the following revenue growth rates, up to and including year five:  
– SpiriTel Mobile   7% 
– Spiritel IP Communications 6% 
– Spiritel IP Networks  5% 
Cost growth was projected at levels below sales growth as the Directors anticipate that the CGUs will be able to increase revenues without 
corresponding increases in costs. A discount rate of 10% was applied to these projections, based on the Directors’ assessment of the 
weighted average cost of capital for the company. 
Based on this impairment review, the Directors have made an impairment charge of £199,000 against Spiritel CallPlan Limited which is included 
with the Spiritel Networks CGU. 
With the exception of Spiritel CallPlan, as disclosed above, the discounted cash flow projections exceed the carrying value of each CGU  
and therefore there has been no other impairment of goodwill during the financial year. Sensitivity analysis has indicated that no reasonably 
foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment calculations would result in any impairment charge being recorded in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
The carrying amount of goodwill is split as follows:

14. Investments  
The Group holds a 50% interest In MyPhone (UK) Limited, a joint venture undertaking. At 30 April 2009, the Group’s share of the losses of the 
joint venture exceeded its interest in the company, and therefore in accordance with IAS 28, the Group has not recognised these losses on the 
basis that the Group has not incurred obligations on behalf of the joint venture. At 30 April 2009, the Group’s share of the accumulated losses 
of the joint venture undertaking was £47,000 (2008: £47,000).

Goodwill on the acquisition of ED Communications Limited is largely attributable to the cross-selling opportunities. 
During the period from the date of acquisition to 30 April 2009, ED Communications Limited generated revenue of £1,121,000 and an 
operating profit of £287,000. Due to the lack of IFRS specific data for ED Communications Limited prior to its acquisition, the pro-forma revenue 
and profit of the Group, had this acquisition taken place on 1 May 2008, have not been disclosed as they cannot be reliably determined.

Bank loans 
Bank loans comprise a term loan from Clydesdale Bank plc of £2,527,500 (2008: £1,912,500). Deferred arrangement fees of £201,000  
(2008: £165,000) have been netted against the amount disclosed above. 
Under a loan agreement dated 27 July 2007, Clydesdale Bank plc provided a term loan of £750,000. As at 30 April 2009, the amount 
outstanding was £562,500 comprising 15 quarterly payments of £37,500 with the final payment due on 31 December 2012. 
Under a loan agreement dated 2 April 2008, Clydesdale Bank plc provided a term loan of £1,200,000. As at 30 April 2009, the amount 
outstanding was £960,000 comprising 16 quarterly payments of £60,000 with the final payment due on 31 March 2013. 
Under a loan agreement dated 4 August 2008, Clydesdale Bank plc provided a term loan facility of £1,900,000 of which £1,100,000 has  
been drawn down at 30 April 2009, with the balance to be drawn to pay amounts due as deferred consideration and earn-out on acquisitions. 
As at 30 April the amount outstanding was £1,005,000 and the undrawn amount is £800,000. This loan is repayable in 20 instalments of 
£95,000 with one instalment having been paid at 30 April 2009. The final payment date will depend on the final amount drawn but will be  
no later than 30 November 2013.  
The Group also has a £250,000 overdraft facility, repayable on demand, and an invoicing discounting facility of £650,000. The loans and 
overdraft carry interest charged at approximately 2.75% above the Clydesdale Bank base rate. 
All Clydesdale Bank plc facilities are secured by debentures over the assets of the Group. 
Other loans 
Other loan notes comprise an interest free loan note of £300,000 issued to the vendors of WN1 Limited, repayable on 1 May 2009. 
Penta loans, loan notes and redeemable preference shares (the “Penta facilities”) 
Modification and conversion during the year 
At 1 May 2008, the company had outstanding loans and loan notes in favour of Penta amounting to £5,566,000 and £770,000 respectively. 
These loans carried the right of conversion into the company's ordinary shares under terms which meet the definition of equity and hence were 
classified as compound financial instruments.  
In addition, at 1 May 2008 the company had £4,100,000 of outstanding redeemable preference shares, together with an accrued redemption 
premium of £1,025,000. These shares, together with the redemption premium, also carried the right of conversion into the company's ordinary 
shares as follows: 
– the first £1m of nominal value, together with a redemption premium of £250,000, were convertible at 2p per ordinary share; and 
– the remaining £3.1m of nominal value, together with the associated redemption premium of £775,000, were convertible at the lower of;  
(a) a 10% discount to the prevailing market price; and (b) the latest subscription price for ordinary shares, in both cases subject to a 
minimum price of 3p per ordinary share. 
The £1m preference shares were classified as a compound financial instrument. Since the conversion terms on the £3.1m preference shares 
meet the definition of a financial liability, this instrument was classified as a host debt with an embedded derivative. The fair value of the 
embedded derivative at 1 May 2008 was £504,000. 
On 22 May 2008 the shareholders of the company, at an Extraordinary General Meeting ('EGM'), approved a modification to the terms of the 
outstanding Penta facilities. The modified terms were that Penta could convert 2,611,467 preference shares at a price of 1.1p per ordinary 
share immediately on EGM approval (the 'Initial Conversion') and that the remaining Penta facilities could be converted into ordinary shares at 
the higher of; (a) 1.5p per ordinary share; and (b) the latest subscription price for ordinary shares, subject to a restriction that Penta's holding  
of the company's ordinary shares cannot exceed 49.99%. Since these terms meet the definition of a financial liability, all the outstanding Penta 
facilities subsequent to modification have been classified as a host debt with an embedded derivative. 
On 22 October 2008, Penta converted a further 555,000 preference shares into ordinary shares at 1.5p per ordinary share.  
A reconciliation of the movements on the carrying value of the loans and loan notes (together “debt”) and the preference shares during the year 
is as follows:

Notes: 
(i) This charge is based on the fair value of the incremental number of shares issued on conversion, compared to the number of shares which 
would have been issued under the previous conversion terms. 
Management has applied certain judgements and estimates in arriving at the fair value of the embedded derivative under the modified terms  
of conversion, both at the date of modification and as at 30 April 2009. Taking into account the restriction on Penta's ability to convert the 
outstanding debt (since Penta hold the maximum 49.99% of the company's ordinary shares), the current share price of the company and the 
price at which Penta are able to convert the outstanding debt, management has concluded that the fair value of the embedded derivative is £nil, 
both at the date of modification and at 30 April 2009.  
At 30 April 2009 
The Penta loans comprise secured facilities of £5,122,000 (2008: £5,566,000) from Penta Fund 1 Limited Partnership which are repayable  
on demand.  
The Penta loan notes of £770,000 (2008: £770,000) are secured, interest free and are repayable at any time at the Company’s option.  
The terms of the redeemable preference shares are as follows: 
– Redeemable at any time at the option of the Company. 
– Do not entitle the holders to any dividend but whilst they are in issue the holders of ordinary 1p shares will not be entitled to receive any 
dividends or other distributions. 
– On a return of capital, redeemable preference shareholders will be repaid the nominal capital paid up on the redeemable preference  
shares together with an amount equal to the amount of any redemption fee then outstanding in priority to any repayment to the  
ordinary shareholders. 
– Holders of redeemable preference shares have the right to receive notice of all general meetings, but only to attend, speak and vote if a 
resolution is proposed, inter alia, for the winding up or reduction of capital of the Company or varying their rights or privileges as holders  
of redeemable preference shares or certain other matters to be proposed by the Company. 
The conversion terms of the Penta loans, loan notes and redeemable preference shares are detailed above. 
The Company’s Articles of Association include various provisions to allow for re-classification or subdivision in order to facilitate the  
conversion process. 
The Penta facilities are secured by second-ranking debentures over certain assets of the Group.

23. Share capital 
The ordinary share capital of the Company consists only of shares of par value of 1p each. All ordinary shares are equally eligible to receive 
dividends and represent one vote at the shareholder meetings of the Company. 
The preference share capital of the Company consists only of redeemable preference shares with a par value of £1 each. The preference 
shares are convertible, together with a redemption premium of £1,025,000, into ordinary shares at a price which is the higher of (i) 1.5p;  
and (ii) the price at which the last subscribers for ordinary shares had subscribed. 
The authorised share capital of the Company was increased by the creation of 500,000,000 new ordinary 1p shares as a result of a resolution 
passed by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 22 May 2008.

preference shares at 1.1p per Share, into 237,406,046 Shares following the approval by the Company’s shareholders in an Extraordinary 
General Meeting of the grant by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of a waiver in favour of the Penta Funds of any obligation on them  
to make a mandatory offer for the company in the event that they implement conversion rights attaching to loan instruments held by them 
which could result in them holding up to an aggregate of 49.99% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. 
– on 16 October 2008, 37,000,000 Shares at 1p per Share to raise net proceeds of £370,000.

Preference shares 
The terms of the preference shares give to the holder (Penta Capital) rights of conversion to ordinary shares as described above. In accordance 
with IAS 32 the preference shares are considered to be a host debt with an embedded derivative. The carrying value of the preference shares  
in the financial statements is analysed below.

24. Financial instruments 
24.1 Capital management policies and procedures 
The Group manages its capital with the objective of ensuring that entities within the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
seeking to improve the return to stakeholders through the management of the debt and equity balance. 
As a result of the significant level of loans and other financial instruments outstanding in favour of the Penta Funds, the continuing co-operation 
and support of Penta is critical to the flexibility and scope with which the Group is able to manage its capital. 
During September 2009 the Company reached an agreement with the Penta Funds, subject to shareholder approval at an EGM, for the 
amendment of conversion rights over all indebtedness. See note 29 – Post balance sheet events for fuller details.  
In May 2009 the Company secured new and increased facilities with Clydesdale Bank plc. The Directors expect the Group will comply with all 
financial covenants required by these facilities. 
The Directors consider that the borrowings payable to Penta do not represent debt for the purposes of calculating gearing and so no gearing 
ratios have been disclosed. 
24.2 Significant accounting policies 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement, and the 
basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements. 
24.3 Categories of financial instruments 
The IAS 39 categories of financial asset included in the balance sheet and the headings in which they are included are as follows: 
 
2009 
£000 
2008
£000 
Loans and other receivables - cash and cash equivalents – 1,058
Loans and other receivables - other 1,373 1,564
 1,373 2,622
The carrying amount reflected above represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.  
The IAS 39 categories of financial liabilities included in the balance sheet and the headings in which they are included are as follows: 
 
2009 
£000 
2008
£000 
Amortised cost 13,700 17,757
Fair value through profit and loss – 504

24.4 Interest rate and liquidity risk management 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and variable rates. Details of borrowings are provided in note 20  
to these financial statements. 
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up on the 
undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based upon the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay, which may differ  
from the carrying value of the liabilities at the balance sheet date. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.

The Directors do not consider that any of the Penta loan notes, the Penta loans or the redeemable preference shares (together “the Penta 
borrowings”) will result in any cash outflows but they will be converted into ordinary shares of the Company. No interest arises on any  
of the Penta borrowings. Hence no cash flows have been included in the above maturity analysis in respect of the Penta borrowings.

24.5 Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
The Group’s variable rate borrowings at 30 April 2009 were £2,527,500 (2008: £1,912,500).  
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments  
at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet 
date was outstanding for the whole of the year. 
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables remained constant, the impact on the Group’s loss for the year 
ended 30 April 2009 would be £13,000 (2008: £9,000). 
24.6 Foreign currency risk management 
The Group does not have any foreign currency denominated trade receivables or payables and is therefore not subject to any significant  
level of foreign exchange rate risk. 
24.7 Credit risk management 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The principal 
credit risk arises from the Group’s trade receivables. The trade receivables balance included 2 (2008: 4) customers who represented more  
than 5% of the total balance. In order to manage to credit risk, the Directors set limits for customers based upon a combination of payment 
history, third party credit references and an independent rating agency. The Group’s exposure and the credit rating of its counterparties are 
continuously monitored.  
Ongoing evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the accounts receivable. 
24.8 Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: 
– the fair value of financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in accordance with generally accepted  
pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes  
for similar instruments. 
– the fair value of optional derivative instruments is calculated using option pricing models. 
The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from the amount at which they are recorded in the  
financial statements.  
25. Leasing commitments  
At 30 April 2009, the Group had commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as set out below:

27. Share-based payments 
Equity settled share-based payments 
The Group’s equity-settled share-based payments comprise the grant of nil-cost options granted under the Group’s Share Option Scheme, 
EMI Share Option Scheme and individual Share Option Agreements. Details of the share options subject to equity-settled share-based 
payments are set out below. In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense to the income statement for the year ended  
30 April 2008 representing the fair value of outstanding equity-settled share-based payment awards to employees which have not vested  
as at 1 May 2006. 
Those fair values will be charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting period adjusted to reflect actual and expected vesting levels. 
The Group has calculated the fair market value of the nil-cost options as being based on the market value of a Company share at the date of 
grant adjusted to reflect the fact that an employee is not entitled to receive dividends over the relevant holding period. 
The estimated fair values of options which fall under the IFRS 2 accounting charge and inputs used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate 
those fair values are as follows:

Expected dividend yield 
The expected dividend yield used in the model is nil. 
Expected volatility 
The volatility of the Company’s share price on each grant was calculated as the average of annualised standard deviation of daily continuously 
compounded returns on the Company’s stock, calculated one year back from the date of the grant, where applicable. 
Risk free rate 
The risk free rate is the Bank of England base lending rate on the date of grant. 
Expected life 
The expected life used in the model is the average expected period to exercise and has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

29. Post balance sheet events 
During September 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Penta Capital LLP, the manager of the Penta Funds, for the 
modification of the conversion terms attaching to the Penta loans, loan notes and redeemable preference shares. The agreement is conditional 
upon the following: 
– the granting of a waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the requirement under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and 
Mergers, that would otherwise arise on Penta Fund 1 Limited Partnership and Penta Fund 1 SP Limited Partnership (the “Penta Funds”),  
to make a general offer to shareholders of the Company as a result of the allotment of new ordinary shares to the Penta Funds which  
would take the aggregate holding of the Penta Funds to greater than 50% of the issued ordinary share capital. 
– a review of the conversion terms by the Company’s nominated adviser and confirmation that the directors consider the terms of conversion 
are fair and reasonable so far as the SpiriTel shareholders are concerned. 
– approval of the waiver and modification of the conversion terms by the ordinary shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting. 
Subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting:  
– all of the current rights to convert the Company’s indebtedness to the Penta Funds into ordinary shares will lapse immediately 
– all of the current rights to interest on the Company’s indebtedness to the Penta Funds will lapse immediately 
– the Penta Funds will immediately convert up to £6.85 million of the Company’s indebtedness into ordinary shares of the Company at the 
price of 0.6p per ordinary share so that, following this conversion, the Penta Funds aggregate holding will represent up to 82.3% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital.

Annual report and accounts 2009 
1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom  
accounting standards. 
Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based payment  
The Company issues equity-settled benefits to certain Directors and employees. All share-based payment arrangements granted after  
7 July 2005 that had not vested prior to 1 May 2006 are recognised in the financial statements. Where employees are rewarded using  
share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted  
to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions. All equity-settled  
share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a corresponding credit to other reserves. 
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number of  
share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period.  
No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised. 
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where appropriate 
additional paid in capital. 
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation 
Tangible fixed assets are included at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on tangible 
fixed assets, excluding land, on a straight line basis to write off their historical cost, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful 
economic lives as follows: 
Leasehold improvements  – over the period of the lease 
Office and computer equipment – 10% or 33% straight line 
Investments 
Investments are included at cost less provisions for impairment. 
Leased assets 
Finance leases and hire purchase agreements 
Where the Company enters into a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee, the lease  
is treated as a finance lease. The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments and is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the asset’s useful economic life. Future instalments under such leases,  
net of finance charges, are included in creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit 
and loss account at a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding, and the capital element, which reduces the 
outstanding obligation. 
Operating lease agreements 
Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Company are treated as operating leases.  
Rentals under operating leases are charged against profits on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

1.  Accounting policies continued 
Current tax 
The current tax charge is based on the profit or loss for the year and is measured at the amounts expected to be paid based on the tax rates 
and laws substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the profit and loss account for the period 
except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or loss that is or has been recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and 
losses. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Company an obligation to pay more tax in  
the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more 
likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using rates of tax that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Foreign currency 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are dealt with through the 
profit and loss account. 
Contributions to pension schemes 
The Company contributes to the personal pension schemes of certain Directors and employees. The pension costs are charged against 
operating profit in the relevant accounting period.  
Financial instruments 
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities are 
obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recorded initially at fair value and all transaction costs are 
recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. All other financial liabilities are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs. 
Financial liabilities categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are re-measured at each reporting date at fair value, with changes in fair value 
being recognised in the profit and loss account. All other financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest-related charges recognised as an expense in finance cost in the profit and loss account. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis using the effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Classification as equity or financial liability 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
A financial liability exists where there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange financial 
assets or financial liabilities under potentially unfavourable conditions. In addition, contracts which result in the entity delivering a variable number 
of its own equity instruments are financial liabilities. Shares containing such obligations are classified as financial liabilities. 
Finance costs and gains or losses relating to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. The carrying amount of the liability is 
increased by the finance cost and reduced by payments made in respect of that liability.  
Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding liability.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.  
Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited directly to reserves. 
Compound instruments 
Compound instruments comprise both a liability and an equity component. The elements of a compound instrument are classified in 
accordance with their contractual provisions. At the date of issue, the liability component is recorded at fair value, which is estimated using  
the prevailing market interest rate for a similar debt instrument without the equity feature. Thereafter, the liability component is accounted for  
as a financial liability in accordance with the accounting policy set out above. 
The residual is the equity component, which is accounted for as an equity instrument. 
Embedded derivatives 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts. Embedded derivatives are recorded initially at fair value, net of issue costs.

Other related party transactions during the year were as follows: 
Penta Capital Partners Limited, through its managed funds Penta Fund 1 Limited Partnership and Penta Fund 1 SP Limited Partnership  
(the “Penta Funds”) is the holder of 49.99% of the Company’s issued ordinary 1p shares and all of the Company’s issued redeemable 
preference shares. Steven Scott, a Director of the Company is also a Director of Penta Capital Partners Limited. During the year, the Penta 
Funds converted preference shares into ordinary shares in the Company as detailed in note 11. Loan notes, all of which are outstanding to  
the Penta Funds, are described in note 9. Penta Fund 1 Limited Partnership held options over 100,000 ordinary shares of the Company at  
an exercise price of 7.25p per ordinary 1p share as at 30 April 2009. Fees paid to Penta Capital Partners Limited in respect of Steven Scott’s 
services as a Director of the Company are detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 15 to 17. At 30 April 2009, the outstanding 
balance within creditors in respect of these fees was £14,000 (2008: £89,000). The prior year balance includes outstanding amounts in respect 
of loan arrangement fees due to Penta Capital Partners Limited. 
17. Post balance sheet events 
During September 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Penta Capital LLP, the manager of the Penta Funds, for the modification 
of the conversion terms attaching to the Penta loans, loan notes and redeemable preference shares. The agreement is conditional upon  
the following: 
– the granting of a waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers of the requirement under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and 
Mergers, that would otherwise arise on Penta Fund 1 Limited Partnership and Penta Fund 1 SP Limited Partnership (the “Penta Funds”)  
to make a general offer to shareholders of the Company as a result of the allotment of new ordinary shares to the Penta Funds which  
would take the aggregate holding of the Penta Funds to greater than 50% of the issued ordinary share capital. 
– a review of the conversion terms by the Company’s nominated adviser and confirmation that the directors consider the terms of conversion 
are fair and reasonable so far as the SpiriTel shareholders are concerned. 
– approval of the waiver and modification of the conversion terms by the ordinary shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting. 
Subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting: 
– all of the current rights to convert the Company’s indebtedness to the Penta Funds into ordinary shares will lapse immediately 
– all of the current rights to interest on the Company’s indebtedness to the Penta Funds will lapse immediately 
– the Penta Funds will also immediately convert up to £6.85 million of the Company’s indebtedness into ordinary shares of the Company at  
the price of 0.6p per ordinary share so that, following this conversion, the Penta Funds aggregate holding will represent up to 82.3% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital.

or other arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with fractional entitlements or any legal or practical 
problems arising under the laws of any overseas territory, or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange or by virtue of

more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that Shareholder.  
A member wishing to appoint more than one proxy should photocopy the proxy card and indicate on each copy the name of the proxy he appoints and the number of shares in respect of 
which that proxy is appointed.   If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in relation to the same shares, the appointment received last before the latest time for receipt of proxies 
will take precedence. 
2 The appointment of a proxy must be in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form which the Directors may approve and (i) in the case of an individual must either be signed 
by the appointor or his attorney; and (ii) in the case of a corporation must be either given under its common seal or be signed on its behalf by an attorney or a duly authorised officer of the 
corporation. Any signature on or authentication of such appointment need not be witnessed. Where an appointment of a proxy is signed on behalf of the appointor by an attorney, the power 
of attorney or a copy thereof certified notarially or in some other way approved by the Directors must (failing previous registration with the Company) be submitted to the Company, failing 
which the appointment may be treated as invalid. 
3 A Form of Proxy is enclosed with this Annual Report and Accounts. The appointment of a proxy will not prevent a Shareholder from subsequently attending and voting at the Annual 
General Meeting in person. 
4 To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy, and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed (or a duly certified copy of any such power of authority), must 
either be (a) sent to the Company’s Registrars, Neville Registrars of 18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, West Midlands B63 3DA so as to arrive no later than 6.00 p.m. on 28 October 2009 or,  
if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned Annual General Meeting or (b) lodged using the CREST Proxy Voting Service – see note 7 below. 
5 Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company. The total number of issued ordinary shares in the Company on 30 September 2009,  
which is the latest practicable date before the publication of this Notice, is 617,639,692. On a vote by show of hands every member who is present shall have one vote. On a poll vote  
every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share of which he is the holder. 
6 Entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting, and the number of votes which may be cast at the meeting, will be determined by reference to the Company’s register of members at  
10.30 a.m. on 28 October 2009 or, if the meeting is adjourned, 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned meeting (as the case may be). In each case, changes to the register  
of members after such time will be disregarded. 
7 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated  
in accordance with EuroClear’s applications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message (regardless of whether it 
constitutes the appointment of a proxy, the revocation of a proxy appointment or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 7RA11) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 4 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt  
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by 
enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be communicated to him by other means. 
8 CREST members (and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) should note that EuroClear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any 
particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned  
to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST proxy or voting service  
provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members  
(and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST 
system and timings. 
9 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 
10 In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted.  
Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in SpiriTel's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).

POLYOLEFIN
Lightweight AZOTE
®
 polyolefin block 
foams produced in Croydon, UK, and 
Kentucky, USA. The most common resin 
used is low-density polyethylene. Foams 
are typically produced in dimensions of 2m 
x 1m at various thicknesses and sold to  
a wide variety of applications globally. 
Capacity improvements in UK and a 
significant investment in our Kentucky, 
USA, site to increase global capacity by 
approximately 20%, are aligned with our 
strategic objective to grow sales by twice 
global GDP. Sales in Asia are managed 
through a 50:50 JV company with INOAC 
Corporation of Japan, our largest 
customer in the region.
Revenue
During 2015 Total Revenue from Polyolefin 
foams increased 8%, with a volume 
increase of 10% offset by slightly less 
favourable foreign exchange rates. Sales 
volumes increased in all major markets.
AZOTE
®
There are many grades of AZOTE
®
 
foams, manufactured using varieties of 
polyethylene polymer. These varieties of 
polymer, combined with colour, additives 
to enhance properties such as fire 
resistance, block size and foam density, 
allow the AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams range 
to be utilised in a hugely diverse range  
of applications.
HPP
High-Performance Products. A portfolio  
of foam products that exhibit certain key 
properties, such as chemical, flammability 
or temperature resistance, due to the 
resins on which they are based. The 
manufacturing process uses the same 
unique, high-pressure nitrogen gas 
process as our AZOTE
®
 range and, 
combined with know-how and our 
increasingly recognisable ZOTEK
®
 
speciality foams brand, offers good 
barriers to entry. 
Revenue
During 2015 Total Revenue in HPP 
increased by 25% and now represents 
15% of Zotefoams’ Group Total Revenue.
ZOTEK
®
ZOTEK
®
 is the brand name for a family of 
HPP block foams. There are a number of 
foam variants manufactured from three 
main categories of polymer. ZOTEK
®
 F 
fluoropolymer foams are made from 
PVDF resin while ZOTEK
®
 N is the brand 
for nylon foams. There is increasing 
interest in our ZOTEK
®
 PEBA range of 
foams for kinetic energy management, 
particularly in the sports industry.
T-FIT
®
 
T-FIT
®
 technical insulation for cleanrooms 
is made from ZOTEK
®
 F blocks although 
we are evaluating extending this product 
range to insulation parts made from 
some of our other foam products. T-FIT 
is currently sold in the pharmaceutical 
and biotech markets, predominantly  
in Asia. 
BLOCK FOAM TECHNOLOGY
At Zotefoams we focus on producing 
high-performance, high quality foams, 
under the brand names AZOTE
®
 and 
ZOTEK
®
, using technologies exclusive to us. 
At the heart of what we do is a unique, 
environmentally friendly, process that 
uses nitrogen gas to produce a range of 
closed cell cross-linked foams. The 
process comprises three distinct stages:
• High quality extrusion and cross-
linking of solid polymeric sheet
• Impregnation of solid sheet with pure 
nitrogen gas at elevated temperature 
and extremely high pressure
• Final expansion of the impregnated 
solid sheet in the low pressure 
autoclave
This technology, as well as being 
environmentally friendly, is extremely 
flexible. Operating at temperatures up to 
250ºC/482ºF allows us to foam a wide 
range of polymers. Some of the unique 
characteristics of Zotefoams’ products 
come from the combination of foaming 
process and polymer performance, 
giving such attributes as very good fire 
resistance, high-temperature stability, 
toughness and insulation.
Regardless of polymer our technology 
produces foam that is:
• uniform • pure
• durable • lightweight
The separation of the process into the 
three distinct stages allows very accurate 
control of the individual parameters 
governing consistent production of 
high-quality foams.
MEL
Our MEL business model is to license  
our proprietary technology to customers 
who save on polymer usage when 
manufacturing their products. A proportion 
of this saving is paid to MEL as a royalty 
fee. Licence and royalty fees should 
become the largest income stream for MEL 
when our business is more mature, but 
currently machinery sales, which enable 
customers to use our technology, are the 
largest portion of revenues.
Most of MEL ’s focus is on the packaging 
market, where polymer usage is high and 
there is a high degree of commonality 
between potential customers. Our MuCell
®
 
microcellular foaming technology is 
currently used in bottles, sheet and film 
products globally.
Revenue
Total Revenue from MEL increased by 25% 
in 2015 driven by an increase in machinery 
sales and favourable foreign exchange 
rates. In 2015 MEL accounted for 5% of 
the Zotefoams Group Total Revenue.
MUCELL
® 
TECHNOLOGY
MuCell
®
 technology is a remarkable 
patented process that creates ‘micro-
bubbles’ in the core of plastic parts or 
products by injecting gas into them as 
they are manufactured. 
This produces a foamed core bounded 
by a solid skin as one integral material 
that seems indistinguishable from  
a solid product.
A MuCell
®
 extruded part or product can 
be designed to perform like solid plastic, 
but will typically use 15-20% less 
material. These cost and environmental 
benefits are delivered by using inert 
carbon dioxide or nitrogen gas, reducing 
plastic content at source. 4

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Results
Total Revenue increased by 11% to a record 
£54.44m (2014: £49.08m), with good growth 
from all business units, while profit before 
tax and exceptional items increased by 14% 
to £6.01m (2014: £5.27m). Basic earnings 
per share before exceptional items grew by 
3.7% to 11.1p (2014: 10.7p). Group Revenue 
increased by 10% to £53.87m (2014: 
£48.95m) and profit before tax increased  
by 50% to £6.01m (2014: £4.01m).
Polyolefin foams, sold under the AZOTE
®
 
brand, is our largest business unit and 
recorded a Total Revenue increase of 8%  
to £43.61m (2014: £40.44m). Sales from 
High-Performance Products (‘HPP’) 
increased by 25% to £8.27m (2014: £6.61m) 
and now represent 15% (2014: 13%) of Total 
Revenue. MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’) sales 
grew 25% to £2.62m (2014: £2.09m). 
Strategy
Zotefoams’ strategy is to expand through  
a combination of profitable organic growth 
of our Polyolefin and HPP businesses, new 
customers for our MEL technology licensing 
business, and through partnerships or 
acquisitions in related technologies, 
products or markets.
Objectives
We target sales growth in our core Polyolefin 
business in excess of twice the average rate 
of global GDP growth. Our largest markets 
are Europe and North America, served by 
manufacturing facilities in Croydon, UK, and 
in Kentucky, USA, where we are currently 
investing in additional capacity. In Asia we 
have a joint-venture agreement with INOAC 
Corporation of Japan to develop the market 
for our AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams. We are 
also committed to developing a portfolio  
of unique foam products from high-
performance polymers, with significant 
competitive advantages over rival materials, 
and to increase the customer base for 
MuCell
®
 extrusion technology. This will allow 
us to command higher margins and affirm 
our position as a leading foam technology 
company. Delivering on part of our strategy 
in Asia, we are investing in a foam moulding 
operation in China to supply T-FIT
®
 
advanced insulation materials through our 
joint venture Kunshan ZOTEK King Lai 
Limited (‘KZKL ’) with a local partner, the  
King Lai Group. We intend to achieve growth 
while continuing to improve our operating 
margins and return on capital employed. 5
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial
Investment
Zotefoams’ growth is supported by a 
programme of investment in both capacity 
and technology. The largest single 
investment is in our Walton, Kentucky, 
facility, where a high-pressure autoclave 
along with supporting extrusion capacity 
and related infrastructure is now expected  
to be commissioned in the first half of 2017. 
This facility was proceeding to plan in all 
significant aspects until the supplier 
informed us of an unscheduled delay in  
the delivery of the autoclave. 
Improvements in efficiency and output from 
existing capacity at our Croydon site, 
together with targeted investment will, we 
expect, cover our capacity needs until the 
Kentucky facility is fully commissioned. 
Additional investment at our Croydon site is 
also planned in anticipation of further growth 
in HPP sales volumes.
Talent
Zotefoams’ business relies on the skills, 
effort and dedication of our people and, on 
behalf of the Board, I would like to extend 
my thanks to each and every one of them. 
We recognise that talent management is key 
to the delivery of opportunities created by 
our product portfolio and are increasing  
our investments in people, training and 
development to meet our ambitious goals.
Board composition
On 1 February 2016 Gary McGrath was 
appointed Finance Director in succession  
to Clifford Hurst, who retires from the Board 
on 16 May 2016. On behalf of the Board and 
employees, I would like to thank Clifford for 
his part in making Zotefoams a success over 
his past 15 years of service and wish him  
all the best for the future. On 31 March this 
year I will retire as Chairman of the Board,  
a post I have held since 2007, to be 
succeeded by Steve Good, who joined 
Zotefoams in 2014 as a Non-Executive 
Director and was appointed Chairman 
Designate in November 2015. I wish both 
Gary and Steve all the best at what is a very 
exciting time for Zotefoams.
Dividend
In 2010 the Board adopted a progressive 
dividend policy subject to profit growth, 
investment requirements and the other 
needs of the Group. I am pleased to say we 
intend to retain this policy and, therefore, the 
Board is proposing a final dividend of 3.8p 
per ordinary share (2014: 3.7p) which, if 
approved by the shareholders, would make 
a total of 5.60p per ordinary share for the 
year (2014: 5.45p), an increase of 3%. If 
approved, the final dividend will be paid on 
25 May 2016 to shareholders on the register 
on 22 April 2016.
Current trading and prospects
Sales for the first two months of 2016 have 
been higher than those of the comparative 
period in 2015. Sales in AZOTE
®
 polyolefin 
foams have grown in line with our long-term 
target of twice the rate of global GDP 
growth, while our HPP business has also 
experienced a strong start to the year. MEL 
is currently experiencing high activity levels 
in machinery commissioning, following a 
particularly strong fourth quarter in 2015. 
The majority of Zotefoams’ costs are sterling 
denominated, while approximately 80% of 
sales are outside the UK, mainly invoiced in 
US dollars or euros. The recent relative 
weakness of sterling will, therefore, have a 
positive impact on our Group, although this 
is unlikely to be significant this year, as the 
majority of expected foreign exchange 
exposure during 2016 has been hedged,  
in accordance with our policy, at rates 
prevailing before the recent sterling 
weakness. The price of our major raw 
material, low-density polyethylene, remains 
high but at a similar level to last year’s 
average price.
Outlook
Zotefoams sells globally into a variety of 
industries and we are therefore influenced 
by, and mindful of, worldwide economic 
conditions. Our strategy of organic 
development for materials based on our 
proprietary technology offers higher growth 
potential, but is accompanied by timelines 
which can be difficult to predict as we enter 
new applications or markets. We believe 
certain of our longer term developments are 
now reaching the point where market 
success is much more likely and we plan to 
further increase resources to support these 
opportunities. While being mindful of market 
and macro-economic conditions, the Board 
anticipates 2016 being another year of 
growth and remains confident about the 
long-term prospects for our business.

CHANGES AHEAD
“It was clear when I joined Zotefoams 
late in 2014 that the Group had an 
exciting range of growth opportunities 
and was transitioning into a multi-site, 
multi-product, international company. 
The Group benefits from unique 
technologies, positioned to take 
advantage of global environmental and 
regulatory trends, has a product range 
with persuasive value propositions for 
our current and target customers, and 
strong barriers to entry, giving it an 
excellent platform for future growth.
After 18 months on the Board I am 
delighted to become Chairman, 
succeeding Nigel Howard, who has 
done a tremendous job in helping 
create an organisation with solid 
foundations and entrepreneurial flair. 
The key challenge ahead for the 
business is to deliver the full value from 
its portfolio of growth projects. To 
accomplish this and to successfully 
execute our strategy, we need to invest 
in talent and build organisational 
capability to complete our transition 
and become a materially larger, fast 
growing, truly international technology-
driven Group. I am excited by this 
challenge and am looking forward to 
working with my fellow Board members 
and the management team to help 
deliver this for all of our stakeholders.”

Supply chain
Loss or failure of a major customer or end user would lower sales 
and might increase costs in the short term as our supply chain 
re-balanced.
Supply chain failure, particularly in raw materials or engineering 
parts, may compromise our ability to meet sales commitments  
or opportunities, losing margin in our business.

Annual Report 2015
Business overview
Zotefoams is a diversified value-added 
plastics processor, utilising unique cellular 
materials technology in a variety of markets 
globally. Zotefoams manufactures block 
foams using high-pressure nitrogen gas 
technology, licenses intellectual property 
(‘IP’), sells related machinery and also 
processes foams for specific markets.  
The block foams business units compete 
primarily through the superior foam 
properties created by our technology, 
offering reduced environmental impact and 
a better safety and technical performance. 
This business has significant barriers to 
entry, including capital cost, know-how,  
user specifications and, in our HPP 
business, patents. Zotefoams’ block foams 
are sold, and often specified, under the 
AZOTE
®
 and ZOTEK
®
 brand names, which 
are well known in the industries we serve: 
automotive, aerospace, packaging, industrial 
parts, marine, building and construction, 
military and sports and leisure. Zotefoams 
also sells T-FIT
®
 (replacing the T-TUBES
®
 
brand) technical insulation, manufactured 
from ZOTEK
®
 foams, for pharmaceutical, 
semiconductor and biotech facilities. MuCell 
Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’) licenses a patented 
process that creates ‘micro-bubbles’ in the 
core of plastic parts or products by injecting 
gas into them as they are manufactured. 
This produces a foamed core, bound by  
a solid skin into one integral material that 
seems indistinguishable from a solid 
product. Products using MEL technology 
can be designed to perform like solid plastic, 
but will typically use 15-20% less material, 
realising both cost and environmental 
benefits, by using inert carbon dioxide or 
nitrogen gas and reducing plastic content  
at source. MEL shares in the customers’ 
benefits by receiving a licence fee for IP  
and/or royalty on parts made.

Results
Zotefoams manages and reports its business 
in three main business units defined by 
product type: Polyolefin foams, HPP foams 
and MEL. Total Revenue increased by 11% to 
£54.44m (2014: £49.08m), with growth in all 
three segments and in all major geographies. 
Gross profit increased by 17% to £15.00m 
(2014: £12.84m excluding exceptional items) 
and our gross margin improved to 27.6% 
Our AZOTE
®
 business unit operates 
regionally across Europe, North America 
and Asia, while HPP and MEL are global 
operations. As our business develops we 
are creating new opportunities, such as our 
joint venture in China and, in 2016, the 
formation of Zotefoams Midwest LLC in 
Oklahoma, USA, which are extending our 
traditional business and moving us closer to 
key customers. These initiatives, operational 
in 2016, along with our major investment in 
capacity in Kentucky, USA, which is now 
expected to begin production in the first half 
of 2017, required significant investment in 
time and expertise from our senior 
management team over the past year. We 
see these initiatives as the start of a period 
of transformational organic growth of our 
business using our unique technologies, 
while building on our IT systems, operational 
capability and continued investment  
in people.

of 12 months of the year. Inventory levels  
of customers increased during the first part 
of the year, generating an overall demand  
in the market for our products in excess of 
normal supply, but declined later in the year, 
leading to a more stable demand situation. 
Zotefoams’ investment in manufacturing 
systems, efficiency and de-bottlenecking of 
capacity continued throughout the year and 
further capacity improvements are expected 
to be delivered from existing autoclaves as 
improvements in support services come  
on line in the first half of 2016. Input costs 
began the year at slightly lower levels than  
in 2014, however, by the end of the first 
quarter, the average euro price of our main 
raw material, Low Density Polyethylene 
(‘LDPE’), began to trend upward. While the 
price of crude oil, the source raw material for 
LDPE, has reduced significantly over the 
past 18 months, the price for LDPE has 
remained at a similar level for the past three 
years. The overall price for LDPE in the year 
was similar to 2014, but with the second six 
months of 2015 approximately 10% higher 
than the first six months.
Zotefoams’ AZOTE

 polyolefin foams are 
manufactured using our unique, high-
pressure, nitrogen gas process. Sheets  
of extruded plastic, in this case mainly 
low-density polyethylene and ethylene-vinyl 
acetate co-polymers, are processed through 
large pressure vessels known as autoclaves 
at temperatures up to 250 degrees 
Centigrade and pressure up to 670 bar, 
before being expanded into sheets of foam 
in a lower-pressure autoclave. The autoclave 
process allows foams to be as light as 
98.5% air by volume and lowers polymer 
usage for improved environmental impact. 
Our foams are consistent, closed cell (giving 
cushioning, very low water absorption and 
buoyancy), good insulators and can be 
processed in many different ways for a 
variety of end applications. Demand overall 
is driven by three main market trends: better 
use of resources, safety improvements and 
other performance benefits.
Total Revenue in Polyolefin foams increased 
by 8% to £43.61m (2014: £40.44m). Sales 
volumes increased by 10%, while foreign 
exchange rates were, in aggregate, 3% 
adverse, as a weaker euro was only partially 
offset by a stronger US dollar. The segment 
profit was £7.55m (2014: £5.99m), after the 
amortisation of acquired intangible items.
In the UK and Continental Europe, which 
accounts for 69% (2014: 72%) of AZOTE
®
 
polyolefin foams’ Total Revenue, sales 
volumes increased by 11%, while North 
America volumes grew by 2%. In Asia, 
where we operate a sales joint venture, sales 
volumes increased by 27% following a small 
decline the previous year. We see all areas 
offering scope for further sales growth in  
line with our stated objective of growing 
Polyolefin foams sales at twice the rate  
of global GDP. To support this global 
opportunity, we need to invest in capacity 
and our approach to this is described in 
more detail in the “investment” section of  
the report.
In 2015 we began the year very strongly, 
with an order book that was partly a result  
of delayed European shipments from late in

MuCell partners with Dow  
on innovative microfoaming 
technology 
In an exclusive collaboration, MuCell 
Extrusion LLC partnered with Dow to 
launch an innovative microfoaming 
technology for the packaging industry in 
Latin America.
Dow is working with MuCell and mutual 
customers in Latin America to produce 
foamed films that replace solid films. 
Foaming films is an excellent route to more 
sustainable packaging by allowing the 
production of more units with the same 
amount of raw material, thus resulting in 
lower carbon emissions.
Some of the key benefits of the 
microfoaming technology include:
• Improved packaging performance such 
as superior sealing integrity and abuse 
resistance.
• Differentiated optical properties that 
deliver characteristics of premium 
packaging.
• A superior environment profile 
compared to traditional packaging.
Dow has played an instrumental role in 
helping MuCell develop five new foamed 
film customers in Latin America over the 
past year with substantial potential for the 
reduction of carbon emissions.

products use the same proprietary autoclave 
technology as our AZOTE

 polyolefin foams 
but are manufactured from PVDF 
fluoropolymer, nylon or PEBA, generating  
a uniqueness based on the combination  
of the original polymer attributes and our 
foaming process. ZOTEK

 N nylon foams are  
tough and can operate in very high 
temperature environments, while ZOTEK

PEBA foams have excellent kinetic energy 
management properties. All of these foams 
are light weight, moisture resistant and  
good insulators.
HPP sales increased by 25% in the year to 
£8.27m (2014: £6.61m) and now represent 
15% of Group Revenue. Within HPP the 
largest market is aviation, where growth is 
expected as a result of new applications 
(increased content per aeroplane) and an 
increase in the build rate of aeroplanes. 
Typical aviation applications are in window 
gaskets, air ducts, high-end seats, seals and 
gaskets. Following a strong performance in 
2014, in which we delivered a near doubling 
of revenue from T-FIT
®
 insulation products, 
2015 sales from T-FIT

 increased by 2%, 
which was below our expectations. This was 
due mainly to the timing of projects in the 
major application of cleanrooms insulation 
for pharmaceutical, biotech and 
semiconductor manufacture in China,  
India and the rest of Asia. 
I am pleased to report that indications  
are positive for future growth in T-FIT

offset by a planned higher investment of 
resource in sales, development and supply 
chain surety to support future opportunities. 
With these additional resources we have 
also made considerable progress in other

MEL ’s business model is to develop and 
license IP and share in the savings or 
benefits of the licensee through a royalty 
and/or licence fee. The MuCell
®
 extrusion 
technology is delivered through a gas 
injection system, which is sold to customers, 
often with other associated equipment and 
engineering support, to retrofit their existing 
extruders. Following product development 
and end-user validation the customers will 
manufacture their products using our 
technology and pay us licence fees and/or 
royalties. MEL revenue, therefore, comes 
from two main sources: initial set-up 
(engineering and equipment sales) and 
operation (licence fees and/or royalties). 
MEL ’s IP comprises a significant body of 
patents and know-how in gas injection 
methods and apparatus, product 
performance, additives, operating systems, 
die and screw design, etc. The main target 
market for MEL is consumer packaging, 
where production volumes are large and 
developments are scalable across 
geographic and product markets.

 PEBA foam delivers performance 
over a wide temperature range, right down 
to -40ºC. The combination of high energy 
return and low flex fatigue delivers 
performance way beyond traditional 
closed cell foams, and with none of the

Marco Reus commented; 
“ This new boot is a real change to what  
we have been wearing before, it actually 
looks and feels like a totally new product. 
They are so light, you can almost not feel 
them, and still I feel they give me exactly 
that support I need to have from a boot. 
This is a whole new direction of

MEL Total Revenue increased 25% to 
£2.62m (2014: £2.09m), driven by more 
favourable US dollar exchange rates and a 
47% increase in Equipment and Engineering 
sales, from £1.16m to £1.70m, as licensees 
convert their extrusion lines to use our 
technology. Licence and Royalty payments 
were at a similar level to the previous year, 
with underlying growth distorted by a 
one-off limited exclusivity licence fee in 2014. 
MEL is still an early stage growth business 
and our key performance measures include 
increasing the installed base at customers 
and further developing our licensable 
technology. Over the past 18 months we 
have delivered significant improvements in 
capital efficiency of line conversions from 
transfer mixer technology and the proven 
use of satellite units. Transfer mixers 
minimise operational downtime and cost 
when converting an extruder to MuCell
®
 
technology, while satellite units allow more 
than one extruder to be run from a MuCell 
extrusion gas system at a minimal marginal 
cost. Improved conversion costs for 
customers are one reason why equipment 
revenues grew by 47% compared to 2014, 
representing 36 units (2014: 20 units), while 
the total installed base at customers is now 
88 units (2014: 52 units), an increase of 69%. 
Approximately half of these units are now in 
operational use at customers and are 
generating revenue, while we anticipate that 
the majority of the remaining units will be 
commissioned for commercial use within 
6-12 months. Following sale, commissioning 
and commercial ramp up, the value 
delivered from our strategy of increasing the 
installed base will be delivered over the life  
of our commercial contracts, which are 
typically 10-12 years.
Further development of IP remains a core 
activity for the MEL business unit and, 
pleasingly during 2015, improvements in 
processing certain polymers, additive 
technology as well as machinery 
modifications were developed and  
are factors which will contribute to our  
future success.
The MEL segment result was a loss (after 
amortisation costs associated with acquired 
intangible assets) of £0.80m (2014: loss of 
£0.41m), reflecting the increased investment 
made in people and IP development in MEL. 
Before amortisation costs on acquired 
intangible assets, the loss was £0.50m 
(2014: loss of £0.10m).

Investment
Zotefoams’ core autoclave technology is 
used in both our AZOTE
®
 and ZOTEK
®
 block 
foam manufacture. The overall need to 
increase capacity is currently driven by our 
demand expectations for AZOTE
®
 polyolefin 
foams, which account for over 95% of 
production volumes. Wherever possible,  
we seek capacity enhancements through 
measures such as improving efficiency, 
investing in services to increase cycle times, 
planning improvements etc. However, in 
2014, we decided that the timing was right 
to begin the next phase of investment in a 
new high-pressure autoclave and to site this 
vessel in our facility in Kentucky, USA. 
Zotefoams Inc, in Kentucky, has operated 
low-pressure autoclave technology, for the 
final expansion of intermediate material, 
since 2001 and demand from the North 
American market will fill a new vessel 
capacity almost immediately, releasing 
capacity from the UK to service demand 
elsewhere. The investment programme was 
originally scheduled to commission in the 
second half of 2016, but will now more likely 
be the first half of 2017, due to a quality 
problems identified by the autoclave supplier 
requiring them to reschedule delivery of  
the vessel. The other components of the 
programme are running to schedule: a 
building extension, extrusion capability 
including feed systems, extruders and 
ovens, plant services including heating 
nitrogen gas to over 250 degrees Centigrade 
and systems to pressurise an autoclave with 
this superheated gas at pressures more 
than 300 times the pressure of a standard 
car tyre, not to mention sourcing appropriate 
raw materials, implementing an IT system 
and hiring and training a technically 
competent workforce. With this delay we 
have examined the need for capacity and 
expect the improvements made in Croydon 
during 2015, including some additional items 
to be brought on line during 2016, to be 
sufficient to meet our demand needs until 
mid-2017. At our Croydon site we are 
planning further investment in low-pressure 
autoclaves and extrusion, specifically 
designed for ZOTEK
®
 foams, as well as 
commissioning additional laboratory space 
for our technical and quality departments.
In Asia, our joint venture with King Lai Group 
is scheduled to begin production in the first 
half of 2016 and will initially make product  
for cleanroom insulation, where the largest 
market opportunities are China and India. 
The investment needed is relatively modest, 
with machines to heat and mould our 
ZOTEK
®
 foams to the specific shapes 
needed. In addition to manufacturing we  
will expand our sales team dedicated to the 
T-FIT
®
 advanced insulation products and, 
with the benefit of local manufacture and 
supply, expect this business to show strong 
growth over the coming years. In AZOTE
®
 
polyolefin foams we currently have a 50:50 
sales joint venture agreement with INOAC 
Corporation in Japan, with the plan to  
begin local manufacturing for the Asian 
market when sales volumes reach an 
appropriate level.
Strategy and objectives
Zotefoams’ strategy is to expand through a 
combination of profitable organic growth of 
our Polyolefin and HPP foams businesses, 
new customers for our MEL technology 
licensing business, and through 
partnerships or acquisitions in related 
technologies, products or markets.
Our stated objectives are:
• Sales growth in our Polyolefin business to 
exceed twice the average rate of global 
GDP growth.
• Develop a HPP portfolio and MEL 
customer base to deliver enhanced 
margins.
• Improve our operating margins.
• Improve our return on capital employed.
Performance against these objectives was 
as follows:
• Sales of Polyolefin foams increased  
by 8%.
• HPP sales grew by 25% and MEL sales 
grew by 25%.
In both business units we continue to invest 
further in resources to deliver growth, with  
a clear understanding of the inherent profit 
potential being higher than the current 
Group operating margins. These business 
units now account for 20% of Total Revenue, 
up from 18% in 2014.
• Group operating margins before 
exceptional items increased to 11.6% 
(2014: 11.4%).
• Pre-tax return on average capital 
employed, excluding acquired intangible 
assets and their amortisation costs, 
decreased to 14.4% (2014: 14.7%). Levels 
of capital employed will continue to 
increase with the strategically significant 
investment in our Kentucky, USA, site, 
planned to commission in 2017. We 
expect the return on capital to reflect this 
until the benefit of this investment can  
be realised.

TALENT
As a unique business, we need unique people 
with specialist skills and knowledge. 
We place a strong emphasis on attracting, nurturing and developing 
talent and in 2015 we added senior roles in HR in the UK and USA 
as well as a Group Talent Manager to support this important 
business focus. We encourage people in all areas of our organisation 
to experience different areas of the business as well as to move up 
to more senior positions. In the UK we offered many progression 
opportunities, filling approx. 50% of our key roles last year internally. 
In the USA we employ 29% more staff than a year ago, attracting  
a dynamic group of highly skilled and knowledgeable people to 
augment our existing team as we invest significantly in production 
capacity in Kentucky. There are specific examples of how people 
have progressed at Zotefoams on our website.
Here at Zotefoams we believe that our 
people deserve investment. We expect  
a lot in terms of energy, effort and ideas, 
and we give a great deal in return. In 2015 
we ran UK business-wide training 
programmes in management skills and 
project management. We also launched 
a share purchase scheme, encouraging 
engagement and retention and enabling 
our hard-working people to share in the

DIVERSITY
At Zotefoams, we recognise that ensuring equality 
and diversity within the workforce are essential for 
attracting and retaining high calibre employees.
We see the diversity of our staff as one of our key strengths, with  
the range of knowledge, skills and experience our employees bring 
to their work.
Respecting and valuing the diversity of our staff contributes to our 
working environment and helps foster an inclusive place to work.  
It also improves communication and understanding both internally 
and with external stakeholders and makes us a stronger organisation.
 
Almost 30 different nationalities are represented among Zotefoams’ 
staff. A typical employee has between 15-20 years of service and 
the average age is around 47 years.
1. While approximately 80% of our business is currently 
outside the UK, only 18% of employees are based 
outside the UK. Our hiring diversity balances this 
local concentration of employees by employing staff 
of almost 30 different nationalities.
2. As Zotefoams’ business changes our staff needs change. As well as filling almost 50% of UK-based vacancies with 
internal candidates we have hired 1/3rd of our current employees within the past two years. Training and 
development of new employees and role transfers is critical to our talent management for the future.
3. Zotefoams has a good balance of length of service within our business, blending experience with fresher external perspectives. Traditionally Zotefoams has employed mainly 
men, with factory and engineering positions having the highest proportion of male staff. Recently a higher proportion of our new recruits are female, with the changing nature of 
our business being reflected in a change in Zotefoams’ gender balance.

Annual Report 2015
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
Income statement
Total Revenue for the year increased by 11% 
to £54.44m (2014: £49.08m). Total Revenue 
consolidates all external sales made by 
Zotefoams and its subsidiaries as well as 
those from its joint ventures and therefore 
shows like-for-like sales growth. Group 
Revenue, being the statutory reported 
measure, excludes the mark-up on sales 
made by the Azote Asia Limited joint venture 
with INOAC. Group Revenue increased by 
10% to £53.87m (2014: £48.95m), with 
growth in all three business units and in  
all major geographies.
Gross margins increased 1.4% to 27.6% 
(2014 before exceptional item: 26.2%),  
with the operational gearing benefit of the 
higher sales.
In 2014 the Group recorded an impairment 
charge of £1.27m related to manufacturing 
curtailment of the microZOTE
®
 extrusion line, 
which was treated as an exceptional item.
Distribution and administrative expenses of 
£8.68m (2014: £7.27m) reflect the Group’s 
investment to support future growth 
expectations and its increasing globalisation, 
albeit with a continued emphasis on tight 
cost discipline. These expenses have been 
reduced by a £0.21m net gain from foreign 
exchange hedging contracts and foreign 
exchange translation (2014: net gain of 
£0.31m). 
The business unit results are shown in  
the Strategic Report. They do not include 
central  plc costs, as they are not 
considered to be business unit specific.  
In 2015 central plc costs were £1.46m  
(2014: £1.34m).
Profit before tax increased 14% to £6.01m 
(2014 before exceptional item: £5.27m). 
The effective tax charge is 20.2% (2014: 
16.8%), which is in line with the UK 
corporation tax rate for the year of 20.3%. 
2014 benefited from a favourable prior year 
adjustment, without which the effective tax 
charge was 20.6%. 21

Exchange rates
Zotefoams transacts significantly in euros 
and US dollars. The exchange rates used to 
translate the key flows and balances were:
2015 2014
Euro – average 1.38 1.25
Euro – year-end spot 1.36 1.29
USD – average 1.53 1.65
USD – year-end spot 1.48 1.56
Earnings per share and dividend
Group basic earnings per share were 11.1p 
(2014 pre-exceptional item 10.7p, post 
exceptional item 8.2p). The Directors are 
recommending a 0.1p increase in the final 
dividend to 3.8p per share which, subject to 
shareholder approval, would be payable on 
25 May 2016 to shareholders on the 
Company register at the close of business 
on 22 April 2016. This would bring the total 
dividend for the year to 5.60p per ordinary 
share (2014: 5.45p).
Cash flow and funding
Cash generated from operations was 
£8.41m (2014: £5.98m), mainly due to the 
improvement in profitability for the year and 
increased working capital efficiency.
Capital expenditure increased to £9.11m 
(2014: £7.57m), reflecting continuation of the 
Group’s capacity expansion of the Kentucky, 
USA site, investment in its factory extension 
in Croydon and other capital programmes in 
the UK relating to capacity improvements, 
efficiency initiatives and operational and 
safety-related investment.
The costs of the Kentucky investment  
were part funded in September 2014 via  
a successful placing of 9.99% of the issued 
share capital for £8.45m net. In December 
2015 Zotefoams Inc signed a 10-year $8m 
fixed rate secured loan which, together with 
the 2014 equity raising and expected 
operational cash flows, secures funding for 
the capital programme.
After tax and dividend payments, the Group 
had net debt of £1.59m (2014: net funds 
£2.42m) at 31 December 2015. This net debt 
at the end of the year consists of £5.27m 
cash and bank overdrafts less £6.86m 
secured borrowings. At 31 December 2015 
the Group had a £4.90m overdraft facility. 
In March 2016 Zotefoams refinanced its 
existing bank facilities, signing a four-year 
£8m multi-currency revolving credit facility 
with a further £2m overdraft facility. This 
bank facility replaces the £4.9m overdraft 
facility previously in operation and provides 
the Group with a solid foundation for its 
stated growth strategy.
Pensions
The gross IAS19 deficit on the Company’s 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme (the 
‘Scheme’) reduced by £0.89m to £5.24m  
as at December 2015 (2014: £6.13m). This  
is primarily due to a higher discount rate 
following rises in corporate bond yields over 
the year and contributions paid by the 
Company towards reducing the deficit.
The Company has agreed, under the last 
triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme  
as at 5 April 2014, to make annual payments 
of £0.50m over the period to 5 April 2020 to 
eliminate a funding shortfall of £2.5m. It has 
also agreed to pay £0.16m per annum to 
cover administration expenses and 
premiums for death in service benefits.
The Company closed the Scheme to new 
members in October 2001 and ceased the 
future accrual of benefit for existing 
members at the end of 2005.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are 
set out in the Group CEO’s Review on pages 
10 to 17 and the section entitled ‘Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties’ on pages 22 to 25. 
This also describes the financial position of 
the Company, its cash flows and liquidity 
position. In addition, note 21 to the financial 
statements includes the Company’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk 
management objectives, details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities, 
borrowing facilities, and its exposure to 
credit risk and liquidity risk. As a 
consequence of the above the Directors 
believe that the Company is well placed to 
manage its business risks and, after making 
enquiries including a review of forecasts, 
budgets and banking facilities, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. Therefore they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
revised UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Directors have assessed the prospect  
of the Company over a three-year period. 
Each year the Directors consider the viability 
of the business over a one-year period as 
part of its budgeting process and over a 
three-year period as part of its review of 
business strategy. The one-year budgeting 
period considers certain existing and 
potential business issues with a greater  
level of certainty while the three-year period 
addresses a wider variety of strategic 
options against a background of less 
certainty. On the basis of this and other 
matters considered and reviewed by the 
Board during the year, the Board has a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period it has used for the 
assessment. In doing so it should be 
recognised that such future assessments 
are subject to a level of uncertainty which 
increases with time so that future outcomes 
cannot be guaranteed or predicted with 
certainty. This assessment was made 
recognising in particular that the ‘Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties’ noted on pages 22 
to 25 of the report could have an impact on 
the future performance of the Company.
Financial risk management
The main financial risks of the Group relate 
to funding and liquidity, credit, interest rate 
fluctuations and currency exposures. The 
management of these risks are documented 
on note 21.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board of Directors believes that the Principal Risks and Uncertainties that the Group currently faces are as stated below. Regular risk 
reviews are undertaken to ensure that the major risks in the business, that could affect the Group’s operations and financial performance, 
have been identified and that, where possible, mitigating actions and controls are put in place.
Significant risks are reviewed by the Board and the Audit Committee. It is not possible to identify every risk that could affect the Group’s 
business, and the mitigating actions and controls that have been put in place may not provide absolute assurance that the risk will neither 
occur nor materially affect the Group’s operations or financial performance.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk and potential impact Description Mitigation actions
Risk trend
OPERATIONAL
As the Group’s operations are currently mainly on one site, a significant operational disruption 
or Safety, Health and Environmental (‘SHE’) incident could impact the ability to manufacture 
and supply products, which could have reputational issues and, in certain defined 
circumstances, have contractual commercial consequences which may result in  
customer claims.
The Group has extensive SHE policies and procedures in place, which are in line with best practice. In the UK the Company 
is certified to accredited standards OHSAS 18001 on Health and Safety and ISO 14001, the International Standard for 
Environment Management Systems.
Regular training is provided on SHE matters to the staff.
Pressure equipment used is operated under the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 and is subject to systematic 
internal and frequent external inspections in accordance with the Safety Assessment Federation.
The Group has extensive fire prevention systems in place and also has appropriate contingency plans in place in the event 
of the failure of certain major pieces of equipment.
Reporting of incidents, including ‘near misses’ and damage to plant or equipment not resulting in personal injury,  
is mandatory in order to track issues and to prevent reoccurrences.
Insurance is in place to cover capital restatement and loss of profits in the event of operational disruption caused by  
certain events.
The Group is investing in its Kentucky, USA, site which, when completed, will give multi-site capability, subject to capacity, 
on many polyolefin products.
OPERATIONAL
The Group is extending its operations in Kentucky to cover the full block foam manufacturing 
process stages. This is a significant capital project, which is reliant on some specialist 
suppliers, and needs to be managed to time and budget.
The extension of our facilities in Kentucky will replicate, where appropriate, machinery and processes already in operation in 
the UK. Existing managerial and engineering support in North America will be supplemented by external project expertise 
and resource from the Group’s Croydon operations. Alternative suppliers were considered. Raw materials will be trialled in 
the UK first to reduce the commissioning risk.
SUPPLY CHAIN
Certain of the Group’s raw materials and engineering components are sourced from single 
suppliers. Disruption in those supplies, either on a temporary or more permanent basis, could 
affect production and supply to the Group’s customers and in certain defined circumstances 
have contractual commercial consequences which may result in customer claims.
Wherever possible, supplies are sourced from more than one supplier or location. However, this is not always possible,  
due to the special nature of the raw materials and machines used.
TECHNOLOGY
The Group’s processes for the manufacture of its products are substantially unique to the 
Group. Whilst the principles behind the processes are not confidential, the precise know-how 
is. A competitor could match or improve upon the properties and economics of the Group’s 
products. Key to the success of the business of MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’) is the strength  
of its intellectual property and, on the back of that, its ability to grant commercial licences. The 
risks to MEL are that its intellectual property becomes dated or its patents expire or are 
successfully challenged.
There are high barriers of entry to the market. Significant capital investment is required for the autoclaves and  
related infrastructure.
The Group actively maintains its intellectual property. It patents its technology wherever it believes it is appropriate to do so. 
Where technology is not subject to patent, patents are no longer applicable or the technology is incapable of being patented, 
the Group guards its know-how.
The Group reduces its technology risk by entering into new markets. For example, the development of High-Performance 
Products (‘HPP’) and MEL, where the product offerings are unique and protected by patents and/or process know-how and 
capability, opens up new markets for the Group with potential significant and lasting differential advantages.
MEL actively maintains and updates its intellectual property portfolio. This is done by undertaking research and development 
to add new patents to the portfolio, further developing its know-how and obtaining licences of key third-party patents, which 
are complementary to the existing portfolio.
MEL licences typically include a bundle of patents and know-how and therefore are not completely dependent on any 
particular patent. 23

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Risk and potential impact Description Mitigation actions
Risk trend
PENSION
The Company has a Defined Benefit Pension Scheme (‘Scheme’) and any inability of the 
Scheme to meet its liabilities to its members could, ultimately, be the responsibility of  
the Company.
To minimise the risk to the Company of meeting the obligations under the Scheme, the Company closed the Scheme to 
new members in 2001 and closed it to future accrual of benefits in 2005. The Company is currently working together with 
the Trustees to undertake de-risking activities to the Scheme.
The Company has concluded discussions with the Trustees of the Scheme on the triennial actuarial valuation of the 
Scheme as at 5 April 2014, and the associated recovery plan for the Scheme. The Company has agreed to make a 
contribution to the Scheme of £41k per month until April 2020 to reduce the deficit.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The Group’s operations are substantially based in the UK and, therefore, most of its 
manufacturing assets and costs are sterling denominated. 
The Group has significant exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. This is both transactional 
and on the translation of foreign currency balances and the consolidation of its foreign 
subsidiaries.
The Group’s customers are normally invoiced in their local currencies. In 2015, approximately 
80% of the Group’s revenue was in currencies other than sterling. The Group, therefore, 
generates surpluses in US dollars and euros, which are converted into sterling.
The Group reduces its foreign exposure for transactional items by making purchases either in euros or US dollars where 
possible. For example, there are US dollar costs associated with the Group’s operations in Kentucky, USA and with MEL.  
In addition, the majority of the Group’s raw materials are purchased in euros.
The Group is currently undertaking a circa $22m capital investment in North America which will reduce exposure for 
transactional items on the US dollar significantly.
The Group has a hedging policy, which is approved by the Board. The Group hedges a proportion of its exposure for 
transactional items to foreign exchange by using forward exchange contracts. The Company, like most public companies, 
does not hedge for the translation of its foreign subsidiaries’ assets or liabilities in the consolidation of its Group accounts.
MACRO ECONOMICS
Most of our markets are exposed to general economic conditions. The Group is operationally 
geared and a fall in demand for its products could adversely impact the Group.
Some of the Group’s markets can be cyclical. However, this risk is spread geographically and across a number of segments 
which are expected to diversify further with the growth of HPP, MEL and the joint ventures. The Group’s experience is that 
in these circumstances operational labour costs can be reduced, polymer prices generally fall with reduced economic 
demand giving a cost benefit and cash can be generated from reducing working capital and slowing capital expenditure 
projects to help offset the effects of a downturn. The Group targets a low financial gearing to give it operational flexibility  
in a downturn.
FINANCING
The Group needs to have sufficient cash, or be able to draw on loan facilities, to finance its 
operations and growth.
The Group has strong cash generation from its operations.
The Group:
• has at 31.12.15 a $8m loan and £1.5m of a £3.5m loan outstanding; and
• from 1 March 2016 a £8m multi-currency revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) and a £2m overdraft facility.
The loans and RCF facility are secured against certain Group assets and are subject to covenants as described in note 21 
and 27 of the Annual Report.
When considering investment projects the Group has regard to its ability to raise finance for the project and will not commit 
to a project until acceptable and appropriate finance is in place, or believed to be available.
COMMERCIAL
Loss, poor performance or insolvency of a major customer or joint-venture partner. The Group’s largest customers are distributors and converters of foam. The Group has good knowledge of the end-
customers of its major customers and, with some additional short-term work, would be able to bring or identify additional 
converter capacity to service these markets.
The risks associated with implementation of joint ventures in Asia have been mitigated by partnering with the JVs’  
major customers.
The joint venture agreements contain clauses to address performance and insolvency issues.
PEOPLE
The failure to attract, develop or retain the right calibre of staff to deliver growing opportunities 
by product and geographic reach.
The Group keeps under review its skill needs and labour requirements. The Group aims to provide its employees with varied 
and interesting work and to incentivise them appropriately.
The Group has appointed a Global Talent Manager, whose remit is to ensure senior and emerging talent is appropriate for 
the Group’s current and future needs. 25

Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
Zotefoams considers that the management of safety, health, 
environmental, social and ethical matters forms a key element of 
effective corporate governance. These areas are covered by the 
internal control systems and procedures outlined in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 34 to 37.
Safety, Health and Environment (‘SHE’)
The Board has in place separate policies relating to Safety, Health 
and Environment. The Group is certified to accredited standards 
OHSAS 18001 on Health and Safety and ISO 14001, the 
International Standard for Environmental Management Systems,  
and is regularly audited by those bodies to ensure that the Group 
complies with those standards.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for SHE policy and 
performance and receives quarterly reports on SHE issues. Annual 
performance objectives are agreed by the Board and performance 
against these objectives is monitored as part of its quarterly 
reporting programme.
The Group CEO is directly responsible to the Board for Safety, 
Health and Environmental performance. Site Committees on SHE 
normally meet once a quarter to consider all SHE matters and are 
overseen by Steering Committees, chaired by the Group CEO (or 
appropriate responsible person in subsidiary companies). The 
Steering Committees consider overall performance and the impact 
of current and impending legislation.
On joining the Group, all employees receive training on SHE matters, 
including the Group’s policies, and refresher training is provided, as 
appropriate, to ensure that the employees understand SHE matters. 
All employees are made aware that everyone has a part to play to 
ensure the safety of themselves and their colleagues at work. 
Employees are encouraged to report to their managers any unsafe, 
or potentially unsafe, conditions. Senior managers are responsible 
for ensuring that SHE policies are implemented in their areas, that 
their teams are informed of the departmental SHE requirements and 
that the employees receive training on environmental issues and 
safe working practices and understand them. Regular audits are 
conducted to ensure policy and procedure implementation  
is appropriate.
The Group takes the reporting of all SHE incidents very seriously 
and requires the employees to report all incidents, including any 
‘near misses’ as well as damage to plant or equipment which has 
not resulted in personal injury. The Group considers the reporting of 
‘near misses’ to be as equally important as actual incidents, since it 
raises situations to management that in other circumstances might 
have caused harm and, therefore, appropriate action can be taken 
to minimise the risk of reoccurrence. The Group also ensures that 
appropriate safety practices are included in standard operating 
procedures to reduce the risk of SHE incidents occurring.
All SHE events are investigated by appropriate levels of management 
to ascertain the root cause of the event and, wherever possible, 
working practices and procedures are improved to minimise the  
risk of reoccurrence. In 2015, there were no prosecutions, fines or 
enforcement actions taken as a result of non-compliance with safety, 
health or environmental legislation (2014: none).
Health and safety performance
Few controlled substances are used in the manufacture of our 
foams, but where they are, the Group has established procedures, 
which the relevant employees are trained on, to ensure the storage 
and handling of such substances are safe and in accordance with 
regulatory requirements. The manufacturing process involves 
manual handling and processing of materials. When new or altered 
equipment or materials are introduced, and at regular periods 
thereafter, the risks to the processes are assessed and, wherever 
possible, improvements are made, such as the design of the 
equipment, to reduce or eliminate the risks identified.
The most strictly controlled parts of the Group’s sites are where 
high-pressure gas is used. The high-pressure operating vessels are 
subject to the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 in the UK 
and OSHA in the USA. Tightly defined procedures and operational 
controls are in place to manage the safety of these pressure 
systems. Fail-safe mechanisms known as Pressure Relief Valves  
and bursting discs (which act like fuses in an electrical system)  
are included in the design of the pressure systems, which when 
triggered allow depressurisation of sections of the system preventing 
any further risks. Operation of these fail-safe mechanisms releases 
harmless nitrogen gas into the atmosphere.
In 2015, the whole Group had seven reportable lost time injuries. 
Four of these incidents were sprains or strains whilst manually 
handling items. One incident was an employee being exposed to 
gas. Another incident was minor scalding to an employee’s arm from 
trapped steam being released from an extruder when it was being 
repaired. The final incident was an employee slipping on ice in the 
car park, and sustaining a broken cheek bone. All incidents were 
fully investigated and appropriate corrective actions have been put 
in place.

Environmental performance
The process used by Zotefoams to manufacture foam is one of the 
most environmentally friendly methods to manufacture cross-linked 
polymer foams. Nitrogen gas, which is an inert gas and comprises 
78% of the earth’s atmosphere, is used to expand the foams. The 
common peroxide cross-linking agent, which improves the foam’s 
properties, is completely utilised during the manufacturing process. 
Unlike foam manufactured by the Group’s competitors, no other 
chemical additives are used to expand the Group’s foam products 
and, therefore, the basic foam products have no toxic or volatile 
chemicals (such as solid chemical residues, CFC, HCFC or  
volatile hydrocarbons). 27
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial
In 2015 the Group had 6 internally recorded environmental incidents 
(2014: 8), which were as follows:
Type of Incident 2015 2014
Bursting disc incidents 0 2
Oil and chemical leaks 1 1
Noise complaints 1 1
Equipment failure 1 0
Other 3 4
Total 6 8
In 2015, there were no incidents of release of nitrogen gas into the  
air from a bursting disc (2014: two). While Zotefoams records these 
as environmental incidents, principally on the grounds of loss of 
production and noise, the bursting discs are an essential part of  
the statutory safety regime for the high-pressure equipment and  
are evidence that the safety systems of the plant are functioning  
as intended.
There was one oil leak (2014: one), which was in Kentucky, where 
there was failure of a seal on a thermal oil pump, which resulted  
in approximately 30 US gallons of thermal oil leaking. This was 
contained immediately and had no significant environmental impact.
There was one noise complaint (2014: one). The Croydon site is very 
close to residential areas and, occasionally, the Group will receive 
complaints concerning noise. Such complaints are taken seriously 
and are investigated, and responses given. The Group takes a 
proactive approach with its neighbours and tries to keep them 
informed of situations in advance that might be considered to be  
a disturbance. 
In Croydon, there was one equipment failure (2014: nil) which  
was a bursting disc on the water cooling system of one of the 
compressors, which resulted in a water spill. Modifications have 
been made to the compressors to reduce the likelihood of this 
incident reoccurring.
There were three other incidents (2014: four), all of which were dealt 
with in accordance with regulations.
The majority of the waste produced by Zotefoams in the UK is either 
solid or foamed polyolefin. Due to the essential cross-linking step 
used on the polymers to manufacture the foams, recycling by being 
melt processed (the process used to recycle most plastics) is 
complicated and not economically viable.
In 2015, the Group commenced an Operations Excellence 
Programme focussed on reducing raw material waste. Such 
initiatives have included improving the dies used on the extruders, 
reducing the trim on extruded slabs and reviewing the processes 
used to clean the extruders between different production runs. In 
2015, 191 tonnes of waste were sent to landfill from the main site in 
Croydon (2014: 225 tonnes). With production volumes up 10% and 
waste tonnage down 15%, this is an improvment of 25%.
In 2015, water consumption at Croydon increased significantly to 
66,000m³ from 43,000m³ in 2014. The Group has now completed 
installation of sub-meters of the utilities at its Croydon site.  
Electricity sub-meters have been operational throughout 2015  
and gas and water sub-meters were installed in 2015. The data is 
now being collected and analysed and will help identify areas of 
usage and develop strategies to reduce the Group’s energy and 
water consumption.
We measure energy efficiency by taking energy consumption and 
dividing it by the amount of material (in kg) that passes through 
high-pressure vessels. In 2015, our energy efficiency slightly 
improved to 11.45 kwhr/kg (2014: 11.50 kwhr/kg). This improvement 
was partly due to higher volumes being produced in 2015 
(compared to 2014) and, therefore, plant and machinery capacity 
being better utilised.
In October 2009, the Group in the UK entered into a Climate Change 
Levy (‘CCL ’) agreement, which involves meeting specific targets to 
reduce energy consumption. Providing the Group meets the 
requirements of the CCL agreement it receives a rebate on its 
electricity bills and is also exempt from the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Scheme.
In July 2015 the Group had its first assessment under the Energy 
Savings Opportunity Scheme (‘ESOS’), received the report from that 
audit in September 2015 and notified the Environmental Agency of 
its compliance with ESOS. The report has been reviewed and in 
conjunction with the data from the sub-metering of utilities, the 
Group is currently determining the projects it will embark upon in 
2016 to improve energy and water consumption.

Energy efficiency has been very much on the agenda at the Group’s 
facility in Walton, Kentucky, USA. The investment in the full process 
there includes the implementation of energy efficient LED lighting 
systems with occupancy sensors in both office and production 
areas. In addition, process cooling systems will utilise external low 
energy air coolers during the winter months (where outside 
temperature can drop to -20°C) and the cooling system for the  
new high-pressure autoclave will exploit the cooling effect of liquid 
nitrogen vaporisation. These initiatives are expected to reduce 
energy consumption by some 317,000kW annually compared  
to using more traditional technologies. 28

Carbon emissions
The Group’s total carbon emissions for all its operations globally 
were 18,576 metric tonnes for the year ended 31 December 2015 
(2014: 17,482 metric tonnes). The breakdown of these figures is  
as follows:
Description
2015 
Emission 
total  
(tonnes)
2014 
Emission  
total  
(tonnes)
2013 
Emission 
total  
(tonnes)
Emissions arising directly from 
our operations (including fuel 
used in our vehicles) 382 255 204
Indirect emissions – use of 
energy (electricity and gas) 18,194 17,227 16,848
Total 18,576 17,482 17,052
Carbon emissions (kg) per 
material gassed (kg) 2.4 2.4 2.6
Our principal carbon emissions have been from our energy usage in 
manufacturing our foam products in both Croydon and Kentucky, 
USA. The carbon emissions from MuCell Extrusion LLC are minimal.
The methodology that we have used has been in accordance with 
the guidance published by the Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs in June 2013. We have only included emissions that 
we are directly responsible for. We have not included emissions for 
activities that we have no direct control over. For example, we have 
included business mileage on company vehicles, but not other forms 
of business travel, such as travel made by employees in their own 
cars or using public transport or aeroplanes.
Whilst there has been an increase in our total carbon emissions  
for 2015 compared to 2014, this is due to the increase in material 
produced. Our actual emissions per material gassed (kg) in our 
high-pressure vessels have remained the same compared to 2014. 
We use this metric as it covers all the material that we produce, 
including any material that might be scrapped. We use a similar 
metric for our CCL agreement.
Equality and diversity
The Group’s people are a key part of the success of the business. 
The Group operates an equal opportunities policy and we believe 
diversity (ethnicity, age, gender, language, sexual orientation, gender 
re-orientation, religion, socio-economic status, personality and 
ability) of the employees promotes a better working environment 
which in turn leads to innovation and business success. Applications 
for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered 
and, in the event of an employee becoming disabled, every effort is 
made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and 
that appropriate training is provided where necessary. It is the policy 
of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of 
disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of 
other employees.
In November 2015, Zotefoams, Inc. received the annual BAWAC 
Community Rehabilitation Centre Business Award for its efforts in 
providing access to employment opportunities and services for 
people with disabilities. 
BAWAC Inc is a non-profit organisation, based in Northern Kentucky, 
founded in 1973 and whose mission is to maximise the vocational 
potential and quality of life of adults with disabilities or other barriers 
to employment, through the flexible integration of counselling, 
evaluation, life and work skills training, job placement, support 
services and employment in a therapeutic or community based 
remunerative work environment.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had 334 employees (2014: 300) 
and five Non-Executive Directors (2014: five). The breakdown of 
those employees and Non-Executive Directors is as follows:
2015 
Male
2015

Senior Managers 3 0 3 0
Other Employees 268 60 249 46
Total 277 62 257 48
Employee development
During 2015, the Group appointed a Global Talent Manager, who 
reports directly to the Group CEO, and is responsible for talent 
attraction, development and retention throughout the Group. In 
Croydon, the Production Skills Development Department was 
established with a remit to provide training to the production 
employees to broaden their skillset. This initiative is mutually 
beneficial as it gives employees greater variety in their work,  
while giving the Group flexibility in its resource deployment.

Human rights
The Group does not, at present, have a specific policy on human 
rights. However, we have several policies that promote the principles 
of human rights.
In the Group’s ethics policy, we state that we will respect the human 
rights of all our employees, including:
• ensuring our employees have the freedom to join a union, 
associate or bargain collectively without fear of discrimination 
against the exercise of such freedoms;
• not using forced labour or child labour; and
• respecting the rights of privacy of our employees and protecting 
access and use of their personal information.
Supporting our ethics policy, we also have an equal opportunities 
policy and a dignity at work policy, which promote the right of every 
employee to be treated with dignity and respect and not to be 
harassed or bullied on any grounds.
The Group is aware of the requirement under the Modern Slavery 
Act 2015 to publish its first statement on its website, by 30 June 
2017, in relation to the steps it has taken to ensure that slavery and 
human trafficking are not taking place throughout its business or 
supply chain. The Group is currently considering the Home Office 
guidance (published in October 2015) and intends to publish a 
statement during 2016 on the steps it has taken so far.
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
people and continues to keep them informed on matters affecting 
them as employees and on the various factors affecting the 
performance of the Group. This is achieved through formal  
and informal meetings. In the UK, the Group operates a Joint 
Consultative Committee (‘JCC’), which comprises an employee 
representative covering each department. The JCC meets regularly 
and considers a wide range of matters affecting the employees’ 
current and future interests.
Business ethics
The Group is committed to high standards of business conduct  
and seeks to maintain these standards across all of our operations 
throughout the world. Under the Group’s ethics policy, we state that 
we will:
• operate within the law;
• not tolerate any discrimination or harassment;
• not make any political donations;
• not make or receive bribes;
• avoid situations that might give rise to conflicts of interest;
• not enter into any activity that might be considered to be 
anti-competitive;
• aim to be a responsible company within our local communities; 
and
• support and encourage our employees to report, in confidence, 
any suspicions of wrongdoing.
Supporting our ethics policy, we have policies on anti-bribery and 
corruption, anti-fraud, employee share trading and whistleblowing. 
Our policies are included in the employee handbook and employees 
are made aware of them on joining the Group. In 2015, the Group 
acquired a licence for online training on anti-bribery and has rolled 
out the training to relevant employees, such as the sales staff, who 
work in areas that are considered to carry a greater risk of bribery. 30

Annual Report 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors present their Annual Report and audited consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Results and dividends
Profit attributable to shareholders for the year amounted to £4.82m 
(2014: £3.34m). An interim dividend of 1.80p (2014: 1.75p) per share 
was paid on 8 October 2015. The Directors recommend that a final 
dividend of 3.8p (2014: 3.7p) per share be paid on 25 May 2016 to 
shareholders who are on the Company’s register at the close of 
business on 22 April 2016. This makes a total dividend of 5.6p per 
share for the year (2014: 5.45p). For further information on the 
performance of the entity refer to the Strategic Report.
Directors
The appointment, replacement and powers of the Directors are 
governed by the Company’s Articles of Association, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006, prevailing 
legislation and resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) or other general meetings of the Company.
The current Directors named on pages 30 and 31 served throughout 
the year, with the exception of G C McGrath, who was appointed to 
the Board on 1 December 2015. The Company’s Articles of 
Association (the ‘Articles’) give the Directors power to appoint and 
replace Directors. Under the terms of reference of the Nominations 
Committee, any appointment must be recommended by the 
Nominations Committee for approval by the Board of Directors. The 
Articles also require Directors to retire and, if they so wish, submit 
themselves for election at the first AGM following their appointment 
and normally every three years thereafter. As has been the case for 
the last few AGMs, the Board has decided to follow best practice 
and all Directors will stand for annual re-election at this year’s AGM, 
notwithstanding that this specific requirement in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code is for FTSE 350 companies.
D B Stirling, C G Hurst and G C McGrath, the Executive Directors, 
have service contracts which are terminable on 12 months’ written 
notice. All the other Directors have letters of appointment which are 
terminable on six months’ written notice.
The Company has issued Deeds of Indemnity in favour of all of the 
Directors. These Deeds were in force throughout the year ended 
31 December 2015 (with the exception of the Deed that was put in 
place on 1 December 2015 for G C McGrath) and remain in force  
as at the date of this report. These Deeds, as well as the service 
contracts and the Company’s Articles of Association, are available 
for inspection during normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered office and will be available at the AGM and 15 minutes 
before the meeting.
Conflicts of interest
All Directors submit details to the Company Secretary of any new 
situations, or changes to existing ones, which may give rise to an 
actual or potential conflict of interest with those of the Company.  
On an annual basis, the Company Secretary seeks confirmation 
from the Directors of their interests, which are reviewed by the 
Nominations Committee and the Board and, where considered 
appropriate, approved by the Board.
Where an actual, or potential, conflict is approved by the Board, the 
Board will normally authorise the situation on the condition that the 
Director concerned abstains from participating in any discussion or 
decision affected by the conflicted matter. Authorisation of a conflict 
is only given by Directors who are not interested in the matter.
Amendment to the Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by  
a special resolution of the shareholders passed in general meeting.
Corporate Governance
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 34 to 37 should be 
read as forming part of the Directors’ Report.
Employees
To ensure employee welfare, the Group has documented,  
and well publicised, policies on occupational health and safety,  
the environment and training. The Group operates an equal 
opportunities, single status, employment policy, together with  
an open management style. The Company operates to a number  
of recognised industry standards including Quality (ISO 9001), 
Environmental (ISO 14001) and Occupational Health and Safety 
(OHSAS 18001) approvals.
Further details of the Group’s employment policies, including its 
policy regarding the employment of disabled people, are set out  
in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on pages 26 to 29.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 14 March 2016, the Company had received notices of the 
following material interests of 3% or more in the issued ordinary 
share capital:
Ordinary 
share of 5.0p
Percentage 
of issued 
share capital
BlackRock Inc. 6,421,090 14.5%

Nicholas Adrian Beaumont-Dark 1,418,000 3.2%
Directors’ shareholdings are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 52 to 53.
Research and development
The amount spent by the Group on R&D in the year was £839,000 
(2014: £1,128,000). In the opinion of the Directors none of this 
expenditure met the requirements for capitalisation in IAS38  
and it was consequently all expensed in the Consolidated  
Income Statement. 33

Annual Report 2015
Share capital and reserves
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which has no right to 
fixed income. Each share carries the right, on a poll, to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions 
on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both 
governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and 
prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No 
person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share 
capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
At 31 December 2015, the Zotefoams Employees’ Benefit Trust 
(‘EBT’) held 768,911 shares (approximately 1.73% of the issued 
share capital) (2014: 340,611 shares, approximately 0.78% of the 
issued share capital at 31 December 2014) to satisfy share plans  
as described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. In accordance 
with best practice, the voting rights on the shares held in the EBT  
are not exercised and the right to receive dividends has been 
waived. During the year, the EBT released 204,548 shares in respect 
of these share plans and 32,848 shares were bought to satisfy future 
share awards. At the AGM held on 13 May 2015, authority was given 
to the Directors to allot unissued shares in the Company up to a 
maximum amount equivalent to approximately two thirds of the 
issued share capital of the Company. This authority was used on 
30 November 2015, when the Company issued 600,000 ordinary 
shares (1.37% of the issued share capital prior to the share issue)  
to the EBT at par value.
Also at the AGM held on 13 May 2015, a special resolution was 
passed that granted authority to the Directors to allot equity 
securities in the Company for cash, without regard to the 
preemption provisions of the Companies Act 2006. This authority 
was used in relation to the above mentioned share issue to the EBT.
Both of the above mentioned authorities expire at the AGM to be 
held on 18 May 2016 and the Directors seek new authorities for  
a further year.
At the AGM held on 13 May 2015, the Company was given authority 
to purchase up to 4,381,444 of its ordinary shares. This authority will 
expire at the 2016 AGM and, at the date of this Report, had not been 
used. In accordance with normal practice for listed companies, a 
special resolution will be proposed at this year’s AGM to seek a new 
authority to make market purchases up to a maximum of 10% of the 
issued share capital of the Company.
Subsidiaries and branches
Details of the subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures within  
the Group are given in note 13 pages 88 to 89 and note 25 on  
page 103.
Treasury and financial instruments
Information in respect of the Group’s policies on financial risk 
management objectives, including policies for hedging, as well as an 
indication of exposure to financial risk, is given on pages 92 to 97 
and in note 21 to the financial statements.
Pension schemes
The Company closed its Defined Benefit Pension Scheme to future 
accrual of benefit in December 2005. Employees are offered 
membership of one of a number of Defined Contribution Pension 
Schemes.
Disclosure of information to Auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s Auditors are 
unaware, and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought 
to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
Auditors are aware of that information.
Independent auditors
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the 
Company’s Auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the report on Corporate Governance on 
behalf of the Board.
At Zotefoams, we recognise the importance of being a well 
managed business, not only for the interests of our shareholders, 
but for other stakeholders as well. The Board and I are committed  
to the highest standards of corporate governance and regularly 
monitor our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Code is available from the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
(www.frc.org.uk).
Statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’)
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, we are required to state 
whether we have complied with the Code’s provisions. The Board 
confirms that, throughout the financial year ended 31 December 
2015, the Company applied all of the provisions set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code as published in September 2014.
The Board also confirms that the Company has applied the 
principles set out in the Code, including both the main principles  
and the supporting principles, by complying with the Code.  
Further explanation of how the principles and supporting  
principles have been applied is set out below and in the  
Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Audit Committee Report  
and Nominations Committee Report.
Board and Committee composition
In 2015 there have been the following changes to the Board.
Firstly, C G Hurst indicated his wish to retire in 2016. Clifford will step 
down from the Board and leave Zotefoams on 16 May 2016. The 
Board and I would like to thank Clifford for the contribution he has 
made to Zotefoams since he joined in October 2000 and wish him 
well in his retirement. We took the opportunity to review the Finance 
Director role and sought to appoint a candidate with significant 
international experience. We were pleased to appoint G C McGrath 
to the Board on 1 December 2015 and to the role of Finance 
Director on 1 February 2016.
Secondly, following a thorough search and selection process,  
the Board on 30 October 2015, upon the recommendation of the 
Nominations Committee, agreed to appoint S P Good, who was 
appointed to the Board on 1 October 2014, as Chairman Designate 
to become Non-Executive Chairman following my retirement on 
31 March 2016. Upon becoming Chairman, Steve will step down as 
a member of the Audit Committee and will also replace me as the 
Chair of the Nominations Committee.
The Board has also requested R J Clowes to remain on the Board 
as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director for a period not to go 
beyond 30 June 2017, in order to provide continuity in experience 
and knowledge as the membership of the Board transitions in 2016 
and a further independent Non-Executive Director is found. The 
Board is of the opinion that R J Clowes, notwithstanding he will have 
been on the Board for nine years in July 2016, remains independent 
as he demonstrates being independent in his judgement of 
discussions and continues to challenge Management on matters.  
R J Clowes will step down as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
after the AGM on 18 May 2016, but will remain a member of the 
Committee. A C Bromfield will become Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee on 19 May 2016.
AGM
We believe that the AGM is an ideal opportunity for the Shareholders 
to attend and meet both the Executive Directors and the Non-
Executive Directors, see the Croydon site and ask questions that 
they may have. The AGM is scheduled for 18 May 2016 and the 
Board looks forward to meeting you there.
N G Howard
Chairman

The Board and its Committees
The Board’s role is to provide the entrepreneurial leadership of the 
Company within a framework of prudent and effective controls 
which enable risk to be assessed and managed. The Board sets  
the strategic aims of the Company, ensures that the necessary 
resources are in place to achieve the Company’s objectives and 
reviews management performance. The Board’s role is to act as 
representative of the shareholders and other stakeholders and 
focuses on the governance of the Company. Management is 
delegated to the Executive Directors and the senior executive 
management of the Group.
All Directors must take decisions objectively in the interests of  
the Company.
As part of their role as members of a unitary Board, Non-Executive 
Directors constructively challenge and help develop proposals on 
strategy. Non-Executive Directors scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor 
the reporting of performance. They satisfy themselves on the 
integrity of financial information and that financial controls and 
systems of risk management are robust and defensible. They are 
responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration  
of Executive Directors and have a prime role in appointing,  
and where necessary removing, Executive Directors, and in 
succession planning.
The Board has three principal committees which report into it and 
function within defined terms of reference. These are the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations 
Committee. The terms of reference for these Committees are 
available on the Company’s website, www.zotefoams.com, and  
in paper form, on request to the Company Secretary.
The Board has put in place a schedule of matters that are reserved 
for its determination or which need to be reported to the Board. This 
schedule is reviewed regularly and was last updated in May 2015. 35

Chairman and Group CEO
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role and setting its agenda. The 
Chairman is also responsible for ensuring that the Directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information. The Chairman facilitates the 
effective contribution of the Non-Executive Directors in particular 
and ensures constructive relations between Executive and Non-
Executive Directors.
The Board considers that N G Howard, who is to retire on 31 March 
2016, has had sufficient time to devote to his role as being the 
Chairman of the Company. Mr Howard only has one other significant 
commitment, which is being a Non-Executive Director of Alliance 
One International Inc. (listed on the New York Stock Exchange). The 
Board also considers that S P Good, who is to become Chairman  
of the Company on 1 April 2016, will have sufficient time to devote to 
the role. Mr Good has no executive positions, but is a Non-Executive 
Director of three other companies (Elementis plc, Cape plc and 
Anglia Water Services Limited).
The Group CEO is responsible for the running of the Group’s 
business. He is supported by the other Executive Directors and 
senior management team members in the Group.
Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises three Executive Directors, four 
independent Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive 
Chairman. R J Clowes has acted as the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director throughout 2015. After the retirements of  
N G Howard and C G Hurst, the composition of the Board will be 
two Executive Directors, three independent Non-Executive Directors 
and the Non-Executive Chairman.
The Chairman is also Chair of the Nominations Committee and  
a member of the Remuneration Committee. Only the respective 
Committee Chairs and members are entitled to be present at 
meetings of the Remuneration, Audit and Nominations Committees, 
but others may attend at the invitation of the Committees. During the 
year the Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors several 
times without the Executive Directors present and the Non-
Executive Directors met without the Chairman being present.
Appointments to the Board and the Nominations Committee
Appointments to the Board are proposed by the Nominations 
Committee and approved by the Board.
A separate Nominations Committee Report provides details of the 
role and activities of the Committee and its work in relation to 
appointments to the Board.
The Board acknowledges the benefits of diversity, including that  
of gender but, when considering appointments to the Board, 
appointments are made purely on merit and against objective 
criteria. No specific policy or quotas have been set on diversity and 
when search consultants are briefed of the search criteria, they are 
encouraged to cast their search sufficiently broadly to identify the 
best candidates. Care is taken to ensure that appointees, as well as 
the existing Directors, have sufficient time to devote to their roles.
Information and professional development
Each month all Directors receive management reports and briefing 
papers in relation to Board matters. New appointments to the Board 
receive an induction and, if appropriate, training. Training is made 
available in order to fulfil the requirements of being a Director of a 
listed company. The Directors have access to the Company 
Secretary and independent professional advisers, at the Company’s 
expense, if required for the furtherance of their duties.
Board evaluation
A formal review of the performance of the Board and its Committees 
is carried out each year. The review of the Chairman’s performance 
is led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director together 
with the other Non-Executive Directors in consultation with the 
Executive Directors. The other Non-Executive Directors’ 
performance is evaluated by the Chairman in consultation with the 
Executive Directors. The Executive Team’s performance is evaluated 
by the Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the Group CEO 
(except in the case of the Group CEO, when the Group CEO is not 
present in that evaluation). 36
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
The evaluation of the Board takes the form of a questionnaire, 
prepared by the Chairman, and the results are compiled and 
discussed, with actions agreed. Each Committee undertakes its 
own evaluation, led by the relevant Chair. These take the form of  
a discussion reviewing the work undertaken during the year and 
actions agreed. Due to the Company’s size, the Board feels, at this 
stage, it is not appropriate to use the services of an external 
facilitator for its annual evaluation, but will keep the matter  
under review.
The most recent Board evaluation was undertaken at the end of 
2015. The timeliness of issuing some papers to the Board was 
raised as an area for improvement and Management have already 
initiated actions to improve this. The Board also concluded that the 
systems in place on risk management and internal control, and 
hence, the Board’s oversight of them, whilst considered currently fit 
for purpose, needed to be reviewed in order to ensure that they are 
adaptable and scalable as the Group grows. Work is already 
underway in this area.
The Chairman Designate, S P Good, will also be following up with 
the Board members on the comments raised in the evaluation as he 
assumes the Chairmanship of the Board.
All the evaluations were completed satisfactorily.
Re-election
Re-election of Board members is required by the Articles at the first 
AGM following appointment and normally once every three years 
thereafter. However the Code requires all directors of FTSE 350 
companies to stand for annual re-election. Although the Company  
is not within the FTSE 350, the majority of Main Market Listed 
companies have now adopted the practice for all their Directors to 
stand for annual re-election. The Board has decided, as has been 
the case for the last few years, that all of the Directors will stand for 
annual re-election at the 2016 AGM.
Remuneration Committee and executive remuneration
A report on the activities of the Remuneration Committee is 
contained within the Directors’ Remuneration Report, together with 
the principles and details of executive remuneration.
 
Financial reporting
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Audit Committee and Auditors
A separate Audit Committee Report provides details of the role  
and activities of the Committee and its relationship with the  
External Auditors.
Relations with shareholders
The Company is always willing, where practicable, to discuss with  
its shareholders its objectives to promote a mutual understanding. 
Meetings with institutional shareholders are held twice a year 
following the announcements of the Group’s interim and final results. 
Other meetings are held at institutional shareholders’ request. To 
ensure that the Board, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, 
understands the views of the shareholders, the Company’s 
corporate brokers provide summary feedback from the investor 
meetings that they arrange, in particular the meetings held following 
the interim and final results announcements. The Chairman and the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, as well as the other 
Non-Executive Directors, are available to meet institutional 
shareholders if requested.
The Board considers the Annual Report, the AGM and the corporate 
website www.zotefoams.com to be the primary vehicles for 
communication with private investors. The Chairs of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees will normally be present to speak at the 
AGM. The Chairman, being also the Chair of the Nominations 
Committee, will normally be present as well.
Internal control
The Board has applied the Code by establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which 
has been in place from the start of the year to the date of approval of 
this report and which is in accordance with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting. The Board is responsible 
for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
In compliance with the Code, the Board regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control as well as  
how it is reported to the Board. The Board’s monitoring covers all 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management. It is based principally on reviewing reports 
from management to consider whether significant risks are 
identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any 
significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need 
for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a 
specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual Report. This 
assessment considered all the significant aspects of internal control 
arising during the period covered by the report. The assessment 
also included a robust review of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten the Group’s business model, 
future performance, solvency and liquidity. The Audit Committee 
assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the system of internal control and 
the principal risks facing the Group, the Board had not identified nor 
been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined 
to be significant. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary 
actions has not been considered appropriate.
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal controls are  
as follows:
Control environment
The Group has an appropriate organisational structure for planning, 
executing, controlling and monitoring business operations in order to 
achieve Group objectives. Overall business objectives are set by the 
Board and communicated through the organisation. Lines of 
responsibility and delegations of authority are documented.

Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
Risk identification
Group management is responsible for the identification and 
evaluation of key risks applicable to its areas of business. These 
risks are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated  
with a variety of internal or external sources.
Information and communication
Annual budgets are a key part of the planning process and 
performance against plan is actively monitored at Board level, 
supported by quarterly forecasts. Statistics and commentary  
on actual operating performance are made available to all  
Directors monthly.
Through these mechanisms, the performance of the Group is 
continually monitored, risks identified in a timely manner, their 
financial implications assessed, control procedures re-evaluated  
and corrective actions agreed and implemented.
Control procedures
The Group has implemented control procedures designed to ensure 
complete and accurate accounting for financial transactions and to 
limit the potential exposure to loss of assets or fraud. Measures 
taken include physical controls, segregation of duties, reviews by 
management, internal audit and external audit to the extent 
necessary to arrive at their audit opinion.
A process of control self assessment and hierarchical reporting  
has been established which provides for a documented and 
auditable trail of accountability. These procedures are relevant 
across the Group and provide for successive assurances to be  
given at increasingly higher levels of management and, finally, to the 
Board. Planned corrective actions are independently monitored for 
timely completion.
Monitoring and corrective action
There are clear and consistent procedures in place for monitoring 
the system of internal financial and non-financial controls. The Audit 
Committee normally meets three times a year and, within its remit, 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal financial 
controls. The Committee receives reports from the External 
Auditors, Internal Auditors and management.
Non-financial controls are reviewed regularly by executive 
management, who report any issues and corrective actions taken 
directly to the Board. 38

REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2015.
Introduction
This is my final report as Chair of the Remuneration Committee.  
A C Bromfield will become chair of the Committee on 19 May 2016,  
but I shall remain as a member of the Committee until I retire from 
the Board.
The main focus for the Remuneration Committee in 2015 has  
been considering the changes on remuneration introduced by the 
updated UK Corporate Governance Code in September 2014. In 
particular, the Committee reviewed our policy on the Executive 
Directors to hold a minimum level of shares (see page 52) and 
concluded that it remained appropriate. The Committee also 
decided to introduce Clawback arrangements to the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and the annual bonus, in addition to the Malus 
arrangements introduced in 2014 on the LTIP and the Deferred 
Bonus Share Plan (‘DBSP’). Details of the operation of the Malus 
arrangements may be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
on page 44. Details of the operation of the Clawback arrangements 
may be found on page 49.
In 2015 the Company launched for eligible UK-based employees  
the Zotefoams Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). The Committee was 
consulted throughout the design and launch processes for the SIP 
and approved the matching ratio of one Matching Share for every 
four Partnership Shares purchased. The Committee believes the SIP 
is a favourable benefit to incentivise the employees and share in any 
future success of the Company. The SIP went live in November 
2015, with the first purchase under the plan being made on 
10 December 2015.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee, with the assistance of Deloitte LLP, 
the Committee’s remuneration consultant, developed the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, which was approved at the AGM held on 
20 May 2014 and is expected to remain in place until the AGM 
planned to be held in 2017. There have been no changes to the 
Policy since then, with the exception of the introduction of the above 
mentioned Clawback arrangements. The current intention is to 
submit to the Shareholders for approval an updated Policy at the 
2017 AGM. The Policy has been included in the Annual Report for 
ease of reference (pages 39 to 48).
Key pay outcomes in respect of 2015 and looking forward to 2016
The base salary of D B Stirling was increased by 4.5% (effective 
1 April 2015). We intend to increase his salary by 4.5% (effective 
1 April 2016). C G Hurst’s salary was increased by 2.5% (effective 
1 April 2015) and this was consistent with the increase given in 2015 
to the wider workforce in the UK. C G Hurst will not receive a salary 
increase in 2016 due to him retiring on 16 May 2016. We propose  
to increase G C McGrath’s salary by 2.5% (effective 1 April 2016). 
The salary reviews of the wider work force for 2016 are still yet to  
be agreed.
The annual bonus for 2015 was 44.4% of eligible salary for D B 
Stirling and 29.4% of eligible salary for C G Hurst. There is no bonus 
in relation to 2015 for G C McGrath due to him only joining the Group 
on 1 December 2015. For D B Stirling, 25% of his annual bonus will 
be deferred by making awards under the DBSP. In light of C G Hurst 
retiring, his entire bonus will be paid in cash. We have set the targets 
for the 2016 annual bonus, which are a mixture of profit before tax, 
sales in High Performance Products (‘HPP’) business and individual 
objectives (further details may be found on page 48). We believe that 
the targets for the annual bonus are appropriate for the Executive 
Directors to deliver on the Group’s strategy.
The vesting of the 2013 awards made under the LTIP will be 50.0% 
of the maximum opportunity and details of the LTIP awards planned 
to be made in 2016 may be found on page 49.
Performance in 2015 and conclusion
The Company had a better year in 2015 than in 2014. Profit before 
tax and exceptional items was £6.01m compared to £5.27m in 2014. 
As a consequence, there were payouts on the 2015 annual bonus 
and vesting of 50.0% of the maximum opportunity of the 2013 LTIP 
awards, which was driven entirely by the significant growth in TSR 
(total shareholder return) at 22% per annum over the last three years. 
Unfortunately, the EPS target for the 2013 LTIP was not achieved.
The Committee and I feel that it is important to incentivise the 
Executive Directors appropriately, to ensure that they deliver on the 
Group’s strategy for profitability and growth in its HPP and 
international businesses. We feel that our remuneration strategy, as 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, remains appropriate 
and is aligned with the Group’s strategy. As always, I will be available 
at the AGM to answer any questions you may have.

Annual Report 2015
Introduction
Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2015
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Listing Rules, section 
421 of Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 to the Large and 
Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the ‘Regulations’).
This report is split into two sections:
• The Directors’ Policy Report, which was approved at the AGM 
held on 20 May 2014, became effective immediately and is 
intended to last three years (ie until the AGM planned for 2017). 
There are no changes to the Policy report and, therefore, no 
shareholder vote is required at the 2016 AGM. It is being included 
for ease of reference.
• The Annual Report on Remuneration, which provides details on 
how Directors were paid in 2015 and how we intend to implement 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2016. This section of the 
report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the  
2016 AGM.
Policy report
The following section sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(the ‘Policy’) which was approved at the 2014 AGM and applies to 
remuneration made since 20 May 2014.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including 
exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such 
payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set 
out below where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the 
Policy came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was 
not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a 
Director of the Company. For these purposes the term ‘payments’ 
includes (but is not limited to) the Committee satisfying awards of 
variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the 
terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.
The Remuneration Committee may also make minor amendments  
to the Policy set out below (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or 
administrative purposes or to take account of changes in legislation) 
without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

Base salary To help recruit and retain 
Executive Directors of the 
calibre required to develop 
and deliver the business 
strategy.
The Committee sets base 
salary taking into 
consideration: 
• the individual’s 
experience, performance 
and skills; 
• the scope of the role; 
• pay and conditions 
elsewhere in the 
Company; and 
• external market 
benchmark data in other 
similar size companies. 
Normally reviewed annually, 
with increases effective from 
1 April, however the 
Committee may review 
them more frequently where 
it considers this appropriate. 
Paid in cash.
While there is no maximum 
opportunity for base salary, 
base salary increases for 
Executive Directors will be 
considered in the context of 
increases for other 
employees in the Company. 
In specific circumstances, 
including but not limited to: 
• where the Committee 
has set the base salary 
for a newly appointed 
Executive Director at 
lower than the market 
level for such a role to 
allow for the individual to 
progress into the role; or 
• where, in the 
Committee’s opinion, 
there has been a 
significant increase in the 
size or scope of an 
Executive Director’s role 
or responsibilities the 
Committee may award 
increases above this 
level.

Benefits To provide market 
competitive benefits for our 
Executive Directors.
The Committee’s policy is to 
provide Executive Directors 
with a market competitive 
level of benefits, taking into 
consideration benefits 
offered to other senior 
managers within the Group, 
the individual’s 
circumstances and 
prevailing market practice.
Core benefits currently 
provided to Executive 
Directors include, but are 
not limited to, a car 
allowance, private medical 
insurance and death in 
service cover.
Participation in all employee 
share plans on the same 
terms as all other UK 
employees, should the 
Company choose to 
establish one.
Relocation/international 
assignment benefits – 
Where an Executive Director 
is required to relocate from 
their home country to take 
up their position, additional 
benefits may be provided, 
including, but not limited to: 
assistance for housing, 
school fees, travel 
assistance, relocation  
costs, insurance  
cover and assistance  
with tax advice.
There is no maximum or 
minimum level of benefits as 
they are dependent on the 
individual’s circumstances 
and the cost to the 
Company.
Relocation/international 
assignment benefits – The 
level of such benefits would 
be set at an appropriate 
level taking into account  
the circumstances of the 
individual and typical market 
practice.

Pension To provide Executive 
Directors with competitive 
post retirement benefits  
and reward sustained 
contribution. 
D B Stirling and C G Hurst 
participate in a defined 
contribution pension plan 
and are deferred members 
of the closed defined benefit 
pension plan.
The terms of the 
contribution to the defined 
contribution plan were 
agreed at the time of closure 
of the Zotefoams defined 
benefit pension scheme, 
and therefore include a 
commitment to current 
Executive Directors to 
increase the level of 
contribution by 3%  
every five years.
The policy for a new 
Executive Director is either 
to participate in a defined 
contribution pension plan or 
receive a cash allowance in 
lieu of pension. There will be 
no contractual commitment 
to increase the level of 
contribution every five years.
G C McGrath was not 
eligible for any pension 
contributions in 2015.  
In 2016 the maximum 
contribution by the 
Company will be 5% to  
the deferred contribution 
pension plan.
Currently the level of 
contribution is as follows:
D B Stirling – 12.75% 
pensionable salary
C G Hurst – 13.75% 
pensionable salary.
There is a commitment to 
increase the level of 
contribution by 3% of 
pensionable salary every 
five years. The next increase 
will apply from 2016, during 
the intended effective period 
of this remuneration policy.
Therefore the maximum 
opportunity for the duration 
of this policy will be as 
follows:
D B Stirling – 15.75% 
pensionable salary
C G Hurst – 16.75% 
pensionable salary.
The defined benefit pension 
plan is closed to future 
accruals, however legacy 
arrangements will continue 
to be honoured.
Contributions for new 
Executive Directors will be 
set at the time of the 
relevant appointment, taking 
into account the individual’s 
circumstances and relevant 
market practice.

Legacy arrangements
The Company also has an Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’). 
This was replaced by the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan as the 
principal plan for incentivising the Executive Directors. No awards 
have been made under the ESOS since 2007 and none now remain 
in place. Options granted under the ESOS were subject to 
performance criteria. 
Information supporting the policy table
There have been no changes in the remuneration policy since it was 
approved at the AGM held on 20 May 2014.
Performance measures and approach to target setting
Annual bonus
Performance measures for the short-term incentive arrangements 
are selected annually by the Committee to align with Zotefoams’ 
annual business strategy.
Performance targets for the financial element are set to be 
appropriately stretching, by reference to the Company’s internal 
business plan, and to align with the shareholder experience. 
Performance targets for the strategic element are determined 
annually by the Committee and set to incentivise the delivery  
of key strategic priorities over the course of the year.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Performance measures for the long-term incentive arrangements are 
selected annually by the Committee to align with Zotefoams’ 
long-term business strategy and to reflect the Company’s growth 
ambitions and approach to dividend distribution.
The performance targets for the Long-Term Incentive Plan are 
reviewed annually and set taking into account market conditions, 
external market forecasts, internal business forecasts and market 
practice.
Malus arrangements for the DBSP and the LTIP
The Remuneration Committee may, in its absolute discretion, 
determine at any time prior to the vesting of an award under the 
DBSP or LTIP to:
a) reduce the number of shares to which an award relates;
b) cancel an award; or
c) impose further conditions on an award in circumstances  
where the Remuneration Committee considers such action  
is appropriate. 
Such circumstances include, but are not limited to:
a) a material financial downturn in the performance of the Company, 
a company forming part of the Group or a relevant business area;
b) a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial 
results;
c) a material failing in the risk management of the Company, a 
company forming part of the Group or a relevant business area; or
d) serious damage to the reputation of the Company, a company 
forming part of the Group or a relevant business area due to the 
participant’s misconduct or otherwise.
Remuneration structure for employees below Board
The remuneration for the senior management immediately below the 
Board is a similar structure to the structure used for the Executive 
Directors. Middle management participates, at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee, in the Approved Share Option Plan 
subject to the Plan’s rules. There is a general staff discretionary 
bonus scheme which is based on the performance of the Company 
and other factors. Other arrangements are also in place for specific 
areas of the Group.

Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Approach to fees Operation Other items
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors (‘NEDs’) are set an appropriate level 
to reflect:
• the time commitment required to fulfil  
the role;
• the responsibilities and duties of the 
positions; and
• typical practice in other similar 
companies.
Fees are reviewed at appropriate intervals by 
the Board.
Fees are subject to the aggregate limit in the 
Company’s Articles of Association for fees 
paid to NEDs.
Our NED fee policy is to pay: 
• a base fee for membership of the Board; 
and 
• an additional fee for being Chair of a 
Committee to reflect the additional 
responsibilities and time commitments of 
the role.
The Chairman receives an inclusive fee for 
the role.
Additional fees for acting as Senior 
Independent Director, membership of a 
committee, or chairmanship or membership 
of subsidiary boards or other fixed fees may 
be introduced if considered appropriate.
The Chairman and NEDs are not eligible to 
participate in the bonus or any long-term 
incentive arrangements.
NEDs do not currently receive any taxable 
benefits.
Additional benefits may be provided In the 
future if the Board considers this appropriate. 46

Remuneration policy on recruitment
In determining the remuneration package for a new recruit to the Board, (including internal promotions to the Board), the Remuneration 
Committee takes into consideration:
• the calibre and skills of the individual, local market practice in the individual’s home country, appropriate market data, internal relativities 
and the current remuneration arrangements applicable for other Executive Directors on the Board. The Committee endeavours to align 
the remuneration arrangements of new recruits with the policy table outlined above. However, where appropriate, the Committee retains 
the discretion to make decisions outside the above Policy table to facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre, which may 
include, where applicable, the utilisation of Listing Rule 9.4.2;
• the Committee’s desire to recruit an Executive Director of the required calibre to develop and deliver the business strategy, while at the 
same time ensuring that remuneration arrangements offered are in the best interests of both Zotefoams and its shareholders without 
paying more than is considered necessary;
• the need to be transparent to shareholders. As such the Committee will make every effort to explain the rationale for the remuneration 
arrangements for a new recruit in the remuneration report following the recruitment of a new Director; and
• the maximum level of annual variable pay and long-term incentive awards which may be awarded to a new Executive Director, which 
following recruitment will be in line with the Policy table set out above, excluding any buy out awards. Such variable remuneration may be 
made in the form of cash or shares, subject to performance conditions as selected by the Committee, and may vest immediately or at a 
future point in time.
The remuneration package for a new recruit may include any of the elements listed in the above policy table, or any other component which 
the Committee considers appropriate at the time.
Buy outs
When appointing a new Executive Director, existing incentive arrangements will be used where possible.
However, to facilitate recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may ‘buy out’ any remuneration arrangements forfeited by the new 
Executive Director on leaving their former employment. In doing so, the Committee will consider all relevant factors including the form of the 
awards (ie cash or equity), performance conditions attached to the awards, the likelihood of such conditions being met and the timeframe of 
the awards.
Typically, any buy outs will be made on a like-for-like basis.
On recruitment, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to grant awards under Listing Rule 9.4.2, which allows for the grant of awards 
specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an Executive Director without seeking prior shareholder approval.
Recruitment of Non-Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee will normally align the remuneration arrangements for new Non-Executive Directors with those outlined in the 
Policy table on page 45.
Service contracts and termination policy
When determining leaving arrangements for an Executive Director the Committee takes into account any pre-established contractual 
agreements including the provisions of any incentive plans, pension entitlements, typical market practice, the performance and conduct of 
the individual and the commercial justification for any payments.

Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman have appointment letters 
setting out their duties and the time commitment expected. 
Appointment letters are currently for terms of three years. 
Appointments may be terminated by either party with six months’ 
written notice. Details of the appointment letters are contained in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on page 53.
External appointments
Executive Directors and members of senior management may be 
invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies. 
These appointments provide an opportunity to gain broader 
experience outside Zotefoams and therefore benefit the Company. 
Providing that appointments are not likely to lead to a conflict of 
interest, Executive Directors may accept non-executive 
appointments and retain the fees received.
Considering shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee is committed to engaging in an open 
dialogue with the Group’s shareholders and will seek views and 
opinions on significant matters relating to the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors as appropriate. As part of formulating the 
Remuneration Policy, letters were sent to the Company’s main 
shareholders summarising the main changes to the remuneration 
strategy and to seek their support for the approval of the Policy at 
the AGM. Both the Chairman and the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee make themselves available at the AGM to answer any 
questions on remuneration matters. They are also available at other 
times (requests should be made to the Company Secretary), should 
a shareholder wish to raise a matter on remuneration.
Annual Report on Remuneration
Statement of implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy in 2016 (Unaudited)
Base salary
From the benchmarking work undertaken by Deloitte LLP in early 
2014, it was identified that the base salary for the Group CEO, D B 
Stirling, had fallen significantly behind the market competitive range 
that the Company uses. A 4.5% increase (effective 1 April 2015) was 
made to D B Stirling’s salary. Whilst this increase reduced the gap,  
D B Stirling’s salary still remains behind the competitive range and, 
therefore, the Remuneration Committee intends to make an increase 
of 4.5% (effective 1 April 2016).
The base salary for G C McGrath, the Finance Director, will be 
increased by 2.5% (effective 1 April 2016).
Budgeted salary increases for the wider employee group are taken 
into consideration when determining increases for the Executive 
Directors and senior executives.
A 2.5% base salary increase (effective 1 April 2015) was awarded to 
the Executive Director C G Hurst in line with the average increase for 
the wider employee group of 2.5% in the UK. C G Hurst will not be 
receiving a salary increase (effective 1 April 2016) as he will be 
retiring on 16 May 2016.
The 2016 salary increase for the wider work force has not yet been 
agreed and, in the UK, this is subject to negotiation with the unions.
The Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees 
when formulating the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
Benefits
Executive Directors will be provided with a car allowance, private 
medical insurance, death-in-service cover and, if they participate in 
the SIP, Matching Shares.
Retirement benefits
For 2016, contributions to the defined contribution pension plan are 
as follows:
• D B Stirling– 15.75% pensionable salary (before salary sacrifice).
• G C McGrath – Up to 5.0% pensionable salary (before salary 
sacrifice) when G C McGrath joins the Defined Contribution 
Pension Scheme.
• C G Hurst – 16.75% pensionable salary (before salary sacrifice).
As mentioned in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, there was a 
commitment, which existed before 27 June 2012, to increase the 
level of pension contribution by 3% of pensionable salary every five 
years for D B Stirling and C G Hurst. The most recent increase took 
effect on 1 January 2016 and has been reflected above.
Annual bonus
For 2016, the maximum opportunity for D B Stirling and G C 
McGrath in respect of the annual bonus will be 100% of base salary 
(before salary sacrifice), while the maximum opportunity for C G 
Hurst will be up to 15% of annual base salary (before salary sacrifice) 
subject solely to performance against personal objectives.
Awards to the Executive Directors under the annual bonus are 
subject to a mix of financial, strategic and individual performance 
measures as follows:

Approved Share Option Plan (‘ASOP’)
In 2016, G C McGrath will receive the maximum award permitted 
under the ASOP (currently £30,000). The award will be calculated 
using the lower of: (1) the mid-market price of the trading day 
immediately before the day of award; or (2) the average mid-market 
price for the three previous trading days before the day of the award.

The award will be subject to the performance target that EPS (earnings per share) must increase over the three year period ending 
31 December 2018 by at least 3% pa in excess of the increase of the Retail Price Index in the same period.
D B Stirling and C G Hurst already hold the maximum amount for awards permitted under the ASOP.
LTIP
For 2016, the Executive Directors (other than C G Hurst) will receive awards of performance shares under the LTIP equal to 100% of base 
salary (before salary sacrifice).
The 2016 awards will be subject to two equally weighted measures consisting of absolute TSR performance and EPS performance. If 
performance is below the TSR trigger point then no part of the TSR award will vest. If the performance is below the EPS trigger point then no 
part of the EPS award will vest. Between the trigger point and the maximum, the award vests on a sliding scale basis.
The table below summarises the performance criteria which will be used for the 2016 award.

EPS goal 12.8p 12.5 19.2p 50
Clawback arrangements
Whilst Malus arrangements were introduced on the LTIP and DBSP in relation to Awards made since 2014, the Remuneration Committee 
has decided to introduce Clawback arrangements, to complement the existing Malus arrangements, for the annual bonus and LTIP. These 
Clawback arrangements will be first used in relation to the 2016 awards.
Where an Executive Director has, in the sole opinion of the Remuneration Committee, committed an act of gross misconduct or when there 
has been a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results, the Remuneration Committee may, at its absolute discretion, 
require an Executive Director:
a) to repay some or all of the cash element of his or her annual bonus received in the previous two years from the date of the Remuneration 
Committee’s determination; and
b) to transfer back or surrender to the Company (or its Employees’ Benefit Trust) some or all of the shares that have vested under the LTIP in 
the previous two years from the date of the Remuneration Committee’s determination. If such shares have been sold, either as part of the 
vesting or subsequently, the proceeds of such sale are to be paid to the Company (or its Employees’ Benefit Trust).

1 The LTIP award made in March 2013 is not due to vest until 19 March 2016, but has been included in the table as its performance was measured for the three year period ended 
31 December 2015. For the purposes of this table, the award has been valued using the average share price over the three months to 31 December 2015 of £3.443. This 
compares to a share price of £2.020 at the date of grant. The LTIP award vested on 4 April 2015 and has been recalculated using the actual sales price achieved for the shares 
when they were sold (£2.959) on 10 April 2015.
2 G C McGrath joined the Group on 1 December 2015 and is not eligible for a bonus in relation to 2015 and has not yet been granted any LTIP awards. 50

Notes to the table (Audited)
Base salary
The Company operates a Defined Contribution (‘DC’) Pension Plan, where individuals can elect to change their contract of employment 
under a salary sacrifice arrangement, whereby their salary is reduced and the Company makes a corresponding contribution into their DC 
Pension Plan. Both D B Stirling and C G Hurst have opted for the salary sacrifice scheme and the amounts shown for base salary are after 
salary sacrifice. Similarly, the amounts shown for pension include the amounts of salary sacrificed. G C McGrath, as at 31 December 2015, 
had not yet joined the DC Pension Plan.
Benefits
Benefits include a company car allowance, private medical insurance and the value of the Matching Shares (at dates when awarded) 
acquired during the year under the SIP.
Annual bonus

The annual bonus was based on base salary before salary sacrifice (‘Bonusable Salary’). The maximum opportunity for the bonus was 100% 
of Bonusable Salary. The bonus pay out for D B Stirling was 44.4% and for C G Hurst was 29.4%. For D B Stirling, 25% of the bonus will be 
deferred by making awards under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan (‘DBSP’). C G Hurst, who will be retiring on 16 May 2016, will receive his 
entire bonus in cash. G C McGrath, who joined on 1 December 2015, was not eligible for a bonus in relation to 2015. Full details of the 
operation of the DBSP are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (see page 42).

LTIP
The LTIP awards made are subject to performance and service conditions. 50% of the award is subject to growth in absolute Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and 50% subject to EPS growth. Performance is measured over a three year period and a proportion of the 
restricted shares will be released to the participant, to the extent to which TSR and EPS targets over the period have been met, together with 
additional shares that represent the dividends that would have been paid during the performance period on the restricted shares that have 
been released.
The total award vesting is the sum of the awards for TSR and EPS. If the performance is below the EPS trigger point then no part of the EPS 
award vests. If performance is below the TSR trigger point then no part of the TSR award vests. Between the trigger point and the 
maximum, the award vests on a sliding scale basis.
The table below summarises the performance criteria for the 2013 award, which is due to vest on 19 March 2016.

Absolute TSR goal
1
7.5% pa growth 12.5 20% pa growth 50
EPS goal

12.3p 12.5 17.7p 50
1 The absolute TSR growth is from a share price of 202p, being the average share price of the final quarter of 2012.
2 The trigger point for the EPS target was originally set as 13.5p, where 12.5% of the award would vest, to the maximum of 19.5p, where 50% of the award would vest. The EPS 
target was adjusted in December 2014 to reflect the dilutive effect that the share placement, that took place on 17 September 2014, had on earnings.
The maximum TSR growth target was fully met (growth being 22.0% pa) and the adjusted EPS target was not met (EPS was 11.1p). 
Therefore, 50% of the award will vest, which will be increased to reflect the dividends paid during the performance period.

Total pension entitlements (Audited)
The Zotefoams Defined Benefit Pension Scheme (the ‘DB Scheme’) was closed to future accrual of benefits as from 31 December 2005.  
At this time, all active members left the DB Scheme and were granted preserved pensions payable from their normal retirement age (or 
immediately, if the member had reached normal retirement age).
The following serving Directors were members of the DB Scheme during the year.

Notes
(1) The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement at normal retirement age (or immediately upon late retirement where applicable), based on 
service to 31 December 2005 (the date the DB Scheme was closed to future accrual), including increases to the year end, but excluding any future increases under the Rules of 
the DB Scheme.
(2) As required by the Regulations, the pension input amount has been calculated using the method set out in section 229 of the Finance Act 2004(a) where:
• ‘pension input period’ is the year ended 31 December 2015; and
• in the application of section 234 of the Act, the figure 20 is substituted for the figure 16.
The following is additional information relating to the Directors’ pensions from the DB Scheme:
(a) Before the DB Scheme closed, members had the option of paying Additional Voluntary Contributions (‘AVCs’). The value of these AVCs has been excluded from the above figures.
(b) Normal retirement age is 65.
(c) On death before retirement, a spouse’s pension is payable of one half of the member’s preserved pension at leaving, revalued from leaving to the date of death.
 On death in retirement, a spouse’s pension is payable of one half of the member’s pension at death, without reduction for any part of the member’s pension commuted for cash 
at retirement.
(d) Members’ Guaranteed Minimum Pensions increase at statutory rates. Other pensions increase in payment at 5% per annum, or the increase in the Retail Prices Index if lower.
(e) From 1 January 2006, active employee members were able to pay contributions to the DC Pension Plan set up by the Company in order to receive retirement benefits. The 
Company also contributes to this arrangement. Both D B Stirling and C G Hurst pay into the DC Pension Plan using a salary sacrifice scheme. Details of the contributions made 
into this Plan have been disclosed in the single figure calculation and are not included in the above disclosure.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited)
In 2014 the Remuneration Committee introduced a policy requiring Executive Directors to hold a shareholding equivalent to 100% of base 
salary, with a five year period to build up to this holding from introduction of the policy or becoming an Executive Director. Throughout 2015, 
both D B Stirling and C G Hurst complied with this policy. G C McGrath, who only joined the Company on 1 December 2015, has until 
30 November 2020 to build up a shareholding to comply with the policy.
The tables below set out the Directors’ interests (including those of their connected persons) in Zotefoams shares as at 31 December 2015.

Committee normally keeps salary increases for the Executive Directors similar to those of the employees when they review the salaries of the 
Executive Directors in April each year. There was a 6.6% increase in the taxable benefits for the Group CEO, which is due to an increase in 
the premium for the private medical insurance for the Group CEO. The majority of employees do not receive any taxable benefits.

Committee roles and advisers (Unaudited)
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. A C Bromfield, R J Clowes, M L Clayton, N G Howard and S P Good were members of the Committee 
throughout 2015 to the date of this report. All the members are independent Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of N G Howard, 
who was independent on appointment as Chairman of the Company. The Committee was chaired throughout 2015 by R J Clowes. The 
Committee’s terms of reference were last updated in March 2014 and may be found on the Company’s website.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than fees paid as disclosed on page 50 and as shareholders) in 
the Company, nor do they have any interests that may conflict with those of the Company, such as cross directorships. None of the 
Committee members are involved in the day-to-day management of the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board  
on remuneration matters. No Director is involved in any decision about his or her own remuneration. 56
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2015 and, at the invitation of the Committee, the Group CEO attended two of those 
meetings to give background information on remuneration matters. The Committee was also advised by the Finance Director as regards the 
level of completion of the performance targets. The secretary to the Committee was the Company Secretary.
In 2015, the Remuneration Committee considered the following matters:
• the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2014 and relevant matters;
• the annual bonuses for the Executive Team and the employees;
• the grant of HMRC Approved Share Options;
• the grant of awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and the vesting of awards made in 2012 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan;
• the salary review of the Executive Team and the Company Secretary;
• the remuneration of the Chairman;
• introducing clawback arrangements into the incentive schemes;
• Directors’ shareholding policy;
• establishing the Zotefoams Share Incentive Plan (a new all employees’ share scheme);
• establishing an incentive plan for MEL employees; and
• evaluating its effectiveness.
In 2015, the Remuneration Committee did not use the services of an independent firm of remuneration consultants. Deloitte LLP, who is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its Code on executive remuneration consulting in the UK, was used in 2014 
to undertake an extensive review of the executive remuneration framework.
Total fees for advice provided to the Committee amounted to the following:

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my report on the activities of the Audit 
Committee for 2015.
During 2015, the Audit Committee paid particular focus to the 
provision of internal audit services and concluded that it still 
remained appropriate, due to the Group’s size, to have the function 
performed by an independent audit firm. Having worked with 
Mazars for seven years, the Committee invited three firms to tender 
for the internal audit of the UK business and selected Grant 
Thornton UK LLP. The main scope of the internal audit was a review 
of the securities of the recently implemented enterprise resource 
planning system (‘ERP’) – together with the accounts payable 
function in Croydon, and a follow up on actions from previous 
internal audits.
The previous internal audit on the Group’s procedures to prevent 
anti-bribery had highlighted some areas for improvement, such as 
providing anti-bribery training via an electronic based package. This 
package has now been implemented and the Audit Committee 
monitored the progress of the other actions.
During the course of the year the Audit Committee was kept 
updated on the resolution of accounts payable and stock issues 
around the recently implemented ERP system and an unrelated 
change in the software to pay suppliers electronically. The situation 
is substantially improved and the Group continues to roll out and 
broaden the use of the ERP system.
With the increasingly global nature of Zotefoams’ business the Audit 
Committee was concerned to ensure that the finance function in the 
Group was appropriately structured and resourced. New hires have 
been made to prepare and support global growth.
The Committee also considered the effects of the updated UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the associated FRC’s Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting, in particular, the viability statement and the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems. As part of 
this work, the specialist governance advisers, Independent Audit 
Limited, were engaged to undertake a review of the Group’s risk 
management framework to ensure that it is meeting the business 
needs as the Group grows in scale and geographic reach. The 
report has just been received and its recommendations will form  
a key part of the Audit Committee’s work in 2016.
As a result of the Committee’s work during the year and having 
undertaken a review of its performance, the Audit Committee has 
concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference 
and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the External 
Auditors. I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions 
about the work of the Committee.
M-L Clayton
Chair of the Audit Committee
14 March 2016
Summary of the role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the 
independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The Audit 
Committee’s terms of reference, which are available on the Group’s 
website, include all matters indicated by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 7.1 and the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
The terms of reference are reviewed regularly by the Audit 
Committee to ensure they remain appropriate and reflect best 
practice and, if amended, are then referred to the Board for 
approval. The terms of reference were last reviewed in March 2016.
The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee are:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group 
and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance and reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgements contained therein;
• reviewing the External Auditors’ management letter and 
management responses to any findings and recommendations 
made from the external audit;
• reviewing the Group’s internal controls and risk management 
systems;
• reviewing the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, 
raise concerns about possible improprieties (‘the whistleblowing 
policy’);
• reviewing the arrangements put in place by the Group to prevent 
bribery and to receive reports of non-compliance;
• annually assessing the need for an internal audit function, 
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the application of 
the internal audit function to the Group, monitoring and reviewing 
management’s responses to any findings and reviewing any 
recommendations made from internal audit;
• reviewing and monitoring the External Auditors’ independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements, and their appointment and remuneration;
• developing and implementing a policy on the engagement of the 
External Auditors to supply non-audit services, taking into 
account relevant guidance regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external audit firm; and
• reporting to the Board on how it has discharged its 
responsibilities, including making recommendations, when 
necessary, on any actions or improvements required.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee during 2015 were the 
independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company: A C 
Bromfield; M-L Clayton; R J Clowes; and S P Good. The Committee 
was chaired by M-L Clayton, who is a Fellow of the Association  
of Chartered Certified Accountants and has, in the opinion of the 
Board, significant, recent and relevant financial experience to fulfil 
the requirements of the role. All Audit Committee members are 
expected to be financially literate and the Company provides further 
training if required or requested.
The Committee comprises the independent Non-Executive Directors 
and two members constitute a quorum. 58
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
Meetings
The Audit Committee has a planned calendar linked to events in the 
Group’s financial calendar, causing it to meet three times in the year. 
Each meeting agenda is predominantly based around these events 
and is approved by the Audit Committee Chair on behalf of the other 
members, although other members have the right to require reports 
on matters of interest in addition to standard agenda items. The 
Audit Committee met three times in 2015.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit Committee. 
The Company Chairman, Group CEO, Finance Director, Financial 
Controller and senior representatives of the External and Internal 
Auditors are invited to attend relevant meetings of the Committee, 
although the Committee reserves the right to request any of these 
individuals to withdraw. At each meeting, the External Auditors are 
given the opportunity to raise matters without the management 
being present. Other senior management may be invited to present 
such reports as are required for the Committee to discharge its 
duties. During the year, on an informal basis, the Audit Committee 
Chair meets senior representatives of both the External Auditors  
and Internal Auditors to discuss matters ahead of the formal 
Committee meetings.
Overview of the actions taken by the Audit Committee to 
discharge its duties
Since the beginning of 2015 the Audit Committee has:
• reviewed the financial statements in the 2014 Annual Report and 
Accounts and the interim report issued in August 2015. As part of 
this review the Committee received reports from the External 
Auditors on the audit of the Annual Report and the review of the 
interim report;
• reviewed the Group’s policies on ethics, anti-bribery and 
corruption, fraud and whistleblowing;
• reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s UK subsidiary 
companies to rely upon the exemption from audit as permitted by 
section 479A of the Companies Act 2006;
• considered the output from the Group-wide process used to 
identify, evaluate and mitigate high-level business risks, including 
reviewing the Group’s high-level business risk matrix;
• reviewed with management and the External Auditors the 
accounting treatment for the Group’s joint ventures in Asia;
• considered the recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and associated guidance published in September 2014, in 
particular, the viability statement and risk reporting;
• put to tender the internal audit function, selected a provider 
(Grant Thornton UK LLP), agreed a programme of work for 2015 
to be performed by the Internal Auditors, and received the 
Internal Auditors’ reports on the work undertaken and 
management’s responses to the proposals made in the reports;
• reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 
(including, but not limited to, financial controls and measures for 
detecting fraud) to ensure that they remain appropriate and 
adequate as the Group grows;
• reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be 
undertaken by the External Auditors;
• considered the views of both the External Auditors and Internal 
Auditors on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial 
controls;
• agreed the fees to be paid to the External Auditors for their audit 
and work on the accounts and interim report;
• undertaken an evaluation of the independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the External Auditors, including reviewing the 
amount of non-audit services provided by the External Auditors; 
and
• reviewed its own effectiveness.
Financial reporting and significant financial issues
The Audit Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. The Committee reviews 
accounting papers prepared by management which provide details 
on the main financial reporting judgements. The Committee reviews 
reports by the External Auditors on the full year and half-year results 
which highlight any issues with respect to the work undertaken on 
the audit.
During the year, the triennial actuarial valuation of the Company’s 
defined benefit pension scheme, as at 5 April 2014, was agreed with 
the scheme’s trustees together with the associated recovery plan for 
the scheme. As the liability of the scheme is one of the significant 
liabilities of the Group, the External Auditors have placed significant 
focus on it during the audit and kept the Audit Committee fully 
informed of their review of it.
The External Auditors continue to place focus also on the 
accounting treatment under IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements) for the 
Group’s joint ventures in Asia and keep the Audit Committee briefed 
on them. A position paper was agreed with the External Auditors in 
the early part of 2015 on the accounting treatment for the joint 
venture established with King Lai Group, ahead of that venture 
becoming operational.
External audit tender
The Audit Committee is aware of the requirement for FTSE 350 
companies to put to tender their external audits at least once every 
ten years (as set out in both the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the Competition and Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory  
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 (the ‘Order’)). The Audit Committee is 
also aware of the requirement in the Order for audit committees of 
FTSE 350 companies to state their plans for when they are likely to 
consider a tender process if the external audit has not been put to 
tender in the past five years.
A tender process for the external audit for the Group was last 
undertaken in 2012, following which PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(‘PwC’) was selected as the External Auditors. This is PwC’s fourth 
annual audit for the Group and, whilst the Group is not within the 
FTSE 350 and hence not subject to the above-mentioned 
requirements, the Audit Committee has no current plans in the 
medium term to retender the external audit, but will keep the  
matter under review.

Senior Statutory Auditor
The External Auditors’ Senior Statutory Auditor (S Wootten) is due to 
retire in 2016 and this is his last external audit for the Group. The 
Senior Statutory Auditor (M Jones) to replace Mr Wootten has been 
introduced to the Audit Committee as well as Management. There is 
a handover process currently underway, which is being assisted by 
delaying the rotation of a senior member of staff on the external audit 
to ensure continuity during this period. The Audit Committee would 
like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Wootten for the contribution 
that he has made to the Audit Committee, not only at the meetings 
he has attended, but also during the external audits themselves, and 
wishes him well for his retirement.
Effectiveness of the external auditors
The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external 
audit process in a number of ways. The External Auditors are invited 
to and normally attend all the scheduled meetings of the Committee 
during the year. At least annually, the External Auditors present a 
report, which includes an assessment and confirmation of their 
independence, as well as the activities that the External Auditors are 
undertaking to ensure compliance with best practice and regulation. 
At the conclusion of the annual audit, the Audit Committee 
undertakes an assessment of the External Auditors in relation  
to their fulfilment of the agreed audit plan, the robustness and 
perceptiveness of the External Auditors in handling key accounting 
and audit judgements and the thoroughness of the External 
Auditors’ review of internal financial controls. As part of this 
assessment, Management’s opinions on the External Auditors  
are also considered.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external 
audit. In order to ensure that the External Auditors’ objectivity and 
independence are not compromised, the Audit Committee set a 
policy in 2012 on the provision of non-audit services by the External 
Auditors, where there is a cap of £30k per annum for non-audit 
services and approval is required from the Chair of the Audit 
Committee to exceed that amount. At each meeting of the Audit 
Committee, the Company Secretary gives a report on the amount  
of spend by the Group for the year to date on non-audit services.
In 2015, the Group spent £5,250 on non-audit services, which 
related to advice on corporation and employment tax in connection 
with the branch in Thailand of Zotefoams Operations Limited and 
further advice on the patent box tax treatment. The External Auditors 
were chosen to do this work as they are an international firm with 
knowledge of the Group’s business allowing the matters to be dealt 
with expediently without compromising the independence of the 
external audit. Details of the External Auditors’ fees may be found  
in note 3 to the financial statements.
The Audit Committee, having conducted a review of the External 
Auditors, concluded that the External Auditors have performed 
satisfactorily and continue to be objective and independent and, 
therefore, has recommended to the Board that a resolution be  
put to the shareholders at the 2016 AGM to re-appoint the  
External Auditors.
Internal audit function
Each year the Audit Committee reviews the need for an internal  
audit function and given the size of the Group continues to be of  
the opinion that the internal audit function is best performed by an 
external audit firm, which complements the services provided by the 
External Auditors. In 2015, the Audit Committee put to tender the 
internal audit function and Grant Thornton UK LLP was successful  
in that process. Following the tender process, the Audit Committee 
agreed the scope for the internal audit, reviewed the report received 
and discussed the proposals made with management. Grant 
Thornton UK LLP has provided no other work for the Group and, 
therefore, the Audit Committee has considered them to be 
independent. 60

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present my report on the activities of the 
Nominations Committee for 2015.
2015 has been a particularly busy year for the Nominations 
Committee. The main activities for the Committee during 2015 have 
been the search for my successor and for a Finance Director.
I am pleased that S P Good has been appointed as Chairman 
Designate and G C McGrath as Finance Director. They both have 
extensive experience in the leadership of international businesses. 
Further information on the respective search processes are set out 
in the report.
N G Howard
Chair of the Nominations Committee
14 March 2016
Composition and operation of the Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee currently comprises the Chairman,  
N G Howard (who is its Chair), and the four independent Non-
Executive Directors. Upon the retirement of N G Howard, S P Good, 
Chairman Designate, will become Chair of the Committee. The 
quorum for meetings of the Committee is two independent Non-
Executive Directors.
The Nominations Committee operates within a defined set of terms 
of reference from the Board and is responsible for putting in place 
succession plans for the Board, reviewing the continuation in office 
of the Directors, managing the recruitment of new Board members 
within a specification set by the Board and annually reviewing 
conflicts of interest authorisations granted to any Board members. 
The Committee met three times in 2015 to perform its duties  
as set out in its terms of reference. The terms of reference  
were last updated in March 2014 and may be found on the 
Company’s website.
Search for Chairman Designate
The search for the Chairman Designate was led by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, R J Clowes, who agreed a role 
profile with the other members of the Nominations Committee as 
well as the Executive Directors. Although S P Good had indicated  
at an early stage his willingness to be considered for the position, it 
was still agreed to appoint the executive search consultant Odgers 
Berndtson to undertake a thorough search for the position in order 
to ensure that the best candidate was appointed. Odgers Berndtson 
does not have any other connection with the Company. In order to 
ensure impartiality, S P Good did not participate in any of the 
discussions nor the search and selection process.
A number of candidates were considered for the position of 
Chairman Designate. It was agreed on 30 October 2015 to appoint 
S P Good to the position. S P Good is already an independent 
Non-Executive Director, who was appointed to the Board on 
1 October 2014. S P Good remains independent until he assumes 
the role of Chairman on 1 April 2016.
Search for Finance Director
The search for the Finance Director, at the request of the 
Nominations Committee, was led by D B Stirling, the Group CEO, 
who agreed with the Nominations Committee a role profile and the 
search consultant to use. M-L Clayton, Chair of the Audit 
Committee, due to her financial experience, was also asked by the 
Committee to assist the Group CEO in the search process, although 
other members of the Committee and the Board and Management 
were involved in the process as well. Oryx Executive Search, which 
does not have any other connection with the Company, was 
appointed to undertake the search, and has also been used by the 
Group in the searches for other senior appointments.
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
In January 2016, the Nominations Committee considered the 
continuation in office of the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director R J Clowes, following him reaching nine years on the Board 
in July 2016. The Nominations Committee recognised that, with the 
retirements of both N G Howard and C G Hurst, there was a need to 
have continuity on the Board during this transitional period and 
made a recommendation to the Board that Mr Clowes, who is still 
considered by the Committee and the Board to be independent, be 
invited to remain on the Board for a further period, not to go beyond 
30 June 2017. 61

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, to be 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 30 to 31 of the Annual Report, confirms that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and the Strategic Report beginning on page 1 of the 
Annual Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
• Zotefoams plc’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view of 
the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit and the Group’s and the 
Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union;
• the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, comprise:
• the Consolidated and Company Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2015;
• the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated and Company Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: £300,500 which represents 5% of profit before tax.
• There are five trading companies within the Zotefoams plc consolidated accounts, one based in the UK, 
two in the US, and two in Asia. All these companies operate internationally.
• We conducted an audit of full year financial information on two trading companies, Zotefoams plc in the UK 
and Zotefoams Inc. in the US, with specific tests on MuCell Extrusion LLC.
• The trading companies where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 98% of Group revenue 
and 90% of Group profit before tax.
• Actuarial assumptions of the defined benefit pension scheme.
• Accounting for Joint Venture and subsidiaries.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read 
in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Strategic Report Governance Financial
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Actuarial assumptions underlying 
the valuation of the defined benefit 
pension scheme liabilities
The Group’s closed defined benefit 
pension scheme represents one of the 
largest liabilities in the statement of 
financial position at £5.2m (2014: £6.1m). 
The valuation of the scheme’s liabilities 
requires the directors to apply their 
judgement in making a number of key 
assumptions, being the rates of inflation 
(Consumer Price Index and Retail Price 
Index), the discount rate, and the life 
expectancy of scheme members. There 
is a risk of material misstatement if there 
are small changes in the assumptions, 
as the liability is highly sensitive.
We assessed whether management’s actuary had the appropriate skills and expertise to 
calculate the pension scheme liabilities, through checking and confirming their membership  
of the Institute of Actuaries.
We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used by management including the  
key assumptions used to value the pension liabilities.
• Discount rate: We considered the appropriateness of the 3.8% discount rate assumption 
used for the UK scheme by reference to our internally developed benchmarks.
• Inflation rate: We agreed the rates used by management against our internally developed 
benchmarks. 
• Mortality: We considered the appropriateness of the base tables selected for use by 
management against our internally developed benchmarks.
No material exceptions were identified as part of our testing of the assumptions outlined 
above and we consider the assumptions used to be in line with recognised market practices. 
We also compared the methodology used in calculating the assumptions against the 
methodology used in the prior year, given that there have been no substantive changes 
to the scheme (notably, as it is closed to new members) and did not identify any 
changes that would have a material impact on the value of the scheme liabilities.
Accounting for Joint Venture 
and subsidiaries
The company entered into an 
agreement with DB Trading Enterprise 
(HK) Limited (King Lai) in July 2015. 
As the subsidiary will be incorporated 
into Zotefoams plc year end accounts 
for the first time and its operations are 
similar to those of a Joint Venture, this 
was an area of focus for the audit team.
We assessed the Directors’ analysis of control and the basis for accounting for the new entity.
We obtained the signed contract to check that the terms noted in the directors’ analysis are  
an accurate reflection. We then assessed the disclosure in the financial statements in line with 
the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
We agreed with the basis used by management in accounting for the new entity is appropriate.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
group operates. All the work was performed by the Group engagement team.
Of the five trading companies, two of these are considered to be significant components of the Group, Zotefoams plc in the UK and 
Zotefoams Inc. in the US. We performed full-scope audits on these. Zotefoams plc accounts for 69% and 82% of the Group’s revenue 
and profit before tax respectively, whilst Zotefoams Inc. accounts for a further 29% and 8% respectively. We also performed procedures 
specifically around revenue within MuCell Extrusion LLC which contributed 7% towards the revenue of the Group.
This together with the procedures that were performed at the Group Level over the Group consolidation process provided us the 
appropriate evidence.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
 Overall group materiality £300,500 (2014: £263,000).
 How we determined it 5% of profit before tax.
  Ra t i ona le f or 
benchmark applied
We believe that profit before tax is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing 
the performance of the Group, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £15,000 (2014: 
£13,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 64

Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 21, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• Information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group 
and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
• The statement given by the directors on page 61, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s and 
Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 57 to 59, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the  
Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 22 to 25 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1  
of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group,  
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw 
attention to.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed  
or mitigated.
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw 
attention to.
• The directors’ explanation on page 61 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the  
Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material 
to add or to draw 
attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent 
with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 65

Annual Report 2015
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from these responsibilities. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the 
Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 61, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by 
our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
NOTES
1. Accounting policies
Zotefoams plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in Great Britain.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The Parent 
Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The consolidated financial statements of Zotefoams plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union and IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 26.
On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements the Company is taking 
advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual Income Statement or Statement  
of Comprehensive Income and related notes that form part of these approved financial statements.
These financial statements were approved by the Board on 14 March 2016.
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set  
out in the Group CEO’s Review on pages 10 to 17. This also describes the financial position of the Company, its cash flows and liquidity 
position. In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, borrowing facilities, and its 
exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its  
business risks.
The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements and the Company’s 
individual financial statements are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied to all of the statements presented.
a) Measurement convention
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the following exception:
• derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value.
b) Basis of consolidation
i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from such transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the 
extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
iii) Accounting for business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value re-measured at acquisition date of the existing equity interest in the 
acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 75
Strategic Report Governance Financial
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The consideration transferred does not 
include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Costs 
related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with 
a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as 
equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree employees 
(acquiree awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer replacement awards are included in 
measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the 
replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree awards and the extent to which the replacement awards 
relate to past and/or future service.
iv) Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with 
owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-
controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or 
received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of 
the Parent.
Prior to the adoption of IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2008), goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of 
non-controlling interests in a subsidiary, which represented the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount 
of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of the transaction.
c) Foreign currency
i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign 
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at 
the date of the transaction.
ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at 
the average rate of exchange ruling during the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of 
the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations since 1 January 2004 are taken directly to translation reserve 
through Other Comprehensive Income. They are released into the Income Statement upon disposal.
d) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from operational, financing and 
investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading 
purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are 
stated at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Where derivatives qualify for 
hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged (see accounting policy (e)).
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted 
forward price. 76

Annual Report 2015
NOTES CONTINUED
1. Accounting policies continued
e) Cash flow hedging
When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or of a 
highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in 
Other Comprehensive Income. If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a 
financial liability, then the associated gains or losses that were recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income are reclassified into 
the Income Statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the Income Statement.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the 
hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in 
accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the 
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
f) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
g) Property, plant and equipment
i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses (see 
accounting policy (l)).
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components are accounted for as separate 
items of property, plant and equipment.
The cost of assets under construction includes the cost of materials and direct labour, and any other costs directly attributable to bringing 
the asset to a working condition for its intended use.
ii) Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Lease payments are accounted for as described in accounting policy (s).
iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of the item of 
property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings   20 years
Plant and equipment 5–15 years
Fixtures and fittings 3–5 years
Assets under construction are not depreciated until after the end of the quarter that the asset is in the location and condition necessary 
for its intended use.
h) Intangible assets
i) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is 
recognised in the Income Statement as an expense as incurred. Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are 
applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. No development 
expenditure has been capitalised to date.
ii) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s interest in the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is stated at the amount recognised on acquisition date less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may 
be impaired. 77
Strategic Report Governance Financial
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
iii) Software
The cost of a purchased intangible asset is the purchase price plus any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and 
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended.
iv) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition and amortised over 
their estimated useful economic life. Their carrying value is the fair value at acquisition less cumulative amortisation and any impairment. 
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are 
as follows:
Marketing related   5–15 years
Customer related   2–10 years
Technology related  5–20 years
Software related  3–10 years
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Other intangible assets including patents that are purchased by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost is the purchase price of the asset. Amortisation is charged to 
the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill 
and brands is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amounts less impairment losses (see accounting policy (l)).
j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, the weighted average purchase price is used. For 
work in progress and finished goods manufactured by the Group, cost is taken as production cost, which includes an appropriate 
proportion of attributable overheads.
k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts 
that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows.
l) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy (j)), employee benefits (see accounting policy 
(p)) and deferred tax assets (see accounting policy (t)), are reviewed at each balance sheet date where there is an indication that the asset 
may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated (see below).
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is 
estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating 
unit (‘CGU’) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
i) Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested 
individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill 
impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed 
reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is 
allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 78
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
NOTES CONTINUED
1. Accounting policies continued
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are 
allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the 
corporate asset is allocated.
ii) Impairment losses
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other 
assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
iii) Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior years are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if 
there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent 
that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or 
amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
m) Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (see below), after initially being recognised at cost in the 
consolidated balance sheet. 
i) Equity Method 
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the  
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in other 
comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint 
ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
When the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other 
unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments  
on behalf of the other entity. 
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint-ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note (l).  
n) Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
o) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any differences between cost and redemption values being recognised in 
the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis where material.
p) Employee benefits
i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
ii) Defined benefits plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit post employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each 
plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that the employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. 
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield 
at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The 
calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses that arise through the Comprehensive Income. 79
Strategic Report Governance Financial
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
iii) Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is recognised 
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period 
during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted before 2006 were 
measured using a Monte Carlo simulation method. Options granted since 1 January 2006 are valued using a Black-Scholes model.  
Fair value measurements take into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
iv) Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
Transactions of the Company-sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Parent 
Company and Group financial statements. In particular, the EBT’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and 
credited directly to equity.
q) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
r) Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Income Statement at the point of despatch when significant risks and rewards of 
ownership are deemed to have been transferred to the buyer. MuCell Extrusion LLC recognises licence revenue upon transfer of the 
MuCell
®
 technology provided that no significant Company obligations remain, the licence amount is determinable, and the collection of 
the related receivable is probable. Royalty income is based on the terms of the licence agreements and is recorded when amounts are 
determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable. Revenue from equipment sales is recognised upon either shipment or 
delivery as specified in the contract terms. Revenue from consulting services is recognised either as the services are performed or upon 
the achievement of a specific milestone. Payments received under these arrangements prior to the completion of the related work are 
recorded as deferred income.
s) Expenses
i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the Income Statement as an integral part of the total lease expenses.
ii) Finance lease payments
The finance charge, where material, is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability.
t) Taxation
Taxation in the Income Statement for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income 
Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in Other Comprehensive Income, in which case it is recognised 
in Other Comprehensive Income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustments to the tax payable in respect of 
previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor 
taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will 
be realised.
Additional tax that arises from the distribution of dividends is recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend. 80

u) Exceptional items
Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature which are considered non-recurring and which are excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 4) are classified 
as exceptional items. In 2014 this included the impairment of property, plant and equipment and inventory associated with the

2. Segment reporting
The Group’s operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to and regularly reviewed by the 
Group Chief Executive Officer, David Stirling, who is considered to be the ‘chief operating decision maker’ for the purpose of evaluating 
segment performance and allocating resources.
The Group manufactures and sells high-performance foams and licenses related technology for specialist markets worldwide. Zotefoams’ 
activities are categorised as follows:
• Polyolefins: these foams are made from olefinic homopolymer and copolymer resin. The most common resin used is polyethylene. 
Included in this segment were microZOTE
®
 foams made using polyolefin resins, an activity curtailed in 2014.
• High-Performance Products (‘HPP’): these foams exhibit high-performance on certain key properties, such as improved chemical, 
flammability or temperature performance, due to the resins on which they are based. Turnover in the segment is currently mainly 
derived from our ZOTEK
®
 F foams and T-FIT
®
 insulation, both made from PVDF fluoropolymer. Other products either commercially 
launched or being assessed in development include foams made from polyamide (nylon) and PEBA.
• MuCell Extrusion LLC (‘MEL ’): licenses microcellular foam technology and sells related machinery. 81

Final dividend prior year of 3.70p (2013: 3.60p) net per 5.0p ordinary share 1,615 1,421
Interim dividend of 1.80p (2014: 1.75p) net per 5.0p ordinary share 785 691
Dividends paid during the year 2,400 2,112
The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 3.80p per share (2014: 3.70p) is subject to approval by shareholders 
at the AGM and has not been recognised as a liability in these financial statements. The proposed dividend would amount to £1,688,000 
if paid to all the shares in issue.
Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing consolidated profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the Parent Company of 
£4.82m (2014: £3.34m) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held by employee trusts 
which are administered by independent trustees. The number of shares held in the trust at 31 December 2015 was 768,911 (2014: 
340,611). Distribution of shares from the trust is at the discretion of the trustees. Diluted earnings per ordinary share adjusts for the 
potential dilutive effect of share option schemes in accordance with IAS33 Earnings.

The Group tests annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the cash generating unit (‘CGU’) that is expected to benefit, being MEL. The recoverable 
amount of the MEL CGU is determined using value-in-use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and 
forecasts approved by management over the next five years. For periods beyond this, cash flows are extrapolated using long-term 
growth rates.
Other assumptions such as market growth and margins are based on past experience and management’s expectations. 88
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
NOTES CONTINUED
12. Intangible assets – Group continued
Key assumptions:
Long-term growth rate 2.5%
This growth rate is based on a prudent assessment of past experience and future estimations of market expectations.
Discount rate 14%
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow forecasts for the MEL CGU are derived from the pre-tax weighted average cost of 
capital for the Group adjusted for local economic and political risks.
The goodwill of £2 million is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of MEL.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
There is sufficient headroom for the MEL CGU so that management believe that no reasonable change in any of the above assumptions 
would cause the carrying value of MEL goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Group has approximately $2.6m (2014: $3.3m) of tax losses carried forward in the USA, which expire between 2022 and 2026 under 
current tax legislation. At year-end exchange rates these tax losses have a value of £1.8m (2014: £2.1m). The Group has only recognised 
£1.0m (2014: £1.0m) of these tax losses as a deferred tax asset representing what the Board considers to be a reasonable estimate of the 
expected US tax utilisation in the near future based on discounted projections. During the year losses of £0.5m were used and no 
additional losses were recognised. At a 35% tax rate these tax losses are £0.6m (2014: £0.7m) of which £0.3m has been recognised 
(2014: £0.4m). 91

21. Financial instruments and financial risk management
Policy
The Group’s and Company’s principal financial instruments include bank loans, cash and short-term deposits the main purpose of which 
is to provide finance for the Group’s and Company’s operations. Foreign exchange derivatives are used to help manage the Group’s and 
Company’s currency exposure. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s and Company’s policy that no trading 
in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s and Company’s financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign 
currency risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies 
have remained fundamentally unchanged throughout the year.
Credit risk
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are 
performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group and Company do not require collateral in respect of 
financial assets.
In 2015 and 2014, the Group and Company had credit insurance to mitigate this risk. However, the uninsured exposure as at 
31 December 2015 for the Group was £4.73m (2014: £3.39m) and for the Company was £2.76m (2014: £2.06m), so elements of 
risk remain.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by 
the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet. 93

The normal terms of trade are in the range 30–90 days from the end of the month of invoice.
The Group and the Company make provisions against trade and other receivables, such provisions being based on the previous credit 
history of the debtor and if the debtor is in receivership or liquidation.
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed on an individual basis, based on credit ratings 
and experience. Management believes adequate provision has been made for trade receivables.
Interest rate risk
The Group and the Company finance their operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The interest rate profile

The Group’s and Company’s objective is to maintain a balance of continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans 
and other financing facilities as applicable. The maturity profile of the Group’s and Company’s borrowings is shown above.
The Group and the Company have a short-term multi-currency bank overdraft facility of £4.9m, which is freely transferable. This facility  
is repayable on demand and is utilised by the Group and the Company under a cross-guarantee structure.
In December 2012 the Company took out a £3.5m mortgage, repayable over five years in equal quarterly instalments. This facility is 
secured over specific plant assets. At 31 December 2015 £1.5m of this mortgage was outstanding and £2m had been repaid. This loan 
has no major financial operating covenants. In December 2015 the Group took out an $8m mortgage, repayable over ten years in equal 
monthly instalments. This facility is secured over assets of Zotefoams Inc. Subsequent to year end a Revolving Credit Facility has been 
taken out and the bank overdraft facility reduced to £2m. Please refer to note 27 for further details. 
Cash flow forecasts are produced to monitor the expected cash flow requirements of the Group and the Company against the 
available facilities.
Foreign currency risk
The Group and the Company are exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, assets and liabilities which are denominated in  
a currency other than sterling. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the euro and the US dollar.
The euro and US dollar rates used in preparing the financial statements are as follows:
2015 2014
Average Closing Average Closing
Euro/sterling 1.38 1.36 1.25 1.29
US dollar/sterling 1.53 1.48 1.65 1.56
The Group and the Company hedge a proportion of their estimated cash exposure in respect of trade and other receivables, trade and 
other payables and forecast sales receipts and purchase payments. The Group and the Company use forward exchange contracts to 
hedge their foreign currency risk. As at 31 December 2015 these forward currency contracts covered approximately two thirds of the 
estimated net cash foreign exchange exposure for the euro for the next nine months and for the US dollar approximately two thirds of the 
estimated income statement exposure for the next twelve months.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the euro and the US dollar, the Group and the Company 
ensure that the net exposure is kept to a manageable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to 
address short-term imbalances. 95
Strategic Report Governance Financial

Where possible the Group tries to hold the majority of its cash and cash equivalent balances in the local currency of the respective  
entity or, for borrowings, in a currency which provides an offset, albeit often partial, against monetary working capital net assets in  
that currency.

Forecast transactions
The Group and the Company classify their forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecast transactions as cash flow hedges and 
state them at fair value. The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecast transactions at 31 December 2015 
was a net liability of £195,000 (2014: net liability of £149,000) comprising assets of £nil (2014: £43,000) and liabilities of £195,000 (2014: 
£192,000).
Recognised assets and liabilities
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and 
for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the Income Statement. Both the changes in fair value of the forward contracts 
and the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items are recognised as part of administrative expenses (see note 3).

Sensitivity analysis
In managing currency risks the Group and the Company aim to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on their earnings. Over the 
longer-term, however, changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on earnings.
Short-term fluctuations in interest rates are not hedged as the Group and the Company, at present, do not consider them material. At 
31 December 2015 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’s and the 
Company’s profit before tax by approximately £9,000 (2014: £ nil). At 31 December 2015 it is estimated that an increase of one 
percentage point in the value of sterling against the euro and US dollar would decrease the Group’s and the Company’s profit before tax 
by approximately £73,000 (2014: £44,000) before forward exchange contracts and £42,000 (2014: £15,000) after forward exchange 
contracts are included for the euro and £116,000 (2014: £117,000) for the US dollar before forward exchange contracts and £7,000 (2014: 
£91,000) after forward exchange contracts are included.
The Group and the Company have significant undertakings in the USA, Asia and elsewhere where revenue and expenses are 
denominated in US dollars. They also make a significant proportion of their sales to customers in continental Europe and these revenues 
are predominantly in euros, together with many of the raw materials purchased by the Company. It was the Group’s and the Company’s 
policy in 2015 to hedge the profit and loss of foreign currency cash flows of invoiced sales net of expected foreign currency expenditure. 
Hedging is achieved by the use of foreign currency contracts expiring in the month of expected cash flow.

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating fair values of financial instruments reflected in the 
table above. They are classified according to the following fair value hierarchy:
• Level 1: quoted process (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted process included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(ie as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The following table presents the Group’s and Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value at 31 December 2015.

Liabilities

The forward exchange contracts have been fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market.
Derivatives are valued at fair value using Barclays mid-market rate at the balance sheet date.
Trade and other receivables are valued at fair value which is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market 
rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material.
Cash and cash equivalents are valued at fair value which is estimated as its carrying value where cash is repayable on demand.
Interest-bearing borrowings are valued at fair value which is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash 
flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.
Capital management
The Group and the Company define the capital that they manage as the Group’s and the Company’s total equity. The Group’s and the 
Company’s policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and 
investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group and the Company have sufficient resources to be able to invest in future 
development and growth of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital which the Group and the Company define 
as profit before tax excluding exceptional items, divided by average net assets. Goodwill, intangible assets and any associated 
amortisation are excluded from this calculation. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. 
The Group and the Company are primarily financed by ordinary shares, borrowings and retained profits. 98

The above amounts apply to both the Group and the Company.
23. Post employment benefits
Defined benefit pension plans
The Company operates a UK registered trust-based pension scheme that provides defined benefits. Pension benefits are linked to the 
members’ final pensionable salaries and service at their retirement (or date of leaving if earlier). The Trustees are responsible for running 
the Scheme in accordance with the Scheme’s Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their powers. The Trustees of the Scheme are 
required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the Scheme. There is a requirement that one-third of the Trustees are 
nominated by the members of the Scheme.
There are two categories of pension scheme members:
• Deferred members: former and current employees of the Company
• Pensioner members: in receipt of pension.
The defined benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit outgo (allowing for revaluation to retirement for 
deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) and then discounting to the balance sheet date. The majority of 
benefits receive increases linked to inflation (subject to a cap of no more than 5% per annum). The valuation method is known as the 
Projected Unit Method. The approximate overall duration of the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2015 was 
20 years.
Since 1 October 2001 the Scheme has been closed to new members and from 31 December 2005 future accrual of benefits for existing 
members of the Scheme ceased.
Future funding obligation
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The last actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed 
by the Scheme Actuary for the Trustees as at 5 April 2014. This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of £2,500,000. In respect of the 
deficit in the Scheme as at 5 April 2014, the Company has agreed to pay £492,000 per annum until 5 April 2020. In addition, the 
Company will pay £168,000 per annum to cover administration expenses and premiums for death in service benefits. The Company 
therefore expects to pay £660,000 to the Scheme during the accounting year beginning 1 January 2016.
Risks
Through the Scheme, the Company is exposed to a number of risks:
• Asset volatility: the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields, 
however the Scheme invests significantly in equities and other growth assets. These assets are expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
• Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation, however this 
would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s bond holdings.
• Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Scheme’s defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation will result 
in a higher defined benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place). The majority of the Scheme’s assets are either 
unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase the deficit.
• Life expectancy: if Scheme members live longer than expected, the Scheme’s benefits will need to be paid for longer, increasing the 
Scheme’s defined benefit obligation.  99
Strategic Report Governance Financial
Zotefoams plc
Annual Report 2015
The Trustees and Company manage risks in the Scheme through the following strategies:
• Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the 
overall level of assets.
• Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
• Annuities: the Scheme holds insurance contracts to pay some members’ AVC benefits and spouses’ pensions. This removes 
investment, inflation and longevity risk for those members.
The Company has recognised all actuarial gains and losses immediately in Other Comprehensive Income. The initial results calculated as 
part of the formal actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2014 have been updated to 31 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary. The 
major assumptions used by the actuary were (in nominal terms) as follows:
As at 
31 December 
2015
As at 
31 December 
2014
Discount rate 3.8% 3.6%
RPI inflation (before retirement) 2.7% 2.9%
CPI inflation (before retirement) 1.7% 1.9%
Assumptions regarding future mortality are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each 
territory. These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65:
2015 2014 
For an individual aged 65 in 2015
 – Male 22.4 22.3
 – Female 24.4 24.3
At age 65 for an individual aged 45 in 2015
 – Male 24.1 24.0

Discount rate +/–0.5% pa –8%/+9%

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the other assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit 
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the 
projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised 
within the statement of financial position. The assets of the Scheme are invested as follows:

Other pension schemes
On 1 January 2006 a separate stakeholder scheme was set up for those employees who were originally in the closed defined benefit 
pension scheme. The contributions paid by the Company in 2015 were £390,000 (2014: £431,000).
In addition to this scheme, the Company operates a stakeholder scheme which is open to employees who joined after 1 October 2001. 
The contributions paid by the Company in 2015 were £228,000 (2014: £276,000).
The Company also operates another stakeholder scheme which is open to employees who joined after 1 March 2014. The contributions 
paid by the Company in 2015 were £76,000 (2014: £65,000).
For certain non UK based employees of the Company, the Company makes contributions into individual schemes. The contributions

For USA based employees, Zotefoams Inc. operates a 401(k) plan. The contributions paid by Zotefoams Inc. in 2015 were £52,000  
(2014: £54,000).
24. Share-based payments
The Company has share option schemes that entitle senior management personnel to purchase shares in the Company. Options are 
exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted closing market price of the Company’s shares on the day before or on the three 
dealing days before the option is granted. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years 
from the date of grant, the options expire. Depending on the circumstances options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the 
Group before the options vest.
In 2007 the Company introduced a LTIP scheme for senior management personnel. Shares are awarded in the Company and vest after 
three years to the extent performance conditions are met. Dependant on the circumstances awards are normally forfeited if the employee 
leaves the Group before the award vests.
In 2007 the Company introduced a Deferred Bonus Plan. Originally under the Plan executive bonuses over 40% of bonusable salary were 
held as deferred shares for three years. The awards made in March 2013 are still outstanding under this arrangement. In 2014 the 
Remuneration Committee amended the Deferred Bonus Plan for bonuses awarded since 2014, where 25% of executive bonuses are held 
as deferred shares for three years. Depending on the circumstances awards are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the award vests.
Details of the vesting conditions for the share, share option and LTIP awards are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 51.

The fair value received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. The 
estimate of fair value of the services received measured is based on a Black-Scholes model. The contractual life of the option (10 years)  
is used as an input into this model. No allowance is made for early leavers. 102

26. Accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other facts that are considered relevant. Actual amounts 
may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision only affects that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. 104

NOTES CONTINUED
26. Accounting estimates and judgements continued
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
disclosed below.
i) Property, plant and equipment
In relation to the Group’s property, plant and equipment, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using 
historical experiences and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved. Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine 
whether circumstances exist that could lead to a potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets. No circumstances have been 
identified to suggest that this is the case.
ii) Intangible assets
The determination of goodwill and intangible assets requires judgements made by the Directors. Goodwill is reviewed annually to assess 
the requirement for impairment. Other intangible assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether circumstances exist that 
could lead to the conclusion that the carrying value of such assets is not supportable. Such calculations require judgement relating to the 
appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in particular markets as well as short-term business performance. The 
Directors also draw upon experience in making these judgements.
iii) Pensions assumptions
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Group policy. The valuation is prepared by an independent 
qualified actuary but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for pension increases, inflation, the discount rate 
applied, investment returns and member longevity which underpin the valuations. Note 23 contains information about the assumptions 
relating to retirement benefit obligations.
Key judgements
i) Development costs
Under IAS 38 development costs must be capitalised when specified criteria have been met. Following a review of the Company’s 
research and development expenditure, because of the uncertainties which still exist on the development of new products, it was 
concluded that no material development costs met the IAS 38 criteria require for capitalisation and therefore all development costs have 
been expensed.
ii) Joint ventures
Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, management is required to assess the contractual terms of joint-venture agreements to determine the 
Group’s and Company’s rights and obligations under such agreements, to make a judgement on the type of arrangement such 
agreements constitute, and to apply the provisions of the accounting standard accordingly. It was concluded that the contracts entered 
into for a sales and a manufacturing joint-venture with INOAC Corporation constituted joint-venture agreements, and therefore these 
investments have been accounted for under the equity method.
27. Post balance sheet event
On 1 March 2016 the Group and Company reduced its overdraft facility from £4.9m to £2.0m and took out a four year multi-currency 
Revolving Credit facility (‘RCF’) for £8m secured on the property and book debts of the Company. This facility has financial covenants on 
net debt/EBITDA and EBIT/gross financing costs ratios. 105

Notes
(i) Pursuant to Part 13 of the Companies Act 2006 and to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended), only those members registered in the 
register of members of the Company at the close of business on 16 May 2016 (or if the AGM is adjourned, 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned AGM) shall be 
entitled to attend and vote at the AGM in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. In each case, changes to the register of members after such 
time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the AGM.
(ii) If you wish to attend the AGM in person please bring the accompanying attendance card and present this to the Company’s reception desk on arrival.
(iii) A member who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at the AGM may appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote instead of him. A member may appoint more than one proxy 
provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares (so a member must have more than one share to be able to appoint more than one proxy). A 
proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the AGM in order to represent you. A proxy must vote in accordance with any instructions given by the 
member by whom the proxy is appointed. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member from attending in person and voting at the AGM (although voting in person at the 
AGM will terminate the proxy appointment). A proxy form is enclosed or has been sent to you separately. The notes to the proxy form include instructions on how to appoint 
the Chairman of the AGM or another person as a proxy. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and in the notes to the proxy form. 
(iv) To be valid, a proxy form, and the original or duly certified copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or authenticated, should reach the 
Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor Services plc, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY, by no later than 10.00 am on 16 May 2016.
(v) The proxy form includes details on how to vote electronically. The notes to the proxy form also include instructions on how to appoint a proxy by using the CREST proxy 
appointment service. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice of AGM or in any related documents (including the proxy form) to communicate 
with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
(vi) In the case of joint holders of shares, the vote of the first named in the register of members who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the 
exclusion of the votes of other joint holders.
(vii) The following information is available at www.zotefoams.com: (1) the matters set out in this notice of AGM; (2) the total numbers of shares in the Company, and shares in 
each class, in respect of which members are entitled to exercise voting rights at the AGM; (3) the totals of the voting rights that members are entitled to exercise at the AGM, 
in respect of the shares of each class; and (4) members’ statements, members’ resolutions and members’ matters of business received by the Company after the first date 
on which notice of the AGM was given.
(viii) If you are a person who has been nominated by a member to enjoy information rights in accordance with Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006, notes (iii) to (v) above do 
not apply to you (as the rights described in these notes can only be exercised by members of the Company) but you may have a right under an agreement between you and 
the member by whom you were nominated to be appointed or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If you have no such right or do not wish to 
exercise it, you may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights.
(ix) A member that is a company or other organisation not having a physical presence cannot attend in person but can appoint someone to represent it. This can be done in one 
of two ways: either by the appointment of a proxy (described in notes (iii) to (v) above) or of a corporate representative. Members considering the appointment of a corporate 
representative should check their own legal position, the Company’s Articles of Association and the relevant provision of the Companies Act 2006.
(x) Members attending the AGM have the right to ask, and, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company must cause to be answered, any questions 
relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM.
(xi) As at the close of business on 5 April 2016, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 44,414,442 ordinary shares of 5 pence each. Each ordinary share carries the 
right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company. No ordinary shares were held in treasury and accordingly the total number of voting rights in the Company as at the 
close of business on 5 April 2016 is 44,414,442.
(xii) Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by shareholders of the Company under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company 
may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditors’ report and the 
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM; or (ii) any circumstance connected with the auditors of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous 
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholders 
requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a 
statement on a website under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s Auditors not later than the time when it makes the 
statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required under Section 527 of the 
Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
(xiii) Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and any of its subsidiary undertakings, deeds of indemnity in favour of the Directors and letters of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during the usual business hours on any weekday (Saturday, 
Sunday or public holidays excluded) from the date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM.
Explanatory notes to the resolutions 
Ordinary business 
Resolution 1 – Receiving the Annual Report and Accounts
Shareholders will be asked to receive the Company’s Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2015, as required by law.
Resolution 2 – Remuneration Report 
Resolution 2 seeks Shareholder approval of the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2015 which can be found on pages 38, and 39 to 56 (inclusive) of the 
Annual Report. 
The Company’s Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have audited those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that are required to be audited and their report may be 
found on pages 62 to 65 of the Annual Report.
The Shareholders approved the Remuneration Policy at the AGM held on 20 May 2015 and it became effective immediately. As there have been no changes to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, there is no need to seek further approval of it at this year’s AGM. The current intention is to submit the Remuneration Policy for Shareholder approval at the 
AGM scheduled for 2017, unless, in the interim, there are specific changes that require Shareholder approval. The Remuneration Policy, for ease of reference, has been included 
in the Annual Report on pages 38 to 56 (inclusive).
Resolution 3 – Declaration of dividend 
This resolution concerns the Company’s final dividend payment. The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 3.8 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2015 which, if approved, will be payable on 25 May 2016 to the shareholders on the register of members on 22 April 2016. 108

Resolution 4 concerns the election of G C McGrath, who was appointed to the Board since the last AGM was held on 13 May 2015.
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires all directors of FTSE 350 companies to stand for annual re-election. Whilst the Company is not within the FTSE 350, emerging best 
practice for listed companies is to follow this requirement and, therefore, the Board has decided for this year that all the Directors will stand for annual re-election. Resolutions 5 
to 9 concern the re-election of A C Bromfield, M-L Clayton, R J Clowes, S P Good and D B Stirling.
Biographies for the Directors are set out on pages 30 and 31 of the report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015. The Chairman having undertaken performance 
reviews of the Directors and the Non-Executive Directors of the Chairman, the Board is satisfied that each Director continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to 
the role and recommends that each Director should be elected or re-elected as the case may be.
Resolutions 10 and 11 – Re-appointment of Auditors and their remuneration
Resolution 10 concerns the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s Auditors, to hold office until the conclusion of the Company’s next general 
meeting where accounts are laid.
Resolution 11 authorises the Audit Committee to determine the Auditors’ remuneration.
Special Business 
Resolution 12 – Power to allot shares 
This resolution grants the Directors authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company and other relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £740,240, 
representing approximately one-third (33.33%) of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 29 March 2016, being the latest practicable date 
before publication of this notice. In addition, in accordance with the latest institutional guidelines issued by the Investment Management Association (‘IMA’), paragraph (b) of 
resolution 12 grants the Directors authority to allot further equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,480,481, representing approximately two-thirds (66.67%) of the 
nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 5 April 2016, being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. This additional authority 
may be only applied to fully pre-emptive rights issues.
The intention of the authority granted pursuant to paragraph (b) of resolution 12 is to preserve maximum flexibility and if the Directors do exercise this authority, they intend to 
follow best practice as regards its use.
The Company does not currently hold any shares as treasury shares within the meaning of Section 724 of the Companies Act 2006 (‘Treasury Shares’). 
The Directors do not have any present intention of exercising the authorities conferred by resolution 12 but they consider it desirable that the specified amount of authorised but 
unissued share capital is available for issue so that they can more readily take advantage of possible opportunities.
Unless revoked, varied or extended, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company or 30 June 2017, whichever is the earlier.
Resolution 13 – Authority to allot shares disregarding pre-emption rights 
This resolution authorises the Directors in certain circumstances to allot equity securities for cash other than in accordance with the statutory pre-emption rights (which require a 
company to offer all allotments for cash first to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings). The relevant circumstances are either where the allotment takes place in 
connection with a rights issue or the allotment is limited to a maximum nominal amount of £222,072, representing approximately 10% of the nominal value of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company as at 5 April 2016 being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice. Unless revoked, varied or extended, this authority will expire at 
the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company or 30 June 2017, whichever is the earlier.
The Board confirms that it will only allot shares representing more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company for cash, where that allotment is in connection 
with an acquisition or specified capital investment (within the meaning given in the Pre–Emption Group’s Statement of Principles) which is announced contemporaneously with 
the allotment, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
The Directors consider that the power proposed to be granted by this resolution is necessary to retain flexibility, although they do not have any intention at the present time of 
exercising such power.
Resolution 14 – Authority to purchase shares (market purchases)
This resolution authorises the Board to make market purchases of up to 4,441,444 ordinary shares (representing approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary shares as 
at 5 April 2016, being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice). Shares so purchased may be cancelled or held as Treasury Shares. The authority will expire at 
the end of the next AGM of the Company or 30 June 2017, whichever is the earlier. The Directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent AGMs.
The minimum price that can be paid for an ordinary share is 5 pence being the nominal value of an ordinary share. The maximum price that can be paid is 5% over the average of 
the middle market prices for an ordinary share, derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, for the five business days immediately before the day on which 
the share is contracted to be purchased.
The Directors intend to exercise this right only when, in light of the market conditions prevailing at the time and taking into account all relevant factors (for example, the effect on 
earnings per share), they believe that such purchases are in the best interests of the Company and shareholders generally. The overall position of the Company will be taken into 
account before deciding upon this course of action. The decision as to whether any such shares bought back will be cancelled or held in treasury will be made by the Directors 
on the same basis at the time of the purchase.
As at 5 April 2016, being the latest practicable date before publication of this notice, there were outstanding awards under the Company’s long-term incentive schemes in respect 
of 549,428 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company representing 1.24% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary 
shares were exercised in full, such options would represent 1.37% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. 109

Resolution 15 – Notice period for general meetings
Under the Companies Act 2006, a listed company must give at least 21 days’ notice of its general meetings. However, this Act enables general meetings (other than AGMs) to be 
held on shorter notice of not less than 14 days provided the shareholders have given their consent at the previous AGM or a general meeting held since the last AGM. Resolution 
15 seeks such approval similar to the resolution that was passed last year. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, when it is intended that a similar 
resolution will be proposed. The Directors will always endeavour to give as much notice as possible of general meetings, but would like to have the flexibility to call a general 
meeting on the shorter permitted notice period for time sensitive matters that are clearly in the shareholders’ interests. If the authority is used, the Company will offer the ability, 
as required by the Companies Act 2006, to vote electronically.
Recommendation
The Directors consider that the proposals being put to the shareholders at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and of the shareholders as a whole. 
Accordingly, the Directors recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions set out in the Notice of the AGM, as they intend to do in respect of their own 
beneficial holdings of ordinary shares. 110

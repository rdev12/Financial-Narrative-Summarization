Strategic Report / Chairman’s Statement
Gemfields continues to go 
from strength to strength with 
the addition of a significant 
new revenue stream from our 
ruby operation in Mozambique 
to the solid foundation of our 
Kagem emerald operations 
in Zambia.
Chairman’s Statement
Dear Shareholder,
I am delighted to update you on a truly 
tremendous year for Gemfields. Your 
Company generated record revenues 
of US$160.1 million and EBITDA 
of US$59.3 million. During the year, 
Gemfields has continued to deliver on its 
strategy of shaping and consolidating the 
coloured gemstone industry, demonstrated 
convincingly by the addition of a 
significant new revenue stream from our 
ruby operations in Mozambique.
While Gemfields today enjoys an 
unrivalled presence in the international 
coloured gemstone industry, the 
opportunity for sustained growth is 
significant. We have built a successful 
emerald business with our world class 
Kagem mine in Zambia (which has 
provided an excellent platform to further 
our vision for the coloured gemstone 
sector globally) and the addition of rubies 
from Mozambique serves to amplify 
our position as the leading supplier of 
responsibly sourced coloured gemstones.
In June 2014, we announced the results 
of our first auction of rough rubies and 
corundum extracted from our 75% owned 
Montepuez deposit in Mozambique. I 
would like to commend our team, and that 
of our 25% partner Mwiriti, for having 
developed Montepuez from a greenfield 
project to an operational and revenue 
generating asset in a little over two years. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 11
Strategic Report / Chairman’s Statement
Gemfields Mozambican
ruby rough
The inaugural auction, which raised 
US$33.5 million, increased our confidence 
in, and understanding of, the ruby 
market and the value of our current 
ruby production profile. The auction 
opened the door to a new audience 
of coloured gemstone purchasers and 
confirmed the effectiveness of our ‘first-
of-its-kind’ comprehensive grading and 
sorting framework which was initially 
established for emeralds and suitably 
adapted for rubies. The successful use of 
this framework, together with feedback 
received from auction participants, marked 
a meaningful endorsement of our ruby 
strategy and we are hopeful that the 
ruby market will follow the trajectory we 
observed when our grading and auction 
methodologies were first deployed in the 
emerald market.
While much work remains to be done in 
building a full scale mining operation, 
Montepuez is a noteworthy achievement 
and we look forward to our second 
auction of rough ruby and corundum 
which is scheduled to take place before 
31 December 2014.
Throughout the past year, demand for 
our responsibly sourced rough emeralds 
continued to grow, in tandem with the 
upward trend in achieved per carat prices. 
In February 2014, our higher quality 
gemstones attained an average price of 
US$59.31 per carat, a 10% increase over 
the previous higher quality auction. 
In November 2013, our lower quality 
gemstones sold for an average price of 
US$3.32 per carat which was a 27% 
increase on the previous highest price per 
carat achieved at a lower quality auction. 
We generated US$110 million from 
emerald and beryl sales during the year, 
derived from auctions of directly-mined 
as well as traded material, and including 
direct sales of our lowest grades of beryl.
During the year, our Kagem operation 
achieved a historic milestone and paid 
its first ever dividend. Total dividends 
amounting to US$16 million were paid 
during the year, of which US$4 million 
was paid to the Government of the 
Republic of Zambia as a 25% shareholder 
in Kagem. We are delighted to share the 
success of this operation with our host 
country and business partner.
The Company continues to evaluate 
a number of gemstone acquisition 
opportunities to complement our stated 
red, blue and green ‘traffic light’ of 
coloured gemstones strategy, and we were 
pleased to announce in September 2014 
our move into Sri Lankan sapphires. This 
strategy runs in parallel with the organic 
growth programme, both in terms of the 
exploration and underground mining 
potential at Kagem, and the scaling up of 
activities at Montepuez.
Last but by no means least, the 
incorporation of Fabergé within the 
Gemfields family to complete our ‘mine 
and market’ strategy has given us a more 
meaningful footprint within the high-
end luxury goods market. Following last 
year’s internal review, we have focused 
on restructuring Fabergé’s operations 
and implementing an integrated, global 
strategic plan. I am pleased to report 
that further progress has been made inter 
alia with key appointments, product 
development and marketing, and that 
Gemfields is already reaping direct and 
indirect benefits, as is evidenced by the 
increased demand and sales prices achieved 
for our emeralds and rubies and improved 
sales margins within Fabergé itself.
On behalf of the Board, I would once 
again like to sincerely thank all of our 
employees, host countries, project partners 
and advocates across our operations for 
their support, commitment and hard 
work. The 2014 financial year has been 
remarkably exciting and successful. I look 
forward to reporting on the future progress 
and prosperity of your Company.

The coloured gemstone industry continued 
to demonstrate impressive progress. 
The United Nations Commodity Trade 
database shows that worldwide imports 
of emeralds, rubies and sapphires reached 
US$3.2 billion in 2013, a 19% increase 
from the US$2.7 billion reported in 2012. 
In 2013, the world’s top coloured gemstone 
cutting, polishing and treatment centres 
– India and Thailand – reported growth 
of 311% and 31% respectively in the value 
of exports of loose emeralds, rubies and 
sapphires. The globally renowned high 
jewellery manufacturing countries of 
France, Italy and Switzerland increased 
their imports of these three gemstones by 
10%, 36% and 22% respectively.
This trend is fundamentally driven by 
rising consumer demand for coloured 
gemstones, particularly in the United 
States, Europe and China. Integrated 
marketing, aided by ever-increasing 
transparency and consistency of supply, 
has advanced consumer awareness and 
understanding of coloured gemstones, 
bolstering consumer confidence 
and making coloured gemstones an 
increasingly popular choice.
Emeralds 
Zambia, Colombia and Brazil are today 
equally important sources of emerald 
supply with each accounting for around 
one third of global supply. Unlike 
Colombia and Brazil (where the emerald 
trade is mostly dominated by smaller-
scale and artisanal miners), Zambia sees 
around 70% of the declared value of its 
emerald exports from a single mine, being 
Gemfields’ Kagem mine. As noted by the 
Gem Guide (an independent provider of 
gem market information), emerald prices 
have been on the rise, especially for finer 
Zambian material where supply has been 
more consistent. In our estimation, this 
demand will remain robust in the coming 
year as jewellers and manufacturers 
focus on reliability of supply as a key 
determining factor in choosing suppliers.
Rubies and sapphires 
Rubies and sapphires are from the same 
mineral, corundum and are as a result often 
found in the same localities. Myanmar 
produces both rubies and sapphires of 
very high quality, while Sri Lanka and 
Madagascar – the world’s major sources 
for blue and fancy sapphires are also 
known to host ruby deposits. However, 
as noted by the Gem Guide, ruby and 
sapphire production in the past few years 
has declined in the better known deposits. 
New deposits such as Mozambique have 
the potential to offset these reductions. 
Since the successful launch of Montepuez 
Ruby Mining by Gemfields some 1.8 
million carats of rubies and corundum 
have reached the market in a transparent 
and ethical manner. Following the JCK 
Las Vegas gemstone and jewellery show 
in June 2014, the trade has witnessed a 
30% increase in the price of Mozambican 
ruby and this trend is expected to continue 
as Gemfields, replicating the model 
successfully deployed in the emerald 
sector, establishes reliable and consistent 
ruby supply to the expanding market.
Other gemstones
As emeralds, rubies and sapphires become 
increasingly desirable they also drive 
demand for other coloured gemstones. 
Aggregate global imports for other 
gemstones (excluding diamonds, emeralds, 
rubies and sapphires) grew an impressive 
89% from 2012 to 2013. Amethyst is 
one of these gemstones. Kariba, which 
Gemfields has a 50% interest, continues to 
account for a material proportion of global 
amethyst production. Synonymous with 
the colour of royalty, amethyst’s desirable 
natural colour continues to garner favour 
given their relative hardness, cost, aesthetic 
variety and global opportunities for 
production and supply.

Strategic Report / Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
2014 has been a landmark 
year for Gemfields as we 
continue to deliver on our goal 
to be the global coloured 
gemstone champion and a 
leading performer within the 
resource sector.
I am pleased to report on a stellar year in 
which Gemfields has delivered impressively 
on its goals at both the mining and 
marketing ends of the business.
One of the most pleasing and significant 
achievements of the year has been our 
rapidly developing ruby business in 
Mozambique. Within two years of 
completing the acquisition of these licences 
we have developed the deposit into a large 
bulk sampling operation which produced 
6.5 million carats of ruby and corundum 
in 2014. This takes the total ruby and 
corundum extracted at Montepuez since 
the commencement of bulk sampling to 
8.4 million carats.
Montepuez is believed to be the most 
significant recently discovered ruby 
deposit in the world. Given the size of 
the licence area, Gemfields has continued 
with its strategy of focusing on building 
our understanding of the various high 
priority areas across the deposit. Towards 
the end of the third quarter of the 2014 
financial year our focus shifted to the new 
Mugloto prospect. The increase in quality 
and quantity of high value gemstones from 
this prospect justified a short-term shift 
in focus and some restructuring of the 
logistical processes involved. As a result, 
Montepuez saw fewer carats produced in 
the second half of the financial year, but 
this reduction was more than offset by the 
value of the higher quality gems recovered. 
The current bulk sampling programme 
allows Gemfields to analyse the cost, 
volume and value characteristics of the 
various ore bodies in the licence area. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 15
Strategic Report / Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Following an 18-month sorting and 
grading programme, Gemfields offered 
rubies for the first time via its proven 
auction platform. The successful auction, 
held in Singapore, comprised high and low 
quality ruby and corundum and generated 
total sales of US$33.5 million. A total 
of 1.82 million carats were sold yielding 
an overall average value of US$18.43 per 
carat. This was a landmark achievement 
signifying the moment Gemfields became 
a producer and purveyor of precious 
coloured gemstones.
At our Kagem emerald mine in Zambia, 
production of emeralds and beryl dropped 
from 30.0 million carats in 2013 to 20.2 
million carats this year. The reduction 
was primarily the result of high rainfall 
and the grade volatility characteristic of 
gemstone deposits. Kagem has seen its 
annual grade vary between 205 to 478 
carats per tonne of ore during the last four 
financial years. Overall, operations at the 
mine remain in line with expectations, and 
Kagem is in a strong position to benefit 
from an anticipated improvement in the 
grade in the coming year. Our objective, 
subject of course to the grade, remains to 
produce approximately 25 million carats 
annually. Kagem’s potential for organic 
growth remains another opportunity to 
generate enhanced project returns. Current 
operating parameters and cost versus 
revenue considerations favour, for the short 
to medium term, an emphasis on opencast 
operations over underground mining in 
our main Chama pit. From an exploration 
perspective, we continue to evaluate the 
nearby Fibolele and Libwente occurrences 
on the Kagem licence. Libwente having 
yielded encouraging early results, has been 
the subject of accelerated analysis and will 
see a detailed bulk sampling programme 
carried out in the coming year.
Our progress to date is clearly evidenced 
by both the success of our auctions and 
the synergistic marketing campaigns 
delivered by both Fabergé and Gemfields. 
While much is still to be done, Fabergé 
has undergone a successful transition post 
acquisition, similar to Gemfields’ early 
developmental processes at both Kagem 
and Montepuez, whereby our initial 
efforts are focused on containing costs, 
increasing productivity, understanding 
our operating environment and acquiring 
and supporting the right people within the 
team to assist in delivering on our strategy 
of establishing Fabergé as the ‘go-to’ 
jeweller for discerning high-end consumers 
and a champion of colour.
Robert Benvenuto was appointed as 
President and Chief Operating Officer 
of Fabergé in October 2013 to provide 
leadership and strengthen the management 
team by providing direction and a 
focus on strategy throughout Fabergé. 
Implementation of Fabergé’s integrated 
strategic plan is well underway with 
the aim of realising Fabergé’s largely 
unexploited global growth potential.
Robert previously spent 13 years at Harry 
Winston where he served as Chief Finance 
Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Co-
Chief Executive Officer. This experience 
meant that, despite internal overhauls 
and restructuring, Fabergé’s net operating 
cost to the Gemfields Group was within 
budget, supported by a pleasing increase 
in sales margins. New products were well 
received by consumers across key markets, 
a fundamental litmus test for the creation 
of a solid platform for future growth.
Our strategy remains that of becoming 
the global ‘Coloured Gemstone 
Champion’, focused on emeralds, rubies, 
sapphires and other selected gemstones. 
We continue to evaluate a number 
of potential acquisitions, in keeping 
with our track record of identifying, 
acquiring and investing in undeveloped 
or underdeveloped deposits. We are very 
pleased with our recently announced Sri 
Lankan joint venture and hope in the 
medium term to add Sri Lankan sapphires 
to our gemstone auctions.
I am increasingly confident that we 
will achieve our global ambitions in 
the short to medium term. This belief 
is underpinned by the impressive track 
record our team members have established 
over the past five years and the expanding 
portfolio of world class assets. I look 
forward to continuing our current 
growth trajectory and being able to share 
this success with our team members, 
shareholders and stakeholders alike in the 
years ahead.

Strategic Report / Business Model
Business Model
Our business model is to create shareholder value by identifying 
and investing in undeveloped or underdeveloped coloured 
gemstone assets internationally. We use our unrivalled operational 
expertise in the coloured gemstone sector to grow these assets, 
typically in partnership with the host government or appropriate 
local partners. We do not pursue comprehensive vertical 
integration. Rather, our ‘mine and market’ strategy means we 
focus on both ends of the value chain, representing the two most 
profitable segments.
Our pioneering auction platform has changed the face of the 
coloured gemstones sector, delivering a key tenet of our business 
model, bringing a consistent supply of responsibly sourced 
coloured gemstones, carefully graded according to our proprietary 
grading systems, to our customers. This distribution platform 
is complemented by determined marketing and promotional 
campaigns to further confidence in, and awareness of, our exciting 
and fast-growing sector.
Gemfields is the world’s leading supplier of 
responsibly sourced coloured gemstones. But we 
prefer to think of ourselves as more than just a 
mining company. We are pioneers at an exciting 
new frontier where mining, marketing, 
exploration and ethics meet.

Our team has a proven track-record of 
identifying high quality gemstone deposits 
that offer potential to become large 
scale operations.
We have invested and continue to reinvest 
significant amounts of capital into key 
resources. We create value by developing 
our assets into large scale operations and 
by applying our intellectual capital.
We safely and efficiently develop our 
mines for long-term value creation, 
aiming to deliver projects on time 
and within budget in what are often 
challenging conditions. From exploration, 
through development and into production 
we continue to improve the quality of our 
assets and place at the heart of each our 
focus on safety and sustainability.
We are the global leader in repositioning 
the coloured gemstone industry alongside 
other luxury goods. Our marketing is 
underpinned by our reliable supply of 
high quality, well graded rough gemstones 
to our customers through auctions and 
trade sales. Leveraging the Group’s 
ownership of Fabergé, potentially one of 
the greatest luxury brands of all time, 
to not only promote Gemfields’ position 
as the leading supplier of ethically 
sourced gemstones, but also with a view 
to stimulating increased creativity and

Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Kagem Mining Limited, Zambia
Kagem is the world’s single largest emerald 
mine and is 75% owned by Gemfields, 
with the remaining 25% owned by the 
Government of the Republic of Zambia. 
Kagem is located in the Ndola Rural 
Emerald Restricted Area and lies south 
of Kitwe and west of Ndola in Zambia’s 
Copperbelt Province. Kagem’s licence area 
comprises almost 41 square kilometres and 
it supplies approximately 20% of global 
emerald production.
Mining
During the year, Kagem completed 
its third high wall pushback and has 
commenced its fourth in order to extend 
the pit size by a further 75 metres at 
the south-eastern edge of the Chama 
pit and to open up new areas of ore for 
future production. The work is being 
carried out by both in-house teams and 
a third-party contractor. A 17-month 
programme has been agreed with the 
contractor, ending in September 2015. 
The pushback programme is projected to 
deliver approximately four years of open 
pit ore production and seeks to increase 
the overall rate of ore mining as well as 
improve flexibility in the areas which can 
be mined at any given time.
Reasonable volumes of ore and gemstone 
production were achieved in the first  
half of the year while high rainfall, grade 
volatility and delays in initiating the 
fourth phase of the pushback programme 
negatively impacted on the full year 
mining results. Gemstone production  
for the year decreased by 32.7% to 20.2 
million carats of emerald and beryl  
(2013: 30.0 million carats) and grade 
decreased by 10.6% to 253 carats per 
tonne (2013: 283 carats per tonne).
During the year, 7.3 million tonnes of 
waste and talc-magnetite schist (“TMS”) 
were mined (2013: 9.5 million tonnes), 
as were 80,000 tonnes of reaction zone 
(ore) (2013: 106,000 tonnes), yielding a 
stripping ratio of 92:1 (2013: 90:1).
Total cash operating costs were US$27.4 
million (2013: US$32.2 million). Unit 
production costs were US$0.91 per carat 
(2013: US$0.55 per carat). On a cash basis 
unit production costs were US$1.33 per 
carat (2013: US$1.07 per carat). Cash rock 
handling unit costs increased by 10.4% 
to US$3.70 per tonne (2013: US$3.35 
per tonne).
The trial underground mining project 
achieved total linear development of 157.4 
metres (2013: 300.4 metres). Four 
additional small (10 metres by 10 metres) 
stopes were developed although the  
ground conditions proved challenging.  
The creation of back-filled support pillars 
has successfully supported the roof but this 
is time-consuming given the current scale 
and nature of the project. A total of 2,635 
tonnes of ore were extracted (2013: 4,918 
tonnes) producing 184,935 carats (2013: 
381,395 carats) at a grade of 70.2 carats 
per tonne (2013: 77.5 carats per tonne).  
An experienced underground project 
manager has been appointed and is 
expected to join the operation in  
October 2014. 
With proven resource available in the 
Chama pit, the continued viability of open 
pit operations and robust emerald prices, 
Kagem has the flexibility to extend the 
open pit operation with further pushbacks 
and is likely in the short term to continue 
underground mining only on a trial basis. 
During the year, a total of US$2.9 million 
(2013: US$4.6 million) was invested in 
new mining and ancillary equipment, as 
well as in improving Kagem’s facilities 
and infrastructure.
Kagem’s annual production performance is 
summarised in the table below:

Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Processing
As part of the ongoing efficiency drive 
at Kagem, the washing plant and its 
security arrangements were upgraded. 
This included optimisation of the process 
flows and resizing of the ore most likely 
to contain higher value gemstones. The 
building of a walled sorting facility has 
resulted in a better working environment 
including improved levels of ventilation, 
lighting and noise, resulting in fewer 
distractions and better overall control. 
These improvements have also resulted in 
fewer breakdowns, reduced maintenance 
costs, more efficient gemstone picking 
from the belts, enhanced security and 
improved gemstone recoveries.
Safety and environment
Mining operations inherently impact 
on the environment and pose a risk 
to the health and safety of employees. 
Kagem prides itself on its ability to 
produce emeralds that are mined in an 
ethical, transparent and safe manner 
with minimised impact on the natural 
environment. In April 2014, the 
Mines Safety Department of Zambia 
awarded Kagem a safety certificate 
recognising 3.1 million shifts free of 
reportable injuries.
Geology and exploration 
Our mineral resource strategy focuses on 
identifying the best possible opportunities 
within our mining licence for assessment 
by way of bulk sampling.
While the Chama pit continues to be the 
main focus with respect to our current 
production activities and contains the 
bulk of the known resources, we continue 
to look for future development projects 
within the Kagem licence and are 
committed to our resource replenishment 
programme. This has included 13,339 
metres of diamond core drilling from 
140 boreholes within the Libwente area, 
located three kilometres north-east of the 
Chama pit.
Exploration at Libwente has established 
the continuity of the Mesoproterozoic 
Muva sequences, favourably intruded 
by pegmatites, quartz and quartz-
tourmaline veins, all indicating high 
levels of potential. The Libwente bulk 
sampling programme has the scope to 
effectively extend the Fwaya Fwaya-Pirala 
belt (home of the Chama pit) in a 
north-easterly direction.
At Fibolele, bulk sampling first 
commenced in September 2012 with 
a 300-metre wide pit having been 
opened along an ultramafic strike 
length of 350 metres. A second phase 
was initiated in October 2013 and 
has benefitted from a low stripping 
ratio (40:1) and the identification of 
gemstone-producing structures.
During the year, we also tested a number 
of conceptual regional geophysical targets 
by diamond core drilling, identifying 
targets within Fibolele East, Dabwisa 
and Kanchule with 5,403 metres of 
core from a further 57 boreholes. We 
remain optimistic about the potential 
for additional mineable sites within the 
Kagem licence. 
Our mining and exploration activities 
are augmented by the utilisation of 
in-depth geophysical and petrographic 
studies combined with state-of-the-art 3D 
inversion and voxel modelling, all of which 
is amalgamated into our 3D mine plan.
Sorting, rough sales and auctions
Gemfields typically offers its rough 
emerald production to selected market 
participants by way of sealed bid auctions 
where all gemstones tendered are certified 
by Gemfields as natural, untreated and of 
a specific origin. Many of the world’s top 
gemstone houses and lapidaries are invited 
to attend these events.
During this financial year, Kagem held 
three emerald auctions and completed one 
out-of-auction direct sale of material which 
previously failed to sell at auction.
The first auction, held in Lusaka in 
Zambia in July 2013, was an auction 
of predominantly higher quality rough 
emeralds. All of the 583,448 carats placed 
on offer were sold, generating revenues 
of US$31.5 million. The auction yielded 
an overall average price of US$54.00 per 
carat, the highest unit value achieved at 
any auction at that time, and representing 
a 26% increase over the previous high of 
US$42.71 per carat (achieved at the July 
2011 Singapore auction).
The second auction, held in Lusaka in 
November 2013, was of predominantly 
lower quality rough emerald and beryl, 
and saw 4.94 million carats being sold, 
representing by far the bulk of the value 
offered. The auction generated record 
aggregate lower quality auction revenues of 
US$16.4 million. The auction also yielded 
an overall average value of US$3.32 per 
carat, the highest unit value achieved at 
any Gemfields auction of predominantly 
lower quality material, and represented 
a 27% increase over the previous high of 
US$2.61 per carat (achieved in the June 
2012 Jaipur auction).

Kagem, Zambia Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 25
Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Security
Kagem maintains a two-tier security 
system to provide the necessary checks and 
balances, combining Kagem’s own internal 
security personnel with mobile units of the 
Zambian police.
The security environment is constantly 
evolving given changes to workflows 
and production scenarios. Security 
measures are continuously reviewed and 
updated in order to minimise the security 
risk. By staying abreast of the latest 
technological developments, Kagem is able 
to consistently improve its surveillance 
technology, an important deterrent against 
pilferage and pivotal in ensuring the 
safeguarding of assets.
Key security initiatives implemented 
during the year include the construction 
of a walled picking-belt facility at the 
washing plant and extensive upgrades 
to the CCTV infrastructure both there 
and at the sort house. These measures 
have yielded considerable improvements, 
but with the unfortunate and associated 
consequence of an increase in the number 
of apprehensions.
Security monitoring in the main Chama 
pit has also been improved with the 
implementation of a new CCTV torch-
camera system and migration to IP-based 
cameras to ensure a wider field of view and 
more comprehensive imaging, all of which 
has markedly improved pit and production 
monitoring efficiencies. GPS tracking and 
monitoring systems have also been fitted to 
some of the vehicles in our fleet.
Dividends
During the year, Kagem declared and 
paid total dividends of US$16 million 
with the Zambian government receiving 
US$4 million given its 25% interest. The 
first dividend, paid in December 2013, is 
believed to be both the first ever dividend 
paid by Kagem in its 29 year history and 
the first such payment ever to be made 
to the Zambian government from any 
gemstone operation in the country.
The dividend payments are attributed to 
the turnaround strategy initiated at Kagem 
following Gemfields’ acquisition of a 
75% interest in June 2008, prior to which 
Kagem had intermittently reported losses 
and had annual revenues of approximately 
US$9 million.
Gemfields’ traded emerald auctions
Gemfields first offered traded emeralds at 
the Singapore auction held in July 2011. 
The traded emeralds were first offered 
to our auction attendees along with 
our directly-mined gemstones. Traded 
emeralds and beryl were also offered at 
subsequent Gemfields auctions held in 
November 2011 (Jaipur), March 2012 
(Singapore) and June 2012 (Jaipur).
Since April 2013, gemstones mined by 
Gemfields at Kagem have been offered 
exclusively in Lusaka, Zambia. On the 
other hand, traded emeralds and beryl 
have been offered on a standalone basis in 
auctions held in Jaipur in September 2013 
and May 2014.
The first standalone traded emerald 
auction held in Jaipur, India in September 
2013 saw 145,952 carats of traded rough 
emeralds (predominantly of higher quality 
material) being sold, generating gross 
auction revenues of US$8.5 million. The 
emeralds sold at the auction comprised 
emeralds obtained by Gemfields in the 
open market from various sources and 
yielded a robust average price of US$58.00 
per carat.
The second standalone traded emerald 
auction was held in Jaipur, India in 
May 2014. The emeralds sold were of 
predominantly higher qualities and 
comprised both Zambian and Brazilian 
emeralds obtained by Gemfields in the 
open market from various sources. The 
auction saw 0.764 million carats of 
traded emeralds placed on offer, with 
0.268 million carats (representing the 
majority of the value offered) being sold, 
and generating gross auction revenues of 
US$13.5 million. Beauty by nature

The specific auction mix and the quality 
characteristics of the lots offered at the 
traded auctions can vary quite considerably 
from those auctions made up solely of 
lots derived from Kagem’s directly mined 
production. As a result, direct comparisons 
between traded auctions and Kagem 
auctions cannot be reliably drawn.
Montepuez Ruby Mining 
Limitada, Mozambique
The Montepuez ruby deposit is located in 
the north-east of Mozambique in the Cabo 
Delgado province. Covering approximately 
33,600 hectares, it is believed to be the 
most significant recently discovered ruby 
deposit in the world. The ruby mining 
area, lies approximately two hours by car 
from the coastal town of Pemba, which has 
modern airport and port infrastructure.
Gemfields owns a 75% interest in 
Montepuez Ruby Mining Limitada 
(“Montepuez”) which holds a 25 year 
mining and exploration licence over 
the area, granted by the Government of 
Mozambique in November 2011.
Mining
Bulk sampling commenced in August 
2012, continues to increase in scale and 
is delivering consistently pleasing results. 
The bulk sampling programme has 
allowed Montepuez to analyse the specific 
characteristics of the various ore bodies in 
parallel with identifying key target sites for 
future large scale mining operations.
Montepuez’s bulk sampling activities 
during the year were initially directed at 
the Maninge Nice, Central and Glass-A 
areas. However, towards the end of the 
third quarter and early in the fourth 
quarter of the 2014 financial year, there 
was a shift in focus toward the newly 
discovered Mugloto area where the overall 
grade is significantly lower but the quality 
of rubies mined is markedly higher.  
As a result, Montepuez saw a reduction  
in the volume of carats produced during 
the second half of the financial year, but 
with a quality-driven increase in overall 
value. As our geological understanding 
continues to improve, Gemfields is 
reasonably confident of its ability to 
manage the production volumes and values 
identified to date, and which may see 
Montepuez become Gemfields’ key 
operating asset.
Approximately 6.5 million carats of ruby 
and corundum were extracted during the 
year (2013: 1.9 million carats). This takes 
the total ruby and corundum extracted 
at Montepuez since the commencement 
of bulk sampling to 8.4 million carats. 
Total rock handling during the year was 
1.6 million tonnes (2013: 0.09 million 
tonnes), made up of 0.4 million tonnes of 
ore and 1.2 million tonnes of waste. Total 
cash operating costs were US$10.9 million 
(2013: US$5.9 million).

Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Operational and Financial Review continued
• A total of 1.6 million tonnes were 
excavated from the Maninge Nice, 
Glass-A, Washplant West, Pit 25 and 
Mugloto areas. This included 1.2 
million tonnes of waste, and 408,619 
tonnes of ore at a stripping ratio of 2.9.
• Approximately 158,000 tonnes of ore 
were processed by the washing plant 
with the highest recoveries achieved 
from the gravel beds of Maninge Nice 
and Mugloto at an average grade of 
43 carats per tonne.
Montepuez’s total capitalised mining  
costs (excluding capitalised infrastructure 
costs) for the year totalled US$4.2 million 
(2013: US$1.5 million). Total investment 
in property, plant and equipment  
for the year was US$6.0 million  
(2013: US$2.7 million).
Cumulative project expenditure from 
inception until 30 June 2014, including 
all acquisition, capital and operating costs, 
stood at approximately US$34 million.
Geology and exploration
Montepuez’s mining area comprises rocks 
ranging from granitic to amphibolitic in 
composition, with scattered quartzite and 
marble occurrences. The rocks are highly 
folded into tight and isoclinal folds of 
all scales, subsequently cut by a number 
of primarily north-east to south-west 
trending shear zones.
To date, rubies from Montepuez differ 
geologically from many of the rubies 
traditionally available in the international 
market in that they are amphibolite  
related rather than marble or basalt related. 
The rubies are found in both alluvial 
and eluvial deposits, with the occurrence 
of primary (in situ) rubies within the 
amphibolite recorded to date at depths 
exceeding 30 metres in places.
An extensive exploration programme 
across the entire Montepuez licence 
area has been initiated with a view to 
generating a solid baseline geological 
map with sufficient subsurface data to 
understand the extent and trend of the 
amphibolites, the gravel bed thickness and 
its distribution and indicative grade.
Gemfields is targeting completion of its 
first JORC-compliant resource and reserve 
statement for Montepuez by 30 June 2016.
The exploration programme involves 
pitting, diamond core drilling (being 
carried out by two in-house core drill rigs) 
and auger drilling. The latter is carried out 
under contract by Equator Drilling based 
in Mozambique and focuses specifically 
on the Maninge Nice and Mugloto/
Ntorro areas.
The auger drilling programme was 
initiated on 5 June 2014 and it is envisaged 
that a total of 25,000 metres will be 
drilled across the central part of the 
Montepuez licence. Approximately 5,000 
metres have been drilled subsequent to 
the reporting period and the drilling 
programme is expected to be completed by 
December 2015.
The study has already delineated 
significant paleo-channel deposits with 
occurrences of ruby mineralisation 
within the Mugloto area and these 
have subsequently been proven by bulk 
sampling. Other various potential areas, 
each with gravel bed thicknesses of more 
than one metre, have also been delineated 
by means of the exploration programme.
Diamond core drilling is also ongoing 
with two rigs in operation north of the 
Maninge Nice area. During the year, this 
programme delivered some 1,649 metres of 
core. The core drilling is primarily utilised 
to establish the continuity of mineralised 
amphibolite within the subsurface areas. 
In the Maninge Nice area, the boundary of 
the amphibolitic body and the subsurface 
continuity of ruby mineralisation to below 
30 metres have already been delineated 
and established. The team has also 
observed the presence of white marble 
bands of up to 30 metres in thickness 
and to a depth of up to 45 metres with 
intermittent bands of amphibolite.

Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Processing 
Ore excavated from the bulk sampling 
pits is brought to a centralised stock yard 
adjacent to the washing plant. The washing 
plant has been augmented from the 
original pilot configuration of 30 tonnes 
per hour (“tph”) to its current capacity of 
120 tph by the addition of a dry screen, 
logwasher (to remove much of the clay 
and fines prior to processing), additional 
sizing screens and jigs. Concentration of 
the output gravel is achieved through a 
series of parallel and sequential jigs, each 
accommodating different size ranges.
To meet the washing plant’s water 
requirements a water reservoir and large 
dam have been constructed adjacent to the 
plant for the collection of rain water. Seven 
large diameter bore holes across the licence 
area have also been installed.
Sorting, rough sales and auctions 
Montepuez has constructed a fully 
functioning sorting facility at the mine 
camp which incorporates a grading room, 
20 gloved sort boxes, secure storage and 
a waste facility. A high-level CCTV 
surveillance system is in operation 
throughout the sort house on a 24/7 basis. 
This sorting facility has been centralised 
and is positioned close to the washing 
plant. Concentrated gravel is transported 
directly from the jigs to the sort house in 
secure lockboxes where it is sorted and 
graded by hand.
Gemfields’ proprietary rough ruby grading 
framework, which separates each gemstone 
into one of nearly a thousand categories, 
has been very well received by industry 
stakeholders and participants attending 
the Company’s inaugural ruby auction 
in Singapore.
Prior to the auction, Gemfields also 
investigated and tested some of the ruby 
and corundum enhancement processes 
that are available to support value addition 
within the lower quality rough material, 
including heating, glass-filling and other 
methods. These tests yielded encouraging 
results, improving the aesthetics of the 
rough material at a reasonable cost while 
delivering considerable benefit to the many 
downstream stakeholders who are not 
individually able to access such techniques. 
Consequently, Montepuez was able to offer 
both untreated and treated rough material 
at the auction, with all treated lots using 
industry-accepted treatment techniques 
and on a fully disclosed basis.
The inaugural auction of rough ruby and 
corundum was held in Singapore from 
12–17 June 2014 and comprised a spread 
of both higher and lower qualities. A total 
of 55 companies placed bids during the 
auction which saw 2.03 million carats of 
ruby and corundum being placed on offer 
and 1.82 million carats being sold. The 
auction generated revenues of US$33.5 
million and yielded an overall average 
value of US$18.43 per carat. A total of 
approximately US$34 million has been 
spent on operations at Montepuez to 
30 June 2014 meaning that the revenues 
from the first auction almost match the 
aggregate expenditures incurred to date. 
The auction results are summarised below:

Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Operational and Financial Review continued
Infrastructure 
The development of a fully operational 
base camp at Namanhumbir was 
completed during the year and includes 
accommodation, office facilities and 
recreation amenities for all of Montepuez’s 
resident employees. A warehouse was 
also built and equipped to accommodate 
the purchasing and supplies functions, 
including a formalised receipt, storage and 
issuing system.
Importantly, both the mining and 
Namanhumbir base camps were connected 
to the national power grid by way of a 
newly erected and commissioned, high-
tension line with associated transformers 
supplied by Electricidade de Moçambique. 
In addition, Montepuez also has three 
250 kVA diesel generators onsite to 
provide backup power in the event of 
power outages.
The mine has evolved considerably and 
has a fully functioning engineering and 
maintenance workshop catering for the full 
fleet of light vehicles and heavy machinery. 
A prefabricated office has also been 
erected to house the human resources, 
and health and safety departments, and a 
separate room is currently being utilised 
for security and CCTV systems. Given the 
distances involved, an additional satellite 
facility has also been installed at Mugloto 
in an effort to further improve security 
and increase operating efficiencies.
Security
The size of Montepuez’s mining licence 
area, the value of its gemstones and their 
relative proximity to the surface mean 
that securing the area will continue to be 
a challenge. Montepuez’s security team, 
assisted by external security contractors 
and Mozambican police have to date 
been reasonably effective in keeping 
the core licence and operating areas 
relatively secure.
The prevailing security arrangements at 
Montepuez have contributed to a reduction 
in the average number of illegal trespassers 
on the licence, when compared to the 
levels prevailing at the time Gemfields 
initiated operations at Montepuez in 
early 2012.
Three basic elements of security have 
been adopted, namely architectural 
(barriers, locks, lighting, etc), operational 
(interaction between guards, quick 
reaction teams and local police 
support under a comprehensive set 
of security policies and procedures) 
and infrastructural (CCTV systems, 
communications and access control) 
and have achieved a considerable level 
of success.
Safety and environment
An annual safety review and improvement 
plan has been developed and implemented, 
including benchmarked safety standards, 
personal protective equipment and 
employee training. Regular monitoring is 
carried out by an inducted Mozambican 
health and safety officer and reviewed by 
committee, with an emphasis on safety 
supervision to establish safe working 
practices for all key activities throughout 
the operation. A local doctor has been 
engaged to carry out regular health checks 
on all employees via a fully stocked onsite 
medical post. In the event of more pressing 
medical emergencies, an ambulance is 
stationed at the mine site.
Montepuez is committed to the 
implementation of environmental 
management plans as outlined at the 
Group level and as required by law, 
and has adopted mining methods that 
limit Montepuez’s overall impact on the 
environment, and which seek to preserve 
the ecology and biodiversity of the 
surrounding areas.
The process of upgrading Montepuez’s 
environmental licence from level 1 to 
level 2, with the associated sustainable 
management system and supported by an 
enhanced environmental impact analysis 
focusing on biodiversity management for 
indigenous species (flora and fauna), has 
been initiated.
Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability
Montepuez demonstrates a strong 
commitment to the development of local 
communities and has implemented a series 
of developmental programmes within 
the villages surrounding the mining 
licence area, specifically in the villages 
of Namanhumbir, Mpene, Ntorro and 
Nseweh. A broad spread of community 
development programmes have already 
been undertaken and have so far focused 
on the provision of healthcare, education, 
agriculture, water supplies and the 
development of local infrastructure and 
promotion of sport.
Kariba Minerals Limited, Zambia
Kariba Minerals Limited (“Kariba”) is the 
world’s single largest operating amethyst 
mine and continues to account for a 
material proportion of global amethyst 
reserves. Synonymous with the colour of 
royalty, amethyst’s desirable natural colour 
continues to garner favour given their 
relative hardness, cost, aesthetic appeal 
and global opportunities for production 
and supply.
In 2013, the Government of the Republic 
of Zambia elected to transfer its 50% stake 
in Kariba (with Gemfields owning the 
remaining 50%) to ZCCM Investments 
Holdings plc (“ZCCM-IH”), in which the 
government owns approximately 87%. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 31
Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Various factors have impacted on Kariba’s 
development and while some of these 
are ongoing, each of Gemfields and 
ZCCM-IH provided further funds of 
US$0.2 million during the year. Each 
of the shareholders had also provided 
US$1.25 million in the prior financial year 
to acquire new equipment and improve 
infrastructure. 
At 30 June 2014, all of the major 
rehabilitation, capital and construction 
projects had been completed within 
budget. These included:
• rehabilitation of the sort house and 
extension of the strong room;
• construction of a new workshop;
• installation of a new 100 tph washing 
plant including four water management 
ponds and six stock management areas 
(silos) for lower grades;
• two new excavators, one new bulldozer 
and three new 25-tonne dump trucks 
have deployed;
• a solar power installation has reduced 
dependency on diesel-generated 
electricity; and
• rehabilitation of the mining camp 
and water distribution network are 
on schedule.
These upgrades are delivering positive 
results and have resulted in mining 
volumes increasing in line with budgets 
and the quantity of commercial and 
medium quality production increasing by 
some 70%.
The mine’s development plans include 
connecting the Francis pits (Main 
Francis, Lower Francis and Top Francis 
West). Therefore, following positive bulk 
sampling results, a new virgin area lying 
between the older pits is now being mined.
Subsequent to the year end, a new 
CCTV system was purchased and is 
expected to become fully operational in 
November 2014.
Oriental Mining SARL
Gemfields owns 100% of Oriental 
Mining SARL (“Oriental”), a company 
incorporated in Madagascar. Oriental has 
15 exploration licences covering emeralds, 
rubies, sapphires, tourmalines and garnets 
in the Antananarivo, Fianarantsoa and 
Toliara provinces of Madagascar. In 
addition, Oriental has the right to five 
exploration licences that are pending 
transfer approval from the Madagascan 
Ministry of Energy and Mines.
Madagascar is recognised as one of the 
most exciting coloured gemstone provinces 
in the world, with several key discoveries 
made during the last decade. Gemfields 
believes that, in the medium to long 
term, gemstone-related activity in the 
country has the potential to become a 
valuable part of the Group’s asset portfolio. 
Given Madagascar’s improving political 
and security environment following 
presidential elections earlier this year, 
Gemfields expects to further increase its 
level of activity in Madagascar during the 
financial year 2014–15.
Fabergé Limited
Fabergé is one of the world’s most 
recognised luxury brand names, 
underscored by a well-documented and 
globally respected heritage. The acquisition 
of 100% of Fabergé by Gemfields was 
completed in late January 2013. The 
acquisition aligned the world’s largest 
coloured-gemstone producer with one of 
the world’s most recognisable and iconic 
heritage brands and enabled Gemfields to 
progress its vision for coloured gemstones 
to the next level, harnessing the Fabergé 
name to boost the international presence 
and perception of coloured gemstones 
and advance the Group’s ‘Mine and 
Market’ strategy.
Thus, Gemfields is operating in the two 
most profitable segments of the coloured 
gemstone supply chain, consistently 
increasing its market share and securing a 
greater influence over coloured gemstones 
positioning and consumer awareness.
During the year, Fabergé has undergone a 
successful transition following last year’s 
internal review, with efforts focused on 
containing costs, improving product 
flows, bringing about synergies, increasing 
consumer and competitor understanding 
and the restructuring of operations so 
as to support the implementation of the 
integrated global strategic plan. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 32
Strategic Report / Operational and Financial Review
Operational and Financial Review continued
Robert Benvenuto was appointed as 
President and Chief Operating Officer 
of Fabergé in October 2013 to provide 
leadership and strengthen the management 
team. Robert previously spent 13 years at 
Harry Winston where he served as Chief 
Finance Officer, Chief Operating Officer 
and Co-Chief Executive Officer. This 
experience meant that, despite internal 
overhauls and restructuring, Fabergé’s net 
operating cost to the Gemfields Group was 
within budget, supported by an increase in 
sales margins.
Implementation of Fabergé’s integrated 
strategic plan is well underway with 
the aim of realising Fabergé’s largely 
unexploited global growth potential.
The operations now fall into three 
categories: creative, production and 
marketing. The strategic plan allows for 
seamless integration between the product 
pipeline, global points of sales, marketing 
initiatives and the coordination between 
all departments.
Creative and production
Fabergé’s design team has concentrated 
on creating new jewellery pieces and 
collections that reflect the artistic use of 
coloured gemstones in support of this 
new brand strategy, generating strong 
international coverage across the luxury 
goods, fashion, financial and trade media.
The Art of Colour, launched in October 
2013 depicts the Fabergé ‘Emotion’ 
rings, which showcase pavé-set coloured 
gemstones and are enjoying strong client 
interest. Each ring is unique and is set with 
over 300 coloured gemstones.
Fabergé developed the following 
collections during the year:
• the Regalia collection, a high jewellery 
suite featuring a surprise egg pendant 
with matching bracelet, ring, sautoir 
and earrings;
• the Rococo collection; and
• expansion pieces for the 
Emotion collection.
Fabergé was honoured with the ‘Best 
International Brand Collection’ award 
at the Andrea Palladio International 
Jewellery Awards 2014 event for the 
Spiral, Treillage and Emotion collections. 
This award is testament to what has been 
achieved thus far. 
These collections and other new products 
were well received by consumers across 
key markets, a fundamental litmus test 
for the creation of a solid platform for 
future growth.
Marketing
In October 2013, Fabergé launched its first 
advertising campaign under Gemfields’ 
ownership, entitled ‘The Art of Colour’.
The Fabergé Big Egg Hunt, a creative 
charity and promotional initiative 
featuring some 300 eggs designed by 
leading international artists, designers 
and brands, concluded in New York on 
26 April 2014. The Fabergé boutique on 
Madison Avenue hosted the egg designed 
by world renowned architect Zaha Hadid 
and enjoyed record footfall. The project 
raised US$2.7 million for charities 
‘Elephant Family’ (founded by Mark 
Shand) and ‘Studio-in-a-School’ (founded 
by Agnes Gund). The egg created for the 
Fabergé Big Egg Hunt by Jeff Koons set a 
world record, raising US$0.9 million for 
the two charities.
From 24 February through 2 March 
2014, Fabergé presented its latest jewellery 
collections at the Doha Jewellery and 
Watches Exhibition at the Qatar National 
Convention Centre in the Qatari capital. 
Fabergé also exhibited at Baselworld, the 
world’s biggest jewellery and watch fair 
from 27 March through 3 April 2014. 
New collections and designs were well 
received by clients and the press alike, 
with the first sales already concluded.
In April 2014, Fabergé hosted a significant 
marketing event at Harrods, the world 
famous department store in London’s 
Knightsbridge. The ‘Fabergé Easter at 
Harrods’ saw Fabergé host an exclusive 
salon and exhibition space in Harrods 
with the famed Brompton Road windows 
and façade dressed in Fabergé flags, telling 
the story of the legendary jewellery house. 
The event ran from 1–21 April 2014 
and generated record monthly sales for 
Fabergé’s directly operated concession 
within Harrods.
‘Fabergé: A life of its own’, a new feature-
length documentary telling the story of 
Fabergé, and in which Fabergé’s Heritage 
Council played a significant role, won 
three awards at US film festivals.
Post year end events
August 2014 emerald auction
From 5–8 August 2014 Gemfields held an 
auction of predominantly lower quality 
emeralds in Lusaka, Zambia, generating 
revenues of US$15.5 million, the second 
highest aggregate revenue yet achieved 
for lower quality emeralds of this nature. 
Excluding the sale of 1.5 tonnes of low 
quality beryl, the average realised price was 
US$3.61 per carat (or US$1.34 per carat 
including the low quality beryl). Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 33

Acquisitions
Sri Lanka
In September 2014, Gemfields plc entered 
into a joint venture with East West Gem 
Investments Limited (“EWGI”), a Jersey 
registered company, in order to progress 
opportunities in the Sri Lankan sapphire 
and gemstone sector via three Sri Lankan 
subsidiaries which will be 75% and 25% 
held by Gemfields and EWGI respectively.
Under the terms of the agreements, 
Gemfields has acquired 75% operating 
interests in 16 exploration licences 
(covering diverse minerals) for a 
consideration of US$0.4 million. The joint 
venture will also see Gemfields and EWGI 
establish a gemstone trading company 
called Ratnapura Lanka Gemstones (Pvt) 
Ltd, a company approved by the Board 
of Investment of Sri Lanka (“BOI Sri 
Lanka”). The trading company will focus 
on sourcing rough sapphires from various 
sources in the local market.
Due to the close proximity of the 
transaction to the year end, the Directors 
have not finalised the accounting 
treatment for this transaction.
Kagem revolving credit facility
In August 2014, Kagem entered into 
a US$20 million revolving credit facility 
with Barclays Bank Zambia plc. Funds 
drawn under the facility bear interest at 
a rate of 3 month US Dollar LIBOR plus 
4.5%. A drawdown of US$15 million took 
place on 29 August 2014.
The purpose of the loan was to replace the 
existing term loan with Barclays (which 
had an outstanding balance of US$6.8 
million at 30 June 2014) and for financing 
Kagem’s working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements.
Security for the loan comprises a fixed and 
floating charge over Kagem’s net assets, 
equivalent to the total amount outstanding 
under the facility and a corporate 
guarantee from Gemfields plc.
Sale of investment in 
Richland Resources Limited 
(formerly TanzaniteOne)
In July 2014, the Group sold its entire 
7.04% shareholding in Richland 
Resources Limited for total consideration 
of US$423,000, representing a profit of 
US$193,000 over the year end net book 
value of US$230,000.
The Company’s strategy remains 
that of becoming the global 
‘Coloured Gemstone  
Champion’ and we are very 
pleased with our recently 
announced opportunity to add 
Sri Lankan sapphires to 
our portfolio of premium 
coloured gemstones.

Strategic Report / Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
Corporate Responsibility  
and Sustainability
Since last year’s Corporate Responsibility 
Review in the Annual Report, 2013 and 
2014 activity across the operating locations 
has continued. Following a working 
session in August 2013 in which we invited 
stakeholders from various organisations 
including PricewaterhouseCoopers’ UK 
sustainability advisory team, World Land 
Trust and the University of East Anglia to 
advise us on developing our sustainability 
strategy, we concluded that to strengthen 
our approach we needed to appoint a 
dedicated member of staff to oversee 
Group strategy and execution.
A Group sustainability manager has now 
been appointed and will be responsible 
for directing Group activity relating to 
corporate responsibility and sustainable 
development, including oversight of 
safety and occupational health on 
projects. Over the coming year we will 
be reviewing our strategy, policies, 
commitments, partnerships projects, 
reporting and metrics, and working with 
senior management across the Group 
to ensure that current and new mining 
projects are and continue to operate to best 
practice standards. 
Our approach and ambition
As reported in 2013, our approach centres 
on facing up to the very real challenges 
of mining in countries where bribery and 
corruption, land rights, environmental 
impacts and sustainable development 
are either endemic or require extremely 
sensitive handling. The principles of 
sustainability in the coloured gemstone 
sector are developing and we are looking 
to take a leading role. Whilst not as 
high profile as diamond, gold and other 
precious metals sectors, coloured gemstone 
mining carries many of the same risks 
particularly those arising from the 
countries in which we operate and the 
nature of the supply chain. 
From mine to market, integrity must 
be central to who we are as a successful 
business. We do not shy away from what 
we do. Having chosen to operate in this 
sector it is therefore imperative that our 
sustainability strategy is fit for purpose 
to support our operations as well as our 
brand. Therefore, we need to guarantee 
a long-term, sustainable and integrity-
driven licence to operate, not just for 
our investors, reputation and employees 
but for the countries in which we have a 
concession to mine.
As we develop our strategy, our aim is 
to follow best practice at managing and 
transparently communicating on the 
following contextual issues as set out in the 
Global Reporting Initiative G4 Metals & 
Minings Sector Disclosures:
• the control, use and management 
of land;
• the contribution to national economic 
and social development;
• community and stakeholder engagement;
• labour relations;
• environmental management;
• relationships with artisanal and small-
scale mining (“ASM”); and
• an integrated approach to minerals use.
We intend to be aligned with other 
recognised standards and frameworks 
by relevant industry organisations such 
as the Responsible Jewellery Council 
and the International Council for 
Mining & Metals. We will also consider 
more investor-centric sustainability 
frameworks such as the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board Metals & 
Mining Standards.

Strategic Report / Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
Governance
With the recently appointed Group 
sustainability manager we are steadily 
putting in place the right levels of 
governance to managing sustainability 
across the business. The Group 
sustainability manager has responsibilities 
to develop the strategy and execution 
plans and report to both the Board and 
also the board-level Health, Safety, 
Environment and Community Committee 
which meets to discuss sustainability 
risks and opportunities. Currently, 
we are benchmarking our approach 
against similar sized organisations in our 
sector and defining metrics by which 
performance will be measured.
We value feedback and input from external 
stakeholders. In developing and managing 
our strategy the intention is to prioritise 
the issues we tackle having first carried out 
a materiality assessment. This requires the 
input of external organisations, partners 
and critical friends. 
The presence of dedicated local teams is 
dependent on the scale and maturity of 
each operation and will be strengthened as 
our strategy develops. Training, capacity 
building and empowering of local teams 
will be a priority in the coming year as 
will ensuring that basic housekeeping on 
project sites is in place.
Review of ongoing activities 
and partnerships
Kagem, Zambia
A two year plan and a budget of over 
US$1 million has been allocated for the 
construction of the secondary school 
at Chapula and a four-ward health 
centre at the Nkana Village. Following 
environmental project brief approvals of 
these projects, the secondary school will 
be the first in this district and will enable 
students to complete their schooling up to 
the 12
th
 level; the four-ward health centre 
will provide medical facilities including a 
children’s and maternity ward, as well as 
onsite nurses quarters. 
No single project has been imposed 
on the community as they are done 
with consultation of all stakeholders 
from various sectors in the district. 
Major stakeholders include traditional 
establishment, all government 
departments with particular interest, 
District Commissioner’s office, local 
council, certain community and 
faith based organisations, and the 
farmer’s cooperatives.
Kariba, Zambia
As one of the only companies in the 
area it is our responsibility to ensure 
the area is developed for the long term 
and Kariba’s managing director initiates 
and oversees the implementation of 
sustainability projects.
In 2014, Kariba intends to switch its 
current diesel generation to solar. In so 
doing, Kariba’s operations will be powered 
by a 600 kW solar array which will be built 
and financed by a third party and sited on 
our concession. Kariba will agree a long-
term fixed contract with the developer and 
any excess generating capacity will be used 
by the local communities at a subsidised 
rate. The mine operation will become more 
efficient as it will only rely on diesel for 
back-up power.
Kariba also intends to finance the building 
of a coal briquette manufacturing unit. 
With the local environment being seriously 
degraded by the removal of wood for 
charcoal, the intention is to manufacture 
briquettes from waste coal dust. These 
briquettes will be sold to local villagers at 
a price which is lower than the charcoal 
they buy. Kariba’s managing director is in 
discussion with local leaders as to how this 
business could eventually be transferred 
to the local council to manage as a 
going concern.
Montepuez, Mozambique
Ruby mining differs from emerald mining 
because seams of ore run closer to the 
surface. Our concession is very sizeable, 
and this makes managing it more difficult. 
As a result, security of our employees and 
the considerable environmental impact of 
ASM on or around our concession is an 
ongoing challenge for us. We have started 
talking to experts in ASM to understand 
the theoretical options for developing an 
ASM strategy.
The focus for Montepuez over the last year 
has been on low impact projects, which 
reflects the relative age of the project. Our 
efforts have so far been restricted to basic 
community relations projects, managed by 
a full time member of staff. These projects 
have largely been philanthropic and 
include the construction of three schools, 
sports ground, market, community health 
centre and drilling and installation of two 
water boreholes. A pilot project on local 
agri-farming programmes has been rolled 
out. Larger and longer-term projects have 
been put on hold until such time that a 
more holistic and strategic view can be 
taken, aligned with local law, on which 
projects to support.

Strategic Report / Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks the Group has to manage in order to allow the 
Group to pursue growth opportunities and increase shareholder value. The Board believes in the maintenance of sound risk management 
and internal control systems.
The Group has identified the following key risks. This is not an exhaustive list but rather a list of the most material risks facing the 
Group. The impact of these risks, individually or collectively, could potentially affect the ability of the Group to operate profitability and 
generate positive cash flows in the medium to long term. As a result these risks are actively monitored and managed, as detailed below.
External risks Mitigation
Gemstone price volatility
Gemstone prices and demand are volatile and influenced by world 
economic conditions. Earnings and cash flows are subject to 
movements in the prices achieved at auctions.
The Group consistently monitors the market in order to determine 
the optimum timing, size and composition of its rough gemstone 
auctions. Forecasting and budgeting assumptions relating to 
gemstone prices are prudent and are monitored by the Board 
and Senior Management.
Regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainty
The Group’s mining operations are predominantly based in Zambia 
and Mozambique. Emerging markets such as these are generally 
subject to greater risk and may be affected by political instability or 
legislative changes. These may result in changes in legal requirements, 
royalty rates, taxation policies or restrictions on the export of currency 
or gemstones, and which may have a material adverse impact on the 
Group’s operations or future development.
 
Political instability may also result in civil unrest, labour disputes 
or the withdrawal or variation of existing agreements, mining 
licences and permits. Any of these threats may adversely affect the 
Group’s operations.
The Gemfields team is experienced in operating in Africa. The 
Group encourages active and open engagement and dialogue 
with the relevant government bodies and ministries. The Group’s 
relationships with the various governments of the countries where it 
operates are actively managed by the Group’s Executive Directors and 
Senior Management.
Political risk – export restrictions
During the prior year, the Zambian Government requested that the 
Group auction rough emeralds from the Kagem mine only in Zambia. 
This presents a risk to the Group in that the level of competition at 
any given auction may not be optimised within Zambia and which 
could result in a reduction in the average price achieved per carat.
There is a risk that other jurisdictions in which Group operates request 
similar selling restrictions on rough gemstones.
Changes to the political environment and regulatory developments 
are closely monitored. The Group engages in dialogue with relevant 
government representatives in order to remain well informed of 
developments, promote understanding and build relationships.
Political risk – in country tax regimes
The Group is exposed to the risk of changing fiscal policies. An 
increase in taxation rates would adversely impact the profitability 
of the Company.
The Board and Senior Management regularly hold meetings 
with government officials to ensure compliance with the relevant 
legislation. The Group monitors changes to the legislative and tax 
environments and engages experts where required. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 37
Strategic Report / Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Financial risks Mitigation
Liquidity risk
The Group has significant capital expenditure (“capex”) plans over 
the next year. The requisite funding is intended to be sourced from 
operating cash flows and financing facilities. A lack of adequate cash 
flows or funding could delay development and growth.
The Group has a strong balance sheet with sufficient headroom to 
raise further financing should the need arise. Cash flow planning and 
review is carried out continually to ensure both capex and operational 
requirements are adequately financed.
Production and capital cost control
Failure to control overall costs per carat will result in reduced profits.
The Group intends, as part of its strategy, to expand its existing mines 
and acquire new assets. Failure or inability to monitor expenditure 
on and progress of capital projects could result in financial losses 
and cost overruns.
The Group undertakes a comprehensive budgeting process on an 
annual basis. Performance against the budget is regularly monitored 
and reviewed by Senior Management and reported to the Board.
The Group also implements rigorous and focused cost-control 
initiatives regarding all exploration projects, with regular revaluations 
carried out to assess the prospective benefits to shareholders.
All significant out-of-budget expenditure requires the approval of 
the Board.
Strategic risks Mitigation
Exploration and development risk
There is no assurance that the Group’s exploration and development 
activities will be successful, or that expenditures will be fully 
recovered and depleted ore reserves replaced. 
There is a risk that exploration activities may not identify viable 
mineral resources or that the Group may fail to identify attractive 
acquisition or investment opportunities. Furthermore, ineffective 
management of projects can result in cost overruns and costly delays 
in going into production which could prevent the Group benefiting 
from favourable market developments.
The Group assesses a wide range of potential growth opportunities, 
both from its internal portfolio and external opportunities, to 
maximise the growth profile of the Group. 
The Group seeks to balance this risk by building a portfolio of 
projects and licence areas that carry a range of differing technical 
and commercial risks, and keeping under careful review the amount 
invested in any one project.
Retention of key personnel
The successful achievement of the Group’s strategies, business 
plans and objectives depends upon its ability to attract and retain 
key personnel.
Part of Gemfields’ success is due to the management structure and 
style whereby innovation and creativity is encouraged. Gemfields’ 
employment terms and remuneration structures are designed to 
attract, incentivise and retain individuals of the right calibre in order 
to mitigate against, as far as possible, the loss of key personnel. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 38
Strategic Report / Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
Operational risks Mitigation
Distribution model (Fabergé)
The Fabergé distribution model presently relies on a combination 
of online sales, directly operated boutiques in Geneva, London and 
New York, a concession in Harrods (London), international client 
events and a network of independent multi-brand retailers. During 
the financial year, Fabergé developed a new range of products seeking 
to attract retail and wholesale clients from different countries and 
expand its presence. Failure of the distribution model either wholly or 
partially would have a material adverse impact on the Group.
The Group continues to monitor the distribution model and the 
associated agreements in order to provide flexibility and react to 
market trends.
Product design (Fabergé)
The success of Fabergé relies heavily on creating products attractive 
to its target customers and which will motivate them to develop an 
enduring relationship with Fabergé. If this strategy fails either wholly 
or partially, the Group would suffer a material adverse impact.
The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by encouraging the development 
of product ranges which meet demand in the chosen markets.
Counterfeit and parallel retail networks (Fabergé)
The Fabergé brand, expertise and production methods can be 
counterfeited or copied. Its products may be distributed in parallel 
retail networks, including web-based sales networks without the 
Group’s consent.
Counterfeiting and parallel distribution have an immediate adverse 
effect on revenue and profit. Activities in these illegitimate channels 
may damage the brand image of the relevant products over time and 
may also lower consumer confidence. 
The Group aims to protect itself against these risks through the 
systematic protection of its brand and trademarks. This involves close 
cooperation with governmental authorities and specialist lawyers.
Gemstone theft
Theft is an inherent risk factor in the gemstone industry. Security measures and systems are constantly reviewed and revised in 
order to minimise the risk.
Artisanal and small-scale miners (“ASM”)
Whilst an inherent risk at all gemstone deposits, this risk is significant 
at the Montepuez ruby mine. Due to its size, it cannot be completely 
fenced off; hence ASM miners frequently enter the licence area. 
ASM miners operate without valid licences and extract gemstones 
which would otherwise be retrieved and sold by the Group. The 
loss of gemstones from the licence area impacts the profitability of 
the Group.
ASM also presents additional risks including significant and 
unmitigated environmental impact, material risks to the health and 
safety of ASM, social issues such as sexually transmitted infection, 
alcohol and substance abuse, prostitution, criminality associated with 
gangs or syndicates, and the threat of violence against our staff. Each 
of these risks can materially impact the operation of a mine.
The Group seeks to balance the commercial risk with the social and 
environmental risks associated with ASM. We are committed to 
undertaking measures to find viable, sustainable solutions and are 
currently reviewing these.
The Group works with local authorities, communities and security 
and police forces in seeking to protect the Group’s employees, 
equipment and mining assets.
Security measures are constantly reviewed and implemented in order 
to minimise the risk. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 39
Strategic Report / Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Operational risks Mitigation
Risks associated with underground mining
The Kagem emerald mine in Zambia has conducted trial underground 
mining operations in order to better understand ground conditions, 
production logistics and test mining and roof support methods. The 
trial was carried out given the possibility that Kagem may develop 
a full scale underground mining operation in the short to medium 
term. Underground mining inherently carries more risk than 
opencast mining.
The trial underground operations is being closely monitored by Senior 
Management, as is the development of plans to build a full-scale 
underground operation.
Health, safety, environmental and community (“HSEC”) risks
HSEC risks are inherent to the mining industry. Failure to maintain 
adequate health and safety standards may result in a significant 
incident or deterioration in safety performance. This may result in loss 
of life, loss of time or disruption to the mining operations.
Mining is an environmentally disruptive process for the majority of 
a mine’s lifecycle. Consideration of the impact of mining is therefore 
important. Breaches can damage reputation and impact revenue. 
Similarly, mining requires the acceptance and support of local 
communities. Failure to share with local communities the benefits of 
our operation, such as provision of jobs or by way of philanthropic 
activities, may cause delays or disruptions to our operations.
The Group is presently undertaking a review of our broader HSEC 
and sustainability risks and strategy. The HSEC Committee guides 
this process and the associated strategy. 
The Group’s mining sites strive to implement suitable safety, health 
and environmental management systems and undertake meaningful 
community projects.
Supply chain risks
The gemstone supply chain is fragmented and characterised by the 
presence of many small businesses and agents. The risk thereby arises 
that certain businesses in the supply chain may operate in a manner 
that does not meet our own standards of ethical business practice.
This represents a risk to revenue because customers and consumers 
may not wish to buy gemstones if they have concerns about the 
supply chain.
The HSEC Committee guides our sustainability strategy.
We work with suppliers and buyers on chains of custody and 
certification, including factory visits and information disclosure.

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their report together with the audited 
financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2014. 
Business review and results
Gemfields is the world’s leading supplier of responsibly  
sourced coloured gemstones. We specialise in high-quality 
emeralds and amethysts from Zambia and more recently  
rubies from Mozambique.
Our approach has set new benchmarks for environmental, social 
and safety practices – a fact of which we are very proud. Our 
direct involvement in each step of the process is unique, and 
allows us to provide discerning customers the assurance they 
require over the responsible journey their gemstones have taken 
from mine to market.
The Strategic Report on pages 06 through 39 and Corporate 
Governance Statement on pages 49 to 52 respectively and are 
incorporated into the Directors’ Report by reference. More 
detailed information about the Group’s businesses, activities and 
financial performance can be found in the Strategic Report on 
pages 06 to 39.
The consolidated income statement is set out on page 61 and 
shows a profit after tax for the year of US$16.3 million (2013: loss 
of US$22.8 million). 
Dividends and dividend policy
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend 
(2013: Nil).
Recommendations in respect of dividends will be considered by 
the Board on a regular basis. Consideration will be given to the 
business’ operating requirements and factors deemed by the Board 
at the time. These would typically include cash flow projections, 
approved business plans, distributable reserves, capital projects, 
potential growth opportunities, equipment and infrastructure 
needs and any financing requirements.
The approval of dividends recommended by the Board remains 
subject to the consent of the Company’s shareholders in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
Statement of capital
Ordinary shares of £0.01
The Company’s ordinary shares represent 100% of its total issued 
share capital. At an annual general meeting (“AGM”) or general 
meeting of the Company every member present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share of which they 
are the holder. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
dividends. On a winding-up or other return of capital, holders 
are entitled to a share in any surplus assets pro rata to the amount 
paid up on their ordinary shares. The ordinary shares are not 
redeemable at the option of either the Company or the holder. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares.
At 30 June 2014, there were 540,808,209 ordinary shares in issue 
(2013: 540,003,208). During the year, 805,001 ordinary shares 
were issued to employees due to the exercise of share options.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the Company’s AGM held on 25 November 2013, shareholders 
approved a resolution to authorise the Company to make one or 
more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum 
aggregate nominal value of £540,003.21 (representing 10% of 
the Company’s then issued ordinary share capital). No ordinary 
shares were purchased under this authority during the year. 
No purchases have been made pursuant to this authority and a 
resolution will be put to shareholders to renew this authority for a 
further year at the 2014 AGM.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares are 
set out in the Articles. The Articles of Association may only be 
changed by the shareholders by special resolution.
Voting
Subject to the Articles of Association generally, and to any special 
rights or restrictions as to voting attached by, or in accordance 
with, the Articles of Association to any class of shares, on a show 
of hands every member who is present in person at a general 
meeting shall have one vote and, on a poll, every member who 
is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every 
ordinary share of which he/she is the holder. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 47
Governance / Directors’ Report
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Votes are exercisable at an AGM or general meeting of the 
Company in respect of which the business being voted upon is 
being heard. Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, or in 
relation to corporate members, by corporate representative. The 
Articles of Association provide a deadline for submission of proxy 
forms of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the 
holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine, be 
entitled to vote in respect of any ordinary share held by him/
her either personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to 
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to 
shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently payable 
by him/her to the Company in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he/she 
has been served with a notice after failing to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in those shares required to 
be provided under the Law.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s financial position and 
cash flow forecasts for the period to the end of September 2015 
and considered any reasonable possible changes in performance of 
the Group. The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
facilities for the foreseeable future and that it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Financial instruments and risks
The Group makes use of financial instruments in its operations as 
described in note 26 of the consolidated financial statements.
Directors 
The names of the Directors who served during the year, together 
with their details, are shown in the Board of Directors section on 
pages 42 and 43.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
Devidas Shetty and Finn Behnken retired and offered themselves 
for re-election at the 2013 AGM. Both Devidas Shetty and Finn 
Behnken were re-elected to the Board at the 2013 AGM. Clive 
Newall and Ian Harebottle will retire at the 2014 AGM and offer 
themselves for re-election.
Subject to the conditions set out in the Companies Act 2006 
(the “Act”), the Company has arranged appropriate Directors and 
Officers insurance to indemnify the Directors against liability in 
respect of proceedings brought by third parties. Such provisions 
remain in force at the date of this report.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group and Parent Company  
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
Union (the “EU”). Under Company law, the law stipulates that 
the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to 
prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the rules of 
the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on 
the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”). 
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 48
Governance / Directors’ Report
Directors’ Report continued
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply with the requirements of the 
Act. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements are made available on the Company’s 
website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s 
website in accordance with legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which 
may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of 
the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the 
ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements.
Charitable and political donations
During the year, the Company donated £72,000 (2013: 
£72,000) to the World Land Trust. The World Land Trust is an 
international conservation charity. The Company did not make 
any political donations. For disclosure of the Group’s Corporate 
Responsibility and Sustainability programme see pages 34 and 35.
Post reporting date events
Details of events after the reporting date for the Group are 
disclosed in note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and for the Parent Company in note 23 to the Parent Company 
Financial Statements.
Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions for the Group are given in 
note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for the 
Parent Company in note 19 to the Parent Company Financial 
Statements. Key management personnel compensation disclosures 
are given in note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Independent auditors
BDO LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office 
and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the AGM.
 
Disclosure of information to the independent auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps they ought 
reasonably to have taken to make themselves aware of any 
information needed by the Company’s auditors for the purposes 
of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that 
information. The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are unaware.

Governance / Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors is committed to adhering to the principles 
of good corporate governance, integrity and business ethics for all 
its activities. Under the rules of AIM, the Group is not required to 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). 
Nevertheless, the Group has identified areas of the Code it 
considers relevant to the current size and nature of its operations. 
It does not seek to comply with all the requirements of the Code. 
The Board is continuing to consider other aspects of the Code for 
appropriateness and these may be introduced when it becomes 
relevant for the Group to do so.
Responsibilities of the Board
The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving 
the Company’s strategy, financial activities and operating 
performance. The Board delegates the day to day management 
of the business to the Executive Directors who consult with the 
Board on all significant financial and operational matters.
The Board structure provides demonstrable separation of executive 
responsibility for running the business and responsibility for 
running the Board. This structure ensures there is appropriate 
accountability to the Board and helps safeguard the independence 
and objectivity of the Board.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are fulfilled  
by separate individuals, each with clear division of accountability 
and responsibility. The Chairman is responsible for running 
the Board and the Chief Executive Officer has executive 
responsibilities for the Company’s strategic development, 
operations and financial results.
Gemfields plc and The Pallinghurst Resources Fund L.P. (“PRF”) 
entered into an amended and restated relationship agreement 
in August 2013 which governs the relationship between the 
Gemfields Group and PRF (the “Relationship Agreement”). A key 
requirement of the Relationship Agreement is that at least 50% 
of the Directors serving on the Gemfields Board are independent 
of PRF. A Director of the Company is defined as ‘independent’ 
under the Relationship Agreement if they are not also a Director, 
officer or employee of PRF, Pallinghurst Resources Limited (PRF’s 
parent company) or of any other entities affiliated to either PRF or 
Pallinghurst Resources Limited.
The balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors has 
been reviewed by the Nominations Committee and the Board. 
Changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board are 
approved by the Board, following recommendations from the 
Nominations Committee.
Independence
In line with the Code, the independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors who have served on the Board for over nine years 
were reviewed. The Board has confirmed that Mr Newall and 
Mr Mascall, who have served on the Board for over nine years, 
continue to demonstrate the characteristics of independence, such 
as challenging management and providing valuable contributions 
to the Board.
All the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to 
be independent in line with the guidelines of the Code and are 
permitted to hold other directorships with other companies.  
Mr Mascall holds shares in the Group but given as his holding  
is not significant, he is considered to remain independent. 
Individual shareholdings for Directors can be seen below.

Board Committees
The Board has established the following Committees, each with its own terms of reference. All Committees of the Board to which 
significant powers, authorities and discretions are delegated, shall at all times be made up of at least two Non-Executive Directors.  
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Committees have the right to: 
• obtain independent professional advice to assist with the execution of its duties, at the Company’s cost, subject to a Board approved 
process being followed; and 
• access the Company’s records, facilities, employees and any other resources, within the scope of its responsibilities, as set out in the 
terms of reference.
Audit and Risk Committee
The members of the Audit and Risk Committee are Graham Mascall, Clive Newall and Finn Behnken, who chairs the Committee.  
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for assuring accountability and effective corporate governance within the Company. 
It provides recommendations to the Board on matters concerning the Company’s accounting policies, financial, risk and compliance 
control, record-keeping and reporting.

Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Graham 
Mascall, Finn Behnken and Clive Newall, who chairs the 
Committee. Its principal responsibility is to determine and review 
the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the framework and 
broad policy for the remuneration of the executive management. 
Within the terms of the agreed remuneration policy, it determines 
the individual remuneration package of executive management 
including incentive payments and long-term performance 
incentive arrangements. It also arranges performance evaluations 
for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer and reports the results of these evaluations 
to the Board. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is 
a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors or, where 
required by the Articles of Association, the shareholders.
Nominations Committee
The members of the Nominations Committee are Clive Newall, 
Finn Behnken and Graham Mascall, who chairs the Committee. 
The Chairman of the Board shall not chair the Nominations 
Committee when it is dealing with the succession of the 
Chairmanship of the Board. The Nominations Committee 
is responsible for regularly reviewing the structure, size and 
composition (including skills, knowledge and experience) 
required of the Board compared to its current position and to 
make recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes. 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for identifying 
and nominating for Board approval, candidates to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise and makes recommendations 
to the Board concerning succession planning for both Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors. In addition, the Committee keeps 
under regular review any authorisations granted by the Board in 
connection with a Director’s conflict of interest.
Health, Safety, Environmental and Community Committee 
The members of the Health, Safety, Environmental and 
Community Committee are Finn Behnken, Graham Mascall and 
Clive Newall, who chairs the Committee. The Health, Safety, 
Environmental and Community Committee is responsible for 
evaluating the effectiveness of the Group’s policies and systems 
for identifying and managing health, safety, social, security and 
environmental risks within the Group’s operations. It is also 
responsible for assessment of the Group’s performance with regard 
to the impact of health, safety, security, social and environmental 
decisions and actions upon employees, communities and other 
stakeholders and the impact of such decisions and actions on the 
reputation of the Group, as well as evaluating and overseeing, on 
behalf of the Board, the quality and integrity of any reporting 
to external stakeholders concerning health, safety, security or 
environmental issues.
Relationship with shareholders
The Directors consider the clear and timely communication of 
information to shareholders an important part of their duties. The 
Company has procedures in place to ensure that all price sensitive 
information is identified, reviewed by management and disclosed 
to the AIM market in a timely manner. Significant developments 
are disseminated through stock exchange announcements 
and regular updates on the Company’s website. The Executive 
Directors meet with institutional investors and analysts after the 
announcement of the interim and year end results. Additional 
meetings are arranged during the year by the Company’s brokers 
and financial advisers on an ad-hoc basis when required. Feedback 
arising from these meetings is communicated to the Board. 
The Group does not have an ultimate controlling party or parent 
company. PRF is a major shareholder in the Group but it does not 
have a controlling interest under IFRS. In addition, Gemfields and 
PRF entered into a relationship agreement in August 2013 which 
governs the relationship between the Group and PRF which 
clarifies that Gemfields is managed autonomously by its Directors 
and operates for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole, rather 
than solely for the benefit of PRF or any of its affiliates.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
Shareholders have an opportunity at the AGM to meet the 
Chairman and other Directors, to receive an update on the 
development of the business and to ask questions of the Board. 
The Group proposes a separate resolution for each substantially 
different item of business, giving shareholders the opportunity to 
vote on each issue.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a regular evaluation of its own 
performance. The review involves detailed interviews with each 
Director and covers the functioning of the Board as a whole, and 
the operation of each of the Committees. The 2013–14 review 
confirmed the high level of commitment and professionalism 
exercised by the Board in the strategic and commercial leadership 
of the Group. It also concluded that the Board and its individual 
members continue to perform effectively and operate within a 
framework of sound governance and practices, wherever it is 
reasonably practicable, are considered to be in the spirit and the 
principles set out in the Code. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 52
Governance / Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance continued
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal controls and risk management to safeguard shareholders’ 
investment and the Group’s assets and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the system. Any internal control system can only 
be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve in part or in whole business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Due to the size of the Group’s operations, the Executive Directors 
and Senior Management are very closely involved in the day to 
day running of the business. The Directors have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal control system presently in place and 
consider that they are still appropriate to the nature and scale of 
the operations of the Group. This review involved considering the 
present needs of the business, the risks it faces and appropriate 
control measures.
There is currently no internal audit function. As the Group 
continues to grow, Management is considering setting up an 
internal audit function.
Key controls and procedures
The Board maintains full control and direction over appropriate 
strategic, financial, organisational and compliance issues, and 
has put in place an organisational structure with defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority. The Board is committed 
to employing suitably qualified staff so that appropriate levels 
of authority can be delegated with regard to accountability and 
acceptable levels of risks.
The annual budget and forecasts are reviewed by the Board prior 
to approval being given. This includes the identification and 
assessment of the business risks inherent in the Group along with 
associated financial risks. Monthly and other period reports of 
actual results (financial and non-financial) are produced and 
reviewed by the Directors and Senior Management.
Management control is exercised at all levels of the Group and is 
regulated by appropriate limits of authority.
Refer to the principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 36 
to 39 for further details of the risks and mitigation.
Future plans to develop governance arrangements
A formal ‘whistle-blowing’ procedure has been put in place where 
employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. 
In addition, corporate governance arrangements will be reviewed 
periodically and the appropriateness and effectiveness evaluated 
and new policies developed and introduced accordingly.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the annual Directors’ Remuneration Report summarising Gemfields’ remuneration 
policy and providing information on the Group’s remuneration approach and arrangements for Executive Directors, Non-Executive 
Directors and Senior Management for the year ended 30 June 2014.
The Remuneration Committee’s objective is to attract and retain high calibre talent who are focused to deliver the Group’s strategic and 
business objectives, while relating reward to performance in the context of appropriate risk and safety management, and aligning the 
interests of Executive Directors and Senior Executive Management with those of shareholders to build a sustainable performance culture. 
The Group’s key remuneration policies were reviewed this year against new guidelines, market best practice and a review of the risk 
environment surrounding the Group’s remuneration arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee is primarily responsible for determining and recommending to the Board the framework for executive 
remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executive Management.
Clive Newall
Remuneration Committee Chairman
19 September 2014 Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 54
Governance / Directors’ Remuneration Report
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Under the rules of AIM, the Group is not required to prepare the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008. Nevertheless, the Group has 
taken steps to address some of the requirements of Schedule 8 in 
so far as it can be applied practically and appropriately, given the 
size of the Group and the nature of its operations. The report also 
provides the information required to be reported on Directors’ 
remuneration under AIM Rule 19.
Remuneration Committee 
Composition of the Committee
The members of the Committee, all of whom were independent, 
who served throughout the year were:
• Clive Newall (Chairman)
• Finn Behnken
• Graham Mascall 
Role of the Committee
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to:
• determine and agree with the Board the broad policy and 
elements for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
Senior Executive Management;
• determine all individual elements of the remuneration of those 
Executive Directors and Senior Executive Management; 
• recommend for approval of the Board long-term performance 
incentives; and 
• set the scope and terms of engagement of any third-party 
experts engaged to provide professional advice and assistance to 
the Committee.
No Director takes part in any discussion directly concerning his 
own remuneration.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors and 
Senior Management
The remuneration policy is based on the following broad 
principles set by the Committee:
• to provide a competitive remuneration package to attract and 
retain quality individuals;
• to align remuneration to drive the overall objectives of 
the business; 
• to align the interests of management with the interests of 
shareholders; and
• to set the pay of the Executive Directors and Senior 
Management with due account taken of pay and conditions 
throughout the Group and corporate governance best practice.
The objective of this policy is aligned with the recommendations 
of the Code as they relate to Directors’ remuneration. That is to 
provide a level of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate 
Directors of the quality required to run the Company successfully, 
but avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.  
As explained below, a significant proportion of the Executive 
Directors’ and Senior Managements’ remuneration is structured  
to link rewards to corporate and individual performance.
The Company has undertaken a review, with the assistance of 
external independent remuneration consultants, of its executive 
remuneration structures. This is to ensure that these structures 
take due account of market best practice in addition to 
incentivising and rewarding the Executive Directors and  
Senior Management for achieving the Company’s strategic  
goals. These strategic goals are established with the intention  
of generating outstanding returns for shareholders.
Furthermore, the Committee has appointed independent 
remuneration consultants to advise on certain aspects of Senior 
Management performance based share options. Currently, the 
Company has a time-based vesting share option plan. Going 
forward, the Committee considers a performance-based vesting 
option plan to be more appropriate for the Executive Directors 
and certain senior executive employees going forward.
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors 
The fees of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are set 
by the Executive Directors. When setting these fees, due account 
is taken of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar 
companies, the time commitment of each Director and any 
additional responsibilities undertaken, such as acting as Chairman 
to one of the Board Committees. For 2014, the basic fee for 
acting as a Non-Executive Director was £45,000 (US$73,000) per 
annum and £85,000 (US$139,000) is paid for chairing the Board.
Elements of remuneration
The below summarises the components of the Executive  
Directors’ remuneration.
(i) Basic salary 
The performance of the individual concerned is taken into 
account together with any change in responsibilities that may  
have occurred and the rates for similar roles within the appropriate 
comparator groups. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 55
Governance / Directors’ Remuneration Report
As of 30 June 2014, the following increases have been effected:

Ian Harebottle £275,000 £325,875 19%
Devidas Shetty £200,000 £237,500 19%
Sean Gilbertson Nil Nil Nil
These increases are believed to reflect the calibre of the individuals and are in line with the salary increases awarded to high performing 
individuals across the Group as a whole.
(ii) Performance related bonus
The bonuses paid to Ian Harebottle and Devidas Shetty of US$665,000 and US$557,000 were 125% and 144% of their basic salaries 
respectively (2013: US$107,900 and US$105,190 were 25% and 33.5% of their then basic salaries respectively).
Performance related bonus payments are based on meeting performance criteria, which are financial and non-financial. The performance 
related bonuses for financial year 2013–2014 reflect the exceptional performance of the Company.
(iii) Long-term incentive arrangements
Share Option Scheme
The Company’s Share Option Scheme was approved by the shareholders at the 2010 AGM and currently operates as the Company’s 
primary executive long-term incentive arrangement. Annual awards are made in the form of share options. The contractual life of the 
options is ten years from the date of grant. One third of the options granted vests at 31 December each year over a three year period, 
during which the person has to remain in employment.
For options granted during the year ended 30 June 2014, options covering the first £30,000 of shares are granted under an approved 
company share options plan (“CSOP”). Options granted in excess of this amount are granted under the Company’s unapproved share 
option scheme.

Notice  
period from 
Director
Notice period 
from the 
Company
Ian Harebottle 6 months 6 months
Devidas Shetty 3 months 3 months
Sean Gilbertson by rotation by rotation
The service contracts of all Directors, which are rolling contracts, are subject to standard terms in the event of termination.
Executive Directors’ external appointments
Board approval is required before any external appointment can be accepted by an Executive Director. Whether the Executive Director 
is permitted to retain any fees paid for such services or whether such fees are remitted to the Company will be determined on a case by 
case basis.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company but are appointed for an initial three-year term.  
Non-Executive Directors are typically expected to serve for two three-year terms, although their appointment can be terminated either 
by them or by the Company on one month’s written notice. The Chairman’s notice period is one month. The Company may invite a 
Non-Executive Director to serve for a further period after the expiry of two three-year terms subject to a particularly rigorous review  
of performance and taking into account the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. Under the Company’s Articles of Association, 
all Directors are required to stand for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 57

1 Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. The policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
In forming its opinion as to going concern, the Board prepares a working capital forecast based upon its assumptions as to trading as well 
as taking into account the available borrowing facilities in line with the capital management policies referred to in note 26. The Board 
also prepares a number of alternative scenarios modelling the business variables and key risks and uncertainties. Based upon these, the 
Board has concluded that the Group has adequate working capital and therefore confirm their belief that it is appropriate to use the 
going concern basis of preparation for the Financial Statements of the Company and the Group.
The Financial Statements of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2014 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively “IFRS”) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as adopted by the European Union (the “EU”).
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
“Group”). The Parent Company Financial Statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The IFRS Financial Statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting standards, interpretations and amendments effective at 
the beginning of the accounting period on 1 July 2013 as described below.
The following were amendments to published standards and interpretations to existing standards effective in the year and adopted by  
the Group.
Name
Mandatory  
effective date Description and guidance
IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement
1 January 
2013
IFRS 13 defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about 
fair value measurements. The standard applies, except in some specified cases (e.g. share-based payments) when other 
IFRS require or permit fair value measurements. It does not introduce any new requirements to measure an asset or a 
liability at fair value, change what is measured at fair value in IFRS or address how to present changes in fair value.
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs 
in the Production Phase 
of a Surface Mine
1 January 
2013
IFRIC 20 requires that, to the extent that the benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory 
produced, the directly attributable costs of that activity should be treated in accordance with the principles of IAS 2 
Inventories. To the extent that the benefit is the improved access to ore, the directly attributable costs should be treated 
as a non-current ‘stripping activity asset’ if certain criteria are met.
The stripping activity asset is initially measured at cost and is recognised as a separate asset.
IFRS 7 – Disclosures – 
Offsetting Financial 
Assets and Financial 
Liabilities
1 January 
2013
This amendment introduces disclosures intended to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the effect or 
potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. This includes the effect or potential effect of 
rights of set-off associated with the entity’s recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities that are either 
off-set as a result of the application of the requirements of IAS 32.42 or that are subject to an enforceable master netting 
arrangement or similar agreement, which is outside of the scope of that paragraph.
Annual Improvements to 
IFRSs (2009–2011 Cycle)
1 January 
2013
The improvements in this amendment clarify the requirements of IFRS and eliminate inconsistencies within and 
between standards.

The Group has not yet assessed the impact of IFRS 9. The adoption of IFRS 9 will eventually replace IAS 39 in its entirety and consequently 
may have a material effect on the presentation, classification, measurement and disclosures of the Group’s financial instruments.

any potential impact from adoption of IFRS 9 as discussed above). Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 68

1 Accounting policies continued
Change in accounting policy
The Group reassessed its accounting policy for revenue from the auction of rough gemstones. The Group has previously recognised 
all revenue from rough auctions once the cash has been received from the customer. On 1 July 2013 the Group elected to change the 
method of accounting for revenue recognition, since the Group believes that recognising the revenue when the buyer enters into an 
agreement with the Group to purchase gemstones better reflects the point at which the Group has transferred the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the buyer.
Had the Group applied the new accounting policy of recognising revenue, during the years ended 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013, there 
would be no impact on the comparative Financial Statements due to the timing of auctions and cash receipts. For this reason there is no 
requirement to restate the comparative balances or opening retained deficit as at 1 July 2012.
Had the Group applied the previous accounting policy of recognising revenue only when cash has been received, the results for the year 
ended 30 June 2014 would have been impacted as follows:
• decrease in revenue of US$10.4 million;
• decrease in cost of sales of US$1.9 million;
• decrease in profit before tax of US$8.5 million;
• decrease in trade receivables of US$10.4 million; and
• increase in inventory of US$1.9 million.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another entity or 
business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Consolidated Financial Statements present the 
results of the Group as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore 
eliminated in full. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted 
by the Group.
 
Business combinations
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair 
values at the acquisition date, which is the date when control passes to the Company. The results of acquired operations are included in 
the Consolidated Income Statement from the date on which control is obtained. Any difference arising between the fair value and tax  
base of the acquiree’s assets and liabilities that gives rise to a taxable deductible difference results in recognition of a deferred tax liability. 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on goodwill.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, 
the Company reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
for additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about 
facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
The difference between the fair value of the shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of subsidiaries in excess of the nominal 
value of the shares, where 90% or more of shares are acquired, is included in the merger reserve.
Merger reserve
Where the Company issues shares as consideration for acquisition of subsidiaries in excess of the nominal value of the shares, where 90% 
or more of the shares are acquired, the excess over nominal value is accounted as merger reserve.

Non-controlling interests
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, the Group initially recognised any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. For business combinations completed on or after 
1 January 2010 the Group has the choice, on a transaction by transaction basis, to initially recognise any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree which is a present ownership interest and entitles its holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net assets in the event of 
liquidation at either acquisition date fair value or, at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognised amounts 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Other components of non-controlling interest such as outstanding share options are generally 
measured at fair value. The Group has not elected to take the option to use fair value in acquisitions completed to date.
From 1 January 2010, the total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the parent and to 
the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests. Before this date, unfunded losses in such subsidiaries 
were attributed entirely to the Group. In accordance with the transitional requirements of IAS 27 (2008), the carrying value of non-
controlling interests at the effective date of the amendment has not been restated.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 
1 January 2010, the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of 
business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired.
Cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the 
acquiree. Contingent consideration is included within the cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent 
consideration classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss. For business combinations completed 
on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the Income Statement. Where the 
fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full 
to the Income Statement on the acquisition date.
Foreign currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in thousands of United States Dollars (“US$”) unless otherwise stated.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (the functional currency) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the translation of unsettled monetary 
assets and liabilities are similarly recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into US$ at rates approximating those prevailing when the 
transactions took place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, 
are translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate 
and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity in the cumulative translation reserve account.
Exchange differences recognised in the income statement of the Group entities’ separate Financial Statements on the translation of long-
term monetary items forming part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the cumulative 
translation reserve on consolidation. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 70
Financial Statements / Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies continued
Financial assets and liabilities
The Group classified its financial assets into two categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. 
The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as either held to maturity or fair value through profit and loss.
Loans and receivables: these are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial 
Position. Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash in hand and short-term deposits made for varying periods of between one day 
and three months.
Available-for-sale: Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale and comprise 
principally the Group’s strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities. They are 
carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity (available-for-sale reserve). Where 
there is a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset (which constitutes objective evidence 
of impairment), the full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the Income 
Statement. Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value 
between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the Income Statement. On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale 
reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include the following items:
• trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, which are initially measured at fair value and subsequently recognised 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method; and
• borrowings are measured at inception at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently they are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The Group has not classified any financial liabilities as ‘fair value through profit or loss’ financial liabilities.
Unevaluated mining properties
Initial exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred in relation to project areas to which the Group’s licences and rights relate are 
capitalised on a project-by-project basis pending determination of the feasibility of the project within intangible assets – unevaluated 
mining properties. Costs incurred include appropriate technical and administrative expenses but not general overheads. If a mining 
development project is successful, the related expenditures are transferred to property, plant and equipment at which point they 
are assessed for impairment. Subsequently, costs are amortised over the estimated life of the commercial ore reserves using a unit of 
production method. Ore reserves used in the calculation are the probable ore resource and mineral reserve attributable to the specific 
asset. Where a licence is relinquished, a project is abandoned, or is considered to be of no further commercial value to the Group, the 
related costs are written off.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Any reversal of the impairment is determined using the depreciated historic cost of the specific asset.

Finite life intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration paid and subsequently amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful economic life, except for trademarks, which have indefinite useful economic life and are reviewed for 
impairment annually.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. The amounts attributed to such intangibles are arrived at 
using appropriate valuation techniques, see section on critical estimations and judgements.
The useful economic lives of significant finite life intangibles recognised by the Group are as follows:
Intangible asset Useful economic life
Trademarks Indefinite
Software 3 years
Fabergé customer list 6 years
Stripping costs
Stripping costs incurred in the development of a mine or pit before production commences are capitalised as part of the cost of 
constructing the mine or pit and subsequently amortised over the life of mine on a unit of production basis.
Production stripping costs related to accessing an identifiable component of the ore body to realise benefits in the form of improved 
access to ore to be mined in the future, are capitalised as a separate asset (deferred stripping asset), within property, plant and equipment, 
and amortised over the life of mine on a unit of production basis.
Deferred stripping assets are amortised over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that becomes more 
accessible as a result of the stripping activity. Specifically, the calculation of amortisation for deferred stripping costs is the ratio of ore 
mined within the reaction zone (the ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the stripping activity) to the total ore estimated 
and identified within the reaction zone exposed by the stripping activity.
Mining asset
Following the determination of the commercial and technical viability of a mining project, the relevant expenditure, including licence 
acquisition costs, is transferred from unevaluated mining assets within intangible assets to evaluated mining assets within property, 
plant and equipment. Exploration expenditure transferred to property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated using a unit of 
production method. The Group calculates depreciation based on the ratio of ore mined during the period to the total volume of ore to be 
mined in the future, based on the estimated reserves. Expenditure deemed to be unsuccessful is written off to the Income Statement.
Investment in joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more 
joint venture partners under contractual arrangements. The Group’s interest in such joint operations is accounted for using the equity 
method in accordance with IAS 31. The Group equity accounts for its investments in joint ventures and does not recognise its share of 
losses in excess of the carrying amount of the investment. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 72
Financial Statements / Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies continued
Revenue
Gemstones
Revenue and associated costs from the sale of gemstones are recognised when control together with the risks and rewards of ownership 
are transferred to the customer.
For rough gemstones sold at auction, this transfer of ownership is deemed to occur at the point the buyer enters into an agreement with 
the Group to purchase the gemstones. This is a change in accounting policy. See page 68 for further details.
For polished gemstones the transfer of ownership is deemed to occur at the date the invoice is raised and the customer has taken 
ownership of the gemstones.
Retail, wholesale and web sales
Revenue from retail, wholesale and web sales is recognised when goods are delivered to the customer. Returns are accounted for at the 
point when the customer returns the item in accordance with terms and conditions published on the Fabergé website and a credit note is 
issued to the customer.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments in the form of share options to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the date of grant of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of shares that will 
eventually vest.
If an option is cancelled or settled in advance of the vesting date, the cancellation or settlement is accounted for as an acceleration of 
vesting. Therefore, the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the vesting period 
is recognised immediately.
Fair value is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Impairment
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken on an annual basis.
Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amount may be different to the recoverable amount. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher 
of value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down. Where the carrying value of an asset is below its recoverable 
amount, any impairment charged in respect of the asset is reversed accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the level of the 
cash generating unit (“CGU”) the asset is part of (i.e. the lowest level group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows).
The Group’s CGUs are determined on an operational basis and have been identified as the Kagem mine, Mozambican operations 
and Fabergé.

Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor (an ‘operating lease’), the total rentals 
payable under the lease are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate 
benefit of any lease incentive is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Property lease premiums are initially recognised in the Statement of Financial Position at cost and subsequently amortised over the term 
of the lease.
Rent deposits
Long-term rent deposits are initially recognised at fair value of the deposit paid and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
effective interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. As well as the 
purchase price, cost includes directly attributable costs and the estimated present value of any future unavoidable costs of dismantling 
and removing items. The corresponding liability is recognised within provisions.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Evaluated mining properties are amortised on the unit of production method in the year, set against the 
total probable ore reserves as detailed in the SRK resource statement, which is publicly available at http://corporate.gemfields.co.uk.
Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and equipment to write off the carrying value of items over their expected 
useful economic lives. It is applied at the following rates:
Freehold buildings – 5% per annum straight line
Plant, machinery and motor vehicles – 20–25% per annum straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 20–33% per annum straight line
Evaluated mining properties – unit of production method. The Group calculates depreciation based on the ratio of ore  
mined during the period to the total volume of ore to be mined in the future based on the 
estimated reserves.
Inventory
Inventory relating to rough gemstones has been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct production costs, 
depreciation of mining equipment and amortisation of the mining asset and amortisation of deferred stripping costs. Net realisable value 
of rough gemstones is the estimated market value based on past auctions, less estimated costs to sell.
During the process of extracting emeralds and rubies, beryl and corundum are also produced. This production is treated as a by-product, 
and is measured at net realisable value. The net realisable value is accounted for as a contribution to the costs of producing emeralds and 
rubies in the equivalent period. Upon sale of the by-products, the sale is recognised as revenue, with any profit over its previous carrying 
value being recognised within revenue in the period of sale.
Cut and polished gemstones, including all retail inventory, and all inventory in the Fabergé business are initially recognised at cost, 
and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs

Consignment inventory
The terms of agreements with customers who request the Group to onward sell their polished gemstones normally note that no legal title 
to the polished gemstones passes to Gemfields. For each particular arrangement an analysis of whether all significant risks and rewards 
of ownership of polished gemstones have passed to the Group is undertaken, in order to determine, if it is to be recognised as the Group’s 
inventory. If no significant risks and rewards have passed to the Group, then such gemstones are considered to be consignment goods 
and are not recorded as part of the Group’s inventory.
Current taxation
The current tax expense is the amount of taxes estimated to be payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for a period 
as well as adjustments to estimates in respect of previous periods. It is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and rates enacted or 
substantively enacted as at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Statement of Financial Position 
differs to its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference 
and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the difference can be utilised.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date 
and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
• the same taxable Group company; or
• different Group companies which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected 
to be settled or recovered.
Provision for decommissioning and restoration
A provision for decommissioning and restoration costs is recognised at the commencement of mining. The amount recognised is the 
present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding 
property, plant and equipment asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created, which is subsequently depreciated as part 
of the cost of production. Any change in the present value of the estimated future expenditure is reflected and adjusted against the 
provision and evaluated mining property, unless the asset to which the provision relates has been impaired in which case the reversal of 
the provision is taken through the Income Statement.

Other non-current liabilities
Provisions are recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing or amounts that have arisen as a result of past transactions. Kagem employees 
are on fixed term contracts and most of them are entitled to end of contract benefits.
From time to time, it is necessary for the Group to defend itself against legal claims that may or may not result in the Group having to 
make a financial settlement.
Provisions for anticipated settlement costs and associated expenses arising from any legal and other disputes are made where a reliable 
estimate can be made of the probable outcome of the dispute. Where it is not possible to make such an estimate, no provision is made.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made judgements, estimations 
and assumptions regarding the future. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates 
and assumptions.
The judgements, estimations, and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial 
Statements are detailed below.
(a) Useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful lives. Useful 
lives are based on the management’s estimates of the period, over which an asset is expected to be available for use by the Group 
or the amount of production expected to be obtained from the asset by the Group; which are periodically reviewed for continued 
appropriateness. Changes to estimates can result in significant variations in the carrying value and amounts charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in specific periods.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU 
level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, 
the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
(b) Carrying values of evaluated mining properties
The ‘value-in-use’ assessment of the recoverable amount of the mining asset was considered to be relevant in the determination of 
carrying value as this is how the economic value of the asset will be ultimately recovered. The determination of value-in-use and 
hence the recoverable amount of the Kagem asset is complex and detailed. The financial model is based on cash flow projections and 
assumptions supported by the SRK resource statement which represent the best estimate of the economics that will exist over the 
remaining life of the mine.
The key estimates, judgements and assumptions which affect the financial model are:
• emerald prices;
• resource and reserve classification;
• the life of mine; and
• applicable discount rate. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 76
Financial Statements / Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies continued
(c) Impairment testing of non-current assets
Where the recoverable amounts are assessed by analyses of discounted cash flows, significant judgement is used and the resulting 
valuations are particularly sensitive to changes in estimates of long-term commodity prices, capital and operating expenditures, discount 
rates and available reserves and resources and future production profile. Events or changes in circumstances can give rise to significant 
impairment charges or reversals of impairment in a particular period.
(d) Impairment testing of Fabergé CGU
The Directors make certain accounting estimates and assumptions regarding the future, all of which could result in a significant impact 
on the Group’s financial results. Any impairment of the trademarks required in the future would have a significant impact on the 
Group’s financial results and financial position however, this would have no impact on the Group’s cash flows.
The Fabergé trademarks are a key asset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The Directors believe that the asset has an 
indefinite useful life as it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity indefinitely, 
and in accordance with IAS 36, have considered the asset for impairment.
Key estimates relating to the valuation of the Fabergé CGU are disclosed in the note 13.
(e) Stripping costs
Stripping costs incurred in opening up new ore areas are capitalised as part of the cost of developing the pit and subsequently amortised 
over the mining of the ore (known as the reaction zone). This is reported under property, plant and equipment.
Deferred stripping costs are amortised over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that becomes more 
accessible as a result of the stripping activity. Specifically, the calculation of amortisation for deferred stripping costs is the ratio of ore 
mined within the reaction zone (the ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the stripping activity) to the total ore estimated 
and identified within the reaction zone. Judgement is required to estimate the total ore within the reaction zone and the expected useful 
life of the identified component. The judgements made are supported by technical data.
(f) Inventories
The Group reviews the net realisable value of, and demand for, its inventory, on a quarterly basis to provide assurance that recorded 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Factors that could impact estimated demand and selling prices include 
competitor actions and economic trends. Judgement is required in predicting market trends and the Directors and Management use their 
experience, market data and trend analysis (as referenced earlier in the report) when undertaking these reviews.
(g) Share-based payments
The Group has an equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme for employees and Directors. Employee services received, and the 
corresponding increase in equity, are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The fair value of share options is estimated by using the Black-Scholes valuation model 
on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are described in note 25 and include, among others, the dividend 
growth rate, expected volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest. Many of the inputs are factual. 
Others are based on market data and strategic Board decisions.

(h) Determination of ore reserves
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information complied by appropriately qualified people relating to 
the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery 
rates. The estimate of recoverable reserves is based on factors such as gemstone prices, future capital requirements and production costs 
along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves and mineral resources, consequently assumptions that are valid at 
the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
(i) Deferred tax
In considering the tax rate which should be applied to the temporary differences to quantify the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising 
in Zambia, Management considers that the average rate that is expected to be payable, based on the variable tax rate regime enacted in 
Zambia, over the life of the Kagem project is 35%.
2 Segmental analysis
For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographic units and business units based on the products and services and has 
five reportable segments as follows:
• Zambia (emerald and beryl mining activities);
• Mozambique (ruby and corundum mining activities);
• UK (sales of cut and polished gemstones, marketing, technical and administrative services);
• Fabergé (wholesale and retail sales of jewellery); and
• Other (traded auctions, sales and marketing offices).
The reporting on these investments to management focuses on revenue, operating costs and capital expenditure. These figures are 
presented after intercompany adjustments have been accounted for.

Profit/(loss) on ordinary activities before tax 36,283 (20,095)

Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1,258 1,442
Different tax rates applied in overseas jurisdictions and other temporary differences 11,134 6,079
Total tax expense 20,011 2,698
In the UK, the main rate of corporation tax was reduced to 23% as from 1 April 2013. Further reductions have reduced the main rate of 
corporation tax to 21% as from 1 April 2014 and 20% as from 1 April 2015.
With regards to the increase in the ‘Different tax rates applied in overseas jurisdictions and other temporary differences’ the increase 
in Kagem Mining Limited’s profits as well as the application of the Zambia variable tax to the assessable profits of that company has 
resulted in an increase in the tax arising in overseas jurisdictions.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method using the applicable tax rate in the 
respective jurisdictions. Temporary differences between the tax bases and net carrying values arise in regards to the effect of differences 
between tax and accounting depreciation, tax losses and other provisions generated during the period. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 82

No deferred tax is recognised in relation to:
• deductible temporary differences in the amount of US$5.2 million (2013: US$5.0 million) arising on the write off of available-for-sale 
investments; and
• unused tax losses in the amount of US$2.2 million (2013: US$22.0 million).
10 Earnings/(loss) per share
Earnings per ordinary share has been calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. During the year, 
the weighted average number of equity shares in issue is 540,334,373 (2013: 417,318,587) and the profit after tax attributable to equity 
holders of the parent is US$8,811,000 (2013: loss of US$22,790,591).
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of 
shares that would be issued on the conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. The calculation of the dilutive 
potential ordinary shares related to employee and director share option plans includes only those options with exercise prices above the 
average share trading price for each period.

(a) During the year ended 30 June 2014, the Group finalised its review of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in respect of the acquisition of Fabergé Limited. All final 
fair value adjustments have been recognised as at 30 June 2014.
(b) In June 2014, the Gemfields plc Board of Directors concluded that the Montepuez ruby project, no longer met the definition of an exploration and evaluation asset as defined under IFRS 6 
and hence the relevant costs were reclassified from intangible unevaluated mining property to inventory and evaluated mining property.
During the year ended 30 June 2013, goodwill arose on the acquisition of Fabergé Limited.

13 Intangible assets continued
The amount of depreciation of plant, machinery and motor vehicles capitalised as a part of unevaluated mining properties in the current 
year is US$530,000 (2013: US$317,364) and hence this has not been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Unevaluated mining properties – Zambian projects comprise Kamakanga emerald mine, Ndola Rural Emerald Restricted Area 
(“NRERA”) prospecting licences and the Jagoda option.
Impairment charged on intangibles
Goodwill acquired through business combinations and trademarks with indefinite useful lives have been allocated to the Fabergé CGU, 
which is also an operating and reportable segment.
The Group performed its annual impairment review of the carrying value of the Fabergé CGU. The impairment review was based on 
a value-in-use calculation of the Fabergé CGU based on the present value of projected future cash flows. The cash flow projections are 
based on a 20-year period, after which a fixed terminal value multiple is applied to the final year cash flow. It is the Directors’ view 
that the Fabergé brand has an indefinite useful life based on the long heritage and history of the Fabergé name and hence the Directors 
consider it appropriate to use a 20-year period when performing the value-in-use calculation.
The present value of future cash flows model was based on the following key assumptions:
• cash flow budgets and projections approved by Senior Management covering a five-year period;
• a revenue growth rate of 10% beyond the five-year period; and
• discount rate of 17.6%.
Sensitivity analyses around the base assumptions have been performed. It was concluded that no reasonable possible changes in key 
assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the Fabergé CGU to be less than the carrying value.

US$15 million bank loan
This loan is a US$15 million loan, of which the amount of US$9,275,000 bears interest at a rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 4.75% and 
the amount of US$5,725,000 bears interest at a rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 4.75%. The loan was entered into by Kagem Mining 
Limited with Barclays Bank Zambia plc. An initial drawdown of US$3 million of the facility occurred in 2012 and the remainder was 
drawn down in the 2013 financial year. The loan is repayable in monthly instalments over a period of 36 months from the date of first 
drawdown of the loan.
Security for this loan comprises a fixed and floating charge of all of the Kagem net assets to a level to cover the US$15 million facility,  
a mortgage over a property registered in the name of Kagem Mining Limited and a corporate guarantee from Gemfields plc. The facility 
of US$9,275,000 was used to pay the contractor undertaking the removal of waste in the Chama section of the Kagem mine and is an 
initial step towards Kagem Mining Limited becoming a fully independent and self-funding operation. The second part of the loan in the 
amount of US$5,725,000 was used to purchase various mining and other equipment.
The above loan facility was subject to four financial covenants, which were tested half yearly. One of the covenants was not met at 
30 June 2013 due to an auction, which had been scheduled to take place in June 2013, being delayed until July 2013. Subsequent to 
the 30 June 2013 reporting date, this covenant has been fulfilled and on 21 August 2013, the bank signed a waiver not to demand 
immediate payment. In line with IAS 1, the total outstanding loan amount has been reported under current liabilities as at 30 June 2013.
Subsequent to the reporting date, the outstanding balance relating to the US$15 million bank loan was repaid and Kagem Mining 
Limited entered into a new revolving credit facility. See note 30 for further details. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 92
Financial Statements / Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
20 Borrowings continued
US$15 million related party loan
The loan facility is available in two separate tranches. The first drawdown of US$10 million took place in April 2014, and the second 
tranche of US$5 million is available to be drawn between 15 July 2014 and 30 November 2014. Both tranches are repayable, together 
with accrued interest, on 30 April 2015. There are no penalties for early repayment. The facility is unsecured.
 
The proceeds of the facility will be utilised by the Company as additional working capital and for general corporate purposes, helping 
to smooth the Company’s centrally available cash flow given the intermittent nature of revenues from its gemstone auctions and the 
ongoing development of its ruby, rough gemstone trading and Fabergé businesses.

Fabergé sub-group LTIP
The Fabergé sub-group operates a cash-settled share-based remuneration scheme which is open to officers or employees of the Fabergé 
sub-group (“Qualified Persons”) as determined by the Board of Fabergé, that determines the level of award granted to each Qualified 
Person. Qualified Persons are entitled to a grant of awards at the commencement date of their employment. Further grants of awards 
may be made at a future date. The value of the award is based on the value of the Fabergé sub-group.
The awards are measured at fair value using an appropriate pricing model. The fair value of the awards is charged to the Income 
Statement over the vesting period.

risk management objectives and policies of the Group. While retaining the ultimate responsibility for them, the Directors have delegated 
the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of these objectives and policies to the 
finance function of the Group. The Directors regularly review the effectiveness of the processes put in place and, when required, approve 
specific policies and procedures designed to mitigate the financial risks.
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instruments risks other than stated in the note.

Financial Statements / Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated Financial Statements
26 Financial instruments continued
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial risk arises, are as described below:
• cash and cash equivalents; 
• trade and other receivables;
• available-for-sale investments;
• trade and other payables; and
• borrowings.
Credit risk
The Group has low credit risk because it does not ship gemstones sold at auction to customers until payment has been received.  
There is a receivable balance at the end of the year relating to cut and polished emerald sales and rough rubies and corundum sold  
at auction. The entire balance has been received post year end.
Credit risk in relation to the Fabergé segment is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations. Fabergé is mainly exposed to credit risk from credit sales. It is Fabergé policy, implemented locally, to 
assess the credit risk of new customers before entering into contracts. The Group impaired receivables during the year for the amount 
of Nil (2013: US$39,000). The Group considers there to be no material difference between fair value of trade and other receivables and 
their carrying amount in the Statement of Financial Position.
Cash and cash equivalents
In relation to its cash and cash equivalents, the Group has to manage its currency exposures and the credit risk associated with the credit 
quality of the financial institutions in which the Group maintains its cash resources.
Under the treasury policy of the Group, approved by the Board and operated by the finance function, the corporate head office in 
London acts as the treasury centre of the Group. Business units maintain the minimum cash balances required by their operations. 
No cash resources controlled by the corporate treasury can be held with financial institutions with credit ratings lower than A–.
At 30 June 2014, 88% (2013: 77%) of the cash balance was held by Barclays Bank and the remaining 12% (2013: 23%) was held by 
other financial institutions.
Maximum exposure to credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure of trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents to credit risk is its carrying amount.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt 
instruments. It represents the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. To achieve 
this aim, the Group seeks to maintain cash balances and agreed facilities at levels considered appropriate to meet ongoing obligations.
The Group maintains an integrated business performance and cash flow forecasting model, incorporating financial position information, 
which is updated monthly.
The Group performance against budget and associated cash flow forecast is evaluated on a monthly basis. The Directors receive rolling 
12-month cash flow projections on a monthly basis as well as information regarding cash balances and Group performance against 
budget. At the reporting date, these projections indicated that the Group expected to have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations 
under all reasonably expected circumstances. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 98

26 Financial instruments continued
The following table illustrates the contractual maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities, including the liabilities that must be 
settled gross, based where relevant, on interest rates and exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The disclosure below sets out 
financial instruments’ actual maturities, which for the year ended 30 June 2013 only differs to the ones reflected in the Statement of 
Financial Position for borrowings due to IAS 1 requirement for the loan to be reported within current assets in full. At 30 June 2014,  
the Group was compliant with the bank covenants, hence no reclassification was required.

Interest rate risk
The Group manages the interest rate risk associated with its cash assets by ensuring that interest rates are as favourable as possible, 
through the use of bank treasury deposits, whilst managing the access the Group requires to the funds for working capital purposes.
Currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is inherent in the Group’s activities and is accepted as such. The majority of the Group’s costs are denominated in 
US$ or Pounds Sterling and hence the Group holds the majority of its cash in these currencies.
The Group is exposed to currency risk on payments for goods and services made to the local suppliers in the jurisdictions of its 
operations. It is the Group’s policy not to hedge this currency risk exposure.

Other market price risk
The Group generates revenue from the sale of rough and cut and polished gemstones as well as wholesale and retail sales of the gemstones 
and jewellery in the Fabergé business. The significant number of variables involved in determining the selling prices of gemstones, such 
as uniqueness of each individual gemstone, the colour of the rough material and the ruling US$ spot rate at the date of sale make it 
difficult to accurately extrapolate the impact of fluctuations in prices would have on the Group’s revenue.
Capital
The Group seeks to maintain sufficient capital to enable its growth and safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern. Capital is 
defined as share capital, share premium, merger reserve, option reserve and cumulative translation reserve.
The primary objective of the Group is maximising shareholder value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining 
the capital structure that is most suited to the Group’s size, strategy and underlying business risk. Currently, the Group has not paid 
dividends, focusing instead on delivering capital growth. The Group had US$5,000,000 (2013: US$11,595,000) debt facilities available, 
which have had not been drawn down as at 30 June 2014.
The Group manages its capital adequacy structure by the issues of ordinary shares, raising debt finance where appropriate, and managing 
Group cash and cash equivalents. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 100

30 Events after the reporting period
August 2014 emerald and beryl auction
From 5 to 8 August 2014, after the end of the financial year, an auction of predominantly lower quality emeralds and beryl was held in 
Lusaka, Zambia, and yielded aggregate revenues of US$15.5 million, the second highest aggregate revenue achieved for lower quality 
emeralds and beryl of this nature.
Acquisitions
Sri Lanka
In September 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture with EWGI, a Jersey registered company, in order to progress 
opportunities in the Sri Lankan sapphire and gemstone sector via three Sri Lankan subsidiaries which will be 75% and 25% held by 
Gemfields and EWGI respectively.
Under the terms of the agreements, the Company has acquired 75% operating interests in 16 exploration licences (covering diverse 
minerals) for a consideration of US$400,000.
The joint venture will also see the Company and EWGI establish a gemstone trading company called Ratnapura Lanka Gemstones (Pvt) 
Ltd, a company approved by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka. The trading company will focus on sourcing rough sapphires from 
various sources in the local market.
Due to the close proximity of the transaction to the year end, the Directors have not finalised the accounting treatment for 
this transaction.
Kagem revolving credit facility
In August 2014, Kagem entered into a US$20 million revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank Zambia plc. Funds drawn under the 
facility bear interest at a rate of 3 month US Dollar LIBOR plus 4.5%. A drawdown of US$15 million took place on 29 August 2014.
The purpose of the loan was to replace the existing term loan with Barclays (which had an outstanding balance of US$6.8 million at 
30 June 2014) and for financing Kagem’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
Security for the loan comprises a fixed and floating charge over Kagem’s net assets, equivalent to the total amount outstanding under the 
facility and a corporate guarantee from Gemfields plc.
Sale of investment in Richland Resources Limited
In July 2014, the Company sold its entire 7.04% shareholding in Richland Resources Limited for total consideration of US$423,000, 
representing a profit of US$193,000 over the year end net book value of US$230,000.

1 Basis of preparation
These Financial Statements represent the individual Parent Company (the “Parent Company”).
The Financial Statements of the Parent Company for the year ended 30 June 2014, have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and Interpretations (collectively “IFRS”) issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as adopted by European Union (the “EU”) and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006.
The Parent Company’s Financial Statements are presented in United States Dollars (“US$”) and all values are rounded to the nearest 
thousand (US$’000), except when otherwise indicated.
The IFRS Financial Statements have been drawn up on the basis of accounting standards, interpretations and amendments effective 
at the beginning of the accounting period on 1 July 2013. New standards, amendments and interpretations effective in the year ended 
30 June 2014 and standards, amendments and interpretations, which are effective for reporting periods beginning after the date of these 
Financial Statements, which have not been adopted early, are described in detail in the Group’s accounting policy on the pages 66 and 67 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2 Accounting policies
In addition to the accounting policies in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the following accounting policies are relevant 
only to the Parent Company Financial Statements.
Investments in subsidiaries
Unlisted investments are carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
In the process of applying the Parent Company’s accounting policies, which are described above and in note 1 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, the Directors have made judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In the future, actual experience may differ from these estimates 
and assumptions.
The judgements, estimations and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial 
Statements are detailed below.
(a) Value of the investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provision impairment. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is 
assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value  
if higher.

15 Current and deferred tax continued
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method. Temporary differences are 
differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet. The tax base of an asset or liability is 
the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised in relation to temporary differences which would give rise to deferred tax assets where it is 
considered probable that those temporary differences will be utilised in the foreseeable future, and therefore the asset is recoverable.
The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below:

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
At 30 June 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of the Parent Company’s financial assets and liabilities approximated their fair values.
Financial risk management
The Parent Company is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. The Directors have overall responsibility to 
determine the risk management objectives and policies of the Parent Company. While retaining the ultimate responsibility for them, the 
Directors have delegated the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of these objectives 
and policies to the finance function of the Parent Company. The Directors regularly review the effectiveness of the processes put in place 
and, when required, approve specific policies and procedures designed to mitigate the financial risks.
There have been no substantive changes in the Parent Company’s exposure to financial instruments risks other than stated in the note.
The principal financial instruments used by the Parent Company, from which financial risk arises, are as follows:
• cash and cash equivalents; 
• trade and other receivables; 
• available-for-sale investments; 
• trade and other payables; and
• borrowings.
Credit risk
The Parent Company has limited credit risk because it does not ship gemstones sold to customers until payment has been received.
Cash and cash equivalents
In relation to its cash and cash equivalents, the Parent Company has to manage its currency exposures and the credit risk associated with 
the credit quality of the financial institutions in which the Parent Company maintains its cash resources.
Under the treasury policy of the Parent Company, approved by the Board and operated by the finance function, the corporate head office 
in London acts as the treasury centre of the Group. No cash resources controlled by the corporate treasury can be held with financial 
institutions with credit ratings lower than A–.
At 30 June 2014, 99% (2013: 99%) of the cash balance was held by Barclays Bank and the remaining 1% (2013: 1%) was held by other 
financial institutions.

The carrying value of financial assets that are past due or impaired is US$363,000 (2013: US$285,981).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Parent Company’s management of working capital. It represents the risk that the Parent Company will 
encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations.
The Parent Company’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. 
To achieve this aim, the Parent Company seeks to maintain cash at levels considered appropriate to meet ongoing obligations.
The Parent Company maintains an integrated business performance and cash flow forecasting model, incorporating financial position 
information, which is updated monthly.
The Parent Company’s performance against budget and associated cash flow forecast is evaluated on a monthly basis. The Directors 
receive rolling 12-month cash flow projections on a monthly basis as well as information regarding cash balances and Parent Company’s 
performance against budget. At the reporting date, these projections indicated that the Parent Company expected to have sufficient 
liquidity to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The following table illustrates the contractual maturity analysis of the Parent Company’s financial liabilities, including the liabilities that 
must be settled gross, based where relevant, on interest rates and exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.

as possible, through the use of bank treasury deposits, whilst managing the access the Company requires to the funds for working  
capital purposes.

Currency risk
Foreign exchange risk is inherent in the Parent Company’s activities and is accepted as such. The majority of the Parent Company’s costs 
are denominated in US$ or UK Pounds Sterling and hence the Parent Company holds the majority of its cash in these currencies.

The Parent Company’s functional currency is US$.
Other market price risk
The Parent Company generates revenue from the sale of rough and cut and polished gemstones. The significant number of variables 
involved in determining the selling prices of gemstones, such as uniqueness of each individual gemstone, the colour of the rough material 
and the ruling US$ spot rate at the date of sale make it difficult to accurately extrapolate the impact which fluctuations in emerald prices 
would have on the Parent Company’s revenue.
Capital
The Parent Company seeks to maintain sufficient capital to enable its growth and safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern. 
Capital is defined as share capital, share premium, merger reserve, option reserve and retained deficit.
The primary objective of the Parent Company is maximising shareholder value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by 
maintaining the capital structure that is most suited to the Parent Company’s size, strategy and underlying business risk. Currently, 
the Parent Company has not paid dividends, focusing instead on delivering capital growth. The Company had US$5 million (2013: Nil) 
debt facilities available, which were not drawn down as at 30 June 2014.
The Parent Company manages its capital adequacy structure by the issues of ordinary shares, raising debt finance where appropriate and 
managing the Parent Company cash and cash equivalents. Gemfields plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 116

STRATEGY
Ceramics, UK Electronics, Japan Precious Metals, France
Good progress,
In January 2005, we announced a Strategic Plan with a three year
horizon, targeted to improve operational and financial performance,
reduce debt and resume a dividend programme. The strategy is
based on the following key principles:
• A focus on higher-technology products and exit from commodity activities
• Investment in production capacity in emerging markets and restructuring in maturing markets
• Cost and overhead reduction
• Disposal of non-core activities and assets

Conclusions
All divisions have detailed plans to deliver strong earnings growth in 2007,
2008 and beyond
2007 should be the last year of high restructuring charges and capital
expenditure, as the major transformation projects are completed
Our financial condition is robust; acquisitions to provide additional growth are
now a possibility should suitable opportunities arise
The management team has demonstrated a track record in delivering results
Ceramics
• 2/3 of revenue is now in higher-margin speciality products with further profit growth achievable by
expanding in emerging markets while improving efficiency in NAFTA and Europe (including expansion
in Mexico and Poland)
• 1/3 of revenue is in linings where our profitability is significantly below our competitors. This can be
turned around
New targets: 2008 margin of 13%; revenue growth 5% – 6% CAGR
Electronics
• The highly cyclical businesses, Speedline and Laminates, have been sold
• Profitable growth will be driven by:
– New products and technical developments
– Strong growth of Chemistry in China following recent successful buy-out of former 49% JV partners
– Further restructuring of Chemistry in Europe and Assembly Materials in NAFTA
Sustained growth in profits
Precious Metals
• US operations were substantially restructured in 2005 and further consolidation of manufacturing 
is currently underway. 15% RoNSV target maintained
• Further restructuring in UK announced in January 2007, including the transfer of some production 
to Thailand. Mid single-digit RoNSV target for 2007
US operations are in good shape. Turnaround of UK will continue in 2007

Ceramics, Poland Precious Metals, US Electronics, Germany I am pleased to report the very considerable progress made
by the Group in 2006. Executive action, taken during the
last two years and centred on our strategic objectives of
profitability improvement and debt reduction, yielded a
strong set of financial results.
Significant restructuring has been undertaken in mature
markets, while investment in new production capacity has
been channelled into emerging markets, with a particular
focus on higher-technology, higher-margin products. The
programme to dispose of non-core businesses is now
essentially complete. Over the past year we completed the
sale of the Laminates and PVC Cements businesses from
the Electronics division and the Ceramic Fibres, Carbon
Blocks, Monofrax fused-cast refractories and US refractory
bricks businesses from the Ceramics division.
Our continuing operations enjoy leading market
positions, offering our customers excellent technology,
quality and service based on a strong local presence in all
our main markets worldwide.
Over the past three years the Group’s risk profile has
significantly improved and our exposure to market
cyclicality much reduced. We supply consumable products,
not capital goods, and our main end-markets of global steel
production and electronics are forecast to grow faster than
GDP over the next few years.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“2006 WAS A YEAR OF
EXCELLENT PROGRESS
IN THE EXECUTION OF
THE STRATEGIC PLAN.
THE BOARD IS
CONFIDENT THAT
THE GROUP HAS
CONSIDERABLE
POTENTIAL TO CREATE
FURTHER VALUE FOR
ITS SHAREHOLDERS.” Cookson Group plc { 11 } Annual Report 2006
Profitability
All three divisions delivered good improvements in revenue
and trading profit and the Group’s return on sales from
continuing operations improved by nearly one percentage
point to 9.5%. As a consequence, headline profit before tax
rose 30% to £131 million and headline earnings per share
improved 27% to 46.6 pence.
Debt reduction
The combination of strong free cash flow and proceeds
from our disposal programme resulted in year-end net debt
reducing to £181 million, £112 million lower than a year
earlier. The Group is now in a robust financial condition with
a strong balance sheet.
Pensions
We continue to focus on addressing pension deficits.
The total reported deficit in our defined benefit plans
worldwide reduced by £70 million in the year to £155 million.
The deficit arises principally in our UK (£82 million) and
US (£57 million) plans. As reported last year, we agreed an
accelerated ‘top-up’ contribution schedule with the UK
Trustee. During 2006, with the Group’s support, the Trustee
has also implemented a hedging programme to significantly
reduce the future volatility of the UK deficit arising from
changes in interest rates, inflation and equity market
performance. In the US we have recently frozen the
principal defined benefit schemes and transferred the
active members to defined contribution schemes. For our
UK and US schemes, in calculating the deficit we have
assumed further improvements in life expectancy trends.
All these measures demonstrate our commitment to
actively managing our pension arrangements to reduce
both the size and future volatility of the deficit.
Dividend
Last year we returned to the dividend list with a final
dividend in respect of 2005 of 5 pence paid in June 2006,
the first payment since October 2001. In respect of 2006,
we paid an interim dividend of 3 pence in October 2006 and
we are recommending a final dividend of 7 pence.
Board and corporate governance
After a period of significant change in personnel, the Board
and the Executive Committee have been unchanged since
my 2005 report. I am confident that we have in place a
sound and proven team with the skills, experience and
strength of purpose to deliver further improvements in
performance and shareholder returns.
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s
strategy in addition to monitoring performance. Through its
own actions and those of the Board committees, the Board
continues to meet its commitment to high standards of
corporate governance. The Board seeks to implement these
standards in such a manner that they provide real benefit
for shareholders, employees and customers.
Employees
I would again like to offer my sincere thanks to all our
employees worldwide for their contributions to the Group’s
improving performance.
Outlook
2006 was a year of excellent progress in the execution of
the Strategic Plan. The Board is confident that the Group
has considerable potential to create further value for its
shareholders and I look forward to continued progress in
2007 and beyond.

2006 results
The results for 2006 demonstrate the progress achieved so
far in the implementation of the Strategic Plan, through
which we continue to transform the profile of the Group.
Our programme of exiting commodity activities, either by
disposal or closure, while improving our competitiveness
in mature markets and growing strongly in emerging
markets, is resulting in an intrinsically more profitable and
less cyclical mix of continuing operations. End-market growth
for our principal activities has been sound, resulting in good
organic revenue growth. Both our net debt and the pension
deficit have also reduced significantly during the year.
Revenue from continuing operations of £1,590 million
was up 9% on 2005 and trading profit rose 20% to £150
million. Headline profit before tax increased by 30% and
headline earnings per share rose 27% to 46.6 pence. Net debt
at 31 December 2006 was £181 million, down £112 million from
a year earlier due to good cash generation, receipt of disposal
proceeds and some favourable foreign exchange movements.
The worldwide pension deficit also reduced by £70
million to £155 million, which reflects the accelerated
contribution programme in the UK and the freezing of the
main US defined benefit plans.
Divisional highlights
The Ceramics division had another outstanding year, with
trading profit up 22% over 2005 driven by revenue growth
in our high-margin flow control and fused silica product
lines and good progress in our strategy to improve margins
in the linings business.
Global steel production, our main end-market, grew 9%
in 2006. During the year projects were launched to build
additional production facilities in China, Poland and Mexico
and to close two factories in the UK and two in the US, while
making further cost reductions in the global management
structure. Two non-core businesses were disposed of in
2006, Ceramic Fibres and Carbon Blocks and a further two
businesses in early 2007, Monofrax fused-cast refractories
and a small US refractory brick business.
Worldwide demand for electronics remained buoyant,
which supported the Electronics division in delivering an
11% increase in trading profit, with good contributions from
several of our new product lines. In mid-year the closure of
the low-margin Industrial Metals activity in Europe was
completed and, later in the year, two substantial
restructuring projects were launched for completion by the
end of 2007. In the US two Assembly Materials factories will
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
“WHILE ALMOST 
ALL OF THE ORIGINAL
TARGETS FROM 
THE JANUARY 2005
STRATEGIC PLAN 
HAVE ALREADY BEEN
ACHIEVED OR
EXCEEDED AHEAD
OF SCHEDULE, THE
TRANSFORMATION
OF THE GROUP IS

be closed with some production relocating to Mexico. In the
Chemistry sector in Europe facilities are being consolidated
by closing factories in Spain and Italy, while expanding
production in Germany and the Netherlands. The buy-out of
the former 49% JV partners in the Chemistry sector’s
China business was completed, now giving the potential for
strong growth in this important market. The non-core
Florida-based PVC Cements business was sold in December.
The Precious Metals division delivered a 41%
improvement in trading profit, with the full year benefit of
the restructuring programmes completed in mid-2005 in
the US and France. Retail jewellery markets showed modest
growth in the US but remained weak in Europe, particularly
in the UK. In response to this we have restructured our UK
selling and distribution network in 2006 and, in January
2007, plans for a fundamental restructuring of UK
manufacturing operations were announced. These will
involve closing the Wrexham facility and downsizing the
Birmingham operations, while transferring some production
to a new facility in Thailand. The US operations continue to
perform well and profitability should be further improved
with the closure of the New Jersey facility and the
relocation of its production to the main Attleboro plant,
which is due to be completed by mid-2007.
Changing Group profile
The programme of disposals, closures, restructuring and
new investments is changing the profile of our activities 
and markets.
Geographically our markets are well-balanced with 
one-third of revenue in NAFTA (which comprises the US,
Canada and Mexico), one-third in Europe and one-third in
emerging markets, mainly Asia-Pacific.
Over the past three years, the total number of
employees in our continuing operations has remained level,
but with significant changes across the regions. In Asia-
Pacific employee numbers have grown 66%. In NAFTA they
have reduced 10% overall, but with an increase in Mexico as
production is relocated from the US. European employee
numbers have reduced 21% overall, but with growth in
Poland and the Czech Republic.
We have exited many commoditised activities and also
the most highly-cyclical, particularly with the sale of the
capital goods business Speedline in 2003 and the Laminates
business in 2006. As a result, the intrinsic cyclicality of the
Group has been greatly reduced and the profitability and
stability of the mix of our activities much improved.
More to go for
While almost all of the original targets from the January
2005 Strategic Plan have already been achieved or
exceeded ahead of schedule, the transformation of the
Group is not complete. In November 2006, an update on the
Strategic Plan with revised targets was announced, which
we discuss more fully on page 7 . Many of the investment and
restructuring plans I mentioned earlier will only produce full
benefits from 2008 onwards and further initiatives are still
to be announced. However, 2007 should be the last year of
high restructuring charges and capital expenditure as the
major transformation projects are completed.
The new targets do not assume any acquisitions, but the
Group now has the financial strength to make acquisitions
should suitable opportunities arise.
Outlook
Our main end-markets, global steel production and
electronics, are forecast to continue to grow ahead of GDP
over the medium-term. Trading over the first two months of
2007 has continued the positive trends from 2006. All
three divisions have detailed plans to deliver strong organic
earnings growth through 2007, 2008 and beyond. However,
the recent weakening of the US dollar, through its
translation impact on our sterling results, would partially
reduce this growth if it were to continue.
Based on these factors we expect to continue to deliver
further improvement in our underlying performance.

Ceramics, South Africa Electronics, Japan Group performance
The financial information provided in this review is at reported exchange rates and reflects the
restatements described further in the Financial Review on page 29. Comparatives have been restated
accordingly. Unless otherwise stated, for revenue and trading profit the impact of changes in exchange
rates between 2005 and 2006 has not been material and, as a result, the percentage improvement
between 2005 and 2006 is the same at both reported and constant exchange rates.
Group revenue from total operations for 2006 was 2% higher than in 2005. In the Group’s continuing
operations, which exclude the results of the Laminates and Monofrax businesses in 2006, revenue was
9% higher . The increase in revenue from continuing operations reflected both strong organic growth plus
the impact of higher metal prices being passed through to customers in the Precious Metals division and
the Assembly Materials and Chemistry sectors of the Electronics division. Revenue trends were broadly
similar between the first and second half of the year on a constant currency basis, with 10% and 9%
increases respectively.
Trading profit from total operations increased by 17% compared to the prior year. In continuing
operations, the growth rate was 20%. Each division reported significantly higher levels of profitability than
in the prior year, reflecting both the strong organic revenue growth and the benefit of the cost reduction
initiatives implemented over the last two years. Trading profit increased by 22% to £89.5 million in the
Ceramics division; by 11% to £58.5 million in the Electronics division; and by 41% to £11.0 million in the
Precious Metals division.
Return on sales from total operations for the Group of 9.5% has improved by 1.3 percentage points
compared to 2005. In continuing operations, the Group’s return on sales is also 9.5%, 0.9 percentage
points higher than for 2005. Each division recorded good growth in return on sales from continuing
operations with the margin of the two largest divisions, Ceramics and Electronics, well into double-digit
levels at 11.8% and 10.5%, respectively. If metals prices in 2006 had remained at similar levels to those
in 2005, the return on sales from continuing operations in 2006 would have been 0.4 percentage points
higher at 9.9%.
The fastest growing and most profitable region for the Group continued to be Asia-Pacific, which
accounted for 23% of Group revenue from continuing operations in 2006 and 42% of trading profit.
NAFTA (which comprises the US, Canada and Mexico) and Europe remain the Group’s largest regions in terms
of revenue; however , despite revenue growth in both these regions, higher levels of growth in Asia-Pacific
in particular has seen their combined share of Group revenue fall from 75% in 2005 to 72% in 2006.

Market overview
The Ceramics division benefited from good market
conditions throughout 2006.
The division’s key end-market is global steel production,
which accounts for around 70% of the division’s revenue. In
2006, global steel production rose by 9% to over 1.2 billion
tonnes. Following the 6% growth in 2005, the rate of
growth increased during 2006, being 8% in the first half
and 9% in the second half of the year. China reinforced its
position as the world’s leading steel producer with year-on-
year growth of 19% and accounted for just over one-third of
the world’s total production in 2006. Notwithstanding the
strong growth from this region, global production outside of
China still showed growth of 5%, with strong growth in the
major regions of India (up 8%), the US (up 4%) and the
enlarged European Union (up 6%). Steel prices increased by
around 10% during 2006, and the industry’s financial
position remains strong. The consolidation of the steel
industry accelerated in 2006, marked by the merger of
Mittal Steel and Arcelor to form the largest steel producer
in the world, with a market share of around 10%, and the
more recent proposed acquisition of Corus by Tata Steel.
This trend is expected to continue and to be particularly
marked in China, where the government has stated its
intention to create a small number of industry ‘champions’
out of the currently very fragmented market place. For
example, China’s sixth and seventh largest steel producers,
Jinan and Laiwu, proposed a merger during the year to
form China’s largest steel producer after Baosteel.
The end-markets for the division’s products and services
which are not related to steel production, namely foundry,
glass, solar and industrial products, are generally linked to
GDP growth. Whilst 2006 was a year of overall global
economic growth, the most important markets for these
sectors – construction and automotive – experienced mixed
fortunes. The construction industry performed well, notably
in China. The performance of the automotive industry in the
established markets, however, was mixed with vehicle
production year-on-year down 3% in the US and up by only
1% in Europe. Demand for solar energy – and thus the
division’s crucibles used in the manufacture of photovoltaic
cells – was strong, as high oil prices stimulated demand for
renewable sources of energy.
Divisional performance
The Ceramics division experienced a very strong year as a
result of good growth in global steel production combined
with the beneficial impact of the various restructuring
initiatives carried out during the last two years. Revenue from
continuing operations for the year at £757 million was 5%
higher than 2005. These results exclude the results of
Monofrax, the US fused-cast refractory business, which was
sold in February 2007 and the results of which are included in
discontinued operations. The division’s results do, however,
include the results of a number of smaller non-core
businesses which were either sold or closed during the year,
but which did not qualify to be treated as discontinued
operations for financial reporting purposes. These include the
principally US-based Ceramic Fibres business and the 
UK-based Carbon Blocks and Magnesia Carbon Bricks
businesses. Excluding the revenue from these businesses,
organic revenue for the division was up 8%, broadly in line
with the growth in world steel production. Trading profit from
continuing operations grew strongly by 22% at reported
exchange rates (up 21% at constant exchange rates) to 
£89.5 million – the highest level ever achieved by the division.
Return on sales was 11.8%, up 1.7 percentage points from the
10.1% reported in 2005. Return on net assets (being trading
profit divided by the total of average property, plant and
equipment, investments, trade working capital and other
operating receivables and payables) increased strongly from
28.2% in 2005 to 34.6% in 2006.
At the end of 2005 a new, more streamlined and
responsive organisational model was introduced which
focuses operational responsibilities on the principal product
lines of flow control, foundry and linings on a regional basis.
Further downsizing of the central management function
was initiated at the end of 2006. In each region the key end-
market is global steel production. Europe and NAFTA are
the division’s two largest regions, making up 39% and 34%,
respectively, of total divisional revenue from continuing
operations. However, the two fastest growing regions are
Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World, which include the fast-
developing markets of China, India and Brazil, together
comprising 21% of total divisional revenue. Fused Silica, the
one product line that is managed on a global rather than a
regional basis, makes up the remaining 6%.
NAFTA (comprising the US, Canada and Mexico)
Revenue from continuing operations in NAFTA grew by 2%
to £254 million (at constant exchange rates and adjusted
for the disposal of the Ceramic Fibres business) with growth
in all principal product lines – flow control, linings and
foundry. Flow control, which constitutes 40% of NAFTA
revenue, grew by 4% in line with the growth in steel
production in the region. Linings, which constitutes just
over 50% of NAFTA revenue, increased by 1%. This
business, which supplies and installs monolithic refractory
linings into a variety of industries, has adopted a strategy of
focussing its resources only on higher-margin, more value-
added projects and this is reflected in the significantly
improved profitability of this business in 2006.
Trading profit from continuing operations increased
significantly by over 40% (at constant exchange rates and
adjusted for the disposal of the Ceramic Fibres business)
compared to 2005. This reflected the underlying volume
growth, the impact of the elimination of around 60 non-
production personnel at the end of 2005, the cost benefit of
the ongoing relocation of production capacity from the US
to Mexico and significantly improved profitability in the
linings product line. Linings, which broke-even in 2005,
returned to profitability with a low single-digit return on
sales in 2006. Whilst this improvement is encouraging, this
level of profitability is still well below that of its main
competitors and we believe that further significant
improvements can be made going forward. Cookson Group plc { 19 } Annual Report 2006
During 2006, the division continued its restructuring
programme with the announcement that the Crown Point
(Indiana) facility will close in early 2007. Production of
taphole clay, an important product used in the production of
molten iron, will be transferred to an existing facility at
Chicago Heights (Illinois) where a new production line using
updated technology is being constructed. The slide-gate
and linings production capacity has also been expanded at
the Monterrey facility in Mexico. In February 2007 , as part of
the programme of disposing of non-core businesses, the
sale of Monofrax, a fused-cast refractory business based in
Falconer (New York), was completed and a small US
refractory brick business was sold.
Europe
Improved market conditions resulted in revenue in Europe
growing by 9% to £297 million (at constant exchange rates
and adjusting for the closed linings operations in the UK
discussed below). Flow control, which constitutes 53% of
European revenue, grew by 7%, ahead of the 6% growth in
steel production in the region. Linings, which constitute
one-third of European revenue, also saw good growth with
a 13% increase in revenue on an organic basis.
Trading profit increased by 14% (at constant exchange
rates and adjusted for the closed linings operations in the
UK). The profit improvement was particularly marked in the
linings product line, which saw its underlying return on sales
more than double.
Following a strategic review of the UK operations in early
2006, the Carbon Blocks business located in Bawtry (South
Yorkshire) was sold in June 2006. The Magnesia Carbon
Bricks business located in Worksop (Nottinghamshire), which
was experiencing very weak market conditions, was closed
in December 2006. The slide-gate operation in Goole (East
Y orkshire) will also close in mid-2007 , in light of the expansion
of slide-gate capacity at our facility in Skawina, Poland,
based on new slide-gate plate technology. As a result of
these initiatives, the Ceramics division’s UK headquarters,
based in Barlborough (Derbyshire), is being downsized.
Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World
Revenue in these regions grew in total by 16% to £162 million
at constant exchange rates reflecting strong steel
production growth in the two key markets of China and India
(19% and 8% respectively) combined with good growth in
the construction and installation business, which operates
primarily in Australia. China continues to experience
consolidation in the steel industry and the government is
encouraging the industry to shift to more modern, energy
and pollution-efficient methods of steel production which
should expand the market for the Ceramics division’s leading
flow control products. This trend should enable the division
to continue its strong progress in China even if the rate of
growth of total steel production starts to slow.
The strong revenue growth has resulted in trading profit
increasing strongly by over 20%, with improved profitability
from both the flow control and, more markedly, the linings
product lines.
As part of the division’s expansion in the region, in May
we announced the construction of a new £5 million foundry
crucible facility in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, near two of the
division’s existing Chinese facilities. The new facility, which is
expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2008, will
produce long-life, high-performance alumina graphite
crucibles for the fast-growing non-ferrous foundry market.
The Chinese foundry industry is the largest in the world and
has experienced annual growth of around 10% over the last
few years.
Fused Silica
The one product line that is managed on a global rather
than a regional basis is Fused Silica. The principal products
in the global Fused Silica product line are tempering rollers
used in the glass industry and Solar Crucibles™ used in the
manufacture of photovoltaic (or solar) cells. Revenue has
grown by 11% to £44 million compared to 2005 at constant
exchange rates with 8% growth in tempering rollers being
enhanced by strong growth of 16% for Solar Crucibles™.
Market conditions in the worldwide glass industry were
generally good in 2006, with growth of around 5% driven
by strong growth in the construction industry in China and
increasing demand for flat screen television panels. The
fast-growing solar energy industry has benefited in 2006
from the impact of high oil and gas prices, which has placed
increased emphasis on the development of renewable
energy sources, such as solar. As anticipated, limited
supplies of the polysilicon material used in the majority of
solar panels has restricted growth in the short-term, but
additional capacity is now coming on stream such that
growth should accelerate further.
Profitability remains strong for this product line with
trading profit up 15% on 2005.
To meet the increasing demand for fused silica
products, a number of new investments were made during
the year. In China, we made a £5 million investment at our
existing glass roller facility in Kua Tang. This investment,
which was completed at the beginning of 2007,
significantly increases capacity for producing the rollers
used in the glass industry and transforms this facility into
the Ceramics division’s leading centre worldwide for glass
roller production. Alongside this facility, we also completed
a new facility to manufacture Solar Crucibles™ for the fast-
growing photovoltaic market in Asia-Pacific. This facility is
currently in its ramp-up phase with full commercial
production expected by the second quarter of 2007.
Following this additional investment in China, a £7 million
investment for the manufacture of Solar Crucibles™ at our
existing facility in Skawina, Poland to support European
customers has been commenced and which is expected to
be operational in the second half of 2007.
With the announcement of the closure of the Beaver
Falls (Pennsylvania) facility, glass roller production in the US
will now be consolidated into one facility at Dillon (South
Carolina) with effect from the first quarter of 2007. Cookson Group plc { 20 } Annual Report 2006
Electronics division
The Electronics division is a leading supplier of advanced surface treatment and plating chemicals and
assembly materials to the automotive, construction and electronics markets.
2006 was a strong year for the division with generally strong end-market demand combined with the
benefit of our ongoing programme of restructuring in the more mature markets of the US and Europe
and further investment in faster-growing markets, particularly China. The disposal of the Laminates
business in April 2006 further strengthened the division by reducing its exposure to this lower-margin
and more cyclical part of the electronics market.
Market overview
Following the disposal of the Laminates business, only around 65% of the division’s continuing revenue now
comes from electronics markets with the remainder deriving from automotive and other industrial markets.
The improved market conditions in the global electronics industry that were evident in 2005 have
continued throughout 2006. The worldwide semi-conductor industry grew 9% by value in 2006, whilst
printed circuit board (“PCB”) production grew 8% by value. Electronic equipment production worldwide
grew by 10% by value in 2006, driven by strong consumer-led demand for PCs, mobile telephones, games
consoles, plasma and LCD televisions and MP3 players. Global PC sales grew by 9% by volume in 2006,
whilst the total annual production of mobile phones reached one billion units for the first time,
representing growth of 23% over 2005.
Regionally, Asia-Pacific experienced the strongest growth both as a result of production capacity
migrating to this region and also from strong local end-market demand. Electronic equipment production,
for example, whilst growing 10% worldwide saw lower growth in both the US and Europe (5% and 4%
respectively) being more than offset by growth of 25% in China.
The world-wide transition to lead-free products continued strongly in 2006, with new EU regulations
(the Reduction of Hazardous Substances Act) coming into force in mid-2006, which forbids the use of
lead in the majority of electronic assemblies. The use of lead-free products is a significant change, not
just for the Assembly Materials sector , whose solder products have traditionally contained lead. Non-lead
solders melt at higher temperatures and so all other PCB components, including fabrication chemistries,
must also be able to withstand these temperatures. In the third quarter of 2006, it was estimated that
53% of the global market for solder was lead-free. The increasing move to lead-free products is expected
to continue over the next few years, albeit at a slower pace.
For the non-electronics markets, 2006 was a mixed picture; despite overall global economic growth, the
most important non-electronics market for the division, the automotive industry, was subdued, with only a
marginal increase in vehicle production in Europe and a near 3% reduction in the US.
Divisional performance
Revenue for the year from continuing operations (excluding the results of the Laminates business) at
£555 million was 13% higher than last year at reported exchange rates (14% higher at constant exchange
rates). Excluding the impact of higher metals prices (tin and silver prices in the Assembly Materials sector
and gold and palladium in the Chemistry sector) and the impact of disposals and closures (PVC Cements
in December 2006 and the closure of the European Industrial Metals business in Naarden, the
Netherlands in June 2006), organic revenue was 6% higher. Trading profit from continuing operations
increased by 11% to £58.5 million, giving a return on sales for the division of 10.5%. The return on sales
is marginally below that reported in 2005 (10.7%) due to the impact of higher metal prices. If metals
prices in 2006 had remained at similar levels to those in 2005, the return on sales in 2006 would have
been 0.8 percentage points higher than for 2005. Return on net assets for the division increased strongly
from 37.6% in 2005 to 42.2% in 2006.

Assembly Materials is the division’s largest sector,
accounting for 58% of revenue and 48% of trading profit in
2006. Chemistry, the most profitable sector, accounted for
42% of revenue but 52% of trading profit.
Asia-Pacific continued to be the division’s fastest
growing region and was responsible for 41% of revenue
from continuing operations, an increase of 4 percentage
points over 2005. Europe accounted for 30%, NAFTA 26%,
and the Rest of the World 3%.
Sector performance
Assembly Materials
The PCB assembly and semi-conductor packaging markets
of the electronics industry account for approximately 84%
of Assembly Materials’ revenue, with the remaining 16%
going into a variety of industrial applications.
Revenue for the year at £319 million was 17% higher
than the prior year. However in 2006, the average prices of
tin and silver – the sector’s major raw materials – were 21%
and 58% higher, respectively, than for 2005. The cost of tin
and silver was, in the main, passed through to customers
during the year, such that revenue was increased by
approximately £30 million compared to 2005 as a result of
the higher metals prices. Revenue also reflected the impact
of disposals and closures, namely the US-based PVC
Cements business in December 2006 and the closure of the
low-margin Industrial Metals activity in Naarden, the
Netherlands in June 2006. Excluding the impact of higher
metals prices and disposals, organic revenue was 8% higher
than last year. The revenue growth reflected the good
growth in PCB production, the increasing penetration of
lead-free solder – with its relatively more expensive mix of
metals – but more difficult markets for solder products used
in industrial applications.
Trading profit of £28.2 million was 10% higher than last
year reflecting the growth in underlying volumes, the higher
profitability of lead-free products and the impact of cost
saving initiatives. Return on sales decreased from 9.4% to
8.8% due to the impact of higher metals prices. If metals
prices in 2006 had remained at similar levels to those in
2005, the return on sales in 2006 would have been 0.4
percentage points higher than for 2005.
Asia-Pacific, the sector’s largest region accounted for
54% of revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over
2005. This reflected the continued migration of consumer
electronics production to this region. Europe accounted for
22% of revenue, NAFTA 20%, and the Rest of the World 4%.
The worldwide transition to lead-free solder products,
driven by EU legislation which became effective on 1 July
2006, continues to enhance both revenue and profits. For
2006, 47% of solder sales were lead-free compared with
24% in 2005, with the conversion to lead-free reaching
51% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Capacity for the
production of lead-free solder has been increased during
the year, notably in Asia-Pacific. Sales of lead-free solder in
2006 were particularly high in Asia-Pacific, with a
conversion rate for the year of 67% compared to 31% in
Europe and 19% in the US. Going forward the conversion
rate is expected to increase significantly in the US, grow
steadily in Europe and start to level off in Asia-Pacific.
Sales of the sector’s proprietary low-silver content, lead-
free solder (Alpha SACX™) have also grown strongly in the
year following its introduction in the second half of 2005.
With only one-tenth of the silver content of normal lead-
free solder this product offers significant cost advantages
to our customers. In the fourth quarter of 2006, 17% of
lead-free solder sales were Alpha SACX™ compared to 5%
in the equivalent quarter in 2005.
The Semi-conductor Packaging Materials business,
which provides epoxy mould compounds, underfills and
solder spheres to the electronics industry, faced continuing
difficult market conditions in 2006 with revenue down on
last year. In response, headcount reductions were
implemented during the year and there was a change in
senior management in the fourth quarter.
During 2006, the strategy of exiting non-core,
commoditised businesses and restructuring in the more
mature markets continued. In June 2006, the closure of the
low-margin Industrial Metals activity in Naarden, the
Netherlands was completed with a reduction in headcount
of 65, and in December 2006 the US-based PVC Cements
business was sold. In November 2006, the restructuring of
the sector’s manufacturing operations in NAFTA was
announced for implementation during 2007. Production of
high labour-intensive solder wire is to be moved from the

this restructuring of £2.2 million are anticipated from the
beginning of 2008.
R&D and new product development remains a key focus,
reflected by a further expansion of R&D capabilities in
Bangalore, India.
Chemistry
End-markets for the Chemistry sector’s plating chemical
products are split in 2006 between the electronics industry
(46%) and other industrial and automotive applications
(54%). If precious metals sales are excluded, then the
percentage of revenue going into electronics end-markets
reduces to 37%.
Revenue for the year at £235 million was 9% higher
than 2005 at reported exchange rates (10% at constant
exchange rates). This growth was to a large extent driven by
the pass through of higher precious metal prices (notably
for gold and palladium) to customers. Prior to this impact,
the organic growth in revenue of 2% reflected underlying
growth for the sector’s higher-margin products serving the
electronics markets, being offset by weaker sales of lower-
margin products for industrial and automotive markets
(particularly in the US). Within the electronics markets, the
sector’s copper damascene, lead-free immersion silver
(AlphaStar™) and wafer-bumping products reported strong
revenue growth, whilst in industrial markets, our range of
plating-on-plastics and corrosion and wear-resistant
coatings products also grew strongly.
Trading profit for 2006 at £30.3 million was 13% higher
than 2005. This reflected the better mix of higher-margin
products serving electronics markets combined with the
effect of the rationalisation of the sector’s European sales
and distribution network, a cost-reduction initiative
commenced in 2005. Return on sales increased from 12.5%
to 12.9%. If metals prices in 2006 had remained at similar
levels to those in 2005, return on sales in 2006 would have
been 1.3 percentage points higher than for 2005.
Europe and NAFTA remain the sector’s largest regions
with 40% and 35%, respectively, of total sector revenue.
European revenue was down 3% on last year (before metals
price impact) reflecting a deliberate strategy of reducing
sales of low-margin electroplating equipment. Excluding
equipment sales, underlying revenue was 3% higher,
reflecting generally solid industrial markets and modest
growth in vehicle production volumes, particularly in
Germany which is our largest market for automotive-related
products in Europe. Revenue in NAFTA was up 2% on last
year (before metals price impact) primarily due to the
strong sales to electronics markets (including copper
damascene and lead-free immersion silver products) more
than offsetting the weak automotive market in the second
half of the year. Revenue in Asia-Pacific, which accounts for
24% of the sector’s revenue, grew strongly by 13%
reflecting the strong growth in this region. In October 2006,
the former joint venture partners in our Chinese operation
who owned 49% of the business were bought out (with
economic effect from April 2006) for a cash consideration
of £2.4 million. As well as enhancing the ability to service
the fast-growing industrial sector in China, this transaction
enhances net earnings by over £1 million per annum.
Following this acquisition, the construction of a new £6
million manufacturing facility in Nansha, Guangdong
Province was announced for completion in 2008. These
initiatives now give the sector unencumbered freedom to
conduct and grow its business in China.
In Europe, the consolidation of the sector’s
manufacturing footprint continued with the closure of the
Swedish and Austrian facilities. In addition, the closure of
the production facility in Spain and the consolidation of our
facilities in Italy were announced with completion expected
by the end of 2007 . With the rationalisation of these smaller
facilities, production will now be focussed on our existing
facilities in Germany and the Netherlands, where the
production and warehousing facilities have recently been
enhanced. Annual cost-savings from this European
restructuring of £2 million are anticipated from the
beginning of 2008.

Precious Metals division
The Precious Metals division is the leading supplier of fabricated precious metals (primarily gold, silver
and platinum) to the jewellery industry in the US, UK, France and Spain. Products include alloy materials,
semi-finished jewellery components and finished jewellery.
Market overview
2006 saw overall retail jewellery market conditions being marginally stronger than for 2005. Retail
demand was stronger in the US with all of the key retailers such as Wal-Mart, Signet, Tiffany and Zales,
reporting improved trading conditions. Market conditions in Europe remained weak. Demand for finished
jewellery products is influenced to a large extent by both consumer confidence and consumer
preferences. Consumer confidence, whilst generally robust, was negatively impacted by higher interest
rates and energy prices during the year. The shift in customers’ discretionary spend over the last few
years away from jewellery products and more towards consumer electronic products such as mobile
phones and MP3 players has continued.
The preference of buyers and wearers of jewellery for white metals and gemstones, which started in
2004 and continued throughout 2005, has showed some early signs of abating with some return to
fashion in 2006 of the ‘yellow gold look’. The price of precious metals – particularly gold – also has an
impact on jewellery demand. As prices increase, the weight of gold in the finished product is typically
reduced to meet retailer price points. In addition, retailers are reluctant to hold inventory when prices are
volatile. Precious metal prices have been very volatile during 2006, with gold trading at around
US$510/ounce at the beginning of the year before rising to a 26-year high of US$730/ounce in early May.
Whilst prices have reduced (to around US$630/ounce by the end of the year), the significant volatility in
prices during the year and its potential impact on retail demand has created uncertainty in the division’s
end-markets.

The division’s revenue of £278 million was 13% higher than last year at reported exchange rates (14% at
constant exchange rates), principally reflecting the higher precious metal prices. Net sales value, which
excludes the precious metal content, of £111 million was 2% higher than 2005 at reported exchange rates
and 3% higher at constant exchange rates. Trading profit in 2006 was £11.0 million, 41% higher than
2005 at reported exchange rates (39% higher at constant exchange rates) giving a return on net sales
value of 9.9% (2005: 7.2%).
The Precious Metals division operates in two distinct geographic regions; the US, which constitutes
58% of the total net sales value for the division, and Europe (which comprises the UK, France and Spain).
Return on net assets increased from 11.0% in 2005 to 14.5% in 2006.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Precious Metals – US
Net sales value of £64 million grew by 5% at reported
exchange rates (6% at constant exchange rates) compared
to 2005. This increase reflected some firming of retail
markets with evidence of a return to fashion of the ‘yellow
gold look’, strong sales of chain and findings products
particularly to non-US markets such as India and Hong
Kong, and increased business from Tiffany and the US Mint
(in particular, the supply of 24 carat gold blanks for the
production of the ‘Buffalo’ coin for investors and collectors).
Trading profit for 2006 at £9.0 million was 23% higher
than last year reflecting the good organic growth in net
sales value growth and the full year impact of the
headcount reductions implemented in the second quarter of
2005. Return on net sales value was 14.1% (2005: 11.9%).
The initiative to consolidate all of the US manufacturing
operations into the principal facility in Attleboro
(Massachusetts) has continued in 2006, with the
announcement in August 2006 of the relocation to Attleboro
of Inverness, our ear-stud business currently located in New
Jersey. This relocation, which will be completed in mid-2007
and involves a net headcount reduction of 20, will generate
annual cost-savings of £1.5 million.
Precious Metals – Europe
Net sales value of £47 million was broadly unchanged
compared to 2005. This reflected continuing weak retail
demand (particularly in the UK) being offset by stronger
scrap refining business, stimulated by the high precious
metals prices during the year. Net sales value was 5% lower
in the UK, but this was offset by small increases in France
and Spain. The UK business outperformed the overall
jewellery market with hallmark statistics for 2006 from the
Assay Office showing a decline from 2005 in the number of
gold and silver jewellery items requiring to be hallmarked by
14% and 12%, respectively.
Trading profit for 2006 was £2.0 million, well ahead of
the £0.5 million profit reported in 2005. All three countries
were profitable and reported improved levels of profitability,
with particularly strong performances coming from France
and Spain.
At the beginning of 2006, the first phase of the
restructuring of the UK operations was announced, with the
implementation of new call centre and internet selling
systems. Whilst this has reinforced our position as a leader
in the UK marketplace, the business continued to suffer
from weakening demand in the industry overall and
increased competition from low-cost imports. Against this
background, a proposed fundamental restructuring of the
manufacturing operations was announced in January 2007,
to be implemented on a phased basis during 2007. The
facility in Wrexham, which produces chain and findings, will
close with manufacturing transferring to a new site in
Thailand. The stampings operation at the main facility in
Birmingham will also relocate to Thailand and certain other
products will increasingly be sourced from the division’s US-
based operations. The sales office in Dublin will also close.
These initiatives, which will result in the loss of some 80
jobs, will result in annualised cost-savings of £2.0 million.
Group corporate
The Group’s corporate costs, being the costs directly related
to managing the Group holding company, were £8.7 million,
broadly in line with last year. The costs in 2006 reflect a
number of non-recurring charges, in particular costs
relating to the successful SEC de-registration.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations include the results of the
Laminates business, which was sold in April 2006,
Monofrax, the sale of which was completed in February
2007 and, in 2005, the Speciality Coating Systems business,
which was sold at the end of December 2005. The
Laminates business traded profitably in 2006 up to its
disposal, reflecting both the restructuring of this business in
2005 and the discontinuance of any depreciation charge as
required by its accounting treatment as a business ‘held for
sale’. Monofrax traded satisfactorily in 2006 with trading
results broadly in line with 2005. Cookson Group plc { 27 } Annual Report 2006

As described in detail in the Operating Review, the positive
end-market growth experienced in our major businesses
during 2006, together with the benefit of the cost-reduction
initiatives implemented in the last three years, drove an
improvement in operating margins from our continuing
businesses by 0.9 percentage points to 9.5%; delivering
trading profit of £150.3 million – an increase of 20% on that
reported for 2005.
After net finance costs of £28.4 million, reduced from
last year as a result of lower average borrowings, headline
profit before tax was up 30% over last year to £131.2 million.
The continued improvement in the Group’s trading
performance, reflected in the 27% increase in headline
earnings per share over 2005, combined with the Group’s
continued strong free cash flow generation, has contributed
to the Board’s decision to recommend to shareholders a
final dividend of 7.0 pence for 2006. This final dividend,
together with the interim dividend paid in October 2006,
makes a total of 10.0 pence per ordinary share for the year.
Finally, the successful implementation of the disposal
programme set out in our Strategic Plan in January 2005
meant that we closed the year with the Group balance
sheet in a very healthy state, with net debt at year-end of
£181 million, a reduction of £112 million from last year.

Restatement of comparative information
This is the second year that the Group accounts have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). During 2006, as a result of
the continued assessment of the detailed impact of IFRS on
the presentation of the Group accounts, a number of
changes to the accounting treatment and presentation of
certain items in the Group accounts for 2006 have been
made, together with appropriate changes to the respective
comparative information for 2005. These changes are
explained in note 3.3 to the consolidated financial statements,
but none of them have had an impact on the Group’s net
cash flows, financial position or total recognised income and
expense as previously reported for 2005. The comparative
information in this review is stated after these changes.

Headline profit before tax for total operations was £131.2
million for 2006, which was £30.1 million higher than 2005.
The increase in headline profit before tax arose as follows:
• £24.6 million increase in trading profit from continuing
operations at constant exchange rates as discussed in the
Operating Review above;
• £0.6 million positive trading profit exchange rate
translation variance;
• £6.6 million lower net finance costs (interest) for ongoing
activities, primarily due to a decrease in the average level
of borrowings throughout the year;
Partially offset by:
• £1.7 million decrease in trading profit from discontinued
operations at constant exchange rates.
Items excluded from headline profit before tax
A net charge of £17 .7 million was incurred in the year (2005:
£22.6 million) for items excluded from headline profit
before tax. This charge consisted of the following items:
Rationalisation costs: a charge of £34.7 million (2005: £18.5
million) was incurred in the year. Of the total charge, £10.3
million related to non-cash write-down of assets and £24.4
million to cash-related costs. The principal items included in
the total charge for 2006 were as follows:
• £22.9 million arose in the Ceramics division for the
rationalisation of facilities mainly in the UK, of which £9.0
million related to the non-cash write down of assets, and
for administrative headcount reductions both in Europe
and the US;
• £7.1 million arose in the Assembly Materials sector for the
rationalisation of production facilities in Europe and the
relocation of manufacturing operations from the US to
Mexico;
• £1.6 million arose in the Chemistry sector for the
rationalisation of the sales, manufacturing and
distribution network in Europe;
• £2.4 million arose in the Precious Metals division for the
relocation to its principal facility in Attleboro
(Massachusetts) of Inverness, the ear-stud business
currently located in New Jersey, and the restructuring of
the sales function in the UK operations; and
• £0.7 million arose in respect of redundancy initiatives in
Group central operations.
A further cash-related rationalisation charge of between
£10-15 million in 2007 and between £5-8 million annually for
2008 and beyond is expected, in respect of both the
completion of the above projects, plus additional cost
reduction projects expected to be initiated in these years.
Employee benefits curtailment gains: a credit of £8.6 million
(2005: £nil) was realised in the year relating to amendments
to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement
healthcare plans in the US.
Profit/(loss) relating to non-current assets: a net credit of
£13.1 million (2005: £Nil) was realised in the year relating
mainly to the disposal of surplus properties.
Non-recurring finance costs: in 2005 a non-cash charge of
£1.2 million was incurred when the existing bank facility was
put in place in March 2005, relating to the write-off of the
un-amortised portion of the fees incurred in respect of the
previous facility.
Loss on disposal of continuing operations: a net charge of
£4.7 million (2005: £2.9 million) was incurred in the year
relating to costs associated with the disposal, either in the
current year or in prior years, of a number of businesses
which did not qualify to be treated as discontinued
operations for financial reporting purposes. The principal
operations which were disposed of during the year, for
which the results up to the date of disposal have been
included within continuing operations, were the Ceramic
Fibres and the UK Carbon Blocks businesses, both formerly
part of the Ceramics division, and the PVC Cements
business, formerly part of the Assembly Materials sector.
The net charge included a write-off of goodwill of £4.2 million.
The loss on disposal of continuing operations in 2005
related principally to the disposal of the Group’s Technical
Ceramics business (McDanel), formerly part of the
Ceramics division.
Group profit before tax after the items noted above was

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Taxation
The tax charge on ongoing activities was £38.2 million
(2005: £28.1 million). The effective tax rate on headline
profit before tax from continuing operations (before share
of post-tax profit of joint ventures) was 31.3% (2005:
31.3%). Tax reform processes underway in certain of the
countries in which the Group operates, in particular
Germany and China, create some uncertainty as to the
Group’s longer-term effective tax rate. Subject to these
uncertainties, the Group is expecting the effective tax rate
for 2007 to be broadly in line with that achieved in 2006.
The Group tax charge relating to exceptional items of 
£5.3 million (2005: £16.0 million) resulted from a tax credit
of £2.1 million in respect of rationalisation costs, a tax
charge of £3.7 million in respect of the profit relating to
non-current assets, a tax charge of £0.6 million in respect of
the disposal of operations and a £3.1 million tax charge in
respect of the different treatment of goodwill in the US for
book and tax purposes.
Net post-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations
A charge of £3.3 million (2005: £41.7 million) was incurred in
the year , principally consisting of a post-tax loss of £5.8 million
relating to the disposal of the Group’s Laminates business
(“Laminates”) to Isola Group S.A.R.L. on 21 April 2006, net of
a post-tax profit of £2.7 million relating to additional proceeds
received in respect of operations discontinued in prior
years. The loss on disposal after tax relating to Laminates
comprised adjustments to its 31 December 2005 estimated
fair value less costs to sell, including movements in working
capital. The assets and liabilities of Laminates, formerly part
of the Electronics division, were classified as ‘held for sale’
in the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2005, with
the consequential recording of a loss at that date of £52.5
million in the 2005 results.
The post-tax loss on disposal in 2005 included the loss
in respect of Laminates noted above plus a post-tax profit of
£10.8 million arising on the sale of Specialty Coating
Systems (“SCS”), formerly part of the Assembly Materials
sector, in December 2005.
Headline profit attributable to equity holders
Headline profit attributable to parent company equity
holders for 2006 was £89.2 million (2005: £69.3 million),
with the £19.9 million increase over 2005 principally arising
from the significant increase in headline profit before tax.
After taking account of all items excluded from headline
profit before tax noted above (net of the related tax impact)
and the net post-tax loss on disposal of discontinued
operations, the Group recorded a profit of £66.4 million for
2006, £74.0 million higher than the £7.6 million loss
recorded in 2005.
Return on investment
The Group’s post-tax return on investment (“ROI”) in 2006
was 8.4%. Whilst the ROI is still not exceeding the Group’s
post-tax weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), which
is estimated to be around 8.5%, it has improved
significantly in the last two years (2005: 6.8%; 2004 6.0%)
due to the Group’s improved trading performance. Capital
expenditure and rationalisation projects are assessed
against the Group’s WACC as part of the pre-authorisation
process.
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Headline EPS, based on the headline profit attributable to
parent company equity holders, amounted to 46.6 pence
per share in 2006, an increase of 27% on the 36.8 pence
reported in 2005. The Directors believe this basis of
calculating EPS is an important measure of the underlying
earnings per share of the Group. Basic EPS, based on the
total earnings attributable to parent company equity
holders, was 32.8 pence (2005: loss of 5.8 pence per share).
The average number of shares in issue during 2006 was
191.5 million (2005: 188.5 million).
Dividend
In June 2006, a 5.0 pence final dividend in respect of 2005
was paid to shareholders, the first dividend payment since
October 2001. This followed a two year period over which
the Group delivered sustained free cash flow and strongly
improved underlying profitability. 2006 has marked a
further year of excellent progress with good cash
generation along with further improvements in profitability.
This, together with the Board’s confidence in the prospects
for the Group, has resulted in the Board recommending a
final dividend for 2006 of 7.0 pence per share which, if
approved, is to be paid on 11 June 2007 to shareholders on
the register at 25 May 2007. This final dividend, together
with the interim dividend paid on 16 October 2006, makes a
total dividend of 10.0 pence per ordinary share for the year,
which is covered 4.6 times by headline earnings and 3.3
times by free cash flow.

Group cash flows
Net cash inflow from operating activities
In 2006, the Group generated £67.7 million of net cash
inflow from operating activities, £5.1 million higher than in
2005. This net increase principally arose from:
• £12.6 million increase in EBITDA (being trading profit
before depreciation and amortisation) to £195.2 million;
• £27.2 million cash outflow for trade working capital, 
£3.5 million higher than 2005;
• £7.2 million cash outflow in respect of Laminates in the
period prior to its disposal;
• £0.9 million decrease in cash spend for rationalisation
costs to £16.1 million;
• £15.5 million increase in pension ‘top-up’ payments;
• £17.6 million net decrease in cash outflow for operating
provisions and other items, including £4 million of
additional incentive payments to employees throughout
the Group in 2005, with the remainder arising from
movements on other receivables and payables;
• £7.5 million decrease in net interest paid; and
• £7.3 million increase in tax payments.
The cash outflow in respect of trade working capital,
prior to the impact of discontinued operations, results from
both the increase in underlying revenue but also the impact
of higher metals prices (notably gold, silver and tin) on the
levels of inventories and trade receivables at the year-end in
the Precious Metals division and the Assembly Materials
and Chemistry sectors. However, there continues to be 
a strong focus on working capital management, evidenced
by the ratio of average working capital to sales from
continuing operations reducing from 22.3% for 2005 to
21.8% for 2006.
Cash outflow for rationalisation activities was £16.1 million
of which £10.0 million related to programmes that were
initiated in 2006 in respect of continuing operations and
the balance from prior year initiatives.
Net cash flows from investing activities
Capital expenditure
Payments to acquire property, plant and equipment were
£43.2 million in 2006, broadly in line with 2005 and
representing 117% of depreciation (2005: 90%).
Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment
Proceeds from the sale of surplus properties in the US,
Europe and Asia were £16.6 million (2005: £10.3 million).
Dividends from joint ventures
Dividends of £0.9 million were received in the year (2005:
£4.7 million) from the Chemistry sector’s Japanese joint
venture.
Disposals and acquisitions
Net cash inflow for disposals and acquisitions in the year
was £52.2 million, which included the following:
• Proceeds from the disposal of businesses, net of disposal
costs, of £59.4 million, principally comprising £11.1 million
for the disposal in March 2006 of the Ceramic Fibres
business, £42.2 million for the disposal in April 2006 of
Laminates, £1.4 million for the disposal in June 2006 of
the UK Carbon Blocks business, £1.7 million for the
disposal in December 2006 of the PVC Cements business
and £3.8 million of additional proceeds in respect of the
disposal in 2003 of the Speedline business;
• Trailing costs and purchase price adjustments for prior
year disposals, net of any associated property disposals,
of £3.1 million; and
• Acquisitions of subsidiaries for £4.1 million, principally
comprising £2.4 million in respect of the buy-out of the
Chemistry sector’s former 49% Chinese joint venture
partners.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating
activities after net outlays for the acquisition and disposal
of property, plant and equipment, dividends received from
joint ventures and paid to minority shareholders, but before
additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
Free cash flow was £64.5 million, £21.6 million higher
than 2005. As in prior years, free cash flow in the second
half of the year increased strongly compared with the first
half due to higher profitability and significantly higher cash
inflows from trade working capital.
Net cash flow before financing activities
Net cash inflow before financing for the year was £94.2
million, £45.3 million higher than 2005. This improvement
primarily reflects proceeds from the disposal of businesses
more than offsetting additional funding contributions to
Group pension plans. After an outflow for financing
activities (before repayment of borrowings) of £14.9 million
(2005: inflow of £4.8 million), arising primarily from the
payments of the 2005 final and the 2006 interim dividends,
the net cash inflow for the year (before repayment of
borrowings) was £79.3 million, £25.6 million higher than 
for 2005.
The strong cash inflow, together with a positive
translation effect of £32.9 million mainly due to the
increase in the value of sterling from US$1.72 to US$1.96
during the year, resulted in an overall decrease in net debt
of £111.8 million to £180.5 million.
Net debt
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had net debt of £180.5
million which was primarily drawn on available medium to
long-term committed facilities of around £480 million. The
Group’s net debt comprised the following:

Net debt 180.5 292.3 Cookson Group plc { 32 } Annual Report 2006
The US Private Placement loan notes, currently US$545
million, are repayable at various dates between 2007 and
2012, with US$50 million repayable in May 2007 and
US$130 million repayable in November 2007. A committed,
unsecured bank facility for £200 million was arranged in
March 2005. The facility, which had an original maturity
date of March 2008 with options to extend by two further
twelve month periods, was extended in January 2007 by
twelve months such that the current maturity date is March
2010. This facility was un-drawn as at 31 December 2006.
Sufficient headroom exists within this committed facility to
meet the repayments of the US Private Placement loan
notes due in 2007.
The Group is currently operating well within the
borrowing ratios contained both in the US Private
Placement loan notes and in the £200 million bank facility.
For 2006, the Group’s interest cover (EBITDA to net interest
ratio) was 7.7 times (against a covenant requirement of
greater than four times), the net debt to EBITDA ratio was
1.1 times (covenant requirement of less than three times)
and the US GAAP leverage covenant (gross borrowings to
shareholders’ funds ratio on a US GAAP basis) was 30%
(against a covenant requirement of less than 50%).
Currency
The US dollar weakened significantly against sterling during
the fourth quarter of the year and the year-end exchange
rate was some 14% lower than for 2005. However, the
average US dollar exchange rate for 2006 was only 1%
lower than for 2005. Other US dollar ‘tracking’ currencies,
such as the Singapore and Hong Kong dollar and the
Chinese renminbi, also showed a similar trend. The value 
of the euro was relatively stable against sterling, both 
in respect of the year-end rates and the average for the
year compared to last year. For 2006, the net translation
impact of currency changes on revenue and profits was 
not material.
Pension and other post-
retirement obligations
The Group operates defined contribution and defined
benefit pension plans, principally in the UK and US. In
addition, the Group has various other defined benefit post-
retirement arrangements, being principally healthcare
plans in the US. As at 31 December 2006, a liability of
£155.1 million was recognised in respect of employee
benefits, a decrease of £69.7 million over the £224.8 million
as at 31 December 2005. This decrease arises, in respect of
the UK plan, from an increase in the interest rate used to
discount the present value of future liabilities and the
additional ‘top-up’ payments agreed with the Trustee in
February 2006. For the US plans, the decrease arises from
the increase in the discount rate and the freezing of
ongoing accruals for current employees in the two largest
plans. Both of these factors have more than offset the
assumption of increased life expectancy of retirees. Of the
total liability, £78.3 million relates to the deficit on the
Group’s defined benefit pension plan in the UK, £39.8 million
to the Group’s defined benefit pension plans in the US,
£13.6 million to defined benefit pension arrangements in the
Rest of the World, and £23.4 million to unfunded post-
retirement benefit arrangements, being mainly healthcare
benefit arrangements in the US.
Following the disposal of SCS and the announcements of
the disposals of Laminates in December 2005 and the
Ceramic Fibres business in February 2006, and in view of
the increase in the net pension deficit for the UK plan
during 2005, it was agreed with the Trustee of the Group’s
UK plan in February 2006 to make revised ‘top-up’
payments (in addition to the normal cash contributions) of
£25.5 million in 2006 and £26.5 million in 2007 . The level of
these additional ‘top-up’ payments will be reviewed in
consultation with the Trustee when the next triennial
valuation is available in mid-2007.
In order to reduce significantly the future volatility of
the Group’s UK plan, in November 2006 the plan Trustee
implemented risk mitigation elements within its investment
strategy by which it entered into a portfolio of inflation and
interest rate swaps, executed an equity hedge and planned
an increase in its asset diversification. The effect of these
arrangements is to significantly narrow the range of likely
outcomes for the employee benefit deficit, whether arising
from variability in the investment performance of the Plan’s
assets due to the impact of future changes in economic
circumstances, or from other aspects of financial market
pricing which are largely outside of the Group’s control.
These risk mitigation enhancements have not impacted on
the expected return assumptions in the Group’s financial
reporting under the relevant accounting standard.
For the Group’s US pension plans, the net deficit as at
31 December 2006 was £39.8 million (2005: £61.1 million).
Funding of the US plans is made in accordance with US
government regulations. The two principal defined benefit
pension plans in the US are closed to new members and
ongoing accruals for both schemes are being frozen for the
majority of active members with effect from the first
quarter of 2007. Benefits payable under certain post-
retirement healthcare benefit arrangements in the US have
also been amended, which has resulted in a significant
reduction in the net deficit as at 31 December 2006 to
£16.8 million (2005: £25.3 million).
The charge against trading profit in 2006 for all pension
plans (including defined contribution plans) and other post-
retirement plans was £22.3 million, a reduction of £0.4
million compared to 2005. Total pension cash contributions
amounted to £42.4 million in 2006 (2005: £25.9 million).
Summary
The strong trading results for 2006, combined with the
significant reductions in our net debt and pension deficit,
demonstrate that we have made good progress in
implementing our Strategic Plan.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED) CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Policy
Cookson recognises that its operations impact a wide
community of stakeholders, including investors, employees,
customers, business associates and local communities and
that appropriate attention to the fulfilment of its corporate
responsibilities can enhance overall performance. In
structuring its approach to the various aspects of corporate
social responsibility, the Company takes account of
guidelines and statements issued by stakeholder
representatives and other regulatory bodies from around
the world.
Social, environmental and ethical matters are reviewed
by the Board, particularly as regards the impact such
matters may have on the Group’s management of risk and
the internal control systems in place for addressing any
significant associated risks.
Code of Conduct
The Company has a Code of Conduct (“Cookson Code”),
which has been distributed throughout the Group in 12
languages and by which all its businesses are required to
operate. The Cookson Code emphasises the Company’s
commitment to compliance with the highest standards of
legal and ethical behaviour. The Cookson Code is
reproduced in full on the Company’s website.
As stated in the Cookson Code, the primary goal of
Cookson is the protection and advancement of the interests
of investors by providing attractive returns on a long-term
basis. In striving to achieve this goal, management must
conduct its business in a responsible manner, while
engaging in careful risk-taking as an essential ingredient of
business success. The Cookson Code requires that
particular care be given to the preservation and protection
of Group assets by making prudent and effective use of
resources. Long-term customer satisfaction is recognised as
being essential to the attainment of Group goals, which
means listening carefully to customers’ product and service
requirements and maintaining a reputation for integrity in
all business and other dealings.
The Group can only achieve its goals through the efforts
of its employees. Cookson recognises that job satisfaction
requires working environments that motivate employees
to be productive and innovative, and which provide
opportunities for employee training and development to
maximise personal potential and develop careers within the
Group. Cookson believes that wherever in the world they
work employees have the right to be treated in good faith
and on the basis of respect for the dignity of the individual.
The Cookson Code requires all Group companies to ensure
that recruitment, training, promotion, career development,
termination and similar employment-related issues are
based on individual ability, achievement, experience and
conduct without regard to race, colour, nationality, culture,
ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability
or any other reason not related to job performance or
prohibited by applicable law.
The Cookson Code requires all employees, officers and
Directors to have a duty of loyalty to the Group. Individuals
may not use their positions to profit themselves or others at
the expense of the Group. Personal interests that do, may or
might appear to conflict with Group interests or improperly
influence the performance of an individual’s duties must be
avoided at all times.
Cookson seeks to be a good corporate citizen wherever
it conducts business. The Cookson Code requires employees
to observe all national and local laws and never seek to gain
any advantage through the inappropriate use of payments,
business courtesies or other inducements. Bribery is strictly
prohibited. Group businesses must respect and take into
account regional and local concerns, customs and
traditions.
Helpline
Cookson has a 24-hour Employee Business Concern Helpline
telephone and email facility. This is operated by a
professional, external provider of employee support,
counselling and business concern services, which provides
Cookson’s employees and business associates with an
independent and confidential service through which to
register any concerns about any incorrect or irregular
practices they perceive in Cookson’s workplace. With the
express permission of the caller or email correspondent, the
service provider reports any matters raised to a designated
team at Cookson’s Head Office for investigation.
Health, Safety and
Environmental Statement
Policy
Cookson has a Health, Safety and Environment (“HS&E”)
Policy based on the principle of operating in a manner that
preserves health, safety and a sound environment. For
Cookson companies worldwide, the minimum acceptable
standard is to meet their legal HS&E obligations, however,
the aim is to improve continually. Cookson believes that
good HS&E performance is an integral part of effective and
profitable business management. The policy, which is
reviewed regularly, is available in full on the Group’s
website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
Management systems
The Board assumes ultimate responsibility for HS&E policy
and for monitoring its implementation, while executives and
line managers are directly responsible for HS&E matters in
the operations under their control. A reporting system is in
place to collect, collate and report on key performance
indicators. Advice and support is available from the
corporate HS&E function, led by the Group Head of HS&E
who reports on these matters to the Board.
Corporate Responsibility Statement
Cookson Group plc { 33 } Annual Report 2006 Cookson Group plc { 34 } Annual Report 2006
Health, Safety and
Environmental Statement (continued)
Performance
In 2004, Cookson began a new programme to reduce
energy use and the associated emissions of carbon dioxide
(“CO
2
”), the principal greenhouse gas. The programme
trains employees to understand energy use and
conservation principles and introduces energy audits to
assist high-use sites in identifying and implementing
conservation measures. During 2006, Cookson conducted
energy audits and prepared energy use-reduction plans at
14 facilities, typically identifying cost-effective opportunities
to reduce site energy use by 5%. In early 2007, the Group
established a target to reduce normalised energy use by 9%
within 3 years, further demonstrating Cookson’s
commitment to reduced energy use and CO
2
emissions.
During 2006, six additional Cookson locations achieved
certification to ISO 14001, the international standard for
environmental management systems. Likewise, three
additional locations achieved certification to OHSAS 18001,
the standard for health and safety management systems.
A number of Cookson companies in the US have been
named as potentially responsible parties under the
Superfund law for wastes disposed of at sites owned by
third parties. Although likely Group costs depend on many
factors, the few cases that remain active are expected to be
settled within the amounts already provided.
Like many manufacturers, some Group companies have
potential environmental liabilities because of past
operations at their current or former sites. Where
remediation is required, Cookson environmental managers
and external specialists work with government authorities
to ensure that remediation is conducted effectively 
and efficiently.
Compliance
A small number of enforcement notices were issued to
Cookson companies in 2006, including several that
assessed minor penalties. One civil court action for alleged
non-compliance with waste management requirements
associated with managing an inactive site was filed against
a Cookson company in 2006. The company expects to settle
the case in 2007.
REACH
The new European regulation for the Registration, Evaluation,
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) will
have significant implications for Cookson businesses. REACH
requires the registration of some 30,000 chemicals as it
shifts the burden of proving chemical safety to industry,
affecting the availability, cost and conditions of use of many
substances. Cookson and its chemical manufacturing
businesses have launched a major exercise to ensure that the
necessary personnel understand the obligations under
REACH and have the systems in place to meet them. This
includes workshops and conferences using internal experts
and outside consultants to educate and foster collaboration
on methods for compliance.
Workplace
Cookson’s success depends on retaining the commitment of
the people who work within it. The Group strives to ensure
that employees have a safe environment in which to work
and that employment practices are fair and equitable.
Safety
Cookson’s goal is zero work-related injuries and illness. To
achieve this, a worldwide initiative has been implemented to
improve safety performance, with a particular focus on
applying sound risk assessments and ergonomic principles.
The programme includes minimum standards of
performance, targeted assistance to higher risk sites and a
variety of training and awareness activities. From 2002 to
2006, the rate of recordable injuries and illness improved by
55%, and the rate of injuries and illness resulting in absence
from work improved by 59%. In 2006, half of Cookson’s
operations around the world achieved our goal of zero
work-related illness and injuries. To ensure continued
progress, the Group has set a target of a further reduction
in injury and illness rates of 30% by the end of 2009.
During 2006, Cookson continued to focus on the
elimination of work-related injuries through better application
of ergonomic principles. The last four years have seen
extensive ergonomic training throughout the Group and the
establishment of ergonomic teams at a number of facilities,
leading to a significant improvement in their performance.
Additional information on HS&E matters can be found on
the Group’s website.

To the shareholders of Cookson Group plc
The Directors of Cookson Group plc are responsible for
preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements of
the parent company only (“the Company”) and of the
Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”), in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group
and Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the
Group financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the
EU and have elected to prepare the Company financial
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The Group financial statements are required by law and
IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial
position and performance of the Group; the Companies Act
1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial
statements giving a true and fair view are references to
their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company financial statements are required by law
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU;
• for the Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are
also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and financial information included
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can
cause results and developments to differ materially from those
anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge
and information available at the date of preparation of this Annual

Principal activities
Cookson Group plc is a leading materials science company which
provides materials, processes and services to customers
worldwide. The Group’s operations are formed into three divisions
– Ceramics, Electronics and Precious Metals. Known in its markets
as Vesuvius, the Ceramics division is the world leader in the
supply of advanced flow control refractory products and systems
to the global steel industry and a principal supplier of specialist
ceramic products to the glass, solar and foundry industries. It is
also a regional leader in the US, UK and Australia in the supply
and installation of monolithic refractory linings. The Electronics
division is a leading supplier of advanced surface treatment and
plating chemicals and assembly materials to the automotive,
construction and electronics markets. It comprises two sectors:
Assembly Materials and Chemistry. The Precious Metals division
is a leading supplier of fabricated precious metals (primarily gold,
silver and platinum) to the jewellery industry in the US, UK,
France and Spain. Products include alloy materials, semi-finished
jewellery components and finished jewellery.
Business review
As required by the Companies Act 1985, the Company must
provide a fair review of the development and performance of the
Group during 2006, its financial position at the end of the year
and likely future developments in the Group’s business, together
with information on environmental matters and employees and a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the
Group. The information which satisfies these requirements, to the
extent that it is not included in this report, is to be found in the
Chief Executive’s Review on pages 12 to 13; the Operating Review
on pages 14 to 27; the Financial Review on pages 28 to 32; and the
Corporate Social Responsibility section on pages 33 and 34; each
of which is incorporated in this report by reference.
Going concern
The financial statements of the Company and the Group,
respectively, have been prepared on a going concern basis as the
Directors consider that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 2006 of
7.0p (2005: 5.0p) per ordinary share which, if approved, will be
paid on 11 June 2007 to shareholders on the register at 25 May
2007. An interim dividend of 3.0p per ordinary share was paid on
16 October 2006 to shareholders on the register at 29 September
2006, making total dividends of 10.0p per ordinary share for the
year (2005: 5.0p).
Corporate governance
Details are set out in the narrative below of the Company’s
corporate governance procedures and application of the
principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued
by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (“the Code”). The
Company has complied with the provisions of the Code
throughout the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Board
Ultimate responsibility for the management of Cookson rests with
the Board of Directors. The Board focuses primarily upon
strategic and policy issues. It approves the Group’s strategy,
oversees the allocation of resources and monitors the
performance of the Group in pursuit of this.
Membership
The Board currently has seven Directors, comprising the non-
executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance
Director and four non-executive Directors. The Board considers
each of the non-executive Directors, namely Messrs J L Hewitt,
J P Oosterveld, B W Perry and J G Sussens, to be independent of
management and free from any business or other relationship
which could affect the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Company has reviewed the availability of the non-executive
Directors and considers that each of them is able to, and in
practice does, devote the necessary amount of time to the
Company’s business. The Board nominates one of the non-
executive Directors to act as Senior Independent Director and
provide an alternative contact at Board level, other than the
Chairman, to whom shareholder matters can be addressed.
Mr Sussens held this position during the year. The biographical
details of individual Directors are set out on pages 36 and 37.
The Articles of Association of the Company require that
Directors should submit themselves for re-election at least every
three years. None of the Directors are required to retire and offer
themselves for re-election at this year’s AGM.
Responsibilities and meetings
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and
delegates certain matters to committees as outlined below. The
Board met as a full Board on nine scheduled occasions during
2006. Two of these meetings were held at Cookson facilities when
the Board visited Group operations. Board meetings may also be
convened on an ad-hoc basis for non-routine business. In addition,
the Chairman and the non-executive Directors meet routinely on
their own without the executive Directors present and at least once
each year the non-executive Directors meet without the Chairman
present to discuss matters such as the Chairman’s performance.
Specific matters reserved for the Board include: reviewing
Group and divisional performance; approving significant
transactions including acquisitions, divestments and capital
expenditure; setting and approving the Group’s strategy and
annual budget; approving the Group’s financing and treasury
policies; succession planning and approving Board appointments
and the remuneration of the non-executive Directors. In addition
the Board considers health, safety and environmental matters
and reviews the Group’s risk management processes.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the
Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board and is set out in
writing. The Chairman leads the Board and meets routinely with
the Chief Executive and Group Secretary to discuss matters
relating to its efficient functioning. During the year the Chairman
Cookson Group plc { 38 } Annual Report 2006
Directors’ Report
  assumed the Chairmanship of Elementis plc. His appointment was
approved by the Board. He also serves as the Senior Independent
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of
D S Smith plc. The Board considers that the Chairman is able to
and does devote sufficient time to his duties at Cookson.
The attendance of Directors at Board and principal Committee
meetings during the year, together with the maximum number of
meetings in the period when the individual was a Board member
(as shown in brackets), was as follows:

Papers are provided to the Directors in advance of the relevant
Board or committee meeting to enable them to make further
enquiries about any matters prior to the meeting should they so
wish. The Group Secretary oversees the distribution of these papers
and ensures that there is an appropriate level of communication
between the Board and its committees and between senior
management and non-executive Directors. He also keeps the Board
apprised of relevant developments in corporate governance.
Performance evaluation
The Board evaluates its own performance and effectiveness and
assesses the performance of its committees and individual
members on an annual basis. In 2006 the Board as a whole met
to review its performance and that of its committees. The Board
considered that overall it was operating effectively and that all
Directors continued to contribute and were committed to their
roles at Cookson.
The performance of the Chairman was in turn reviewed by the
Senior Independent Director following consultation with other
members of the Board. The Chairman was judged to have
performed satisfactorily.
Induction and training
The Group Secretary ensures that a comprehensive induction
programme is provided to all new Directors, including visits to
manufacturing facilities, meetings with key Group executives and
introductions to the Company’s principal external advisers, as
appropriate. New Directors are also advised of their legal and
other duties and obligations as Directors of a listed company. This
is supplemented by reference materials, which are updated as
required, including information about the Board, the committees,
Directors’ duties, procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares
and other regulatory and governance matters. Directors are
provided with details of seminars and training courses relevant to
their role. They are encouraged to attend these as they consider
appropriate and are supported by the Company in so doing.
Where a general training need is identified, in-house training is
provided to the entire Board, as occurred in 2006. During the
year Directors attended external seminars and other functions
relevant to specific areas of their responsibility.
Relations with shareholders
The Company reports its financial results to shareholders twice a
year, with the publication of its Annual and Interim Reports. In
conjunction with these announcements presentations are made to
institutional investors and analysts, copies of which are posted on
the Group’s website: www.cooksongroup.co.uk. In addition, in 2006
the Company provided trading updates at the Company’s AGM and
in advance of the interim and year-end close-periods, as well as a
strategy and trading update in November 2006. The Company
maintains a regular dialogue with major institutional investors and
regular updates on shareholder issues and discussions are
provided to the Board. Board members also receive copies of
significant analysts’ notes issued on the Company. All Directors
normally attend the Company’s AGM, providing shareholders with
the opportunity to question them about issues relating to the
Group, either during the meeting or informally afterwards.
Board committees
The principal committees of the Board are the Audit,
Remuneration and Nominations Committees. Each committee has
written terms of reference agreed by the Board. These are
available to view on the Company’s website.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee members are the non-executive Directors,
namely Mr J L Hewitt, Mr J P Oosterveld, Mr B W Perry and 
Mr J G Sussens. During the year the Committee was chaired by 
Mr Hewitt. The Board believes Mr Hewitt possesses the relevant
financial experience, as described by the Code.
The Group Finance Director, the Group Head of Internal Audit
and the Company’s Auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, are normally invited
to attend meetings and other executives are invited to attend as
and when appropriate. The Committee meets regularly with the
Company’s Auditor without any executives being present.
Audit Committee report
The principal roles of the Audit Committee are:
• assisting the Board in the discharge of its responsibilities in
respect of statutory and other financial reporting and in
respect of its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal
controls and risk management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal audit function;
• making recommendations to the Board on the appointment and
dismissal of the Auditor;
• approving the remuneration and terms of engagement of the
Auditor;
• monitoring and reviewing the Auditor’s independence,
objectivity and effectiveness, taking into account professional
and regulatory requirements; and
• helping to strengthen the independent position of the Auditor
by providing a direct channel of communication between it and
the non-executive Directors.
The Committee has established procedures for the receipt,
retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company
including accounting, internal controls, auditing matters and
confidential communications from employees.
Cookson Group plc { 39 } Annual Report 2006 The Group Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the
Committee Chairman and the Committee reviews and approves
the internal audit work programme for each year. During the year
under review, the Committee met four times and reviewed,
amongst other matters, the Company’s published financial results;
internal audit reports and management control issues; the scope
of the external audit and its cost effectiveness; and the extent to
which the Auditor’s remuneration for non-audit services might
affect their independence and objectivity in carrying out the audit.
More specifically, the responsibilities of the Committee were
discharged as follows:
• at its meetings in July 2006 and March 2007, the Committee
reviewed the Company’s Interim Report and Preliminary
Results announcement/Annual Report and Accounts,
respectively. On both occasions, the Committee received
reports from the Auditor identifying any accounting or
judgmental issues thereon requiring its attention;
• a quarterly report from the Group Head of Internal Audit was
presented at each of the four meetings. In addition, at the
December 2006 meeting, the Group Head of Internal Audit
submitted the function’s internal audit plan for 2007;
• the Auditor presented its audit plan at the October 2006
meeting;
• following the successful deregistration from the US Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) referred to in further detail
on page 45 and the consequential cessation of the Group’s SEC
reporting requirements, the Committee continued to review the
effectiveness of internal financial controls using an approach
similar to that required by the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations,
whilst also considering the cost-efficiency of related audit
procedures;
• from time to time, executives were required to make
presentations to the Committee or to the full Board on the
identification, management and control of specific areas of risk
which impact the Company and the Group; and
• as a matter of routine, the Committee was presented with
information on any significant litigation involving the Group.
As noted above, one of the duties of the Committee is to make
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of
the Auditor . A number of factors concerning the Auditor are taken
into account by the Committee in assessing whether to
recommend the Auditor for re-appointment, including:
• the quality both of reports provided to the Committee and the
Board and of advice given;
• the level of understanding demonstrated of the Group’s
businesses; and
• the objectivity of the Auditor’s views on the controls around
the Group and its ability to coordinate a global audit, working to
tight deadlines.
The Committee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the
independence of the external audit is not compromised. Such
safeguards include:
• seeking confirmation that the Auditor is independent of the
Company in its own professional judgement; and
• considering all the relationships between the Auditor and the
Group, including those relating to the provision of non-audit
services and whether this impairs, or appears to impair, the
Auditor’s judgement or independence.
The Company has a policy governing the Group-wide conduct
of non-audit work by the Auditor. Under that policy the Auditor is
prohibited from performing services where it:
• may be required to audit its own work;
• would participate in activities that would normally be
undertaken by management;
• is remunerated through a ‘success fee’ structure; or
• acts in an advocacy role for the Group.
Other than the above, the Company does not impose an
automatic prohibition on the Auditor undertaking non-audit work.
The Auditor is permitted to provide non-audit services that are
not, or are not perceived to be, in conflict with auditor
independence, providing it has the skill, competence and integrity
to carry out the work in the best interests of the Group. Details of
the amounts paid to the Auditor during the year for audit and
other services are set out in note 8 on page 71.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the outcome of
the Audit Committee meetings to the Board and the Board
receives the agenda, papers and minutes of Audit Committee
meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee members are the non-executive
Directors, namely Mr J L Hewitt, Mr J P Oosterveld, Mr B W Perry
and Mr J G Sussens who chairs the Committee. The Committee’s
principal roles are to recommend and monitor the level and
structure of remuneration for senior management and to set the
appropriate remuneration for the Group Chairman, executive
Directors and Group Secretary. Further details of the activities of
the Remuneration Committee are provided in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 51.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee reports the
outcome of the Remuneration Committee meetings to the Board.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee advises the Board on appointments
to, and retirements and resignations from, the Board. The
members of the Committee are the Group Chairman, the Chief
Executive and any three non-executive Directors. The Committee
meets as and when required and is chaired by the Group
Chairman or a non-executive Director . The Group Chairman would
not act as Chairman of the Committee where it was dealing with
the appointment of his successor. Formal meetings are held to
consider standing items of business; there is also a significant
level of ad hoc discussion between members of the Committee,
particularly when a recruitment exercise is taking place.
When considering the appointment of new Directors, the
Committee draws up specifications, taking into consideration the
existing balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board
and the ongoing requirements of the Group. It utilises the
services of external recruitment consultants to identify
appropriate candidates, interviews those short-listed and then
makes recommendations for each appointment to the full Board.
Care is taken to ensure that all proposed appointees have
sufficient time available to devote to the role and do not have any
conflicts of interest. The Nominations Committee reviews the
Company’s succession plans. The Board as a whole also considers
this subject. The Chairman of the Nominations Committee
reports the outcome of the Nominations Committee meetings to
the Board.
Cookson Group plc { 40 } Annual Report 2006
Directors’ Report (continued) Finance and Share Schemes Committees
The Board delegates certain responsibilities on an ad hoc basis to
the Finance and Share Schemes Committees.
The Finance Committee is chaired by the Group Chairman, its
other members being the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director
and Group Treasurer . The Committee meets as and when required

Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and comprises the
Group Finance Director, the Group Secretary and the Chief
Executives of each of the Group’s three divisions. Specific
authority has been delegated to the Central Executive comprising
the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Secretary.

the Auditor about its reporting responsibilities can be found on
pages 35 and 52, respectively. The Directors fulfill the
responsibilities set out in their statement within the context of an
overall control environment of central strategic direction and
decentralised operating responsibility.
Disclosure of information to the Auditor
As at the date of this report, so far as each Director of the
Company is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which
the Company’s Auditor is unaware and each Director hereby
confirms that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is
aware of that information.
Auditor
Resolutions for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as Auditor
of the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine its
remuneration are to be proposed at the AGM.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Throughout its global operations, Cookson faces various risks,
both internal and external, which could have a material impact on
the Group’s long-term performance. Cookson manages the risks
inherent in its operations in order to mitigate exposure to all
forms of risk, where practical, and to transfer risk to insurers,
where cost effective.
Global economic, political and operational risks
With operations worldwide, the Group’s businesses are subject to
various risks inherent in their international operations, including
economic, political and operational risks.
The diverse nature of Cookson’s products and services, and
customers and markets served, helps to mitigate the impact of
any individual exposure to economic conditions. Political risks
include the imposition of trade barriers, changes of regulatory
requirements and the volatility of prices, taxes and currencies.
The Group is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes,
including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
The Group’s businesses are subject to a variety of operational
risks, the occurrence of which could result in a substantial
interruption to a facility and a potential loss of customers and
revenue, which may materially impact the trading results of
individual facilities, though not necessarily of the Group as a
whole. The Group is exposed to possible natural catastrophe risk
and possible terrorist action. Management monitors such risks,
maintaining what it considers to be adequate insurance cover and
adopting business practices as appropriate to mitigate exposure.
New products, technology and other market risks
The Group supplies materials and services primarily to the steel
and electronics industries on a global basis and to the jewellery
industry primarily in the US and Europe. These markets and
economies are subject to cyclical changes in demand and to
associated pricing pressures. Furthermore, the markets in which
many of the Group’s businesses operate can experience rapid
changes due to the introduction of new technologies. The Group’s
continued success depends upon its ability to continue to develop
and produce new and enhanced products and services on a cost-
effective and timely basis in accordance with customer demands.
In addition, the markets for the Group’s products are competitive
in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product
development and introduction time, customer service, financing
terms and other similar factors. Cookson invests significant
amounts in research and development to sustain its competitive
advantage and takes appropriate action to ensure that its cost
base remains competitive.
Legislation and regulatory risk
Cookson’s operations are affected by various statutes,
regulations and laws in the countries and markets in which it
operates. Cookson cannot predict whether future developments
in laws and regulations concerning its businesses will affect the
demands of regulatory agencies in a manner which could
adversely impact the Group.
Intellectual property risks
The Group relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents,
confidentiality procedures and agreements, and copyright and
trade mark laws to protect its proprietary rights. If the Group fails
to or is unable to protect, maintain and enforce its existing
intellectual property, it may result in the loss of the Group’s
exclusive right to use technologies and processes which are
included or used in its businesses. The Group’s involvement in
intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense,
and/or materially adversely affect the development of sales of the
challenged product or intellectual property. All appropriate
measures are taken to protect the Group’s intellectual property
rights and to minimise the risk of infringement of third-party rights.
Raw materials risk
Tin, solvents, alumina, graphite, silver and gold are among the
principal raw materials that the Group purchases. The Group’s
businesses may be affected by fluctuations in the price and
supply of such raw materials, although purchasing policies and
practices seek to mitigate, where practicable, such risks and the
Group’s geographical and product diversity reduces the
Cookson Group plc { 41 } Annual Report 2006 dependence on any single item or supplier. The Group’s ability to
pass on increases or decreases in the cost of raw materials to its
customers is, to a large extent, dependent upon market
conditions, established market practice and terms of trade.
Environmental and health and safety risks
The Group is subject to applicable laws and regulations in all of
the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to
pollution, the protection of the environment, human health and
safety, the disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials
and remediation of any land or water contaminated by such
substances. Violations of legal or other regulatory requirements
could result in restrictions on plant operations, the imposition of
more stringent permitting conditions, damages, fines or other
sanctions. The practices and processes of Cookson’s businesses
are subject to routine inspections by internal qualified personnel
and by external regulatory or other enforcement bodies.
Provision is made for identified remediation obligations related to
contaminated sites based on a reasonable assessment of the
likely costs of rectification.
Product liability risk
A large proportion of the Group’s products are used in the
manufacturing processes of the Group’s industrial customers. If a
product of the Group or of the Group’s industrial customer does
not conform to agreed specifications or is otherwise defective,
the Group may be subject to claims by its customers arising from
end-product defects, injury to individuals or other such claims.
The Group’s current and former businesses have used and/or
continue to use a wide range of hazardous materials, in the
manufacture of industrial and consumer products. Legal claims
have been brought against certain Group companies by third-
parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to
such materials, and further claims may be brought in the future.
Two of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to suits in the US
relating to a small number of products containing asbestos
manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by 
the Group. These suits also name many other product
manufacturers. To date, there have been no liability verdicts
against any of these subsidiaries.
Provision is made for amounts payable in respect of known or
probable costs. Management believes, taking into account legal
advice received and the Group’s insurance arrangements and
financial provisions, that none of the currently pending or
potential claims will, either individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial position or
trading results. However, the outcome of legal action is uncertain
and there is always the risk that it may prove more costly than
expected and exceed the level of insurance cover and provisions
made, resulting in such a material adverse impact.
Warranties and liabilities relating to divestments
The Group has divested its interests in certain companies and
businesses and has given indemnifications, representations and
warranties with respect to the businesses of the divested
companies at the time of their divestment. Management believes
that sufficient provisions are in place to meet possible claims
resulting from these indemnifications, representations and
warranties, however, significant liabilities arising out of these
transactions may arise in future which have not been provided for .
Post-employment benefit plans
The Group operates defined benefit pension and other post-
retirement plans, principally in the UK and US, the valuation of
which reflected a deficit of £155.1 million as at 31 December 2006.
The funding level of the Group’s pension plans and the Group’s
liabilities in respect of its post-retirement healthcare plans are
subject to adverse change resulting from movements in the
actuarial assumptions underlying the calculation of plan
liabilities, including decreasing discount rates, increasing
longevity of plan members and, in the case of pension plans, a
decline in the market value of plan investments. Significant
adverse changes in these underlying factors could materially
impact the Group’s financial position. The Group’s largest defined
benefit pension plans are in the UK and US, each of which is
closed to new members, with the Group’s largest US plan also
being closed to further benefit accrual for existing members. The
Group’s main pension plan is its UK plan, which had a deficit of
£78.3 million at the end of 2006. Deficit-reduction contributions
of £26.5 million per annum in addition to the normal cash
contributions are being made under the terms of a repayment
schedule agreed with the plan Trustee in February 2006. To
reduce future volatility in the UK plan deficit, the UK plan Trustee,
with support from the Company, entered into swap arrangements
and an equity hedge in November 2006 to mitigate significantly
the impact of changes in interest rates and inflation on the UK
plan’s liabilities and volatility in the equity performance of the
plan’s assets.
Compliance with covenants in debt agreements
The Group’s ability to meet the financial ratios and tests and
comply with covenants contained in its current or future debt
agreements could be affected by a material adverse change in
the financial position of the Group. In the event of a default under
any of its financing arrangements, the Group’s lenders could
terminate their commitments to lend to the Group or accelerate
the repayment of debt and declare all amounts borrowed due 
and payable.
Precious metal consignment arrangements
The Group’s precious metal fabrication operations utilise
significant quantities of precious metals, primarily gold by value.
These metals are held on consignment arrangements, details of
which are given in note 27 on page 82. The utilisation of
consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious
metals industry. Should precious metals consignors decide to
reduce or withdraw the facilities for whatever reason, or require
a return of the consigned metal, the Group’s precious metal
fabrication operations may suffer shortages of raw materials or
may require precious metals to be supplied in a way which could
materially increase Group borrowings and costs.
Currency exchange rates, inflation and interest rate risk
The Group has no control over changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, or inflation and interest rates. In the normal
course of business, transactions are carried out by Group
companies in currencies other than their reporting currency,
leading to transactional foreign exchange risk, although these are
not material for the Group overall. It is Cookson policy that
foreign currency transaction exposures that are material at an
individual operating unit level are hedged using appropriate
instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts. While
the Group attempts to manage transactional and balance sheet
Cookson Group plc { 42 } Annual Report 2006
Directors’ Report (continued) translation risks associated with currency exchange rate
fluctuations through its hedging and funding policies,
fluctuations in the value of currencies in which it operates may
nevertheless adversely impact the Group’s financial position and
trading results. The Group does not currently hedge translation
exposures arising on unremitted non-UK earnings.
Where appropriate, the Group manages its interest rate
exposures using interest rate swap agreements or other
instruments; however fluctuations in interest rates could
adversely impact the Group’s financial results. Significant interest
rate and currency hedging programmes require the approval of
the Finance Committee of the Board.
Credit risk
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit
risk, represented by the loss that would be recognised should a
counterparty fail to perform as contracted. The counterparties to
the Group’s financial instruments are reputable financial
institutions and the credit rating of these counterparties is
monitored on a regular basis in accordance with Board-approved
guidelines. Further information relating to the Group’s financial
risk management can be found in note 4 on pages 66 and 67 and
in note 36 on pages 88 to 90.
Internal control
The Directors are responsible for the establishment and
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal control.
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code on
internal control which require that the Directors review the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, including
financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk
management systems. Whilst no system of internal control can
provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or
loss, the Group’s system is designed to provide the Directors with
reasonable assurance that problems are identified on a timely
basis and are dealt with appropriately. Since the date of the
review, there have been no significant changes in internal
controls or other matters which could significantly affect them.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by Cookson. Group
management operates a risk management process designed to
identify the key risks facing each business and reports to the Audit
Committee on how those risks are being managed. As a basis for
this report, each of the Group’s major business units produces a
‘risk map’ which identifies their key risks and assesses the likelihood
of those risks occurring, their impact if they do occur and the
actions being taken to manage those risks to a desired level.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by
the Group’s Internal Audit function, which operates on a global
basis. This function assists management and the Board in the
effective discharge of their responsibility for internal control by
conducting reviews of Cookson businesses and reporting
objectively both on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system
of internal control in place and as to whether those businesses
are in compliance with applicable Group policies and procedures.
The Group Head of Internal Audit is responsible for developing
the function, within the framework of common Group policies and
standards, and for carrying out assignments in accordance with
an annual audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee receives reports from the Group Head of Internal
Audit on a regular basis and reports to the Board on the results
of its review.
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the effectiveness
of the system of internal control, it delegates the following
matters to the Audit Committee to be carried out during the year:
• review of external and internal audit work plans;
• consideration of reports from management and internal audit
on the system of internal control and any material control
weaknesses; and
• discussions with management on the actions taken on problem
areas identified by Board members, in internal audit reports or
in external audit management letters.
In addition to the above, the Board considers significant
financing and investment decisions concerning the Group,
including the giving of guarantees and indemnities, and monitors
policy and control mechanisms for managing treasury risk. The
Board also reviews the role of insurance and other measures used
in managing risks across the Group, receives regular reports on
any major issues that have arisen during the year and makes an
annual assessment of how the risks have changed over the period
under review.
At the year end, following the review by the Audit Committee
of internal financial controls and of the processes covering other
controls, the Board evaluates the results of the internal control
and risk management procedures conducted by senior
management. This includes a self-certification exercise by which
they certify the effectiveness of the system of internal controls
within the businesses for which they are responsible, together
with their compliance throughout the year with the Group’s
policies and procedures.
Remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive Directors
The Board considers the remuneration policy for the non-
executive Directors. Non-executive Directors’ fees were increased
with effect from 1 May 2006 from £30,000 to £40,000 per
annum. A supplementary fee is payable to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee of £15,000 per annum. The Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee receives a supplementary fee of
£10,000 per annum. A supplementary fee of £5,000 per annum
is payable to the Senior Independent Director. No changes were
made in 2006 to the supplementary fees payable.
The Group Chairman’s remuneration, which is subject to
periodic review, is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
There was no change to the Group Chairman’s remuneration,
which was reviewed during the year . Neither the Group Chairman,
who is not an executive Director, nor the other non-executive
Directors are members of the Group’s pension plans, nor do they
participate in the Group’s incentive schemes.
Legal matters
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group
Secretary. There is also an agreed procedure in place for
Directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent
legal advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Remuneration matters
The Directors’ Remuneration Report appears on pages 46 to 51.
Donations
Donations in the UK for charitable purposes totalled £0.1m (2005:
£0.1m); and such donations throughout the Group totalled £0.1m
(2005: £0.1m). In accordance with Company policy, no political
donations were made in either 2006 or 2005.
Cookson Group plc { 43 } Annual Report 2006 Creditor payment policy
Each operating company in the Group is responsible for agreeing
the terms and conditions under which business transactions with
their suppliers are conducted. It is Group policy that payments 
to suppliers are made in accordance with these terms, provided
that the supplier is also complying with all relevant terms 
and conditions. In the accounts of the Company as at 
31 December 2006, the number of days’ purchases outstanding
was 22 (2005: 19 days).
Employment policies
A fundamental concept embodied in the Company’s Code of
Conduct is that Cookson’s goals can only be met through the
efforts of its employees. Cookson recognises that job satisfaction
requires working environments that motivate employees to be
productive and innovative and provide opportunities for
employee training and development to maximise personal
potential and develop careers within the Group.
Cookson is managed on a decentralised basis and within
each division it is the responsibility of the relevant divisional
Chief Executive to adopt employment policies and practices that
best suit the size, style and geographical location of their
operations. This allows the Group’s operations to respond
competitively to changes in the marketplace and to develop and
retain a strong sense of identity whilst benefiting from being a
part of a major international group. Cookson values the
involvement of its employees and keeps them informed on
matters affecting them as employees and factors relevant to the
performance of the Group.
It is established policy throughout Cookson that decisions on
recruitment, career development, training, promotion and other
employment-related issues are made solely on grounds of
individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct. These
principles are operated on a non-discriminatory basis. Cookson
gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment
from disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled
during their employment with Cookson, every effort is made to
enable them to continue their service with the Group.
Pensions
In each country in which the Group operates, the pension
arrangements in place are considered to be consistent with good
employment practice in that particular area. Independent
advisers are used to ensure that the plans are operated in
accordance with local legislation and the rules of each plan.
Group policy prohibits direct investment of pension fund assets in
its own businesses. Outside the UK and the US, the majority of
pension plans in the Group are of a defined contribution nature.
In 2004, the Group closed its UK defined benefit plan to new
entrants and, with effect from 1 January 2006, the Group’s main
US defined benefit plan was closed to new entrants. During the
first quarter of 2007, the Group’s two largest US defined pension
plans have ceased providing future benefit accrual, with members
instead being provided with a broadly equivalent benefit through
a defined contribution plan. Benefit accrual under the Group’s UK
defined benefit pension plan continues for those employees who
joined prior to the closure of the plan to new entrants. Defined
contribution plans exist for new employees in the UK and the US.
For the Group’s UK defined benefit and defined contribution
plans a Trustee board is appointed by the Company. This
comprises employees, former employees and an independent
trustee. This structure has been accepted by the members of each
plan under the 1997 regulations concerning Member Nominated
Trustees. The administration of each plan is outsourced.
The Company is mindful of its obligations under the Pensions
Act 2004 and of the need to comply with the guidance issued by
the Pensions Regulator. Regular dialogue is maintained between
the Company and the Trustee board of the UK plans to ensure
that both Company and Trustee are apprised of the same
financial and other information about the Group and the plans
which is pertinent to each being able to contribute to the
effective functioning of the plans. The Company currently has in
place a schedule of contributions, agreed with the Trustee board,
which aims to reduce to zero the deficit existing on the UK
defined benefit plan as at 31 December 2005 within five years
from that date. The adequacy of this schedule of contributions
will be monitored over time, so as to assess the need for it to 
be modified should the deficit position change compared to
current expectations.
All US retirement plan assets are held in trust for the
exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries. An
independent financial institution acts as the trustee. The trust
assets are protected by law and by Federal Government
Regulation and are subject to annual audit by an independent
accountant, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of
Labor. Further details of pension arrangements are given in note
37 on pages 90 to 96.
Directors
Biographical information for the current Directors of the
Company is given on pages 36 and 37.
The interests of Directors and their related parties in the
ordinary shares of the Company, all of which are beneficial, as
disclosed in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, are as set
out on page 50 and details of the Directors’ long-term incentive
awards are set out on page 51.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s Directors are indemnified under the Company’s
Articles of Association.
Share capital
Details of movements in the Company’s issued share capital
during the year are given in note 13 on pages 109 and 110.
As at 1 January 2006, the Company’s issued equity share
capital amounted to £375.5 million and comprised 190.4 million
ordinary shares of 10p with an aggregate nominal value of £19.0
million and 727.6 million deferred shares of 49p with an
aggregate nominal value of £356.5 million.
On 12 January 2006, the Company held an Extraordinary
General Meeting to seek shareholders’ approval to amend the
Company’s Articles of Association to facilitate termination of its
registration with the SEC and to effect a reduction of its share
capital. The Company duly gained approval to cancel and
extinguish its 727.6 million deferred shares of 49p each and to
cancel its share premium account. In addition, shareholders
approved the cancellation of six ordinary shares of 1p each, which
had been retained in the Company’s authorised but unissued
share capital, following the share consolidation in May 2005.
Following the approval of these resolutions, the Company applied
Cookson Group plc { 44 } Annual Report 2006
Directors’ Report (continued) to the High Court to effect the cancellation of this share capital.
On 15 February 2006, the High Court of Justice confirmed the
reduction of capital of the Company. The Order of the Court was
registered on 15 February 2006 and the reduction of capital was
therefore effective on that date.
As at 31 December 2006, the Company’s issued equity share
capital amounted to £19.3 million and comprised 193.4 million
ordinary shares of 10p.
Since the year end, 111,045 ordinary shares have been issued
as a result of exercises of options granted under the Company’s
share option schemes. Resolutions giving the Directors the
authority to allot further shares and make allotments of shares to
persons other than existing shareholders in certain circumstances
will again be proposed at the AGM.
SEC deregistration
On 21 February 2006, the Company filed a Form 15 with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to terminate the
SEC registration of its ordinary shares. SEC deregistration
occurred 90 days after this date. The Company is now exempt
from SEC reporting requirements.
Under the applicable SEC regulations, the number of
US-resident shareholders, whether holding directly or through
nominees, had to be less than 300 in order for the Group to
qualify for deregistration. At an Extraordinary General Meeting
held on 12 January 2006, shareholders approved amendments to
the Articles of Association giving the Board the ability to limit the
number of US-resident shareholders. The amended Articles allow
the Board to require US-resident shareholders, whether holding
directly or through nominees, to sell their shares. Prior to filing
for deregistration, the Board exercised these provisions in
respect of a number of US-resident shareholders in order to
decrease their total number to below 300.
Under the presently applicable SEC regulations, the number
of US-resident shareholders also has to remain below 300 at each
fiscal year-end to avoid re-commencement of SEC reporting and
other applicable US obligations. On 21 February 2006, the
Company announced that, pursuant to the amended Articles, the
Board may, from time to time, continue to require US-resident
shareholders (whether holding ordinary shares directly or
through nominees) to sell their shares in order to be satisfied that
their number is less than 300 at each fiscal year-end. The
Company exercised these provisions in respect of a number of
US-resident shareholders in December 2006.
On 22 December 2006, the SEC re-proposed rules that would
make it easier for non-US companies to deregister and remain
deregistered from the SEC. At this time the rules continue to
remain in proposal form only. It is not clear when and in what
form the SEC will finalise any such rules. The Company will keep
the position under review and in the meantime continues to
comply with all existing regulations to ensure that it remains
deregistered from the SEC.
Events after the balance sheet date
On 1 February 2007, the sale of Monofrax Inc. to RHI AG was
completed. The purchase price of US$45m, which is subject to
finalisation of the value of pension and other post-retirement
obligations and working capital balances, was satisfied by the
assumption by RHI AG of pension and other post-retirement
obligations of US$10m, with the balance of US$35m satisfied in cash.
Authority for purchase of own shares
At the 2006 AGM, shareholders gave the Company renewed
authority to make market purchases of up to a maximum of 10%
at that time of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. As at
the date of this report, the Company has made no such purchases
under this authority. The Directors believe it advisable to seek
renewal of this authority at each AGM.
Substantial interests
As at the date of this report, the Company has been notified in
accordance with section 198 to section 208 of the Companies Act
1985 or, alternatively, DTR 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency
Rules of the following interests in its issued ordinary shares:

Richard M H Malthouse
Group Secretary
13 March 2007
Cookson Group plc { 45 } Annual Report 2006 The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible for
recommending and monitoring the level and structure of
remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of
management below Board level, and setting the appropriate
remuneration for the Group Chairman, the executive Directors and
the Group Secretary. A copy of the Committee’s T erms of Reference
is available on the Group’s website at: www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
The current members of the Committee are all the non-
executive Directors, namely Mr J L Hewitt, Mr J P Oosterveld, Mr
B W Perry and Mr J G Sussens, who also chairs the Committee. All
the members of the Committee are independent. The Chairman,
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director are invited to attend
Committee meetings as appropriate.
In formulating its policies and deciding individual remuneration
levels, the Committee was advised during the year by the Chief
Executive, the Group Secretary and by the external advisers Kepler
Associates (“KA”) and New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (“NBS”),
and the law firms McDermott Will & Emery UK LLP (“MWE”) and
Clifford Chance LLP (“CC”). KA, NBS and MWE were appointed
directly by the Committee and CC was appointed by the Company
on its behalf. NBS, MWE, and CC also provide other limited advice to
the Group, in their specialist areas of share valuation, employment
law and share schemes respectively.
Remuneration policy for executive Directors
The Committee has established employment and remuneration
practices for the Company’s executive Directors aimed at fostering
a high performance culture. In formulating remuneration policy,
the Committee has regard to the international scale and nature of
the Group’s operations and takes into consideration guidelines
issued by its leading shareholders and bodies such as the
Institutional Shareholders’ Committee, the Association of British
Insurers (“ABI”) and the National Association of Pension Funds.
The remuneration packages of the executive Directors have been
designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of remuneration
is linked to performance.
In 2006, the Committee appointed KA to undertake a review
of the Group’s executive remuneration policy to ensure that it
continues to provide a strong alignment with the delivery of value
to shareholders and reflects current best practice, while meeting
Cookson’s particular business needs and enabling Cookson to
attract, retain and motivate the talent it requires. The review
demonstrated that the overall remuneration package is
competitive in terms of both structure and quantum. However,
the review concluded that certain changes should be made to the
Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The Committee decided to broaden the performance
condition that applies to both Matching and Performance Shares
under the LTIP by including Group Headline Earnings per Share
(“Headline EPS”) growth. For future awards, vesting of Matching
and Performance Shares will be based 50% on Total Shareholder
Return (“TSR” – defined as the increase in the value of a share,
including reinvested dividends) and 50% on Headline EPS
growth. The two measures will operate independently. The
Committee considers that the use of TSR relative to the FTSE 250
excluding Investment Trusts aligns participants’ interests with
those of Cookson’s shareholders and represents an objective
measure of the Company’s success. The Committee reviewed a
number of indices and alternative comparator groups for the
purposes of benchmarking Cookson’s TSR, but concluded that the
FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts remains the most robust
and meaningful comparator group for Cookson at this time.
Headline EPS growth will complement relative TSR and reflects
the Group’s strategy to enhance profitability and manage costs.
The Committee believes that this blend of measures will provide
an improved balance between absolute and relative performance.
In addition, the Committee has determined that going
forward, in order to further align executive and shareholder
interests, participants in the LTIP should also receive the accrued
dividends on any shares that vest.
Annual salary and benefits in kind
Base salary is set by reference to market rates in the relevant
country for jobs of similar complexity and responsibility. The
salaries of the Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director are benchmarked against the salaries of two FTSE 250
comparator groups, the first focusing on sector comparators and
the second on companies of similar size. The sector comparator
group currently comprises: Abbot Group, Aga Foodservice 
Group, Bodycote International, Carillion, Charter, Cobham,
Electrocomponents, Enodis, GKN, Halma, IMI, Invensys, John
Wood Group, Laird Group, Meggitt, Mitie Group, Morgan Crucible,
Spectris, Tomkins and the Weir Group. The size comparator group
currently comprises: Aggreko, BBA Aviation, Carillion,
Countrywide, De La Rue, Electrocomponents, Go-Ahead Group,
Intertek Group, John Wood Group, Johnston Press, Marston’s,
Meggitt, Misys, MyTravel Group, QinetiQ, RHM, SIG, Spectris,
Taylor Nelson Sofres, and the Weir Group. The salaries of
individual executive Directors are normally reviewed on
1 January each year. With effect from 1 January 2007 Messrs
Butterworth and Salmon were awarded increases of 10.7% and
3% respectively, following a review of market data.
Benefits in kind receivable by the executive Directors
principally comprise company car allowances, life assurance
benefits and medical and disability insurance. These benefits are
similar to those provided to other company executives in the UK.
Variable remuneration
The remuneration programme is structured such that variable,
performance-related remuneration potentially represents more
than half of total remuneration.
Annual incentive
In line with the Group’s other senior executives, the executive
Directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive calculated as
a percentage of base salary and based on achievement against
specified financial targets. Each year the Committee establishes
the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year . These
criteria are set by reference to the Group’s financial budget and
prior year actual financial results.
The Annual Incentive has a Threshold level of performance
below which no award is paid, a Target level at which executive
Directors are entitled to a payment equal to 50% of their base
salary and a Maximum performance level at which a maximum
award worth 100% of base salary is earned.
For the financial year 2006, the executive Directors’ Annual
Incentive awards were based on Group Headline Earnings
performance (the calculation of which is shown in note 17 to the
consolidated financial statements). For 2006, the Group as a whole
exceeded the Maximum level of performance and so maximum
annual bonuses were paid to the executive Directors for 2006.
These are reported in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 50.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for 2007
the executive Directors’ Annual Incentive will again be based on
Group Headline Earnings.
Cookson Group plc { 46 } Annual Report 2006
Directors’ Remuneration Report Long-term incentive
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) was introduced in 2004 and is the only long-term incentive plan under which awards are made
to the executive Directors. It rewards executives for delivering superior TSR and (from 2007 onwards) Headline EPS growth, and as
such is intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders’ interests.
The LTIP has two elements: firstly, executive Directors are eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares worth up to
100% of base salary (“Performance Shares”); secondly, executive Directors can elect to invest all or part of their Annual Incentive in
ordinary shares of the Company (“Bonus Investment Shares”) in return for which they receive a conditional allocation of shares worth
up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the Annual Incentive so invested (“Matching Shares”).
Performance Shares and Matching Shares can vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based on the
Company’s performance against specified performance conditions. For awards made in 2004, 2005 and 2006 vesting is based upon
the Group’s three-year TSR performance (as explained in more detail below) relative to that of the companies of its comparator group,
the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts.
Allocations were made under the LTIP to the executive Directors in April 2006, as shown in the table on page 51. Both 
Mr Butterworth and Mr Salmon purchased Bonus Investment Shares under the Matching Share element of the LTIP in 2006. In addition
to the executive Directors, senior divisional and corporate executives are allocated Performance Shares under the LTIP and members
of the Group’s Executive Committee are also given the opportunity to participate in the Matching Shares element.
Vesting of the Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2004, 2005 and 2006 LTIP awards will be as follows:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares vesting ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares vesting percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below Median 0% 0
Median 25% 0.5:1
Upper Quintile (top 20%) 100% 2.25:1
Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Pro rata between 0.5:1 and 2.25:1
For 2007 the Remuneration Committee has broadened the performance condition by including Headline EPS growth. Vesting of 50% of
shares awarded will therefore be based on the TSR performance measure described above and 50% on Headline EPS growth over a three-
year period. The two measures will operate independently. In addition, participants will receive the dividend accrued on any awards that vest.
Vesting of the portion of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007 LTIP awards which is based on TSR
performance will be according to the following schedule:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Performance shares vesting Matching Shares vesting ratio compared to total pre-tax
excluding Investment Trusts as a percentage of total award investment bonus (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below Median 0% 0
Median 12.5% 0.25:1
Upper Quintile (top 20%) 50% 1.125:1
Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Vesting of the portion of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007 LTIP awards which is based on Headline EPS
growth will be according to the following schedule:
Performance Shares vesting Matching Shares vesting ratio compared to total pre-tax
Annual compound headline EPS growth above RPI as a percentage of total award investment bonus (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below 3%0% 0
At 3% 12.5% 0.25:1
At or above 10% 50% 1.125:1
Between 3% and 10% Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Matching Share awards will only vest if the Bonus Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
The Committee will obtain independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the TSR performance condition at
the end of the performance period and to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the measurement of the Company’s
performance are both in accordance with the rules of the LTIP. Measurement of the Group’s TSR will take place over a performance
period commencing on the first day of Cookson’s financial year in which the award is granted. Thus, for grants made in 2006, the
performance period commenced on 1 January 2006 and will end three years later, i.e. 31 December 2008. TSR will be measured as the
percentage increase in a return index (net of tax) between the beginning and end of the performance period. The return index at the
beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start
of the performance period. The same three-month averaging method will be used to ascertain the return index at the end of the
performance period. The companies will then be ranked, in descending order, according to their TSR. If Cookson is ranked at or above
median against the comparator group then some proportion of the awards will be eligible to vest.
Cookson Group plc { 47 } Annual Report 2006 The Group’s Headline EPS will be calculated on a consistent basis and the Committee will have discretion to adjust for exceptional
items as it deems appropriate. Growth in Headline EPS will be annualised percentage growth over the performance period (comparing
Headline EPS for the base year and final year), expressed as compound annual growth, above the compound annual growth in the Retail
Prices Index (“RPI”).
Prior to the vesting of any award, the Committee has also stipulated that, as an additional hurdle, it will need to be satisfied that
vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period.
In prior years the Group operated a number of other executive and all employee share plans under which certain awards and
options are outstanding, although neither of the current executive Directors hold options or awards under the relevant plans. Under
the executive share option schemes the Company granted share options, with an option exercise price fixed by reference to the market
price prevailing at the time of grant, the exercise of which were subject to an EPS performance condition. The last executive share
option grant was made in 2003 and the Company does not intend to make any further grants under the schemes.
Under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan (“MTI Plan”) executives were eligible to receive a bonus (paid partly in cash and partly in
deferred shares) based upon the achievement of target financial performance, measured over a three-year period. The MTI Plan
operated on a rolling three-year basis and the final remaining cycle culminated at the end of 2005.
Both the executive share option schemes and the MTI Plan were replaced by the Group's LTIP. In addition the Group operated a UK
and International Sharesave Plan and a US Stock Purchase Plan. These plans were all closed to new participants in 2004. Further
details of the awards and options outstanding under these share plans are given in note 15 to the Company Financial Statements.
For 2007 the Group intends to implement a new Deferred Bonus Plan in place of the LTIP for certain Corporate managers. Under
this plan executives will receive an allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. These shares, which
will be sourced from existing shares, will vest after three years, although an executive's allocation may lapse if he ceases employment
in certain circumstances before the end of the three-year period. The executive Directors will not participate in this plan. It is
anticipated that approximately 20,000 shares will be allocated under the Deferred Bonus Plan in 2007.
Performance graph
The graph below compares Cookson’s Total Shareholder Return over the last five years with the return on the FTSE 250 Index
(excluding Investment Trusts). This index has been chosen as the comparator index to reflect the size, international scope and diversity
of the Group’s businesses and is the comparator group against which Cookson’s performance is measured for the TSR performance
condition of the LTIP.
Dilution limits
The rules of each of Cookson’s share-based incentive schemes, including the LTIP, and the pre-existing share option and employee
share savings schemes, contain limitations to the total number of options over new shares that can be awarded in accordance with the
ABI guidelines.
Shareholding guidelines
The Remuneration Committee encourages executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to
at least one times salary. To this end, executive Directors will normally only be able to sell a maximum of up to 50% (measured as the
value after tax) of any Performance Shares or Matching Shares vesting under the LTIP, until this criterion has been met.

Directors’ service contracts
Both of the executive Directors have contractual notice periods from the Company of 12 months. Neither of the executive Directors’
contracts contains any change of control provisions and they both contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an alternative
paid occupation in any period during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination. A summary of the
main conditions of the contracts of the Directors is as follows:
Executive Directors
Both of the current executive Directors have UK service contracts which have 12 months unexpired terms and provide for 12 months’
notice being given. Mr Salmon’s contract was dated 14 June 2004 and Mr Butterworth’s 25 May 2005. Each contract provides for
compensation to be paid on early termination by the Company based on one times salary, pension allowance and benefits payable half
in a lump sum and the balance in six separate monthly instalments commencing six months after leaving, mitigated by any salary
earned from new paid occupation.
Non-executive Directors
In accordance with the Code, each non-executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years subject to their election
at the Company’s first AGM following their appointment. Thereafter, subject to approval of the Board and their re-election at the
appropriate AGM, they are appointed for a further three-year term. Non-executive Directors are not entitled to receive compensation
for loss of office at any time.

The Group Chairman, Mr Beeston, was appointed on 1 April 2003 for a fixed period which expires at the conclusion of the AGM in
2008. He is entitled to 12 months’ notice from the Company. Any compensation for loss of office would be based upon his annual fee.
All Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Board sets the remuneration of the non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and
the practice of other companies. The non-executive Directors do not participate in Board discussions on their own remuneration. The
Group Chairman’s remuneration is set by the Remuneration Committee.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as non-executive directors of other companies provided that these do not lead to
conflicts of interest. The Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis. Fees received are retained by the executive
Director concerned. In 2006, Mr Salmon received fees of £50,000 for his role as non-executive director of United Utilities plc.
No Directors had any material interest in a contract of significance (other than service agreements) with the Company or any
subsidiary company during the year.
Pension arrangements
Messrs Butterworth and Salmon are not entitled to participate in any of the Group’s pension arrangements. In accordance with their
contracts they receive pension allowances of 25% of their respective base salaries to enable them to make their own pension provision.
Mr Butterworth’s pension allowance in 2006 amounted to £64,375 (2005: £33,854), whilst Mr Salmon’s pension allowance in 2006
amounted to £119,375 (2005: £115,875). This information is audited by the Company’s Auditor. Directors’ remuneration

Notes
1. The allocations were calculated based upon the closing mid-market price of Cookson shares on the day before the awards were
made. The 2006 allocations were made to Messrs Butterworth and Salmon on 6 April 2006. Cookson’s mid-market closing price on
this date was 545.5p.
2. The 2004 and April 2005 market prices shown for shares on the date before the awards have been multiplied by 10 to reflect the
impact of the share consolidation on 26 May 2005 on the Company’s share price. On this date every 10 ordinary 1p shares held by
shareholders were exchanged for 1 new 10p ordinary share.
3. The performance criteria which apply to the vesting of these share allocations are summarised on page 47 and 48.
4. The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2004 ended on 31 December 2006. The company’s TSR performance during
the 3-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance
was below median. Accordingly the 2004 LTIP awards will not vest on 29 July 2007 and the awards will lapse.
5. The information in the above table is audited by the Company’s Auditor.
On behalf of the Board
John G Sussens Chairman, Remuneration Committee
13 March 2007 Cookson Group plc { 52 } Annual Report 2006
We have audited the Group and parent company financial
statements (the ‘’financial statements’’) of Cookson Group plc for
the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the Group
Income Statement, the Group and parent company Balance
Sheets, the Group Statement of Cash Flows, the Group Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as
adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards
(“UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice”) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 35. Our
responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to
you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that
information presented in the Operating Review and the Financial
Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of
the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or
if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
2003 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of its profit for the
year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation;
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2006;
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with
the financial statements.

Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense
For the year ended 31 December 2006 1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Cookson Group plc is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
Its registered address is shown on page 118. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the
Operating Review on pages 14 to 27.
The financial statements, which were authorised by the Directors for issue on 13 March 2007, are presented in millions of
pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies
set out in note 3.6.
2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU (“IFRS”). The financial statements of the parent company-only have been prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”), as disclosed in note 1 to the Company financial statements.
The following standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations are effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2006 but do not have a material impact upon the results or net assets of the Group:
• IFRS 1 (Amendment), First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards;
• IFRS 6 and the amendment thereto, Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources;
• IAS 21 (Amendment), Net investment in a foreign operation;
• IAS 30 (Amendment), Financial guarantee contracts;
• IAS 39 (Amendment), Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intra-group transactions;
• IAS 39 (Amendment), The fair value option;
• IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease;
• IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds; and
• IFRIC 6, Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market – waste electrical and electronic equipment.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been
applied in these financial statements, were issued but not yet effective:
• IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures; and the related amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements, on capital
disclosures;
• IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies;
• IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2; and
• IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives.
IFRS 7 is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 and will be adopted in the Group’s consolidated
financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2007. The adoption of IFRS 7 will have no impact upon the Group’s net 
cash flows, financial position or recognised income and expense, but will add to the existing disclosures for financial instruments.
The Directors believe that interpretations 7, 8 and 9 issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(“IFRIC”) will have no impact on the financial statements of the Group.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
With the exception of certain items noted below, which are carried at fair value, the consolidated financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 have been prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and IFRS, having been prepared in accordance with IFRS for the first time in 2005. During 2006, the
Directors continued to assess the detailed impact of IFRS on the presentation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
As a consequence of this continued assessment, the Directors have made a number of changes to the accounting treatment and
presentation of certain items in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for 2006, together with appropriate changes to
the respective comparative information in the prior year. These changes, none of which have had an impact on the Group’s net
cash flows, financial position or total recognised income and expense as previously reported for 2005, are explained in note 3.3.
Cookson Group plc { 57 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.2 DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
IAS 1 provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed. 
It also encourages additional line items and the re-ordering of items presented on the face of the income statement when
appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance. In keeping with the spirit of this aspect of IAS 1, the
Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement the effect of any components
of financial performance considered by the Directors to be exceptional, or for which separate disclosure would assist both in a
better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results. Both materiality and the
nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation. Such items
may include, inter alia, the financial effect of any profits or losses arising on business disposals, major rationalisation or
restructuring activity, curtailment gains or losses relating to employee benefits, profits or losses on sale or impairment of non-
current assets and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on
the Group’s results of operations either due to their size or nature.
3.3 RESTATEMENT OF COMPARATIVE INFORMATION
(a) Interest cost and expected returns associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
In the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, the interest cost and expected return on
assets associated with the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans were recognised in the
income statement within trading profit. For 2006, the interest cost has been included in the income statement within finance
costs and the expected return on assets within finance income. Comparative figures for 2005 have been restated accordingly,
such that raw material manufacturing costs have increased by £0.4m; other manufacturing costs have decreased by £1.6m;
administration, selling and distribution costs have decreased by £4.1m; trading profit and profit from operations have
increased by £5.3m; finance costs have increased by £24.2m and finance income has increased by £18.9m. This change in
accounting treatment, which the Directors believe provides the user of the financial statements with more relevant
information in relation to the Group’s trading performance, finance costs and finance income, has no impact upon the Group’s
previously reported net cash flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
(b) Amortisation and impairment of intangibles
In the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, charges in respect of the amortisation and
impairment of intangibles were separately disclosed in the Group income statement as a component of profit from operations,
outside of trading profit. No such costs were incurred for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the Directors believe that
these charges do not currently warrant separate disclosure. Comparative figures for 2005 have been restated, increasing
administration, selling and distribution costs by £0.8m, reducing trading profit by £0.8m and reducing both headline and
diluted headline earnings per share attributable to discontinued operations by 0.4p. This change in presentation has no
impact upon the Group’s previously reported net cash flows, financial position or total recognised income and expense.
(c) Disposal of businesses from continuing operations
In the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, the loss on disposal of operations which
were not classified as discontinued operations due to their size and importance, were calculated post-tax and presented on
the face of the income statement below income tax costs. In these financial statements, losses on disposal of continuing
operations have been reported pre-tax as a separate line item below operating profit and before profit before tax.
Comparative figures for 2005 have been restated accordingly, such that a loss on disposal of continuing operations of £2.9m
has been reported before profit before tax; profit before tax has reduced by £2.9m and income tax costs on exceptional items
have increased by £1.6m. This change in accounting treatment, which the Directors believe provides the user of the financial
statements with more relevant information in relation to the results from continuing operations, has no impact upon the
Group’s previously reported net cash flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
(d) Cash flows from financing activities
In the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, cash flows resulting from the settlement
of forward foreign exchange contracts were disclosed within the statement of cash flows as a component of cash flows from
operating activities. The Directors believe that such items should more appropriately be presented as a component of cash
flows from investing activities and comparative figures for 2005 have been restated accordingly. This change in presentation
has no impact upon the Group’s previously reported net cash flows, financial position, total recognised income and expense
or earnings per share.
(e) Bank overdrafts
In the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, bank overdrafts were disclosed within the
balance sheet as a component of cash and cash equivalents. The Directors believe that such items should more appropriately
be presented as a component of interest-bearing loans and borrowings and comparative figures for 2005 have been restated
accordingly. This change in presentation has no impact upon the Group’s previously reported net cash flows, financial
position, total recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
Cookson Group plc { 58 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 3.3 RESTATEMENT OF COMPARATIVE INFORMATION (continued)
(f) Investments
In the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005, certain assets held in Rabbi Trusts were
disclosed in the balance sheet as a component of other financial assets. The Directors believe that such items should more
appropriately be presented within non-current investments and comparative figures for 2005 have been restated accordingly.
This change in presentation has no impact upon the Group’s previously reported net cash flows, financial position, total
recognised income and expense or earnings per share.
3.4 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included
in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line
with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s interest therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority’s
share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority’s interest
in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
3.5 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, Business
Combinations, are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that
are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which
are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the recognised identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities. If the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
3.6 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the
results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences
arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement;
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated; and
(iii) Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income
statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses
are recognised directly in equity, in which case any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly
in equity.
(b) Translation from functional currency to presentational currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling), its
results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year , except where the use of such an average
rate does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used;
and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in translation reserves as a separate component of equity and are
recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Cookson Group plc { 59 } Annual Report 2006 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.6 FOREIGN CURRENCIES (continued)
(c) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation
are recognised in the income statement in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the foreign operation
as appropriate. In the consolidated Group financial statements such exchange differences are initially recognised in
translation reserves as a separate component of equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement on disposal of
the net investment.
3.7 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to
customers, after deducting sales allowances and value-added taxes. Revenue is recognised when the risk of loss transfers to the
customer, depending on individual customer terms at the time of despatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance.
Provision is made for returns where appropriate.
3.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefits expense when they fall due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that they result in either a cash refund or reduction in future
payments. Outstanding contributions are recognised as a liability within accruals.
(b) Defined benefit pension plans
The liability recognised in the balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, less the fair value of the plan
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by
discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity
approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised
past service cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Pension expense for the Group’s defined benefit plans is recognised as follows:
(i) Within trading profit:
• Current service cost – representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from
employee service in the current year; and
• Past service cost – representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from
employee service in prior periods that arises from changes made to the benefits under the plans in the current year. 
To the extent that the changes to benefits vest immediately, past service costs are recognised immediately, otherwise
they are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
(ii) Within finance costs:
• Interest cost on the liabilities of the plans – calculated by reference to the plan liabilities and discount rate at the
beginning of the year and allowing for changes during the year.
(iii) Within finance income:
• Expected return on the assets of the plans – calculated by reference to the plan assets and long-term expected rate of
return at the beginning of the year and allowing for changes during the year.
(iv) Within the statement of recognised income and expense:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans.
(v) Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the income statement in the same line where
the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised or, if material, separately reported as a component
of operating profit.
Cookson Group plc { 60 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 3.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)
(c) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of different share-based payment arrangements for its employees of both the equity-settled
and cash-settled type.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the
grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) upon which
vesting for some of the awards is conditioned, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with 
a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that
will eventually vest and for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. For grants with market-based conditions
attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model. For consistency, this method has
also been used to value executive share options and stock appreciation rights granted to executives whose options are 
not subject to the additional market-based performance conditions. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the
Black-Scholes model.
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense
with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the amount payable is initially measured at grant date using a
form of stochastic option pricing model and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair
value of the liability are recognised in the income statement.
3.9 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the
Group has sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is recognised in the income
statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. No development expenditure was capitalised in 2006 (2005: £nil).
3.10 BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs, comprising interest on bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, the unwinding of the discount on
provisions and the costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings, are recognised in the income statement
using the effective interest rate method.
3.11 TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws
that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax
is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which
case the associated deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Cookson Group plc { 61 } Annual Report 2006 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.12 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is
probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably. All other
repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins
when the asset is available for use and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less
residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life
Freehold property between 10 and 50 years
Leasehold property the term of the lease
Plant and machinery – motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years
– information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years
– other between 5 and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at
each financial year-end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to
its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, as described in note 3.15.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in
the income statement.
3.13 GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or associate represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or associate recognised
at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses. Impairment testing is carried out annually, as described in note 3.15. On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
3.14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL
Other intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other
legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
3.15 IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value
in use, which is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit,
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units for this purpose are the business segments disclosed in note 6,
which represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored. Cash-generating units to which goodwill
has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-
generating unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Cookson Group plc { 62 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 3.15 IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)
(b) Other tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit to which the asset belongs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss for tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill is recognised immediately
in the income statement.
3.16 INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity
that is subject to joint control. Joint control exists when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the
activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity
method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for under IFRS 5.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the joint venture.
3.17 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly
incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production
overheads based on normal activity levels. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net
realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.
In addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group holds precious metals under consignment
arrangements, further details of which are given in note 27.
3.18 NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Non-current assets (or a collection of assets and liabilities in a disposal group) are separately classified as held for sale in 
the balance sheet when their carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use.
Immediately prior to being classified as held for sale the measurement of the assets (and all assets and liabilities in a disposal
group) is brought up to date in accordance with applicable IFRS. Then, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets
and disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial
classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, as are gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Discontinued operations are those operations that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group, both operationally
and for financial reporting purposes, that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and which represent a
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
3.19 LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
(a) Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if
lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged
to the income statement.
(b) Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Cookson Group plc { 63 } Annual Report 2006 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
(a) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(b) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to
manage the effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings. In accordance
with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement
to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being
hedged (note 4.2).
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. The fair value
of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
(c) Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments include investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and
cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Loans and borrowings comprise secured and unsecured loans and obligations under finance leases (note 3.19).
Non-derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s investments in equity and debt securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Subsequent to
initial recognition they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in equity. When an investment
is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
All other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment losses.
3.21 PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks
associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised
as an interest expense.
Cookson Group plc { 64 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 3.22 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in addition to
those reported in accordance with IFRS. Because IFRS measures reflect all items which affect reported performance, the
Directors believe that certain non-GAAP measures, which reflect what they view as the underlying performance of the Group, are
important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this
annual report.
(a) Net sales value
Net sales value is calculated as the total of revenue less the amount included therein related to any precious metal
component. The Directors believe that net sales value provides an important measure of the underlying sales performance
of the Group’s Precious Metals division.
(b) Return on sales and return on net sales value
Return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue. Return on net sales value is calculated as trading profit
divided by net sales value. The Directors believe that return on sales provides an important measure of the underlying trading
performance of the Group and the Group’s Ceramics and Electronics divisions and that return on net sales value provides an
important measure of the underlying trading performance of the Group’s Precious Metals division.
(c) Organic revenue growth
Organic revenue growth from the current period to a prior year comparator period is calculated after having adjusted the
revenue of the comparator period so that it is stated using the same exchange rates as used in the current period and, for
those businesses for which metals are a key raw material (notably for tin, gold and silver), the same average metal prices as
incurred in the current period. In addition, revenue related to current year acquisitions is removed and, for any business
disposals or significant business closures, the comparator period revenue is adjusted such that both current and comparator
period have a comparable period of revenue contribution from those businesses. The Directors believe that organic revenue
growth gives an important measure of the underlying revenue-generation capacity of the Group.
(d) Trading profit
Trading profit, defined as profit from operations before the costs of rationalisation of operations, the profit or loss relating to
non-current assets and curtailment gains relating to employee benefits, is separately disclosed on the face of the Group
income statement. The Directors believe that trading profit is an important measure of the underlying trading performance
of the Group.
(e) EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation and amortisation charges. The Directors believe that
EBITDA provides an important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
(f) Headline profit before tax
Headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and net
finance costs, excluding any component of net finance costs considered to be exceptional by the Directors. The Directors
believe that headline profit before tax provides an important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
(g) Headline earnings per share
Headline earnings per share is calculated as the total of trading profit, plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and net
finance costs and income tax costs associated with ongoing activities, less profit attributable to minority interests, divided by
the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe that headline earnings per
share provides an important measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
(h) Free cash flow
Free cash flow, defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the acquisition and disposal of non-
current assets, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to minority shareholders, but before additional funding
contributions to Group pension plans, is disclosed on the face of the Group statement of cash flows. The Directors believe
that free cash flow gives an important measure of the underlying cash-generation capacity of the Group.
(i) Average working capital to sales
The average working capital to sales percentage is calculated as the ratio of average working capital balances (being
inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables) for a year to revenue for that year. The Directors
believe that the average working capital to sales ratio provides an important measure of the underlying effectiveness with
which working capital balances are managed throughout the Group.
Cookson Group plc { 65 } Annual Report 2006 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.22 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)
(j) Interest cover
Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA, as adjusted to include the rationalisation costs of operating activities, to net finance
costs, excluding any component of net finance costs considered to be exceptional by the Directors. The Directors believe that
interest cover provides an important measure of the underlying financial position of the Group.
(k) Net debt
Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings and cash and short-term
deposits. The Directors believe that net debt is an important measure as it shows the Group’s aggregate net indebtedness to
banks and other external financial institutions.
(l) Net debt to EBITDA
Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA, as adjusted to include the rationalisation costs of
operating activities, for that year. The Directors believe that net debt to EBITDA provides an important measure of the
underlying financial position of the Group.
(m) Return on net assets
Return on net assets is calculated as trading profit plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint-ventures divided by
average operating net assets (being property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and
payables). The Directors believe that return on net assets provides an important measure of the underlying financial
performance of the Group’s divisions.
(n) Return on invested capital
Return on invested capital is calculated as trading profit plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint-ventures divided by
invested capital (being shareholders’ funds plus net debt, employee benefits deficit and goodwill previously written-off to, or
amortised against, reserves). The Directors believe that return on invested capital provides an important measure of the
underlying financial performance of the Group.
4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
4.1 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions and borrowings that are
denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. It uses various financial instruments to manage these exposures, as
explained below.
(i) Recognised assets and liabilities
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in fair value of a
recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk and which could affect profit or loss. Such forward
exchange contracts are accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2 (a).
(ii) Forecast transactions
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that might
arise from the fluctuation of exchange rates in relation to highly probable forecast transactions that are denominated in
currencies other than its own functional currencies and which might affect profit or loss. Such forward exchange
contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2 (b).
(iii) Net investment hedges
Forward foreign exchange contracts and debt denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling are both used to
hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in the value of its investment in the net assets of its foreign operations
that arise from fluctuations in exchange rates. Such financial instruments are accounted for as net investment hedges in
accordance with the policy in note 4.2 (c).
(b) Credit risk
At the balance sheet date, the Group had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group Treasury function ensures that there are sufficient levels of committed facilities, cash and cash equivalents to
ensure that the Group is at all times able to meet its financial commitments.
Cookson Group plc { 66 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 4.1 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS (continued)
(d) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowings. An analysis of the currency and interest rate profiles of
the Group’s borrowings is shown in note 36.
Borrowings at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and borrowings at fixed rates expose the
Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is to borrow a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Where appropriate,
the Group manages its interest rate exposures using interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments.
From time to time the Company manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate swaps, which have the
economic effect of changing the interest rate profile of the Group’s borrowings. Under the interest rate swaps the Company
agrees with the counterparty to exchange at specified intervals the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest
amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
4.2 HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Group designates certain financial instruments as either: (a) hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of
recognised assets or liabilities that are attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss (fair value hedges);
(b) hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable
forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss (cash flow hedges); or (c) hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the financial instruments
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
(a) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised within trading
profit in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are subject
to the hedged risk.
(b) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity within
hedging reserves. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in the income
statement. When the forecast transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or
loss on the derivative financial instrument is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same
period. When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability,
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the
non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains
in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction takes place. If the hedged transaction
is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately within trading
profit in the income statement.
(c) Net investment hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to
be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity within translation reserves and subsequently recognised in the income
statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
recognised immediately within trading profit in the income statement.
Cookson Group plc { 67 } Annual Report 2006 5. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
5.1 GOODWILL
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the
Group over future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the
carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill, using discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the value in use to the Group
of the capitalised goodwill. In the assessment undertaken in 2006, value in use was derived from discounted 5-year cash flow
projections, using a growth rate of 3% in the years beyond the projection period, and pre-tax discount rates ranging from 11-13%.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s
businesses for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts could significantly
alter the Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill.
5.2 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
It is Group policy to depreciate its property, plant and equipment assets, except freehold land, on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. This applies an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of production and
delivery of goods and services. A key element of this policy is the estimate of the useful life applied to each category of property,
plant and equipment which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge. Variations in asset lives could impact
significantly Group profit through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge.
5.3 CURRENT ASSET RESERVES
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working
capital, principally inventory and trade receivables. Reserves are established for obsolete or slow-moving inventories, bad or
doubtful debts and product warranties.
Reserve requirements are based on the facts available at the time and are also determined by using profiles, based on past
practice, applied to certain aged inventory and receivables categories. In estimating the collectability of trade receivables,
judgement is required in assessing their likely realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related
ageing of the past due balances. Specific accounts are assessed in situations where a customer may not be able to meet its
financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy.
5.4 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES
In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out environmental clean-ups at former and
current production sites. Many of these obligations will not arise for a number of years and the costs are difficult to predict
accurately. The Directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the accounts for an appropriate amount for
the likely cost of such clean-ups.
5.5 DEFERRED TAXATION
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in certain of the
Group’s businesses, primarily in Europe and Asia. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the
values at which these assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax
rates or to the period over which the losses or timing difference might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax asset
will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group has losses and other timing differences for which no value has been recognised for deferred tax purposes in these
financial statements. These can arise in loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of these timing differences
is not probable. It can also arise where the timing differences are of such a nature that their value is dependent only on certain
types of profit being earned, such as capital profits. If trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these
companies, the timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
5.6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-
retirement benefits to current and former employees. It is the Directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining
the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations. These assumptions are set after consultation with the Group’s
actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans’ assets and
liabilities. Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect
the Group’s profit and financial position.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 6. SEGMENT INFORMATION
6.1 PRIMARY REPORTING FORMAT – BUSINESS SEGMENTS
For management reporting purposes the Group is organised into three main business segments, Ceramics, Electronics and
Precious Metals. These segments form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below. The principal activities of
each of these segments are described in the Operating Review on pages 14 to 27. Segment revenue represents revenue to
external customers and is stated after the elimination of inter-segment revenue, which is immaterial. Segment results, assets and
liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets exclude cash and short-term deposits, deferred tax assets, income tax recoverable, investments in joint
ventures, assets classified as held for sale and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business
segment. These items are shown collectively in the following tables as ‘unallocated assets’. Segment liabilities exclude interest-
bearing loans and borrowings, employee benefits obligations, deferred tax liabilities, income tax payable, liabilities directly
associated with assets classified as held for sale and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a
business segment. These items are shown collectively in the following tables as ‘unallocated liabilities’.

9. RATIONALISATION OF OPERATING ACTIVITIES
The charge of £34.7m (2005: £18.5m) was the result of the implementation of a number of initiatives aimed at reducing the
Group’s cost base and realigning its manufacturing capacity with its customer markets. The initiatives implemented included
redundancy programmes, the consolidation of facilities, plant closures, the streamlining of manufacturing processes and the
rationalisation of product lines. Of these rationalisation charges, £10.3m (2005: £3.0m) represented asset write-downs, the
majority of which were in Europe and NAFTA. Total cash spend in respect of rationalisation initiatives was £16.1m (2005: £17.0m),
leaving provisions made but unspent of £19.3m as at 31 December 2006 (2005: £12.7m). The net taxation credit attributable to
these rationalisation costs was £2.1m (2005: £5.7m).
10. PROFIT/(LOSS) RELATING TO NON-CURRENT ASSETS
The net profit on non-current assets of £13.1m in 2006 principally comprised profits arising on the sale of surplus property. There
was no net profit/(loss) for the Group during 2005 in relation to the sale of non-current assets, as a net loss of £1.9m in the
Group’s continuing operations was offset by a profit of £1.9m in discontinued operations. The net taxation charge attributable to
the sale of non-current assets was £3.7m (2005: £nil).

13. LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
During the year, the Group disposed of a number of businesses from its Ceramics and Electronics divisions, none of which
represented a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Accordingly, these disposals are presented
within pre-tax results from continuing operations in the Group’s income statement. The net proceeds received in respect of these
disposals amounted to £14.5m resulting in a net loss before tax of £4.7m (note 42). In 2005, the Group disposed of its Technical
Ceramics business, formerly a part of the Ceramics division, and also incurred additional costs in relation to prior year disposals,
resulting in a net loss before tax of £2.9m. The tax charge associated with these disposals was £0.6m (2005: £1.6m).

The Group’s total income tax cost of £43.8m (2005: £44.4m) includes £5.3m (2005: £16.0m) relating to exceptional items,
comprising a £2.1m credit (2005: credit £5.7m) in relation to rationalisation costs (note 9), a charge of £3.7m (2005: £nil) in
relation to non-current assets (note 10), a charge of £3.1m (2005: £3.5m) in relation to the different treatment of goodwill
amortisation for tax and reporting purposes and a charge of £0.6m (2005: £1.6m) on the loss on disposal of continuing
operations (note 13). The 2005 cost also included a write-down of deferred tax assets of £16.6m following a reassessment of
expected future geographical profit contributions. Current tax cost for 2006 has been reduced by a benefit of £2.2m arising from
previously unrecognised tax losses.
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. Changes in any of these areas
could, adversely or positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to
absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2006, as effective
tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses. Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in
note 3.11.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £81.0m (2005: £61.7m). The tax charge relating to items charged or
credited directly to equity was £nil (2005: £nil).

On 15 December 2005, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its Laminates business, 
which previously formed part of its Electronics division, to ISOLA Group S.A.R.L, with completion of the transaction expected in
the first half of 2006. Accordingly, with effect from 31 December 2005, the assets and liabilities of the Laminates business were
classified in the Group balance sheet as held for sale and measured at fair value less costs to sell, resulting in a loss in 2005 of
£52.5m, after a related tax credit of £0.6m. In 2006, a further loss of £5.8m was incurred on the completion of the disposal on
21 April 2006.
On 31 December 2005, the Group sold its Specialty Coating Systems (SCS) business, which previously formed part of the
Assembly Materials sector of the Electronics division, to Bunker Hill Capital for £29.4m, resulting in a profit on disposal in 2005
of £10.8m, after a related tax charge of £5.7m. During 2006, a further £0.2m of disposal costs were incurred.
As part of the sale of the Group’s former Speedline business in 2003 to KPS, an equity fund, the sale agreement provided for
the Group to receive further consideration from KPS contingent upon Speedline being sold in the future for more than a specified
sum. In December 2006 Speedline was sold by KPS for an amount in excess of the specified sum and accordingly a profit of £2.7m
has been recognised in 2006.
There was no tax charge or credit associated with the net post-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations in 2006 (2005:
net tax charge of £5.1m).

For the purposes of calculating diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include the weighted
average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Potential
ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share, or
increase loss per share, from continuing operations.
In addition to the 1.3m (2005: 1.1m) shares shown in the table above as being dilutive, the Company had an additional 1.9m
(2005: 6.0m) of potential ordinary shares outstanding at the end of the year that could dilute EPS in the future, but were not
included in the calculation of diluted EPS above because they were antidilutive in the years presented.
As disclosed in note 3.3 (b), charges in respect of the amortisation and impairment of intangibles were previously disclosed
in the Group income statement as a separate component of profit from operations, outside of trading profit and added back as
an adjustment in arriving at earnings for the purposes of headline EPS. No such costs were incurred for the year ended 
31 December 2006 and the Directors believe that these charges do not currently warrant separate disclosure. Accordingly, they
are now classified as a component of trading profit within administration, selling and distribution costs. Comparative figures for
the year ended 31 December 2005 have been restated accordingly, reducing earnings for the purposes of headline EPS
attributable to discontinued operations by £0.8m and reducing both headline and diluted headline EPS attributable to
discontinued operations by 0.4p.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units for this purpose are the business segments disclosed in note 6,
which represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored. For the cash-generating units shown below,

Cookson Group plc { 79 } Annual Report 2006 22. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)
Impairment testing
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-generating units is determined from value-
in-use calculations, derived from discounted 5-year cash flow projections with a perpetuity calculation beyond the projection
period, using pre-tax discount rates.
In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2006, the Directors have made use of the most recent
detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-generating units, prepared as at 31 December 2005. The
Directors consider this to be appropriate as the assets and liabilities making up the cash-generating units have not changed
significantly since those calculations were made; those calculations resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying values of
the cash-generating units by a substantial margin; and the likelihood that a current recoverable amount determination would be
less than the current carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is remote.
In preparing the 5-year projections at 31 December 2005, both the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation
plans and market price trends and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit
operates, were taken into account. A growth rate of 3% was used in the years beyond the projection period, which was in line
with the long-term forecast GDP growth rates for the regions in which the Group operates. Pre-tax discount rates were estimated
reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each cash-generating unit and were 12.4% for
Ceramics, 12.0% for Assembly Materials, 12.9% for Chemistry and 11.7% for Precious Metals.

The £5.4m charge to the income statement for 2006 is all included within the income tax costs shown in note 14. Of the £23.4m
charge to the income statement in 2005, £18.3m was charged within income tax costs (note 14) and £5.1m was charged in arriving
at the net post-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations (note 15).
The total deferred tax asset not recognised as at 31 December 2006 was £352.4m (2005 restated: £395.6m). This consisted of
£58.3m (2005: £64.3m) relating to capital losses, £141.5m (2005: £143.0m) relating to operating losses, £68.9m (2005: £67.8m)
relating to unrelieved interest, £70.6m (2005 restated: £107.4m) relating to other categories and £13.1m (2005: £13.1m) relating
to UK ACT tax credits. In accordance with the accounting policy in note 3.11, these items have not been recognised in the above
analysis on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable. In total, there was a decrease of £43.2m (2005: increase
of £46.4m) in net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year. Comparative figures for 2005 have been restated to reflect
the deferred tax asset not recognised in relation to the UK pension deficit on a consistent basis with 2006.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had total operating losses carried forward with a tax value of £147 .8m. This total includes
£62.9m for losses which are available to offset future taxable US income, of which approximately £6.0m will expire in 2020 and
the remainder will expire between 2022 and 2026. A further £63.2m of losses are available to offset future UK taxable income
and may be carried forward without time limit. The remaining losses with a value of £21.7m include £18.6m which may be carried
forward indefinitely and £3.1m which has a maximum life of between 7 and 15 years. The amounts arise in a number of countries
and are not individually significant, reflecting the spread of the Group’s operations.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had US unrelieved interest with a tax value of £68.9m, which may be carried forward
indefinitely.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had UK capital losses carried forward with a tax value of £58.3m. These losses are
available to offset future UK capital gains and may be carried forward without time limit.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had total US tax credits carried forward with a tax value of £6.8m. This includes £2.0m
of research and experimentation credits which expire between 2018 and 2026 and £4.8m of foreign tax credits expiring between
2009 and 2016.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had UK ACT tax credits carried forward with a tax value of £13.1m, which may be carried
forward indefinitely.

The fair values of trade and other receivables are the same as the carrying values shown above. There is no concentration of

significant proportion of the outstanding receivables balance.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet for trade receivables are net of allowances for uncollectible receivables, in
respect of which in 2006 £2.1m (2005: £4.0m) has been charged to the income statement.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was
£797.4m (2005: £743.2m).
In addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held precious metals on consignment terms with a total
value as at 31 December 2006 of £236.6m (2005: £228.5m). As at 31 December 2006, metal held under consignment comprised
564,148 ounces of gold (2005: 599,001 ounces), 6,063,106 ounces of silver (2005: 6,714,921 ounces), 17,746 ounces of platinum
(2005: 22,118 ounces) and 16,022 ounces of palladium (2005: 17,370 ounces).
The Group also held precious metals on behalf of customers for processing, the value of which as at 31 December 2006 was
£84.4m (2005: £66.8m).
The Group’s precious metals fabrication operations utilise significant amounts of precious metals, being primarily gold by
value. These metals are predominantly held on consignment under arrangements the terms of which provide, inter alia, that the
consignor retains title to the metal and has a right of return over the metal without penalty. Consignors are party to either
committed or uncommitted arrangements. Under uncommitted arrangements, the consignor is under no obligation to supply the
precious metal to the Group’s fabrication operations and has the right, with limited or in some cases no notice, to demand
physical return of the consigned metal.
The metal which the Group fabricates for its customers may be purchased by the Group from the consignor and sold
concurrently to the customer, or may be consigned or sold directly from the consignor to the Group’s customers, with the Group
charging customers only for the fabrication process. Both of these methods used to supply metal for fabrication by the Group
eliminate the Group’s exposure to the risk of market fluctuations in metals prices. As the consignors retain title and associated
risks and benefits of ownership under these arrangements, the physical metal so held is not recorded in the Group balance sheet.
Consignment fees are charged by the consignor and totalled £4.2m in 2006 (2005: £5.7m).

Forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, together with debt denominated in currencies
other than pounds sterling (note 36), are used to provide a hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in the value of its
investment in the net assets of its foreign operations that arise from fluctuations in exchange rates. Both net investment hedges
and cash flow hedges are short-dated and are expected to mature within a year of the balance sheet date.
29. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE
On 18 December 2006, the Group entered into an agreement with RHI AG to sell Monofrax Inc., a US-based manufacturer of
fused-cast refractory products representing a separate major line of business within the Ceramics division. The transaction was
completed on 1 February 2007 (note 45) and accordingly, the related assets and liabilities of Monofrax Inc. were classified as held
for sale as at 31 December 2006.
On 15 December 2005, the Group entered into an agreement to sell its Laminates business to ISOLA Group S.A.R.L.
Accordingly, the related assets and liabilities of the Laminates business were classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2005
and remeasured at fair value less costs to sell. The losses incurred on remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell, and on the
completion of the disposal on 21 April 2006, are shown in note 15.

Cookson Group plc { 84 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 30. SHARE CAPITAL (continued)
At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 12 January 2006, shareholders approved special resolutions to
reduce the issued share capital of the Company by cancelling and extinguishing all of the existing deferred shares of 49p each.
The cancellation of the deferred shares became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration of the order of the High Court
with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of £356.5m on the account became a non-distributable reserve of
the Company reported within other retained earnings (note 15 to the Company financial statements). This reserve becomes
distributable only at such time when all external creditors of the Company as at 15 February 2006 have either been fully settled,
or have agreed that this reserve may be deemed distributable.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time, are entitled to one vote per
share at meetings of the Company and rank equally with regard to entitlement to the Company’s residual assets. The deferred
shares carried no right to dividends or voting and were effectively worthless.
Also at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 12 January 2006, shareholders approved a special
resolution to amend the Company’s Articles of Association to facilitate termination of the Company’s registration with the
Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) of the US. The amendment included a provision conferring upon the Board the power
to require ordinary shares which are held directly or indirectly by US resident shareholders to be sold in order to reduce the
number of such shareholders below 300, as presently required by the SEC for termination of registration. The Board commenced
exercising these compulsory transfer provisions soon after the amendment was approved by shareholders and, having reduced
the number of US resident shareholders below 300, the Company announced on 21 February 2006 that it had filed a Form 15 with
the SEC to terminate the SEC registration of its ordinary shares, with SEC deregistration occurring on 22 May 2006. On filing of
the Form, the Company’s obligations to file certain forms and reports with the SEC, including Forms 20-F and 6-K, were
suspended.
Under currently applicable SEC regulations, after the deregistration, the number of the Company’s US resident shareholders
must remain below 300 at each financial year-end to avoid recommencement of SEC reporting and other applicable US
obligations. The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company’s Directors the ability to limit the number of US resident
shareholders for this purpose.

Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between
informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. Where market values are
not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing rates translated at year-end exchange rates.

36.4 BORROWING FACILITIES
Of the total borrowing facilities available to the Group, the undrawn committed facilities amounted to £200.0m (2005: £176.7m),
expiring in more than two years but not more than five years (2005: more than two years but not more than five years) from the
balance sheet date. The Group had committed facilities of £478.5m as at 31 December 2006 (2005: £517.5m). The Group’s near-
term borrowing requirements have been met by a committed syndicated bank facility of £200m (2005: £200m). The facility was
originally for a term of three years, with options to extend for a further two years. In the period since 31 December 2006, the
Group has exercised the last of these options to extend the facility’s maturity to 1 March 2010 on the same pricing and terms.
Borrowings under the facility, which is unsecured, are for general corporate purposes.

37.1 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS
The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type, and
accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19 (as amended).
(a) Defined contribution pension plans
The Group’s principal defined contribution plans are in the UK and the US and the assets of the plans are held separately from
the Group in trustee-administered funds. The total expense for these plans in the income statement amounted to £7.0m
(2005: £7.9m) and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
(b) Defined benefit pension plans
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US. The assets of these plans are held separately from
the Group in trustee-administered funds. The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plan’s beneficiaries. The
Group also has defined benefit pension plans in other territories but these are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
The Group has one main defined benefit pension plan in the UK (“the UK Plan”). A full actuarial valuation of the UK plan
is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the plan Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as
at 31 December 2003. At that date, the market value of plan assets was £179.6m and this represented 81% of accrued plan
benefits at the time (using the projected unit method of valuation). The UK Plan was closed to new entrants from 2004.
Following the last full valuation of the plan, the Group’s ordinary contributions were set at 11% of pensionable salaries. In
addition to these ordinary contributions, the Company agreed with the plan Trustee in February 2006 a repayment schedule
that provides for additional funding payments of £25.5m in 2006 and £26.5m per annum from 2007 to 2010 with the aim of
eliminating the plan deficit by 2011. The Company monitors the plan funding level on a regular basis and will review annually
with the plan Trustee the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place. The next full triennial
valuation is due as at 31 December 2006.
The US has a number of defined benefit plans, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit. In
addition, the Group’s US Retirement Security Plan has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans but with a
minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members’ accounts. The ‘cash balance rate’ assumption in the
table in note 37.2(a) refers to the assumed minimum guaranteed return on members’ accounts. From early in 2007, the
Retirement Security Plan and the largest of the Group’s US defined benefit plans are to be closed to new members and also
to future benefit accruals for existing members. Existing plan members are, in each case, being provided with future pension
benefit through a defined contribution arrangement. Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefit pension plans are carried
out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2005. At that date the market value of the plan
assets was £65.7m, representing 52% of accrued plan benefits at that date (using the projected unit method of valuation).
Funding levels for the Group’s US defined benefit pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by
independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations.
(c) Other post-retirement defined benefit plans
The Group’s principal defined employee benefit plans other than pensions are healthcare benefit plans in the US and UK. 
As is common for these types of plan, the costs of providing these benefits are not funded externally by the Group.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 37.2 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS
(a) Principal actuarial valuation assumptions
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-
retirement benefit plans, as shown in the table below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent
professionally qualified actuaries.
The UK discount rate is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15-year AA-rated sterling corporate bond index.
The US discount rate is based on the equivalent iBoxx index for US domestic corporations. The assumptions for price inflation
are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds.
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets reflects market expectations at the valuation date of long-term asset
returns and the mix of assets in the plans.

(b) Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s UK and US defined benefit pension liabilities have
been amended to assume that pensioners have a longer life expectancy. The assumptions used are summarised in the table
below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
For the UK plan, the assumptions used have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables which reflect recent
research into mortality experience in the UK (PA 92 tables projected forward with the medium cohort improvement factors)
and, in addition, by making adjustments to reflect the latest available trend information which indicates that life expectancy
relating, in particular, to blue collar workers may not be improving as quickly as indicated by the standard tables. Accordingly,
based on an analysis of the mix of blue and white collar workers in the Group’s UK plan and on the results of an investigation
carried out on the mortality experience in the plan since 2003, the UK assumptions have been adjusted (using a scaling factor
of 112%) to reflect a lower level of life expectancy amongst the blue collar membership. The assumptions used in the 2005
valuation were based on the PA 92 tables combined with the short cohort improvement factors and a scaling factor of 118.75%.
For the Group’s US plans, the assumptions used have been based on standard US mortality tables (RP2000CH projected
40 years for non-pensioners and 25 years for pensioners using projection scale AA). The assumptions used in the 2005
valuation were based on the UP-94 tables using projection scale AA.

(c) Sensitivity analysis of key actuarial assumptions used
The following table analyses, for the Group’s UK and US pension plans, the estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting from
changes to key actuarial assumptions, whilst holding all other assumptions constant. The figures in the table take no account
of the new risk mitigation and asset allocation strategy implemented during 2006 in the Group’s UK plan, details of which are
given on pages 94 and 95, which has led to a significant reduction in the risk that the value of the UK plan’s assets falls
materially relative to its liabilities and thus increases the stability of the IAS 19 funding ratio of the UK plan (the ratio of plan
assets to plan liabilities), which was 78% as at 31 December 2006. For example, a 1% fall in long-term interest rates would
have led to an approximate 10% change in the funding ratio under the previous investment strategy, whereas under the new
investment strategy, the impact would be expected to be broadly neutral.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on UK plan liabilities Impact on US plan liabilities
Discount rates Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by 1.7% Increase/decrease by 1.2%
Price inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by 1.5% Increase/decrease by 0.2%
Mortality Increase by one year Increase by 3.7% Increase by 2.6%
With regard to the Group’s post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, a one percent increase in the healthcare cost trend rate
assumptions shown in the table in note 37.2(a) would increase the accumulated post-employment medical benefit obligation
by £1.4m and increase post-employment medical benefit costs by £0.1m; a one percent decrease in the healthcare cost trend
rate assumptions would reduce the obligation and costs by £1.3m and £0.1m respectively.

Curtailment gains of £8.6m (2005: £nil) result from reductions in liabilities arising from the closure of the Group’s two largest
US defined benefit pension plans to new members and the freezing of benefits for existing members, together with reductions
in the level of benefits provided through certain of the Group’s US post-retirement healthcare plans.
Cookson Group plc { 92 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 37.4 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION
The liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are measured by discounting the
best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method. The projected unit method is
an accrued benefits valuation method in which the calculation of plan liabilities makes allowance for projected increases in
benefit-related earnings.

In addition to the assets reported above, £8.3m (2005: £8.5m) of assets were held as at 31 December 2006 to fund certain non-
qualified US pension plan obligations (note 24). These assets are not included within pension plan assets as they are available to
satisfy creditors in the event of the winding-up of the Group company in which they are held and are reported as investments in
the Group balance sheet.
The Group is expected to make aggregate contributions into its defined benefit pension plans of £35.2m in 2007 . This includes
a special funding contribution of £26.5m into the UK defined benefit pension plan, although the level of this contribution is
expected to be reviewed with the plan Trustee during the course of 2007. The Group is also expected to make aggregate
contributions in respect of its other post-retirement benefit plans of £2.0m in 2007.
37.6 RISK MITIGATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGY
(a) Risk mitigation strategy
Following a review by the Company and the UK plan Trustee to consider how best to manage the plan’s exposure to major
investment risks, a number of changes to the investment strategy of the UK plan were made during 2006. The following were
deemed to be the key investment risks which could affect the value of the plan’s assets compared to its liabilities:
• Interest rate risk – the risk of long-term interest rates falling further, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
• Inflation risk – the risk of inflation rising faster than expected, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
• Equity market risk – the risk of significant equity market falls, leading to a fall in the value of plan assets.
In order to mitigate these key risks, the Trustee has entered into the following financial derivative arrangements:
• Interest rate swaps – the UK plan receives a fixed rate of interest and pays out a variable rate of interest, based on the
London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This is beneficial when long-term interest rates fall, significantly offsetting the
corresponding increase in the value of the plan’s liabilities.
• Inflation swaps – the UK plan pays out a fixed rate of interest of around 3% per annum and receives payments linked to
actual inflation. This is beneficial when inflation increases faster than expected, and significantly offsets the corresponding
increase in the value of the plan’s liabilities.
• Equity derivatives – using a combination of equity derivatives, the plan has protected its assets against the first 20% fall in
equity market prices over the four year period from 1 December 2006. Under these arrangements the plan foregoes any
equity market price returns above about 6.5% per annum, but will continue to receive dividend payments and the benefit
of any active management out-performance of its equity manager’s respective benchmark.
The interest rate and inflation swaps entered into were designed to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk for approximately
80% of the plan’s liabilities. The new investment strategy implemented during 2006 has led to a large reduction in the risk
that the value of the plan’s assets falls materially relative to the liabilities, thus increasing the stability of the IAS 19 funding
ratio of the plan (the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities), which was 78% as at 31 December 2006. For example, a 1% change
in long-term interest rates would have led to an approximate 10% change in the funding ratio under the previous investment
strategy, whereas under the new investment strategy, the impact would be expected to be broadly neutral.
Cookson Group plc { 94 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 37.6 RISK MITIGATION AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGY (continued)
(b) Asset allocation changes
In December 2006, the UK plan Trustee sold all of the UK plan’s UK Government bonds. The bonds were replaced with interest
rate and inflation swaps, to take advantage of the material additional yield available in the swap market relative to gilts at the
time. The swaps are backed by short-term money market instruments (typically AAA-rated very short-term debt) to ensure a
similar exposure to holding gilts. As a result of this switch, the plan is expected to receive an additional yield of at least 0.25%
per annum with very little additional risk.
The replacement of the plan’s gilts with interest rate and inflation swaps is not expected to have a material impact on 
the ‘expected return on assets’ valuation assumption, which impacts the calculation of the pension charge in the Group
income statement.
As at 31 December 2006, the UK plan’s assets were allocated 63% in equities (of which 50% are UK and 50% overseas)
and 37% in money market instruments combined with interest rate and inflation swaps. The target allocation currently
provides for money market instruments to move to 40% of the plan’s assets and for 10% of the UK plan’s assets to be held
in each of infrastructure investments and absolute return funds. The target allocation to infrastructure is to be funded
gradually from the UK plan’s equity holdings over the next two years. The target allocation to absolute return funds is 
also due to be funded from the equity holdings, but during 2007. Both of these asset types have been introduced to reduce
further the exposure to equity market risk and to provide an alternative source of return which is not highly correlated with
equity markets.
The swaps held in combination with the money market instruments are in addition to the interest rate swaps, inflation
swaps and equity options in place as part of the risk mitigation strategy described above.

38. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
38.1 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES
The Group operates a number of different share-based payment schemes. The main features of each scheme are outlined below.
(a) Long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”)
At the 2004 AGM of the Company, shareholders approved a new LTIP to replace the Mid-Term Incentive Plan (“MTIP”) and
the executive share option schemes, both of which are being phased out.
The LTIP has two elements. Firstly, executives who are eligible receive a conditional annual award of shares worth up to
a prescribed percentage of their base salary (“Performance Shares”). Secondly, executives who are eligible can elect to invest
all or part of their annual incentive in ordinary shares of the Company (“Bonus Investment Shares”) in return for which they
receive a conditional award of ordinary shares equal in value to the pre-tax equivalent of the annual incentive so invested
(“Matching Shares”).
Performance Shares and Matching Shares vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based on
the Company’s TSR performance over that three-year period relative to that of the constituent companies of its comparator
group. For awards made during the year , the comparator group used for the Company was the FTSE 250 excluding Investment
Trusts. This performance measure was chosen to enhance the link between the interests of the Group’s senior executives,
including the executive Directors, and shareholders. Vesting of the Performance Shares and Matching Shares will be 
as follows:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares vesting ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares vesting percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below median 0% 0
Median 25% 0.5:1
Upper quintile (top 20%) 100% 2.25:1
Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Pro rata between 0.5:1 and 2.25:1
An executive’s Matching Shares award will only vest if the Bonus Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
No Performance Shares or Matching Shares vest for below median performance.
The fair value of awards granted under the LTIP is measured using a stochastic pricing model.
(b) Mid-term incentive plan (“MTIP”)
Under the MTIP, executives were eligible to receive a bonus, paid partly in cash and partly in ordinary shares of the Company,
the beneficial receipt of which was deferred for two years from the date of the award (“restricted shares”), based upon the
achievement of target financial performance measured over a three-year period. Performance targets based on either the
Group’s cumulative profit or cumulative profit and cash flow performance were set by the Remuneration Committee for each
three-year MTIP period. The MTIP operated on a rolling three-year basis and the final remaining cycle culminated at the end
of 2005.
The fair value of awards granted under the MTIP is measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
Cookson Group plc { 96 } Annual Report 2006
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) 38.1 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES (continued)
(c) Executive share option schemes (“ESOS”)
The last executive share option grant was made in 2003. Under these schemes, share options were granted at the market
price prevailing at the time of grant. Options normally only became exercisable if the growth in headline earnings per share
was at least equal to the increase in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum (2% per annum for options granted in 1995
and 1996) for a consecutive three year period.
The fair value of awards granted under the ESOS was measured using a stochastic pricing model.
(d) UK and international Sharesave schemes (“SAYE” schemes)
The last grant under the SAYE schemes was made in 2004. Under the SAYE schemes, employees had the opportunity to
purchase ordinary shares in the Group at a discounted price of up to 20% by using their savings together with an additional
tax free bonus at the end of their saving period. The schemes operated in conjunction with a three or five-year savings
contract and options were granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
Employees who entered into these contracts had to make monthly savings of between £5 and £250.
The fair value of awards granted under the SAYE schemes was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(e) US Stock Purchase Plan (“USSPP”)
The last grant under the USSPP was made in 2004. An eligible employee who applied for an option under the USSPP agreed
to savings being deducted from their net pay. Regular deductions were made over a one-year period (not more than
US$5,000 in any year). Shares were only acquired under the USSPP on exercise of the option using the savings together with
interest on such savings. The price payable for each ordinary share was the price in sterling determined by the Directors,
provided that it was not less than 85% of the middle market quotation of the ordinary shares on the date of grant. An option
grant under the USSPP was exercisable not later than 18 months after the date of grant provided the option holder was still
employed by the Group.
The fair value of awards granted under the USSPP was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(f) Stock Appreciation Rights (“SAR”)
Due to the disadvantageous tax regime in Belgium, Belgian participants in the ESOS and SAYE schemes receive SAR instead
of share options. These SAR were awarded under exactly the same rights and conditions as the share options, except that
individuals received, in cash, the difference between the subscription price and market price of Cookson Group plc shares on
the date of exercise, rather than having the right to purchase shares.

The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ current best estimates of the costs to be incurred both in the
fulfilment of obligations undertaken in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure,
together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites. The provision comprises amounts payable in respect
of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including
claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the
timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be
utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances
with regard to individual matters.
The provision for rationalisation costs is used to manage the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise its operating
activities. The balance of £19.3m as at 31 December 2006 relates to future expenditure on rationalisation initiatives, the majority
of which commenced in 2005 and 2006 and is expected to be spent over the course of the next two years.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other
regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is
subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority
of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly
updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. The closing balance of other provisions relates to
items previously reported within other payables, which the Directors believe should more appropriately be reported as other
provisions.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance
sheet when its realisation is virtually certain. At 31 December 2006, £6.4m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated
insurance reimbursements, of which £4.8m is non-current. The amounts reported in the table above as charged to the income
statement represent only that part of the total income statement charge which should be reported as a movement on the
relevant provisions, other components of which, such as asset write-offs, are reported within the relevant balance sheet line item.
41. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED
During the year a total of £4.1m was paid, in cash, in respect of deferred consideration for subsidiaries acquired in prior years and
the buy-out of a 49% minority shareholding in a Chinese subsidiary of the Electronics division. No further assets or liabilities
were acquired by the Group as a result of these transactions.

leases of discontinued operations amounted to £2.6m (2005: £4.5m). Details of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of
the Group, are given in note 18 to the Company financial statements.
The Group has extensive international operations and several companies within the Group are parties to legal proceedings,
certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the Group company involved. While the
outcome of litigation can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the Group’s insurance
arrangements, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially
adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or results of operations.
Legal claims have been brought against Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by
exposure to hazardous materials. Two of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits in the US relating to a small number of
products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group. To date, there have been
no liability verdicts against either of these subsidiaries. A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled, and the
amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a materially adverse effect on the Group’s financial position
or results of operations.

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company-only financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Company’s results are included in the consolidated financial statements of Cookson Group plc, a company registered in
the United Kingdom. The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities
that are part of the Cookson Group plc group.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company only has not been presented, as permitted by
Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in
relation to the Company-only financial statements.
2.1 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the
balance sheet date.
Currently tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in
respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that
deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from
which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made for the tax that would arise on
remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have
been accrued as receivable.
2.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for employees. Equity-settled share-based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-
based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return targets upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditioned, and is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense
recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of non market-based vesting
conditions. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option
pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
2.3 PENSION COSTS
The Company participates in a UK-wide Group pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets of
the plan are held separately from those of the Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
liabilities of the plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, ‘Retirement Benefits’, accounts
for the plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents
the contributions payable to the plan for the year.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide Group defined contribution pension plan. The assets of the plan are held
separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.4 POST-RETIREMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS 
The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan. The costs of providing the benefits under this plan are 
not funded and the amount recognised in the balance sheet is based upon independent actuarial valuations, using the projected
unit method.
2.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Differences arising from the translation, at closing rates, of loans to overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, foreign currency
borrowings, trading and other items are taken to profit or loss.
2.6 BORROWING COSTS
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges and direct
issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Notes to the Company Financial Statements 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.7 INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES
Shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost, together with long-term loans that are stated at amortised cost, less any impairment 
in value.
2.8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts to manage the Company’s
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on retranslation of the Company’s subsidiaries’ net assets on consolidation. In
accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value, which is their quoted market price at the balance sheet
date. At each subsequent balance sheet date, forward foreign exchange contracts are measured at their quoted market price at
the balance sheet date with any change in fair value being recognised in profit or loss.
2.9 PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the
Company will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
3. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 12 January 2006, shareholders approved special resolutions to
reduce the issued share capital of the Company by cancelling and extinguishing all of the existing deferred shares of 49p each.
The cancellation of the deferred shares became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration of the order of the High Court
with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of £356.5m on the account became a non-distributable reserve of the
Company. This reserve becomes distributable only at such time when all external creditors of the Company as at 15 February 2006
have either been fully settled, or have agreed that this reserve may be deemed distributable.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time, are entitled to one vote per
share at meetings of the Company and rank equally with regard to entitlement to the Company’s residual assets. The deferred
shares carried no right to dividends or voting and were effectively worthless.
Also at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 12 January 2006, shareholders approved a special
resolution to amend the Company’s Articles of Association to facilitate termination of the Company’s registration with the
Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) of the US. The amendment included a provision conferring upon the Board the power
to require ordinary shares which are held directly or indirectly by US resident shareholders to be sold in order to reduce the
number of such shareholders below 300, as presently required by the SEC for termination of registration. The Board commenced
exercising these compulsory transfer provisions soon after the amendment was approved by shareholders and, having reduced
the number of US resident shareholders below 300, the Company announced on 21 February 2006 that it had filed a Form 15 with
the SEC to terminate the SEC registration of its ordinary shares, with SEC deregistration occurring on 22 May 2006. On filing of
the Form, the Company’s obligations to file certain forms and reports with the SEC, including Forms 20-F and 6-K, were
suspended.
Under currently applicable SEC regulations, after the deregistration, the number of the Company’s US resident shareholders
must remain below 300 at each financial year-end to avoid recommencement of SEC reporting and other applicable US
obligations. The Company’s Articles of Association give the Company’s Directors the ability to limit the number of US resident
shareholders for this purpose.
14. SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT
As at 31 December 2006 the share premium account amounted to £6.3m (2005: £645.5m). Share options exercised during 2006
increased the balance on the account by £7.7m.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 12 January 2006, shareholders approved a special resolution
to cancel the share premium account of the Company. The cancellation became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration
of the order of the High Court with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of £646.9m on the account became a
non-distributable reserve of the Company. This reserve becomes distributable only at such time when all external creditors of the
Company as at 15 February 2006 have either been fully settled, or have agreed that this reserve may be deemed distributable.

Of the actuarial gain of £1.4m that arose during the year , £1.1m related to the Company’s post-retirement healthcare benefits plan
and £0.3m related to the Company’s unapproved unfunded retirement benefit plan.
During the year , having received independent professional legal advice, cumulative interest income received from a subsidiary
company, previously held to be unrealised, was deemed to have been realised and resulted in a transfer of £91.0m from other
reserves to retained earnings. In addition, on disposal of the Company’s Laminates business, a merger reserve of £42.3m was
transferred from other reserves to retained earnings and is now considered to be realised. The net loss transferred from the
profit and loss account in 2005 was £27.3m.
Treasury shares
As at 1 January 2006, 1.2m ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company were held by Cookson Investments (Jersey) Limited as
Trustee of the Cookson Group Employee Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), with a nominal value of £0.1m, which were purchased
at a gross cost of £12.4m. During the year , the ESOP utilised 0.4m shares to meet share option obligations and accordingly £4.0m
has been transferred from the treasury shares reserve to retained earnings, net of £0.9m consideration received. As at 
31 December 2006, 0.8m ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company were held by Cookson Investments (Jersey) Limited as
Trustee of the Cookson Group Employee Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), with a nominal value of £0.1m, which were purchased
at a gross cost of £8.4m. The purchase of these shares was financed by the Company out of borrowings included in the Company
balance sheet as at 31 December 2006. The market value of these shares as at 31 December 2006 was £4.9m (2005: £4.9m). The
Trustee of the ESOP has waived its rights to receive dividends on the shares held. The shares are held, as Treasury Shares, to
meet share option obligations as and when they arise at the discretion of the Company.
Options exercisable over ordinary shares and capable of being satisfied through new allotments of shares or through shares
held by the Company’s ESOP as at 31 December 2006 were as follows:

Pension plans
The Company participates in a UK-wide Group defined benefit pension scheme. The Company is unable to identify its share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and therefore accounts for its membership of the scheme as it would for a defined
contribution scheme. Costs charged in the year in respect of its contributions payable to the scheme were £3.7m (2005: £7.3m).
The pension scheme is a closed scheme and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be
expected to increase as the members of the scheme reach retirement.
The last full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary,
was carried out as at 31 December 2003. At that date, the market value of the plan assets was £185.9m, representing 69% of
accrued plan benefits at the time (using the projected unit method of valuation). The 2003 full valuation has been updated, as
appropriate, in order to estimate the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2006, at which date the market value of the plan
assets was £277.3m (2005: £245.5m), representing 78% (2005: 68%) of estimated accrued plan benefits, including the
Company’s obligation with respect to its unapproved unfunded retirement benefit plan.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost charge for 2006
represents contributions payable by the Company to the scheme and amounted to £0.1m (2005: £0.1m). There were no
outstanding contributions payable to the scheme as at 31 December 2006 (2005: £nil).
Post-retirement plans other than pension plans
The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan. The costs of providing these benefits are not funded. The level
of the accrued plan benefits provision is based on independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method. The last
full actuarial valuation of the plan, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out at 31 December
2006, at which date the accrued plan benefits were £3.8m (2005: £4.9m; 2004: £4.2m; 2003: £4.5m; 2002: £2.9m).

18. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group,
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make
a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2006 in respect of the liabilities of its
subsidiary companies amounted to £34.8m (2005: £73.8m) and guarantees under property leases of discontinued operations
amounted to £2.6m (2005: £4.5m).
In addition the Company has, on behalf of its subsidiaries, given guarantees to precious metals consignors amounting to
£235.6m (2005: £228.5m), representing all of the value of precious metals held by its subsidiaries on consignment terms as at
31 December 2006. Further details of these consignment arrangements are given in note 27 to the consolidated financial
statements.
Cookson has extensive international operations and several of its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of
which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved. While the outcome of litigation
can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company
and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
19. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
Other than as disclosed in note 45 to the consolidated financial statements, there were no disclosable post balance sheet events.

Continuous casting
Method of pouring steel directly from its molten form into a slab,
bloom or billets and thereby short-cutting secondary processing
with associated cost savings. During the process, steel is poured
from a ladle into a tundish on top of the continuous caster. As it
flows from the tundish down into the caster’s mould, it solidifies
into a ribbon of red-hot steel. At the bottom of the caster, torches
cut the continuously-flowing steel to form slabs, bloom or billets. 
Float glass process
Production method to produce flat glass for building, automotive
and specialty products. Glass is melted in a separate tank and flat
glass is formed when molten glass is poured from the tank on to
a bath of molten tin. The glass then "floats" on the tin. Following
this, the glass sheet is progressively cooled in the annealing lehr
(which is a type of oven used to anneal glass) and then on fused
silica rollers, as produced by Cookson.
Glass tempering process
Flat glass is transformed into toughened or tempered glass by
being heated and then rapidly cooled. This creates a surface
tension in the glass. Tempered glass is six times stronger than
ordinary glass. When toughened glass is broken the tension is
released, which causes the glass to shatter into less-harmful tiny
fragments. For this reason, toughened glass is specified for many
applications where safety is an issue, including automotive and
architectural applications. The glass is carried on fused silica
rollers, as produced by Cookson, during its manufacture.
Monolithics
Refractory mixes in the form of castables, plastics and sprayed
refractories used principally as a protective lining for ladles and
tundishes. Join-free application reduces heat loss, gas
permeability and thermal stress forces. 
Refractory products – linings
Products which provide a heat protection in devices such as
steelmaking vessels, furnaces, kilns and ovens, allowing them to
operate at extremely high temperatures without damaging their
outer shell. They also protect the devices against damage caused
by abrasion, pressure, chemical attack and rapid changes in
temperature, as well as facilitating heat retention to allow the unit
to operate more efficiently without major heat loss.
Slide gate refractories
Flow control refractories are used as valves between steelmaking
vessels to control the flow of molten metal as it runs through the
continuous casting process. These products have to withstand
extremely high temperatures and are consumables, sometimes
used up in a matter of hours. Cookson is the world leader in the
production of flow control products for the steel industry and
supply major steel mills worldwide. 
Solar Crucible™
A Solar Crucible ™ is a large fused silica ceramic crucible used for
the melting and crystallisation of photovoltaic silicon. Silicon
ingots manufactured in these crucibles are then cut into blocks;
blocks are sliced into wafers; and then wafers are used to make
solar cells.
VISO™
Brand name for isostatically-pressed alumina-carbon products
manufactured by the Ceramics division to control and protect the
flow of molten metal from re-oxidation in the continuous casting
steelmaking process. Includes ladle shrouds, stoppers, subentry
nozzles and tube changers. VISO™ is a flow control refractory.
Electronics
Damascene copper
Chemicals used to create nanoscale copper connections within
semi-conductor wafers.
Epoxy moulding compounds
A solid polymer that is heated to a liquid and injected over or
under a PCB component for protection.
Immersion Silver
A PCB final finish that provides tarnish resistance, low contact
resistance and ease of cleaning. Specially designed to meet PCB
lead-free assembly and OEM requirements.
PCB assembly 
PCB assembly involves attaching components such as surface
mount devices and capacitors on to a fabricated board, together
with the required physical and electrical connections. This has to
be done with precise accuracy if the finished PCB is to function
effectively. 
Printed circuit board (“PCB”)
A type of circuit board which has conducting tracks superimposed
or ‘printed’ on one or both sides. May refer to a board either
before or after the assembly process.
Semi-conductor wafer 
A semi-conductor wafer is a thin slice of semi-conducting
material, upon which microcircuits are constructed by chemical
deposition of various materials.
Solder
An alloy of tin and other metals with a comparatively low melting
point, used to join less fusible metals. 
Underfill
An adhesive that mechanically couples an electronic component-
such as a chip-to a PCB to restrain most of the lateral movement
between the component and the board. The interconnect joints
are therefore protected and preserved.
Wafer bumping products
Metal alloys for wafer bump plating, including gold, copper, lead-
free alloys and low alpha lead-based alloys.
Precious Metals
Findings
Jewellery components such as pins, clasps, posts and clips.

Chairman’s statement
As we continue to manage 
in a climate of uncertainty, 
we have taken significant 
steps this year to 
enhance our flexibility 
and strengthen the 
Group for the future.
In a sector that is a key enabler of 
economic development, the Group’s 
diverse portfolio offers an attractive 
platform for sustainable growth. During 
the year we continued to take action to 
mitigate the effects of prolonged economic 
weakness and to place the business on a 
firmer footing to continue to invest for the 
future and deliver improved growth  
and returns. 
The Group has grown rapidly over the last 20 years through a 
combination of acquisition, organic growth and contract wins, and we 
have established a broad-based portfolio of market leading transport 
businesses in the UK and North America with unrivalled scale and 
breadth. We believe that our stakeholders benefit from the diversity  
of the Group which underpins the wealth of expertise and unique 
knowledge that we have of many different markets, networks, 
contracts and assets. 
The diversity of our portfolio also means that each of our  
businesses responds differently to changes in the economic  
cycle. As the problems of congestion from urban growth continue  
to multiply, the need for more efficient transport solutions is 
recognised as being ever more critical. 
The external headwinds we have faced this year have been 
considerable. The sustained economic weakness across the  
UK and North America continued to affect our passenger revenue 
businesses, and the impact of reduced Government support for 
the bus industry in the UK during the year has been marked. It has 
also been an exceptionally challenging period for the UK rail industry 
and for our rail business in particular, following the unexpected 
cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. 
Notwithstanding the public statements from the Department for 
Transport (DfT) that we were not at fault, having followed due 
process and submitted a strong bid in strict accordance with their 
terms, we were frustrated that our employees and our shareholders 
had to endure this extraordinary series of events. In March, following 
the completion of two independent reviews, the DfT issued a detailed 
timetable for rail franchise awards over the next eight years. As the 
UK’s largest and most experienced rail operator, we remain 
committed to maintaining a leading position in the market, and look 
forward to submitting further high quality bids that create value for 
passengers, taxpayers and shareholders.
Martin Gilbert 
Chairman Overview
03 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
As we continue to manage in a climate of uncertainty, we have taken 
significant steps this year to enhance our flexibility and strengthen the 
Group for the future. Across the business there is a resolute drive to 
harness our scale by developing and sharing our global expertise for 
the benefit of our local markets. Led by Tim O’Toole, the management 
team remain focused on detailed plans to strengthen the business to 
address the challenges we are facing today, and to achieve sustainable 
growth for the future.
During the year we took steps to further strengthen the Board through 
a number of new appointments.
On 1 August 2012 we were pleased to welcome Brian Wallace  
and Jim Winestock to the Board as Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Brian has held executive board positions within a number  
of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 organisations, most recently as Group 
Finance Director of Ladbrokes plc. Prior to joining Ladbrokes he was 
Group Finance Director and Deputy Chief Executive of Hilton Group. 
Jim Winestock served in a number of senior roles and was a member 
of the Management Committee during his career at United Parcel 
Service, Inc. Most recently he was Senior Vice President and Director 
of US Operations and Global Security with responsibility for all US 
operations and 360,000 employees. 
Chris Surch was appointed to the Board as Group Finance Director 
on 1 September 2012. Chris joined from Shanks Group plc where he 
was Group Finance Director. Prior to that, he held a number of senior 
financial roles including at Smiths Group plc and TI Group plc. 
Together with strong financial leadership, he brings considerable 
operational, strategic and international knowledge and experience  
of significant business improvement programmes. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to extend our sincere thanks and 
gratitude to our 120,000 employees. They are the backbone of our 
organisation and our greatest strength. The engagement, support, 
and development of all our people is an important focus for 
management and vital to delivering our plans for the future.
The Group remains a strong and profitable business with market 
leading positions. During the year we continued to take action to 
mitigate the effects of the prolonged economic downturn and to place 
the business on a firmer footing to continue to invest for the future. 
Having comprehensively reviewed other options, the Board is 
confident that the rights issue announced in May is the best  
solution for the Group, to remove the risk of a credit rating 
downgrade, remove the constraints of the balance sheet and  
give management the resources necessary to deliver their value-
enhancing strategy for the Group.
We are targeting an appropriate, progressive and sustainable 
dividend policy with cover of 2.0 to 2.5 times in the medium term. In 
the short term the Board proposes that no final dividend will be paid 
in respect of the year to 31 March 2013, nor an interim dividend for 
the year to 31 March 2014. Payments will recommence with a final 
dividend for the year to 31 March 2014, subject to performance in 
line with expectations, as a transition to re-establishing a progressive 
dividend policy thereafter. While the exact quantum will be determined 
at that time, the Board’s intent is to pay a transitional final dividend 
of up to £50m for the year to 31 March 2014.
The rights issue will not only strengthen the Group and support its 
continued growth, but also underpin its ability to remain a dividend 
paying stock as well as supporting an investment grade credit rating. 
When this project is complete, I intend to step down as Chairman 
once a successor has been identified. I have led the business for  
27 years, from start-up to its current position as the leading transport 
operator in the UK and North America and I am extremely proud of 
what we have achieved during that time. While I am sorry to leave,  
I am pleased that this fund raising will open the way to the next  
stage of the Group’s development.

Chief Executive’s strategic review
Tim O’Toole 
Chief Executive
Our services help to create strong, vibrant 
and sustainable local economies and our 
opportunity is to be the provider of choice 
for our customers and communities. 
We are the largest transport operator in the UK and North America 
and each day, every one of our 120,000 employees works hard to 
deliver vitally important services for our passengers. During the last 
year more than 2.5 billion passengers relied on us to get to work,  
to education, to visit family and friends and for much more. 
In May of this year, Martin Gilbert announced his intention to stand 
down as Chairman, once a successor has been identified. On behalf 
of the Board and our employees, I would like to pay tribute to Martin 
and thank him for his outstanding contribution to the Company.  
As Chairman and a founder, his vision and drive have led the 
transformation of the Group, and under his stewardship the business 
has grown to become one of the world’s leading transport operators.
Our opportunity
Our objective is to provide sustainable, integrated transport services 
that are safe, reliable and meet the needs of the customers and the 
communities we serve. We have established a diverse portfolio of 
assets in a sector which is a key enabler of economic growth. Effective 
transport links are essential to the prosperity of any economy, and 
whilst the needs of any one local or regional community may be 
different, as we look ahead, the unrelenting move towards urbanisation 
means that we can be certain that congestion will be a feature of the 
future. It is companies like ours with the necessary breadth and scale, 
and collective expertise and capability spanning two continents, that 
will be able to provide efficient solutions to congestion. 
Capital structure
In May 2013 we announced a rights issue to raise approximately  
£615m, which will remove the constraints of our current balance sheet 
and provide the necessary flexibility to continue our transformation plans 
and invest to create sustainable, long term value. 
The decisions we have taken this year will position the Group to deliver 
improved growth, and return us to a profile of consistent financial 
returns and cash generation. Over the next four years we aim to 
increase Group revenue (excluding UK Rail) at a faster rate than the 
economies we serve, improve margins in First Student and UK Bus
1
  
to double digit levels, and achieve a post-tax return on capital 
employed (ROCE) in the 10% to 12% range. We aim to maintain  
an investment grade credit rating and appropriate balance sheet 
liquidity and headroom and, as the business performance improves, 
to re-establish a progressive dividend policy to target 2.0 to 2.5 times 
dividend cover.
Future outlook
The actions we are taking will create a more robust company and one 
that is better placed to face its challenges, deliver on its promises and 
take advantage of future opportunities. As a result I believe that we are 
in a stronger position now with greater clarity and confidence in our 
way forward.

Our vision and values Overview
05 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Actions taken this year Future priorities
This year has been a significant one for the  
Group as we moved ahead with our plans for our 
future development. Our business improvement 
programmes are at different stages across each 
of our divisions, but over this year we have 
prioritised the following areas: 
While we are pleased with progress in the year, 
significant opportunities remain ahead of us. Over 
the next four years, we intend to invest approximately 
£1 .6bn across the Group to continue our transformation 
programmes and take advantage of growth 
opportunities. The key priorities in delivering our 
plans and generating long term, sustainable value 
for shareholders and our other stakeholders include:
 
First Student 
We are reforming the operating model to create a more efficient 
cost structure through improving labour productivity, streamlining 
systems to reduce bureaucracy, standardising operating 
procedures and applying best practice. We are expanding  
the use of innovative technology, reducing maintenance costs  
through uniform practices and reducing fuel costs through 
enhanced driver training.
To continue to execute the ongoing recovery plan by improving 
operational efficiency with a view to targeting double digit operating 
margins in the medium term, including by ultimately driving up  
our contract retention rates above 90%, taking advantage of 
opportunities to win new contracts as state authorities and school 
boards continue to outsource their student bus services, and 
returning to a selective in-fill acquisition strategy to enhance growth,  
at the appropriate levels and time.
 
First Transit 
We have strengthened our core business units in First Transit, 
and disposed of non-core operations during the year. We are 
seeing a steady pipeline of new contract wins including additional 
paratransit services and, going forward, we plan to increase our 
focus on higher growth operations such as our shuttle bus 
business. We are also placing more emphasis on technological 
innovation in the division.
To continue to achieve strong growth and maintain operating 
margins while investing to take advantage of key outsourcing 
opportunities, including the expansion of our shuttle bus 
operations, particularly on university campuses and in the 
Canadian oil fields.
 
Greyhound 
We have significantly transformed Greyhound’s operating model 
to create a more flexible and agile business, including through 
improvements in technology, right sizing and relocating terminals, 
purchasing new vehicles and refurbishing our existing fleet. We are 
expanding our Greyhound Express services, building on the 
inherent strength of our unique national network, as well as 
developing bespoke brands for niche markets.
We will invest in infrastructure and IT, including new reservation 
and ticketing systems, to drive operational efficiencies, facilitate 
better yield management and thereby seek to achieve growth in 
excess of GDP , as we have achieved in BoltBus and Greyhound 
Express. Further capital expenditure will also be made to renew 
and refurbish the Greyhound fleet and to continue to fund the 
addition of new routes and services.
 
UK Bus 
During the year we rebalanced our UK Bus portfolio through a 
programme of selected business and asset disposals. We are 
improving efficiency by standardising our maintenance and operating 
procedures, investing in our bus fleet and adjusting the commercial 
model to be more responsive locally and to enhance patronage growth.
To improve operating margins, on a post-IAS 19, basis to 
double digit levels in the medium term by continuing our depot 
transformation programme, network redesign plans, reducing the 
fleet age to be closer in line with our peers, as well as improving 
our information provision and smart ticketing capabilities to 
support volume growth.
 
UK Rail 
We continue to focus on operating performance across all of our  
UK Rail operations, including prioritising the introduction of new smart 
ticketing and passenger information technology. We are working 
closely with our partners to deliver infrastructure and capacity 
upgrades. Contract extensions are being negotiated for two of our 
franchises, and we remain committed to maintaining our leading 
position in the rail market as the DfT’s franchising process restarts. 
Ensuring our management expertise and capital strength 
continues to support our plans to participate in a range of future 
franchise competitions and tenders and maintain our market 
leading position. 06 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Our business model
How we generate revenue 
We operate five divisions which require 
similar core skills and expertise, and are 
diversified by geography, customer  
base and mix of contract backed  
and passenger revenue. 
Our revenues are balanced between the UK (57%) and North America 
(43%), together with some minor activities in other European 
countries. Our customers include the national government, regional 
and local authorities in the UK, state and municipal authorities, local 
school boards, universities and private companies in North America, 
and a diverse demographic mix of individual passengers in both the 
UK and North America. Our passenger revenue is broadly spread 
between business, commuting, social and recreational travelling.  
In all, approximately 50% of our revenues are derived directly from 
our passengers, while approximately 50% are backed by contracts 
or franchise agreements. Our broad footprint in the UK and North 
America also gives us profound experience of two of the most 
developed markets in the world for outsourced municipal 
transportation, and therefore a breadth of expertise across different 
regulatory and contractual structures. 
As a result of the breadth and diversity of our operations, each of  
our businesses is typically moving through a different stage of the 
economic cycle. This diversity helps to ensure that we are not 
dependent on any one market, and weaker performance in one area 
is more likely to be offset by stronger performances elsewhere in the 
portfolio. These variations influence the way in which each business is 
managed, the range of KPIs that management work to and the local 
strategies that are applied.
As a result of the breadth 
and diversity of our 
operations, each of our 
businesses is typically 
moving through a 
different stage of the 
economic cycle.

How we create value 
Our objective is to create long term  
value for shareholders and other 
stakeholders through the provision of 
sustainable, integrated transport services 
that are safe, reliable and meet the needs 
of our customers and communities. 
Our strategy for sustainable growth
We believe we are well placed to achieve sustainable growth from 
delivering innovative and high quality transport solutions to the local 
markets we serve. We expect to achieve that growth through a 
balanced strategy of investing our resources in four areas: to drive 
continued operational excellence, to deliver organic growth, to 
continue to achieve contract wins and renewals, and to make 
selected in-fill acquisitions. In each case, we aim to deploy our 
strengths and capabilities as a whole to generate an appropriate 
economic return for our shareholders.
Our strengths
Although our five main divisions have different operating  
models, there are some common strengths that run through  
all of our businesses:
Market leader in the UK and North America
Our strengths in the UK bus and rail markets, and in the student 
transportation, transit and intercity coach markets in North America 
offer excellent platforms to identify and develop other opportunities 
for future growth. 
Diverse business model 
Each of our businesses has market leading positions in a sector 
which is a key enabler of economic growth and essential to the 
creation of strong and sustainable communities. The growth of 
urbanisation and the resultant congestion will lead to more complex 
transport demands. Within this context, governments are increasingly 
turning to private sector operators to deliver more efficient and 
innovative solutions. The diversity of our business, together with our 
innovative transport solutions, means that we are well placed to meet 
this need. Our diverse portfolio also helps to ensure that we are not 
dependent on any one geographic or customer market, as each of 
our businesses is typically moving through a different stage of the 
economic cycle. 
Unrivalled scale and breadth
Our scale has allowed us to develop a range of expertise in different 
markets and regulatory regimes. We focus on engaging with different 
partners and stakeholders, building effective relationships and 
enhancing our ability to deliver transport solutions that are most 
appropriate to local needs.
Harnessing global expertise
We harness the in depth knowledge and expertise of our experienced 
leadership teams across two continents to address the specific 
needs of individual markets.
Effective deployment of assets and people
The scale of our activities means that employing and training 
professional, dedicated employees who are committed to  
our customers and their safety, and procuring, deploying and 
maintaining a wide variety of vehicle fleets and other physical  
assets, are core skills. We hire, train and manage around 120,000 
employees to deliver our services. We deploy and maintain combined 
fleets of 70,000 owned or managed vehicles. 
Focused on enhancing operational excellence
We strive to improve our performance by sharing best practice across 
our businesses to provide high quality, attractive services that are 
safe, reliable and meet the needs of customers and the communities 
we serve.

network, carrying more than  
310 million passengers per year.

intercity, commuter and regional 
franchises (First Capital Connect, 
First Great Western, First ScotRail 
and First TransPennine Express) 
and one open access passenger 
rail service (First Hull Trains). We 
operate the Tramlink service on 
behalf of Transport for London 
and the Heathrow Connect service 
with Heathrow Airport. Through 
our joint venture with Danish State 
Railways (DSB) we operate some 
passenger rail services in the 
Oresund region of Denmark.

Customers
School districts provide 
transportation for students 
depending on varying criteria 
determined at state level. 
Contracts are usually structured 
with fixed pricing, meaning that 
the private operators bear cost 
risk. These contracts are typically 
three to five years in duration. 
School districts receive their 
funding from state and local 
sources, including tax receipts, 
and their budgets for all 
expenditure, including 
transportation, tend to be linked 
to economic factors. In addition 
to school districts outsourcing 
student transportation (known as 
‘conversion’), growth is driven by 
inflation related escalators built 
into contracts and increased 
student numbers leading to 
additional routes being driven for 
a given school.
Competitors
The private outsourced market is 
highly fragmented with only ten 
operators running more than 
1,000 buses. Our largest 
competitors include National 
Express’s Durham School 
Services, Student Transportation 
of America and Atlantic Express 
Transportation Corp. The next  
40 largest contractors operate  
a further 17 ,000 buses and the 
remaining outsourced contracts 
are operated by several thousand 
small companies, often termed 
‘Mom and Pop’ operators.
Linda Burtwistle
President,  
First Student
First Student
Increasingly the market will place a 
premium on those companies, such 
as First Student, which can offer value 
added benefits to improve the 
customer proposition.
The market
School buses provide home to 
school transportation for millions 
of students in the USA and 
Canada. There are more than 
15,000 school districts in North 
America responsible for providing 
over 500,000 school buses. The 
total North American market is 
estimated to be worth around  
$24bn per annum. It is estimated 
that school districts operate 
approximately 64% of the market, 
with 36% outsourced to private 
operators. Charter services are 
also operated on an ad-hoc 
basis, separate from scheduled 
school runs, and are typically of 
limited duration and scope.
Changes in market
■ ■
The weakness in the North 
American economy is still being 
reflected in school board budgets
■ ■
Despite this, we have seen 
signs of state and local finances 
beginning to stabilise, helping to 
create more certainty in respect 
of school district funding
■ ■
Usage of buses for school and 
non-school charter activities 
continues to increase
■ ■
Signs of organic growth 
returning to the market
■ ■
Interest in conversion continues 
to be high, although it remains 
the case that only a small 
proportion switch to outsourcing.

The market
The transit market is worth 
around $22bn per annum  
in the United States of which 
approximately 30% is 
outsourced. The vehicle  
services market is worth 
around $2.9bn per annum in 
the United States of which 
less than half is outsourced. 
The transit contracting and

local agencies, and private 
institutions including universities, 
hospitals and airports. The 
vehicle fleet maintenance 
services market includes 
contracting for private and  
public sector clients including 
municipalities and fire and  
police departments.
Competitors
First Transit has approximately 
14% of the outsourced market 
in the United States, which 
accounts for approximately  
30% of the total market. The 
outsourced transit market is 
fragmented although First Transit  
has two large competitors, MV 
Transportation, Inc., and Veolia 
Transportation. The outsourced 
fleet maintenance market is 
highly competitive and First 
Vehicle Services is estimated  
to be one of the largest providers 
in the market, with Penske and 
Ryder being the principal 
competitors. A number of small 
and medium sized companies 
represent a significant portion  
of the outsourced market.

Dave Leach
President and CEO,  
Greyhound
Greyhound has a unique national network 
and, having developed a more flexible and 
agile operating model, has responded well 
to the challenges of the weak economy 
with a portfolio of successful and 
popular brands.
The market
From 2006 to 2012, the US 
intercity bus transportation 
industry grew between 5% and 
10% per year – a reversal of the 
position between 1980 and 
2006, when the industry declined 
by an average of 2.9% a year. 
As well as passenger revenues, 
income is generated from 
Package Express services, 
charter and tour organisation and 
also catering outlets in terminals. 
Partnership between Greyhound 
and independent bus lines, 
known as interlining, provides 
complementary services to 
Greyhound’s national network. 
Greyhound also partners with 
Amtrak to offer passengers 
a through ticket to their final 
destination if not served by rail.
Changes in market
■ ■
The market as a whole has been 
the fastest growing intercity 
travel sector in the United States 
for the last five years
■ ■
Despite this, the weakness in 
the North American economy 
continues to have some impact 
on patronage
■ ■
New entrants to local markets 
seek to establish sustainable 
services through discounted 
offers although increased 
competition has attracted  
new customers
■ ■
Point-to-point bus lines 
continue to expand across 
North America
■ ■
Several companies serving 
Chinatown passengers in the 
north east closed after the 
federal government increased 
enforcement of safety 
regulations affecting  
kerbside operators.
Customers
Intercity coach firms in North 
America serve a diverse, value 
oriented customer base, whose 
primary purpose is to visit friends 
and family. The development of 
new brands, such as Greyhound 
Express which originates from 
major Greyhound hubs and 
serves approximately 900 city 
pair journeys, is attracting users 
back to bus travel and 
encouraging a new passenger 
demographic. Traditionally 
customers bought walk up 
tickets but recent developments 
in technology are encouraging 
new habits.
Competitors
In the US and Canada, intercity 
coach transportation competes 
with many other modes of mid to 
long distance travel, including a 
number of other coach operators, 
private cars as well as budget 
airlines. The north east of the US 
is the most dense travel corridor 
in the country and sees a highly 
competitive intercity coach 
market competing with air and 
rail services.

The market
Local bus services in the UK 
operate on two very different 
models. Outside of London, the 
local bus market has been 
deregulated since the 1980s, with 
most services being provided by 
private operators although some 
local authority owned operators 
exist. Bus markets are local and 
services operate on a flexible 
model with operators setting 
fares, frequencies and routes on a 
commercial basis and operating 
‘socially necessary’ services 
under contract to local authorities.
Bus services in London are 
contracted by Transport for 
London, typically for a duration  
of five years.
The Transport Select Committee’s 
report into the industry recognised 
the role that partnership working 
between local authorities and 
operators has in delivering service 
improvements without increasing 
council taxpayer spending.
Changes in market
■ ■
Economic weakness continues 
in some of the UK’s urban areas
■ ■
Impact of reductions in 
Government funding for local 
authorities, causing pressure 
on local transport budgets, 
began in April 2012
■ ■
Better Bus Area grants 
introduced by the DfT for 
specific partnership projects 
around the country, with a 
second generation linked to 
local devolution of the Bus 
Service Operators Grant (BSOG)
■ ■
Introduction of premium high 
quality services serving  
distinct markets
■ ■
Focus on development of new 
technology including smart 
ticketing and improved 
passenger information
■ ■
Increased use of 
environmentally friendly  
hybrid vehicles.
Customers
Bus customers in the UK are 
diversified by journey purpose 
with significant proportions 
using bus services for commuting 
– to work, school, college or 
university – for shopping and for 
leisure purposes. Revenues in 
the bus market outside London 
principally comprise passenger 
ticket sales and concessionary 
fare schemes (payments by local 
government authorities for 
services for which passengers 
pay reduced or no fares). Income 
may also be generated through 
operating tendered services.  
In 2011/12, some 2.9 billion 
passenger journeys were made 
on local bus services outside 
of London. 
Competitors
The main competitor to bus 
services in the UK is the private 
car. Outside London, the c.£4bn 
UK bus market is deregulated 
and highly competitive with more 
than 1,200 bus operators and in 
all markets in which we operate 
we face competition. A number 
of multi-regional operators have 
increased market share through 
acquisitions during the year and a 
number of operators have both 
entered and exited the market.

UK Rail
We are the market leader with a diverse 
portfolio of operations, and we are 
committed to maintaining this position 
by building on our strong track record 
of innovation and partnership as the 
DfT returns to rail franchising.
The market
Passenger rail services are 
principally provided by private 
train operating companies (TOCs) 
through franchises awarded by 
the relevant authority, but a 
small number are provided on 
an ‘open access’ basis (without 
franchises). Many elements  
of the service provided to 
passengers are mandated  
as part of the franchise  
contract and others are left  
to commercial judgement.  
Total franchised passenger 
revenues in the UK are 
approximately £7bn per  
annum. Railway tracks and 
infrastructure (signalling and 
stations) are owned and 
managed by Network Rail. 
Operators typically lease rolling 
stock from leasing companies.  
The Office of Rail Regulation 
grants and enforces licences  
to operators and Network  
Rail, regulates access to  
track, stations and depots  
and supervises the access 
relationships between  
Network Rail, operators  
and others. 
Changes in market
■ ■
Passenger numbers have 
increased to 1.5 billion per 
annum across the UK as a 
result of improved rolling stock, 
marketing initiatives and 
additional services in some 
areas and despite ongoing 
economic weakness
■ ■
The Government paused its 
refranchising programme during 
the year , including the outright 
cancellation of two of the four 
competitions (InterCity West 
Coast and Great Western)
■ ■
Independent reviews into the 
InterCity West Coast and wider 
franchising competitions were 
completed. The DfT published 
a revised refranchising timetable 
in March
■ ■
Government investment in 
infrastructure across the country 
is delivering improvements for 
passengers, funded in part by 
regulated fare increases.
Customers
Rail markets vary but are typically 
grouped into three sectors – 
London and south east 
commuter services, regional and 
long distance. For our franchises 
in London and the south east of 
England, the majority of our 
passengers are commuters to 
and from the capital. First Great 
Western and First Hull Trains also 
have a large proportion of long 
distance and leisure travellers. 
First ScotRail and First 
TransPennine Express carry a 
large number of commuters into 
the major towns and cities on 
their networks, and also serve a 
significant leisure market. 
Competitors
The main competitor to rail 
services is the private car. We also 
face competition on certain 
passenger flows from other rail 
services and, to a lesser extent, 
from long distance coach services 
and airlines. We bid against 
operators of current UK rail 
franchises and rail operators from 
other countries, principally from 
within the EU and Hong Kong.

Operating and financial review
Notwithstanding the prolonged  
economic weakness we are focused  
on our objectives of improved  
performance and sustainable growth.  
We have taken a series of comprehensive 
actions to address specific issues,  
reform operating models to improve  
performance and strengthen  
our businesses. 
 
First Student
First Student continues to respond well to the recovery programme 
which is now well established. While there remains work to be done, 
we are confident of the prospects to build on the actions we have 
taken and we are on track to achieve $100m of annual cost savings 
from a more efficient model.
 
First Transit
In First Transit, we continue to focus on our core segments which 
delivered strong growth during the year with new contract wins. 
Consistent with that strategy, we completed the sale of First 
Support Services, our military base facility management business, 
for a gross consideration of $10.2m. We have grown to become one 
of the largest providers of shuttle bus services at airports and for 
universities, and are developing opportunities for further expansion.
 
Greyhound
At Greyhound we have transformed the operating model to create a 
more flexible and agile business. By investing in technology, right 
sizing or relocating terminals and modernising our network we will 
provide customers with more attractive, affordable and reliable long 
distance travel. Our unique national network underpins our success 
as we expand our popular, fast growing point-to-point services.
 
UK Bus
We are making good progress with our programme to transform our 
UK Bus business. As we continue to work through our plans we are 
improving operating discipline, adjusting the commercial model to 
be more locally responsive and creating more effective partnerships 
with local stakeholders. We are encouraged by positive signs in the 
markets where our transformation is furthest along.
 
UK Rail
In UK Rail, we continue to focus on operating performance across 
our existing franchises while delivering major infrastructure and 
capacity upgrades in conjunction with our industry partners. We are 
in discussions with the DfT in respect of contract extensions for two 
of our existing franchises, First Great Western and First Capital 
Connect. We are poised to take part in the new franchising process 
as set out by the DfT and remain committed to retaining a leading 
position in the UK rail market.

Capital structure 
The continued strength of our balance sheet is critical to delivering  
the full potential of our businesses. We believe that the rights issue 
announced in May 2013, to raise approximately £615m, will: 
■ ■
remove the constraints of our current balance sheet and provide  
a sustainable capital structure going forward 
■ ■
support our objective to remain investment grade, and avoid  
the anticipated additional financing costs of becoming  
sub-investment grade 
■ ■
provide the necessary flexibility to continue our transformation plans 
and invest to create sustainable, long term value. 
Investing for the future 
Over the next four years, we will invest approximately £1.6bn across 
the business to continue our transformation programmes and take 
advantage of growth opportunities. This will be financed from existing 
cash resources, future cash generated from operations,  
and a portion of the proceeds of the rights issue. 
In order to deliver our plans and underpin growth and returns,  
we will equip our divisions with appropriate levels of investment  
to achieve their key priorities. Further details about specific  
priorities can be found in the Chief Executive’s strategic review  
on pages 4 and 5.
Medium term targets 
Following the rights issue, we are targeting the following objectives 
over the next four years: 
■ ■
Increase Group revenue (excluding UK Rail) at a faster rate than the 
economies we serve, improve margins in First Student and UK Bus
1
 
to double digit levels, and achieve a post-tax return on capital 
employed (ROCE) in the range of 10% to 12% 
■ ■
Maintain our investment grade credit rating and appropriate liquidity 
and covenant headroom 
■ ■
Re-establish a progressive and sustainable dividend policy, aligned 
to business performance.

 On a post-IAS 19 basis. The estimated impact of IAS 19 is set out on page 39.
Dividends
In the short term, the Board proposes that no final dividend will 
be paid in respect of 2012/13 and no interim dividend will be paid in 
respect of 2013/14. 
Dividend payments will recommence with a final dividend for 2013/14, 
subject to performance in line with expectations, as a transition to 
re-establishing a progressive dividend policy thereafter. A transitional 
final dividend of up to £50m for 2013/14 will be recommended, 
subject to the Board determining the exact amount and thereafter, a 
dividend cover of 2.0 to 2.5 times will be targeted.
Over the next four years, 
we intend to invest 
approximately £1.6bn 
across our business to 
continue our transformation
programmes and take 
advantage of growth 
opportunities. 18 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Operating and financial review
The net cash outflow for the year was £74.4m (2012: inflow of 
£119.2m). The exchange of contracts for the sale of eight of our 
London depots occurred just after the financial year end on 9 April 
2013 and had been included in our expectation of cash flow being 
broadly neutral for the year. The net debt to EBITDA ratio was  
3.0 times (2012: 2.5 times). The average debt duration at 31 March 
2013 was 5.4 years (2012: 5.5 years) and there was £1,215.5m  
(2012: £795.8m) of headroom under committed revolver facilities and 
free cash, prior to the repayment of the £300m April 2013 bond. 
During the year a new £325m bond was issued at an effective  
rate of 5.49% as part of our long term funding strategy.
Group results
Group revenue increased by 3.3% to £6,900.9m (2012: £6,678.7m),  
or 4.5% excluding the extra week of trading in the non-Rail businesses 
last year. Underlying operating profit was £335.4m (2012: £428.5m) 
reflecting the previously indicated reductions in UK Bus profits as a 
result of reduced Government support for the industry and external 
cost pressures, together with lower UK Rail profits as we entered the 
new franchise extension period for First TransPennine Express at 
margins closer to the industry average, as well as the impact of one 
week less trading for the North American businesses. Statutory 
operating profit was £205.7m (2012: £448.0m) reflecting the lower 
underlying operating profit and a charge for exceptional items this 
year compared to a credit last year, largely driven by the UK Bus 
pension scheme changes. Underlying EPS was 26.9p (2012: 40.0p) 
and EBITDA was £667 .0m (2012: £742.9m).

Operating and financial review 
First Student
First Student
Revenue in our First Student division was $2,378.6m or £1,503.1m 
(2012: $2,497 .9m or £1,567 .2m). Adjusting for the extra week last year 
US Dollar revenues were 2.8% lower, principally due to a reduced 
number of contracts reflecting our continued focus on retaining or 
winning business that delivers an appropriate level of return on capital 
employed, as well as the impact of Hurricane Sandy and further 
severe weather during the winter. Underlying operating profit was 
$174.9m or £109.9m (2012: $169.5m or £107 .1m) with incremental 
savings from our recovery plan more than offsetting the profit impact 
of the reduced revenues.
A significant amount of our operations were disrupted by Hurricane 
Sandy in late October 2012. The storm, which impacted the entire 
eastern seaboard, parts of the Midwest and Eastern Canada, 
affected approximately 130 of our locations and led to the closure of 
schools for up to nine days. This adversely impacted operating profit 
by approximately $13m and further periods of severe weather in early 
2013 saw a further $8m impact. A number of the lost operating days 
may potentially be recovered at the end of the summer term which 
occurs in our 2013/14 financial year. 
Recovery programme
We have made good progress in continuing our recovery 
programme in First Student to address performance and strengthen 
the operating model. Although there remains significant work to be 
done, and we remain cautious in respect of the sustained weakness 
of the US economy, we are seeing positive results from a more 
efficient model, and are on track to achieve our stated target of 
$100m in annual savings.
A key milestone in our recovery programme has been the rollout of 
uniform practices which are achieving consistency and greater 
efficiency across our locations. A detailed ‘playbook’ setting out 
consistent operating procedures and best practices sourced from 
across the business is generating real and tangible benefits. This also 
gives First Student a more compelling, efficient and consistently high 
standard offering. We are extremely pleased to report that customer 
satisfaction scores are at the highest level for four years and we have 
seen a sustained improvement for the fourth year in a row.

Our lean maintenance and engineering practices continue to be 
adopted, following the examples set by our 18 reference workshops 
across the business. 92% of our workshops have now achieved the 
initial level of lean certification. We are consolidating our vehicle and 
parts purchasing processes and have developed a much more 
efficient online ordering system that has been well received across  
the business.
The benefits of our transition to a more efficient organisation were 
particularly visible at the start of the school year in September. This is 
traditionally a challenging time for school bus operators but this year 
we saw consistently high levels of operating performance, including 
continued improvement in our safety metrics. Our industry leading 
safety performance is entrenched in our culture, giving us a 
competitive advantage and forming an important consideration when 
bidding for contracts. Illinois, for example, recently passed legislation 
adding safety as a criterion, alongside low cost, for contract award. 
Outlook
We are now well positioned to leverage our scale as the market leader 
and deliver long term, sustainable growth. Whilst there remains work 
to be done in our recovery programme, the actions we have taken 
and positive results we have seen so far give us confidence that we 
will be able to create a sustainable competitive advantage that we  
can build upon for many years to come.
Contract wins and retention
Although state and local finances have stabilised overall, a number of 
large states and school districts continue to face substantial funding 
constraints. Against that backdrop, our recovery is on plan and we 
are making progress by leveraging our existing relationships to 
expand current operations, for example in Kansas City, Missouri and 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. Recent new contract wins 
have included competitions in Indian River, New York and in 
Waukesha, Wisconsin where our winning proposal offered 150 
propane fuelled buses and a system of swipe cards that allows 
parents to track when students get on and off the bus, which was 
welcomed by parents and the school district.
Interest in conversion from in-house operations to the private sector 
remains high as a result of a drive to improve municipal finances, 
although we remain suitably cautious since only a relatively small 
proportion of these inquiries result in outsourcing. Despite this, we 
continue to be competitive in the conversion market. New business, 
started in September 2012, included eight conversion contracts 
totalling more than 450 buses out of a total amount of 860 new buses 
that we started operating during the 2012/13 financial year.
Charter business
Our plans to increase the charter activity of our business are 
progressing well. Amongst charter business we were awarded this 
year was a contract to transport staff to Super Bowl XLVII in February 
in New Orleans, as well as work with the PGA golf tour and NASCAR 
auto racing.
Operating efficiency
We continue to promote the use of innovative and environmentally 
friendly technology, with 134 propane fuelled buses also now in use 
for Seattle and Portland public schools. Our FOCUS GPS software, 
which underwent an upgrade in October 2012, links on-board data to 
back office systems which helps to eliminate excess mileage and fuel 
usage and provides customers with access to real time data. We 
completed the rollout of the system across our US locations during 
the year, as well as beginning our rollout in Canada which will 
complete during 2013/14.
High customer satisfaction 
For the fourth year in a row, First Student 
saw improved customer service scores, 
with increases achieved in all major 
categories, particularly the start up 
of the new school year.
Centenary of school buses 
First Student, in one name or another, can 
trace its origins back to 1913 and California’s 
first school bus, used to transport students 
in the city of Newman. A testament to its 
strong customer relationships, First Student 
is proud to serve the same school district a 
century later.

First Transit continues to deliver strong revenue growth from a diverse 
portfolio of related businesses. Revenue increased to $1,286.8m or 
£814.6m (2012: $1,242.6m or £778.6m). Excluding the extra week last 
year and the First Support Services (FSS) business which has been 
sold, US Dollar revenues increased by 7 .7%. Underlying operating 
profit was $77 .7m or £49.1m (2012: $89.1m or £55.8m) with the 
reduction principally due to the agreement to settle a $13.5m historic 
legal claim in California.
In March we divested our First Support Services business, which 
provides military base operations support and facility management 
services, to Parsons for sale proceeds of $10.2m, allowing First 
Transit to focus on its core transportation segments.
First Transit and First Vehicle Services are the leading operators in 
their field with an unrivalled reputation for transport and fleet 
maintenance expertise. We operate a varied and extensive mix of 
approximately 340 contracts across almost 40 US States, four 
Canadian Provinces and in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  
We are the largest, or near largest, private operator in each of our 
core business segments – fixed route, paratransit, shuttle, transport 
call centres and vehicle maintenance services.
Our management team is highly experienced and has a strong 
reputation in the transit market. This long established credibility 
and track record helps us to win new business across a range 
of private customers and public transit authorities. We work 
collaboratively with our clients as they seek to improve their transit 
offering by helping them to generate greater efficiencies and using 
our global expertise and best practice to deliver transport solutions 
on any scale. 
Strong contract growth
We continued to develop new business from a healthy pipeline  
of opportunity during the year. Key contracts won in the fixed route 
business included Valley Metro in Mesa and Tempe, Arizona and  
we expanded our contract with Foothill Transit in Arcadia, Southern 
California. In the paratransit business we won new contracts with  
the Maryland Transit Authority and Washington DC Metropolitan 
Transport Authority.

Innovative solutions
We continue to work with our clients to promote the latest 
technological and environmental innovation. This includes the 
DriveCam system, which monitors driving behaviour to provide real 
time feedback and coaching data to improve safety and fuel 
economy. On renewing our partnership with the University of Buffalo, 
we worked with them to introduce a new fleet, powered by biodiesel 
fuel and including the latest in clean engine technology to produce 
near zero emissions. This follows our introduction of the Austin area’s 
first environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel cell bus to University of 
Texas students. The introduction of this bus assists Austin’s Capital 
Metro in promoting its green initiatives to the community, as well as a 
new environmentally friendly form of local transit.
College students are early adopters of new technology and we are 
working with our university partners to develop smart ticketing and  
real time passenger information solutions where possible, including 
joining with industry leading information provider Transloc. This 
experience helps us develop and extend our offering across  
our other core operations.
Outlook
First Transit is well placed to use our knowledge and wide-ranging 
experience to pursue growth opportunities in our core areas, 
particularly the shuttle bus segment, going forward.
An area of strong growth and focus for us is the shuttle bus market, 
and we were awarded further contracts at airports across the USA 
including Detroit and Dallas/Fort Worth. We expanded our market 
leading university shuttle bus portfolio, the largest in the USA, with 
an eight year contract at Auburn University as well as further new 
business at the University of Tennessee, the State University of New 
York and the University of Alabama. Following last year’s contract 
win at Yale and our existing business at Princeton, this year we will 
be partnering with another Ivy League university at Brown.
Client relationships are key in this market and our reputation in one  
area of First Transit can be an important factor in winning business in 
another. During the past year, we have secured a new contract for the 
New York State Department of Transportation, building on the existing 
relationship we already had with the same authority. We also continue  
to build on the strong relationships we have with companies in Fort 
McMurray, Alberta, as we add more contracts to complement the 
existing work we already undertake in this non-traditional market and 
expanding oil industry location.
During the year we also renewed several key contracts, including 
fixed route contracts with Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority, 
the city of Phoenix, Arizona, the Potomac and Rappahannock 
Transportation Commission in Virginia and further large fixed route 
contracts in Colorado, Washington State and British Columbia. Other 
renewal contracts include paratransit work for NJ Transit AccessLink, 
Pierce Transit in Washington State and Chemung County in New York, 
as well as shuttle buses for the New York Department of Corrections.
In First Vehicle Services, we were pleased to renew a significant 
contract this year with Mount Pleasant, South Carolina,  
to maintain their fleet of 636 vehicles. First Vehicle Services sets  
the highest standards in the industry and has more maintenance 
workshops with National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence 
Blue Seal certification than our competitors, with around a quarter  
of our locations certified so far.
Greener vehicles 
We are introducing new 
environmentally friendly vehicles, 
including biodiesel and hydrogen fuel 
cell buses, to locations across the 
United States such as the University 
of Buffalo, Capital Metro in Austin 
and Emory University in Georgia.
Helping veterans back to work 
We support the United States Army’s 
Partnership for Youth Success (PaYS) 
programme, a nationwide partnership 
helping provide jobs to returning or retiring 
soldiers. More than 900 veterans have been 
placed in a number of positions within First 
Transit and First Vehicle Services.

Greyhound
Greyhound
Greyhound continues to be affected by the ongoing weakness 
in the sector of the US economy that it serves and during the 
year like-for-like revenue growth was 1.1% (2012: 4.1%). Revenue 
was $1,022.0m or £647.1m (2012: $1,049.3m or £657.2m) with 
the reduction principally due to the extra week last year as well 
as slimmed down operations in our Canadian business. Underlying 
operating profit was $81.5m or £52.0m (2012: $81.0m or £50.6m) 
with operating efficiencies and fixed cost savings more than 
offsetting the reduction in revenues.
While Greyhound remains a cyclical business, the actions we have 
taken over recent years have enabled us to better position the division 
to leverage the benefits of a more flexible and agile operating model. 
This means that we have been able to mitigate the sustained softness 
in economic conditions in North America. We are making Greyhound 
a more modern and efficient network as well as redefining the 
customer experience.
Greyhound Express
Our Greyhound Express product continues to go from strength  
to strength. We continue to develop these non-stop city to city 
services and saw passenger growth of around 10% in Greyhound 
Express markets during the second half of the year, as the 
concept continues to encourage a new passenger demographic 
and attract users back to bus travel.
During the year we began operating Greyhound Express in new 
markets including California, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Nevada and 
Delaware as well as Ontario and British Columbia in Canada. 
With further rollouts taking place in states where we already had 
a presence, the Express network now serves more than 900 city 
pairs available in nearly 100 markets. As we continue to build  
on this momentum further expansion is planned in the  
coming year.

As well as changes to our network and vehicles, we have also been 
transforming the way we interact with our customers. An improved 
website offers benefits for customers and we are encouraged by the 
take up of our partnership with PayNearMe and retailers including 
7-Eleven and ACE Cash Express, which allows customers without 
debit or credit cards to book attractive fares online and pay by cash  
in store. This is now our fifth largest sales channel and we are 
developing relationships with further partners. We are seeing high 
usage of our self service ticket kiosks and are rolling these out across 
the network, with ten further locations introduced this year.
We continue to right size or relocate our terminals where appropriate. 
During the year we completed the move of all of our Washington, DC 
operations to the multi-modal hub at the city’s Union Station, which 
allows customers from our networks to connect seamlessly to other 
transport modes. 
Greyhound Canada
In Canada, we have been working with the provincial government of 
British Columbia to reduce uneconomic routes, and now that this is 
almost complete, we are aiming to return to profitability in the coming 
year. We successfully launched Greyhound Express in Alberta, 
Ontario and British Columbia.
Outlook
Notwithstanding the economic backdrop, coach travel is the fastest 
growing mode of intercity transportation in the United States. 
Greyhound is an iconic business which is synonymous with 
affordable travel. The 99-year old business is in a unique position 
with the only national network in North America. Our focus is to 
harness the commercial learnings and attributes from our smaller, 
faster growing point-to-point businesses in the operation of our  
legacy network.
Tailored brands for local markets
Although Greyhound has a national scale, the division also offers 
distinctive local products. Our BoltBus service expanded into the 
Pacific Northwest during the year, offering customers a viable 
alternative to Amtrak’s Cascades service in the region and our 
subsidiary Crucero USA, serving the Hispanic market, also launched 
its first direct, non-stop services connecting key locations in Southern 
California during the summer. Our Chinatown connection service,  
YO! Bus, launched a direct service between New York and 
Philadelphia in December 2012, providing a reliable alternative to 
many current Chinatown operators. After seeing impressive success 
from YO! Bus we subsequently extended the service to Boston in 
March 2013.
Investing in fleet and operations
We added 60 new vehicles to our fleet during the year, and we also 
refurbished more than 200 vehicles to introduce more modern 
amenities for our customers. We have now refurbished more than 
540 buses to date.
In April 2013 we announced the $100m purchase of a further 220 
new buses, the largest order in the company’s recent history. These 
will be introduced over the course of 2013 and 2014. All the buses  
will feature our new look interiors with on-board amenities including 
Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, three-point safety belts and extra 
legroom, and will be powered by clean diesel, low emission engines. 
Building on our experiences in First Student and First Transit, the new 
buses will also have the DriveCam video data and driver feedback 
system, helping to improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions. The 
introduction of these new vehicles will mean almost all of Greyhound’s 
fleet is now either new or refurbished.
Successful launch of YO! Bus 
Taking advantage of a growing sector our 
new brand serving the Chinatown market 
between Philadelphia and New York City 
proved highly successful, and was 
expanded to serve Boston.
Investment in new fleet 
We are investing $100m in 220 new buses  
for Greyhound, which will include modern 
amenities such as Wi-Fi, power outlets  
and leather seating. They are powered by 
clean diesel, low emission engines and feature 
the latest technology in safety and efficiency.
Operating and financial review 
Greyhound continued Performance
25 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Operating and financial review 
UK Bus
Revenue in our UK Bus division was £1,128.2m (2012: £1,157 .2m) 
and like-for-like passenger revenue growth was 2.4% (2012: 1.6%). 
Underlying operating profit was £90.7m (2012: £134.4m) with the 
reduction, as previously indicated, principally down to a fall in 
Government funding available to the industry as well as external  
cost pressures, particularly fuel and pension costs.
In May 2012 we set out our clear and detailed strategy to fix and 
restore sustainable growth to our UK Bus division. Following a 
detailed review of our businesses we implemented comprehensive 
plans coordinated at a divisional level but tailored to each of our local 
operations, focused around repositioning and rebalancing the 
portfolio, improving operating discipline and efficiencies and driving 
increased revenue and patronage growth.
Repositioning and rebalancing the portfolio
The vast majority of our bus operations generate good returns or 
have potential for significant further improvement. We have taken 
action to reposition and rebalance the portfolio in order to concentrate 
on these areas and throughout the year we have executed a targeted 
disposal programme, selling 14 bus depots and outstations across 
the country for a total of almost £100m.
Amongst the disposals we announced the sale of eight of our London 
bus depots in April 2013. Whilst we have been a presence in London 
for many years, we have decided to focus our business on the 
deregulated market outside of the capital where we see greater 
opportunity for improved growth and returns. We have a very 
constructive relationship with Transport for London and we will be 
working closely with them to ensure the transfer to the new operators 
goes ahead smoothly.
Improving operating discipline and efficiencies
We are making progress in restoring operating discipline across the 
business, and improving service quality and delivery through the 
application of best practices and standardisation. We have rolled out 
upgraded diagnostic systems, improved our engineering and repair 
processes and are enhancing our training.
Our programme to transform our depots will raise operating 
performance and optimise processes, leading to greater efficiency. 
This includes learning from the best practices that our First Student 
and Greyhound divisions have accumulated in recent years. Areas 
under focus include optimising depot layout, leadership development 
and reducing vehicle defects. Early positive outcomes across certain 
regions include a 22% reduction in breakdowns since these initiatives 
were launched, and mileage lost due to engineering has significantly 
reduced, by up to 50% in some areas.

We have a strong platform 
from which to grow in 
UK Bus. Our networks 
are the backbone of the 
communities we serve
and contribute to 
vibrant and sustainable 
local economies.
Driving increased revenue and patronage growth
Our strategy to drive increased revenue and patronage growth 
is focused on developing tailored local solutions that are most 
appropriate for each of the areas in which we operate, based on the 
highest standards that we have established at a national level.
Our local management teams are introducing better value for money 
fares structures in order to stimulate demand. These include better 
value day and period tickets, such as ‘eight days for the price of 
seven’ promotions launched in Aberdeen. In Manchester we 
announced a range of fare reductions and on certain routes we have 
seen passenger growth of up to 50%.
Our local networks are also being redesigned to deliver volume 
growth. For example, in Norwich our new colour coded routes are 
proving popular amongst existing customers as well as providing 
additional impetus to attract new passengers. In Glasgow we 
launched a wide-ranging consultation on SimpliCITY, a root-and-
branch review of our network in the city, and after taking into account 
feedback introduced a revised network in May 2013 that is both 
simpler and improved for the majority of passengers. We have 
introduced 200 new vehicles in the Manchester and Yorkshire 
markets and rebranded 750 buses on our high frequency inter-urban 
networks. With strong local route branding and targeted marketing 
we have seen up to 3% passenger volume growth compared to the 
existing network.
High frequency network
We have introduced 200 new vehicles 
and 750 rebranded buses on our high 
frequency inter-urban networks in 
Manchester and Yorkshire. With local 
route branding and targeted marketing, 
we have seen passenger volume growth 
of up to 3%.
Networks reviewed and relaunched 
After detailed analysis of market opportunities, 
a number of our networks have been 
relaunched to offer new, simpler, colour coded 
routes, which are more accessible to existing 
and potential customers.

Smart ticketing and innovation
Following the installation of smartcard enabled ticket machines 
across our regional fleet in England in 2012/13, we are now working 
to introduce smartcard applications across our networks. We are 
party to a host of multi-operator ticketing schemes, which are all 
smartcard compatible, and we are keen to support the introduction  
of further such arrangements where they do not currently exist and 
where a clear market need can be identified.
Further innovation includes fitting Wi-Fi to our new buses as standard, 
and we retro-fitted Wi-Fi to our fleet in certain areas during the year. 
The Eclipse Bus Rapid Transit network in South Hampshire, built on 
a former railway line, has been a great success in its first year of 
operation. Passenger numbers have risen steadily, with more than 
1.3m journeys made since the service began. The South Hampshire 
area was also the pilot for our new mobile phone app which is now 
live across the country providing up to the minute bus information  
for passengers. 
Over the past year, the excellence and innovation of our UK Bus 
division has been recognised by various awards. We picked up 
six accolades at the UK Bus Awards in categories which included 
marketing and community initiatives, whilst our operations in 
Aberdeen won the team of the year prize at the Scottish 
Transport Awards.
Developing effective partnerships
We have been working with local authorities to implement schemes 
which were awarded money in the first phase of the DfT’s Better Bus 
Area (BBA) fund last March. For instance, we have used BBA funds 
given to the Transport for South Hampshire coalition of councils to 
introduce Wi-Fi on all buses operating in the area. Hybrid buses are 
being introduced in services across the country, for instance in our 
park and ride services in Bath, Leeds and Glasgow. Funding from the 
Government’s Green Bus Fund has been used to introduce hybrids 
on routes in Essex and around Heathrow.
We are developing close partnerships with all local authorities in 
areas in which we operate. This will enable us to respond best to their 
needs as a reliable partner who can deliver solutions to congestion 
and help stimulate economic activity in alignment with their aims. 
In Sheffield we are working closely with South Yorkshire Passenger 
Transport Executive, Sheffield City Council and other operators to 
radically improve bus services in the city, which has resulted in 
Government funding for fuel duty rebate being devolved back to 
the city and supplemented by a top up fund of an additional 20%, 
the first award of this kind. This money will be spent to tackle specific 
problems in the city. Our experience shows that partnership is by far 
the quickest and most effective way to achieve the changes that bus 
users want to see and that will deliver growth.
London 2012 Games
We were delighted that around 2,000 of our employees were directly 
involved in the positive transport story at the London 2012 Games, 
as we provided successful spectator transport for hundreds of 
thousands of attendees. The new buses that formed part of our 
London 2012 offering have now been deployed into our networks, 
as part of our £160m investment in 1,000 new vehicles over the last 
two years. We followed this up in February with a further order for 464 
new buses worth £76m for delivery in 2013/14, with interior designs 
taking into account feedback from passengers and employees.
Outlook
We have a strong platform from which to grow in UK Bus. Our 
networks are the backbone of the communities we serve and 
contribute to vibrant and sustainable local economies, although the 
challenging economic environment continues to affect many of the 
urban areas in which we are based. While there remains significant 
work to do in order to transform our UK Bus business we are 
pleased by the progress so far and the early positive signs in 
some of our markets.
Wi-Fi being rolled out across the fleet 
Our new buses have Wi-Fi fitted as 
standard and the technology is being 
retro-fitted across large parts of our 
existing fleet.

UK Rail
Operating and financial review 
UK Rail
Our UK Rail division continues to benefit from strong demand with 
like-for-like passenger revenue growth of 7 .4% (2012: 8.4%). Revenue 
during the year was £2,795.1m (2012: £2,506.1m) with the increase 
due to higher passenger receipts as well as higher subsidy receipts at 
First ScotRail, principally due to Network Rail changes, which meant 
that both subsidy receipts and operating costs were £128m higher 
than in the preceding year. Underlying operating profit was £63.2m  
(2012: £110.5m) reflecting the expected reduction in profits at  
First TransPennine Express in the three year extension period  
at operating margins closer to the industry average.
We have a diverse rail portfolio encompassing long distance, regional 
and commuter operations, and are the largest owning group in the 
UK with around a quarter of the market. Our highly experienced 
management team has unrivalled knowledge in delivering major 
infrastructure improvements in partnership with stakeholders. For 
example, First ScotRail has entered into an alliance agreement with 
Network Rail which is creating a more efficient working relationship 
between the two organisations in order to better align overall 
objectives, deliver value for money and increase focus on passenger 
requirements. The first major project to be undertaken under this 
arrangement was electrification of the line between Glasgow Central 
and Paisley Canal. This award winning project was delivered in just 
four months and at less than half of the original cost estimate as a 
result of the effective alliance.
We have a strong track record of investment with more than 700 new 
vehicles introduced and punctuality and performance increasing 
across each of our franchises since we commenced operation. 
Our rail companies also played their part in the successful transport 
operation for the London 2012 Games, with First Great Western 
running a shuttle service connecting to First Games Transport’s 
buses at Slough station for rowing events at Eton Dorney. First Capital 
Connect ran over a million extra seats during the Games, including 
later trains home after events, and established a successful 24/7 
customer support centre which has now become a permanent 
feature of our customer service offering. 
This year the rail sector has been subject to a great deal of scrutiny 
following the cancellation of the DfT’s franchising programme. We 
have the most experienced bidding team in the industry and our 
delight in being awarded the InterCity West Coast franchise in August 
2012 was matched only by our disappointment in being notified in 
October that the DfT had cancelled the competition following the 
discovery of significant technical flaws in their internal processes. The 
DfT made it clear that we were in no way at fault, having followed the 
due process correctly. We submitted a strong bid, in good faith and in 
strict accordance with the DfT’s terms.

29 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Our bid would have delivered a better service for West Coast 
passengers, value for the taxpayer and an appropriate return for 
shareholders. Following various inquiries the DfT announced in 
January 2013, as part of a new refranchising schedule, that it was to 
extend our First Capital Connect and First Great Western franchises 
by the 28 week period in the original contracts. Further extensions of 
six months for First Capital Connect and 33 months for First Great 
Western, as well as ten months for First TransPennine Express, were 
announced in March and we are progressing negotiations with the 
DfT in respect of these. The publication of the timetable setting out 
the return to refranchising is an important development for the 
industry, enabling the private sector to continue to provide effective 
and efficient passenger rail services with further performance and 
infrastructure improvements. 
During the year the Scottish Government also announced that the 
First ScotRail franchise will now be extended to March 2015, from 
its previous completion date of November 2014.
As the UK’ s largest and 
most experienced rail 
operator , we remain 
committed to maintaining 
a leading position in 
the market.
First Capital Connect
We continue to focus on performance at First Capital Connect, 
where our Public Performance Measurement (PPM) of reliability and 
punctuality stands at 88.3% on a Moving Annual Average (MAA) 
basis, a reduction of 1.6% from last year. During the London 2012 
Games we recorded our highest ever PPM score of 94.6%.  
However, the main reason for the overall reduction has been 
significant disruption caused by infrastructure problems, with 
a number of incidents relating to the failure during the winter of the 
overhead line equipment supplying power to our trains. We are 
working with Network Rail to establish more effective cooperation 
going forward, for example on more efficient engineering practices 
during improvement work.
We continue to work closely with our industry partners on the 
Thameslink Programme of major improvement works which will 
deliver much needed capacity on this key cross-London route.  
During the year, a significant highlight was the resumption of full 
service between Brighton and Bedford throughout the day, evening 
and at weekends following the completion of three and a half years 
of engineering work. Major improvements were made with longer 
12-car trains introduced at peak times, later trains and new services. 
First Great Western
First Great Western’s PPM MAA score stands at 89.1%, a slight 
decrease on last year. Severe weather, especially repeated flooding 
in the West Country, caused a number of Network Rail infrastructure 
failures impacting punctuality over a total of 21 days, and we have 
been working with them to help overcome these issues. 
During the year we completed the introduction of 48 new carriages 
as part of the DfT’s High Level Output Specification programme. 
Refurbishments on the Class 180 fleet have also allowed us to trial 
Wi-Fi provision. In the past three years we have worked with the DfT 
to secure a total of 90 additional carriages, adding around 10% more 
space on trains for customers. This badly needed capacity increase 
has helped improve the customer experience and reduced the 
number of severely overcrowded trains.
Introducing new technology 
We are embracing new technology to 
explore different ways to enhance the 
customer offering. This includes mobile 
ticketing, apps for smartphones, 
redesigned, user-friendly websites and 
increased use of social media.
Tramlink success 
Tramlink, which we operate on behalf of 
Transport for London, enjoys the best 
performance and customer satisfaction levels 
of any of TfL’s services. It now carries 29m 
people per annum, an increase of 11m since 
the start of operations. 30 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Major infrastructure work including gauge and signalling upgrades 
continues on the route, including an £850m improvement package 
at Reading station to ease this bottleneck and improve capacity at 
this key junction. From 2016 the vast majority of the eastern section 
of the route will be electrified, providing the opportunity for cleaner, 
longer and more reliable trains, and we are working with the DfT as 
that project commences. 
First ScotRail
First ScotRail continues to perform well with a PPM MAA score 
of 93.0%, considerably above the national average. In Passenger 
Focus’s independent National Passenger Survey (NPS) category 
of overall customer satisfaction, we scored 90% in autumn 2012, 
an increase on 2011 and five points higher than the UK average.
We began a £1m investment programme during the year into stations 
which will see increased patronage during the 2014 Commonwealth 
Games. As a result of a further £1m of Scottish Government funding, 
free Wi-Fi will be rolled out by December 2013 at 25 stations across 
Scotland, and all 38 of First ScotRail’s Class 380 trains will have Wi-Fi 
by March 2014.
First ScotRail and the Scottish Government are accelerating plans to 
offer smartcard season tickets to customers. After a successful initial 
pilot, an investment of approximately £2m has seen the installation 
and/or upgrade of equipment at 70 stations across the central belt, 
which will see key routes begin to accept smartcards.
First TransPennine Express
First TransPennine Express has continued to set and achieve high 
standards through 2012/13. Our PPM MAA score is above the 
national average at 91.7%. This result was achieved despite severe 
disruption caused by a landslip at a colliery near Scunthorpe in 
February 2013 causing that part of our route to be closed for several 
months. We achieved a customer satisfaction rating of 88% in the 
latest NPS, a 14% increase since the start of the franchise, and during 
the year we achieved five star accreditation from the British Quality 
Foundation, the highest possible award.
First TransPennine Express now has the second highest seat 
occupancy of any UK operator and has reduced taxpayer subsidy 
as a proportion of passenger revenue by 80% during the life of the 
franchise. Carrying nearly 25m passengers in 2012/13, we have 
increased passenger income growth for the year by 10%, well ahead 
of the industry average.
We are investing £60m in 40 new carriages which will form  
longer trains from December this year on the Manchester-Scotland 
routes. The new trains will provide a 30% uplift in capacity and a  
25% increase in luggage space and their introduction will in turn 
release carriages to increase capacity on the popular Manchester-
Leeds route. 
First Hull Trains
In 2012 First Hull Trains carried almost 750,000 people, a new  
high, on our 90 services a week between Hull and London King’s 
Cross and our Class 180 fleet has seen improved performance.  
New initiatives such as M-Tickets, where travel documents are sent 
directly to customers’ mobile telephones as well as a new, more 
interactive website and print at home tickets have all improved the 
journey experience.
Partly as a result of these initiatives, we scored 95% in overall 
customer satisfaction in the latest NPS – a 7% improvement on  
the autumn 2011 survey, and 2% better than the score achieved  
in spring 2012 compared with the national average for long  
distance operators of 89%.
Outlook
As the UK’s largest and most experienced rail operator, we remain 
committed to maintaining a leading position in the market. We look 
forward to reviewing the details of the upcoming franchise 
competitions, and submitting further high quality bids that deliver 
value for passengers, taxpayers and shareholders.
Smartcards for First ScotRail
First ScotRail and the Scottish 
Government are accelerating plans to 
offer smartcard season tickets to 
customers after a successful initial 
pilot with 12,000 cards on the 
Edinburgh-Falkirk-Glasgow line.

Outlook
We have a fundamentally attractive 
portfolio of market leading transport 
businesses, and our unrivalled scale and 
breadth gives us significant opportunities 
to share best practice and expertise,  
to deliver outstanding services to our 
customers and to create long term, 
sustainable value for our shareholders.
We have delivered a resilient trading performance for the year, in line 
with our expectations. We also achieved other significant goals we set 
ourselves, including our c.£100m UK Bus disposal programme and 
divesting of other non-core assets such as First Support Services.
The real long term opportunity for us, however, arises from our 
business recovery programmes, particularly in First Student and  
UK Bus. We have clear plans in place and, while there remains 
significant work to be done, our confidence continues to grow as 
a result of the progress to date.
The rights issue announced in May 2013, to raise approximately 
£615m, will remove the constraints from our balance sheet and 
enhance our ability to invest in our businesses going forward. We plan 
to invest approximately £1.6bn across our five divisions over the next 
four years to underpin growth and return our businesses to our target 
levels of profitability. Through these actions, combined with our scale 
and expertise, we are positioning the business for improved growth 
and returning it to a profile of consistent returns and cash generation. 32 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013

33 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
First Student legal claims 
During the year, the Group incurred £2.6m of legal costs in defending 
old contractual claims and other litigations. In addition, the Group 
provided £17 .2m to cover the estimated potential settlement amounts 
on certain of these historical claims.
First Transit legal settlements 
The Group settled certain historical legal claims during the year, 
principally a contractual dispute from 2009. The Group treated  
this cost as exceptional due to the size and age of the claims.  
The Group recognised an exceptional charge of £5.9m in respect  
of these settlements. 
First Transit Diego Garcia insurance claim
The Group settled a historical insurance claim in relation to the  
Diego Garcia contract in 2012/13 and recognised exceptional income 
of £6.7m.
UK Bus Pension Scheme changes
UK Bus Pension Scheme changes relate to measures the Group 
took to mitigate the risk of the pension schemes covering UK Bus 
employees. As a result of these changes, future pension liabilities of 
the Group decreased. In 2011/12, the Group linked pension increases 
to consumer price inflation (CPI) rather than retail price inflation (RPI), 
which usually shows a higher rate of inflation, and also introduced a 
pensionable pay cap, along with lower pension accrual rates. 
As a result of these changes, future pension liabilities of the Group 
decreased in 2011/12, and the Group realised a one-off exceptional 
gain of £73.3m.
UK Rail bid costs
The Group’s net UK Rail bid costs during the year represented 
franchise bid costs for all bids, less amounts recovered or recoverable 
from the DfT in respect of the InterCity West Coast franchise bid. The 
Group incurred UK Rail bid costs in both 2012/13 and 2011/12 in 
connection with the InterCity West Coast franchise bid as well as bids 
for Great Western, Thameslink and Essex Thameside rail franchises.
Competition Commission costs
Competition Commission (CC) costs relate to costs incurred by  
the Group in 2011/12 in responding to an investigation by the CC  
into the UK local bus market. The CC issued their final report in 
December 2011.
UK Bus depot sales and closures
UK Bus depot sales and closures relate to measures taken by the 
Group to rebalance its portfolio in the UK Bus operations, which 
included selling or closing certain operations. Shortly after the end of 
the year we announced the agreements to sell all of our London 
depots with the exception of Dagenham. The principal charge in 
2012/13 represents asset impairments and an onerous contract 
provision for the remaining Dagenham depot.
First Transit FSS disposal and exit from  
Diego Garcia operations 
During the year the Group disposed of the First Support Services 
business realising a loss on disposal of £7 .7m. In addition operating 
profit to date of disposal of £1.0m has also been treated as part of the 
overall exceptional charge. The Diego Garcia operations were exited 
at the end of the year which resulted in a net exceptional charge 
of £5.9m.
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision
The Group recorded a provision in 2010/11 in respect of the  
UK Rail First Great Western (FGW) franchise agreement. This 
provision reflected the Group’s best estimate of the likely losses  
on the franchise over the two years to 31 March 2013, which would 
arise due to the accelerated write off of assets dedicated to the FGW 
franchise due to the Group’s decision not to exercise its option to 
extend the franchise agreement for a further three years beyond the 
original franchise end date. The Group recorded a further provision 
of £9.9m in 2012/13 due to incremental losses following the DfT 
exercising their option to extend the franchise by a further seven rail 
periods to October 2013.
UK Rail joint venture provision 
The carrying value of £5.0m of the investment in DSBFirst, a joint 
venture with a Danish rail operator, was fully written-off during the 
year as current and projected trading indicates that there will be no 
recovery of this amount at the end of the franchise.
First Student onerous contract
During the year the Group provided a further £2.7m against a 
loss-making contract that was taken on as part of the Laidlaw 
acquisition undertakings in 2007 . This contract is due to expire 
early in the year to 31 March 2014. 34 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Finance costs and investment income
Net finance costs, before exceptional items, were £163.0m  
(2012: £157 .1m) with the increase principally due to the issuance  
of a new £325m 10 year bond in November 2012.
Profit before tax
Underlying profit before tax was £172.4m (2012: £271.4m) with the 
decrease due principally to lower underlying operating profit.  
An overall charge of £135.2m (2012: £8.5m credit) for exceptional 
items and amortisation charges resulted in statutory profit before  
tax of £37 .2m (2012: £279.9m).
Tax
The tax charge, on underlying profit before tax, for the year was 
£34.7m (2012: £54.5m) representing an effective rate of 20.1%  
(2012: 20.1%). There was a tax credit of £43.3m (2012: £0.4m) relating 
to amortisation charges and exceptional items. There was also a 
one-off credit adjustment of £2.0m (2012: £4.0m) to the UK deferred 
tax liability as a result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate 
from 24% to 23% (2012: 26% to 24%) which will apply from April 2013. 
This resulted in a total tax credit of £10.6m (2012: charge of £50.1m) 
on continuing operations. 
The actual tax paid during the year was £6.3m (2012: £17 .7m). North 
American cash tax remains low due to tax losses brought forward 
and tax depreciation in excess of book depreciation. We expect the 
North American cash tax rate to remain low for the near term.  
The UK cash tax for the year was lower than last year principally  
due to lower profits in the Group’s UK businesses.
Discontinued operations
In September 2011 a loss on disposal of £9.2m arose on the sale of 
FirstGroup Deutschland GmbH representing gross consideration of 
£5.5m less the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, and 
transaction costs. This, as well as the operating loss after tax to the 
date of disposal of £0.3m, was classified within discontinued 
operations in the consolidated income statement in 2011/12.
Dividends
The interim dividend of 7 .62p (2012: 7 .62p) per share was paid during 
the year and amounted to £36.7m (2012: £36.6m). The Board 
proposes that no final dividend will be paid in respect of 2012/13.
EPS
The underlying EPS was 26.9p (2012: 40.0p), a reduction of 33%. 
Basic EPS was 7 .3p (2012: 42.7p), a decrease of 83% principally due 
to lower underlying results and higher net exceptional items 
compared to last year. 
 
Other exceptional items
Other exceptional items include principally costs incurred  
in effecting the changes to the UK Bus Pension Scheme in  
2011/12 described above.
Amortisation charges
The charge for the year was £52.0m (2012: £30.9m) with the increase 
mainly due to a higher level of contract amortisation at First Student 
as a result of a reassessment during the year of the remaining useful 
economic lives of the contracts acquired with the Laidlaw acquisition. 
Previously these contracts were being amortised over 20 years but 
are now being amortised over ten years. As a result of this, the 
income statement charge increased by £24.8m during the year.
(Loss)/profit on disposal of properties
During the year the Group realised £9.7m (2012: £40.3m) on the 
disposal of selected properties predominantly in Greyhound and  
UK Bus operations. These resulted in a net loss on disposal of  
£2.7m (2012: profit £1.0m). 
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives
Due to the ineffective element and undesignated fair value 
movements on financial derivatives there was a £5.5m non-cash 
charge (2012: £11.0m) to the income statement during the year. The 
principal component of this non-cash charge relates to fixed interest 
rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting but do provide 
a cash flow hedge against variable rate debt from 2013 to 2015. 
Tax on exceptional items and amortisation charges
The tax credit as a result of these exceptional items was £43.3m 
(2012: £0.4m). In addition there was a one-off deferred tax credit of 
£2.0m (2012: £4.0m) as a result of the reduction in the UK corporation 
tax rate from 24% to 23% (2012: 26% to 24%).

The decrease in cash flow compared to last year was primarily due to:
■ ■
EBITDA of £667 .0m was £75.6m lower than last year. 
■ ■
Higher total exceptional items of £124.4m as set out on page 32.
■ ■
Working capital excluding FGW provision was £27 .3m lower than 
last year principally due to the reversal of cost accruals created for 
the additional week of trading last year in the non-Rail businesses. 
■ ■
Working capital FGW provision movement outflow of £23.0m being 
the £32.9m utilisation for the operating losses in the year partly 
offset by the £9.9m increase in the provision due to incremental 
losses following the DfT exercising the option to extend the 
franchise by a further seven rail periods. 
■ ■
Higher pension payments in excess of income statement charge of 
£6.9m principally due to additional deficit contributions in 
Greyhound.
■ ■
Higher capital expenditure primarily reflecting further investment in 
UK Bus and First Student.
■ ■
Lower disposal proceeds of £43.0m with the reduction due to the 
sale of several Greyhound properties last year the largest of which 
was in Washington DC. 
■ ■
Higher dividend payments to Group shareholders of £5.2m.
Operating and financial review 
Other financial matters continued Performance
37 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Partly offset by:
■ ■
The impact of the 2012/13 asset impairments in relation to the 
Dagenham depot.
■ ■
Movements in other provisions favourable by £16.9m primarily due 
to the additional First Student and First Transit legal claims provided 
for in the year but not paid out during the year.
■ ■
The impact of last year’s one-off non-cash benefit of £73.3m in 
relation to the UK Bus pension scheme changes. 
■ ■
Lower tax and interest payments of £11.0m principally due to lower 
UK tax payments as a result of lower profits in the UK businesses 
and slightly lower interest rates compared to last year.
■ ■
Lower dividends payable to non-controlling minority shareholders 
primarily due to lower First TransPennine Express profits in UK Rail. 
■ ■
Higher proceeds from sale of business of £33.7m due to the impact 
of the UK Bus depot sales (primarily Wigan & Northumberland Park) 
and the sale of FSS in First Transit. 
Capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure was £338.1m (2012: £293.6m) and 
comprised First Student £127 .7m (2012: £115.6m), First Transit 
£18.0m (2012: £31.9m), Greyhound £51.3m (2012: £44.1m), UK Bus 
£72.4m (2012: £33.6m), UK Rail £66.1m (2012: £63.4m) and Group 
items £2.6m (2012: £5.0m).
In addition during the year we entered into operating leases for 
passenger carrying vehicles in UK Bus and First Transit with capital 
values of £21.6m (2012: £43.4m) and £12.5m (2012: £nil) respectively.
Gross capital investment was £404.3m (2012: £366.9m) and 
comprised First Student £150.8m (2012: £135.6m), First Transit 
£30.5m (2012: £29.7m), Greyhound £51.3m (2012: £44.2m), UK Bus 
£103.0m (2012: £88.5m), UK Rail £63.9m (2012: £64.5m) and Group 
items £4.8m (2012: £4.4m).
Funding and risk management
The Group continues to have strong liquidity. At 31 March there was 
£1,215.5m (2012: £795.8m) of committed headroom and free cash 
comprising £821.6m (2012: £631.8m) of headroom under the 
committed revolving bank facility and free cash balances of £393.9m 
(2012: £164.0m). Largely due to seasonality in the North American 
school bus business, committed headroom typically reduces during 
the financial year up to October and increases thereafter. Treasury 
policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed headroom at 
all times.
After the end of the year, the 2013 £300m bond was repaid in full,  
as planned.
The Group’s main revolving bank facility expires in December 2015. 
The average debt maturity was 5.4 years (2012: 5.5 years). 
The Group does not enter into speculative financial transactions 
and uses only authorised financial instruments for certain risk 
management purposes only. 
Interest rate risk
The Group reduces exposure by using a combination of fixed rate 
debt and interest rate derivatives to achieve an overall fixed rate 
position over the medium term of more than 75% of net debt.  
At 31 March 2013 100% (2012: 100%) of net debt was fixed  
and in excess of 81% of net debt is fixed for the next two years.
Fuel price risk 
We manage the commodity price risk on fuel through a progressive 
forward hedging policy.
In the UK, 90% of crude oil costs were hedged at an average rate 
of $102 per barrel during the year. At the end of the year we have 
hedged 85% of our ‘at risk’ UK crude requirements for the year to  
31 March 2014 (1.9m barrels p.a.) at $105 per barrel and 33% of our 
requirements for the year to 31 March 2015 at $99 per barrel.
In North America 69% of crude oil costs were hedged at an average 
rate of $94 per barrel during the year. At the end of the year we have 
hedged 69% of the ‘at risk’ volume for the year to 31 March 2014 
(1.6m barrels p.a.) at $93 per barrel. In addition we have hedged 37% 
of ‘at risk’ volumes for the year to 31 March 2015 at $89 per barrel.
Foreign currency risk
Group policies on foreign currency risk affecting cash flow, profits 
and net assets are maintained to minimise exposures to the Group 
by using a combination of natural hedge positions and derivative 
instruments where appropriate. Translation risk relating to US Dollar 
earnings arising in the US is largely offset by US Dollar denominated 
costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest 
and tax costs so that exposure to EPS on a year to year basis is  
not significant.
With regard to balance sheet translation risk, the Group hedges  
part of its exposure to the impact of exchange rate movements on 
translation of foreign currency net assets by holding currency swaps 
and net borrowings in foreign currencies. At 31 March 2013 foreign 
currency net assets were 39% (2012: 47%) hedged. 38 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Net debt

ratios at the balance sheet date. 
Shares in issue
As at 31 March 2013 there were 481.8m shares in issue  
(2012: 481.4m), excluding treasury shares and own shares held  
in trust for employees of 0.3m (2012: 0.7m). The weighted average 
number of shares in issue for the purpose of basic EPS calculations 
(excluding treasury shares and own shares held in trust for 
employees) was 481.7m (2012: 481.4m).
Balance sheet
Net assets have decreased by £61.7m since the start of the year. 
The principal reasons for this are actuarial losses on defined benefit 
pension schemes (net of deferred tax) of £48.7m, dividend payments 
of £124.5m, unfavourable hedging reserve movements (net of deferred 
tax) of £45. 1m, partly offset by favourable translation reserve movements 
of £103.2m and the retained profit for the year of £47 .8m.
Goodwill
The carrying value (net assets including goodwill but excluding 
intercompany balances) of each cash generating unit (CGU) was tested 
for impairment during the year and there continues to be sufficient 
headroom in all of the CGUs. The First Student recovery plan is 
progressing in line with expectations and as a result the headroom on 
this business has increased modestly compared to last year.

The US Dollar rate was slightly lower in the year to 31 March 2013 
compared to last year.
Pensions
The Group has updated its pension assumptions as at 31 March 
2013 for the defined benefit schemes in the UK and North America. 
The net pension deficit of £268m at the beginning of the year has 
decreased to £248m at the end of the year principally due to better 
actual returns on assets partly offset by lower discount rates and 
higher inflation rates.
The main factors that influence the balance sheet position for 
pensions and the sensitivities to their movement at 31 March 2013 are 
set out below: 
Movement Impact
Discount rate +0.1% Reduce deficit by £33m
Inflation +0.1% Increase deficit by £23m
The changes to the Accounting Standard IAS 19 will apply from 
2013/14 onwards and will have significant impact on certain profit 
measures including operating profit and EPS. We estimate the new 
rules would reduce operating profit in the current year as follows: 
 
2012/13  
£m
UK Bus (37)
UK Rail (25)
Greyhound 2
Total (60)
The changes above have no cash impact and do not affect the 
Group’s banking covenants as these are measured on a constant 
accounting basis.
Seasonality
The First Student business generates lower revenues and profits 
in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year as the 
school summer holidays fall into the first half. Greyhound operating 
profits are typically higher in the first half of the year due to demand 
being strongest in the summer months. 
Going concern
The Group has established a strong balanced portfolio of businesses 
with approximately 50% of Group revenues secured under medium 
term contracts with government agencies and other large 
organisations in the UK and North America.
The Group has a diversified funding structure with average debt 
duration at 31 March 2013 of 5.4 years (2012: 5.5 years) and which 
is largely represented by committed medium to long term unsecured 
bond debt and finance leases. The Group has a $1,250m committed 
revolving banking facility of which $1,135m (2012: $1,011m) was 
undrawn at the year end. This facility expires in December 2015. 
The Directors have carried out a detailed review of the Group’s 
budget for the year to 31 March 2014 and medium term plans, 
with due regard for the risks and uncertainties to which the Group 
is exposed, the uncertain economic climate and the impact that 
this could have on trading performance. Based on this review, the 
Directors believe that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared  
on a going concern basis.

Description
The rail industry’s Public 
Performance Measure (PPM) reflects 
punctuality and reliability. Trains are 
deemed punctual if they arrive at 
their destination, having made all 
timetabled stops, within five minutes 
of scheduled time for commuter and 
regional services; and ten minutes 
for long distance trains.
Performance
PPM reduced slightly compared to 
2011/12 on three of our franchises 
as a result of prolonged infrastructure 
disruption during the winter. First 
ScotRail continued to demonstrate 
improvement and is now considerably 
above the national average.

Performance
We achieved a 3% reduction in Lost 
Time Injuries across the Group (2012: 
18% reduction). This was our ninth 
consecutive year of reductions, as we 
make steady progress towards our goal 
of zero injuries. Despite all our

of incidents, particularly slips, trips and 
falls over the prolonged winter weather 
conditions this year and new learnings 
will be implemented going forward.

similar programme in Greyhound. 
We are also training our drivers to 
use more fuel efficient driving 
techniques. Performance

In 2011/12 we saw our best punctuality 
performance for five years, and we 
have maintained this level throughout 
2012/13. We continually review 
scheduled running times to reflect 
changing traffic conditions where 
possible. We work with local authority 
partners to encourage highway 
upgrades for both improved and 
sustainable journey times.

UK Rail Public Performance Measure
(% MAA)
Description
The rail industry’s Public 
Performance Measure (PPM) reflects 
punctuality and reliability. Trains are 
deemed punctual if they arrive at 
their destination, having made all 
timetabled stops, within five minutes 
of scheduled time for commuter and 
regional services; and ten minutes 
for long distance trains.
Performance
PPM reduced slightly compared to 
2011/12 on three of our franchises 
as a result of prolonged infrastructure 
disruption during the winter. First 
ScotRail continued to demonstrate 
improvement and is now considerably 
above the national average.

We achieved a 3% reduction in Lost 
Time Injuries across the Group (2012: 
18% reduction). This was our ninth 
consecutive year of reductions, as we 
make steady progress towards our goal 
of zero injuries. Despite all our 
preparation we saw a greater number 
of incidents, particularly slips, trips and 
falls over the prolonged winter weather 
conditions this year and new learnings 
will be implemented going forward.

Performance
Emissions have reduced by a  
further 5% this year, in part due to 
implementation of an engineering 
modification programme in the First 
Student fleet and completion of a 
similar programme in Greyhound. 
We are also training our drivers to 
use more fuel efficient driving 
techniques. 42 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Corporate responsibility 
We have made good progress in achieving 
many of our corporate responsibility 
objectives this year and achieved ‘Gold’ 
status in Business in the Community’s 
Corporate Responsibility Index, up from 
‘Silver’ in the previous five years.
Our corporate responsibility priorities
Our corporate responsibility (CR) priorities support the delivery  
of our vision to provide solutions for an increasingly congested 
world… keeping people moving and communities prospering. 
For more information on our vision and values, please see page 4.
Our CR impacts broadly fall into four key areas:
■ ■
Delivering sustainable travel solutions
■ ■
Putting our customers at the heart of everything we do
■ ■
Engaging with local communities
■ ■
Valuing and developing our people
Within these four areas, our CR priorities are focused on the  
issues that are most relevant and material to us, notably service 
performance, employee engagement, customer service  
and addressing the challenge of climate change. Further  
information on our materiality process can be found at  
www.firstgroup.com/corporate/cr
Corporate responsibility management
CR has for many years been integral to our organisation and our 
activities. Our CR programme is led by the Executive Management 
Board (EMB), which reports directly to the Board of FirstGroup plc. 
The programme and associated reporting is developed in line with the 
AccountAbility Principles Statement (AA1000APS) and independently 
assured in accordance with the AccountAbility AA1000 Assurance 
Standard (2008).
Delivering sustainable travel solutions
The years ahead will bring some serious transport challenges driven 
by the need to meet the travel demands of a growing population 
whilst managing pressure on resources and climate change. 
Providing sustainable travel solutions to address these challenges is 
central to our vision and in order to do this we focus on working with 
local and national governments to ensure the right policy and 
investment frameworks are in place, whilst working to reduce our own 
environmental impact and that of our suppliers.
Within FirstGroup this means using new systems to improve 
environmental performance and investment in best practice solutions, 
which over the past year have included: 
In First Transit we have a number of partnerships with technology 
providers that allow us to offer added value to our customers. These 
include DriveCam, which promotes safer driving and fuel efficiency, 
NextBus and Transloc which provide passengers with real time 
information, and RouteMatch scheduling software.
We continue to use the DriveGreen driver management system in our 
UK Bus division to encourage our employees to drive as fuel efficiently 
and safely as possible. Throughout the UK more than half the drivers 
certified at the highest level of excellence by GreenRoad, the 
manufacturers of DriveGreen, are FirstGroup employees.
We have also introduced a programme in First Student that aims to 
improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions through encouraging 
our employees to alter driving habits. 89% of our drivers surveyed 
have changed their habits as a result of the initiative and almost 300 
of our locations have reported measurable fuel savings.
In UK Rail we continue to develop active partnerships to build cycle 
storage facilities at our stations. Working with Hertfordshire County 
Council we have secured funding to double cycle parking capacity at 
Harpenden station, and at Luton and Leagrave we have worked with 
Luton Borough Council to quadruple capacity.
Making our buses accessible for all
Our UK Bus division is working closely 
with organisations, including Guide 
Dogs and the Alzheimer’s Society, to 
improve journeys for our passengers.
Prohibiting alcohol on evening trains 
First ScotRail worked in partnership with 
the Scottish Government to successfully 
introduce this bylaw which has led to a 
c.16% reduction in accidents at stations. Performance
43 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Reaching new customers 
Our partnership with PayNearMe and 
retailers including 7-Eleven allows 
Greyhound customers without debit 
or credit cards to book attractive fares 
online and pay by cash in store.
Putting our customers at the heart of everything we do
To grow our customer base and provide the transport solutions that 
keep people moving and communities prospering, we put our 
customers at the heart of our business. We constantly strive to deliver 
better services and find ways to improve the customer experience 
across our businesses. We undertake extensive research on 
customer satisfaction on topics ranging from affordability to 
accessibility. We use wide-ranging engagement methods including 
forums, one to one meetings, and surveys, and we use this feedback 
to help shape the business and our service offering. 
The safety of our customers remains of critical importance and we 
continue to work both independently and in partnership with the 
communities we serve to reduce the risk of injury to our passengers 
and pursue our zero injuries goal. 
Developments in 2012/13 have included:
First Student has launched a new website that builds on feedback 
from our customers. The new user tested design makes it easier for 
customers to find things they need such as data and service 
information. This new online presence helped to push First Student’s 
customer service score to 83.4% – a 6% improvement since 2010.
We launched an innovative new service called ‘Your Ideas’ on the 
First Capital Connect website, allowing concepts to be suggested 
and voted on by other passengers. In response to feedback on this 
site, we launched a free email and text service that warns rail 
passengers of issues with specific trains.
We are currently looking to extend the applicability of our Safer 
Journey card in UK Bus, which was originally introduced to allow 
older customers to discreetly communicate to the driver any 
additional help they might require. We have sought feedback on a 
card for passengers with disabilities from a range of organisations.
In 2012/13 we reduced passenger injuries by 11% and vehicle 
collisions by 2%. We continually seek ways to work with our 
customers to improve passenger safety with campaigns at various 
points during the year. All of our bus and train drivers are trained to 
the highest safety standards, including fatigue management.
Engaging with local communities
Transport is vital to the economic, social and environmental well-
being of our local communities. We have a role as a trusted advisor 
on community transport issues and in creating successful local 
partnerships. We want to play an active and positive role in the areas 
we serve and we work with local communities to support broader 
community initiatives. We also engage with charity partners in both 
the UK and USA.
Examples of our community engagement in 2012/13 include:
As part of an initiative led by Greener Journeys across the UK bus 
industry, Jobcentre Plus travel card holders were able to travel for  
free during the month of January 2013 on almost every local bus  
service across the country. More than 12,000 people benefited from  
the scheme. 
We are committed to supporting local schools to reduce the risk  
of bullying. First Student took part in a campaign, recognised by  
the White House, to encourage employees to take action where 
necessary and our rail teams worked with the charity Red Balloon  
to promote anti-bullying initiatives in the UK.
During the year our employees in the UK selected Macmillan Cancer 
Support as our new charity partner. £420,000 has been donated in 
cash and in kind since June 2012, including £300,000 of bus 
advertising space in support of Macmillan’s awareness-raising 
campaigns, and £10,000 raised in one day by our employees.
In North America, our chosen charity Children’s Miracle Network is 
dedicated to saving and improving the lives of young people by 
raising funds for children’s hospitals. During 2012/13 we raised 
$108,000. These charity partnerships are part of our community 
contributions (in cash and in kind) of more than £1.36m in 2012/13,  
as measured by London Benchmarking Group (LBG).
Community rail schemes 
First Great Western participates in six of the top 
ten performing Community Rail Partnerships 
across the country. Our partnerships in Devon 
and Cornwall saw two million passengers for the 
first time during the year and were selected by 
the DfT to become mentors to others nationwide. 44 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Valuing and developing our people
Our transport services are crucial to the local areas in which we 
operate but we are also a major local business and employer in  
all of our communities. We believe that our strategy for recruiting, 
developing and engaging our 120,000 people is an important step 
towards our success. The combined energies, capability and 
commitment of our people can offer us significant competitive 
advantage. Our employees are the key to ensuring we provide 
consistently excellent standards of service and maintain high levels 
of customer satisfaction. 
Our new vision and values were introduced during the previous 
year to provide our people with greater clarity and support 
consistent behaviours.
In order to support the achievement of our new vision and the 
consistent application of our values in everything we do, our priorities 
broadly fall into three main areas:
■ ■
Recruitment and retention
■ ■
Development and performance management
■ ■
Employee engagement
Recruitment and retention
We aspire to be the employer of choice in our industry and we hire, train 
and develop more employees than any other company in the sector. 
We want to continue to attract and retain the best people that the 
transport industry has to offer. We employ experienced, professional 
and dedicated people to deliver a safe journey for our passengers with 
a high standard of customer service. 
We recognise that the opportunity to build diversity and inclusion in our 
teams will allow us to develop our workforce to be more representative 
of the communities we serve and to access a wider skills pool. Our 
strategy for recruitment and development supports this aim and 
ensures that we have the right mix of capability and experience to 
deliver and drive business performance. 
We recognise that, in common with much of the transport sector, we 
still need to work harder to improve the balance and diversity of our 
workforce but we are pleased to be making progress towards this 
goal. In particular, we recognise the under-representation of women in 
our UK operations and we are focused on increasing the percentage 
of women in senior roles, which is currently 17%, through a number of 
development opportunities. 
We are committed to ensuring that our working practices and  
policies ensure our employees or potential employees do not suffer 
discrimination, harassment or bullying and have the opportunity  
to report such matters in a confidential and safe manner.
As well as career and skills development opportunities, reward is 
an important part of our retention strategy. We offer our employees 
a comprehensive reward programme, which includes a valuable 
and wide-ranging benefits package, and we recognise our employees 
for their contribution to the success of the business through a range 
of award schemes at a local, regional and national level. We are 
committed to wide employee share ownership and employees 
continue to have the opportunity to participate in our Save As You Earn 
and Buy As You Earn schemes, details of which are set out in note 35 
to the financial statements. 
Development and performance management
Ensuring our employees have the right skills and training to do their 
jobs is essential to our performance and to employee retention. 
Ongoing development needs are established as part of regular 
performance and capability development reviews, with manager and 
peer feedback used in conjunction with feedback from our customer 
surveys. Specific training for our customer facing employees has 
been introduced to help build engagement around key customer 
service, operational and safety matters.
Employee Director
Most of our UK operating companies have an Employee Director on their 
boards. This principle extends to the Board of FirstGroup plc where an 
Employee Director is elected by their peers to represent employees across the 
Group. Mick Barker, a train driver for First Capital Connect, has held that 
position since January 2012 and is able to give an employee viewpoint on all 
matters affecting the direction and governance of the Group.
London 2012 Games 
Our employees were a crucial link in the positive spectator 
transport story at the London 2012 Games. The 
development of our people is an enduring legacy within the 
company. First Capital Connect’s dedicated 24/7 centre 
has been retained and transformed into a permanent 
feature of the company’s customer service. Performance
45 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Alongside role specific training, we also offer professional 
development opportunities for employees at all levels, including a 
variety of qualifications such as National Vocational Qualifications  
for all of our UK Bus drivers, as well as graduate schemes and 
apprenticeship programmes. In Greyhound, we have introduced a 
Supervisor Certification programme to provide managers with formal 
management skills development. 
Strong management teams with in depth knowledge and experience  
of transport and their local markets is a priority. We believe that this 
provides a good platform for growth in the future, and the focus on 
development among these teams is already having an impact in our 
transformation programmes, particularly in First Student and UK Bus.
Recognising the impact strong leadership can have on driving our 
strategy forwards, we are investing further in our most senior 
management teams with a series of programmes to enhance capability 
in areas proven to be critical for improved business performance. 
These areas will assist our leaders in creating strategic momentum, 
delivering sustainable performance, driving commercial growth and 
innovation and engaging and developing their own teams. To further 
nurture and harness the talent and expertise across our organisation, 
we have in place detailed and robust succession planning and our 
leadership teams from across the Group regularly meet to share best 
practice and ideas.
Employee engagement
With such a large employee base, continuing and enhancing employee 
engagement is key to improved performance and fundamental to our 
wider success. We are committed to achieving sustainable employee 
engagement by ensuring that FirstGroup is a great place to work and 
that our customers receive a high standard of service. We are focused 
on inspiring people through our vision and values and driving the 
cultural change necessary for the development of the Group, and the 
transformation programmes in First Student, Greyhound and UK Bus 
would not be possible without employee commitment and involvement.
We take an informed and consultative approach to employee 
communication across our business. As well as more traditional 
forms of communication, employees can also access online facilities 
and our redesigned internal employee portal is to be launched in 
summer 2013. In addition management teams work to ensure that 
face to face communication is cascaded throughout their business 
areas. Employees are encouraged to discuss any issues with 
management at any time and events, such as an executive roadshow 
series in Greyhound, have been arranged at regular intervals to allow 
employees the chance to feed back to senior management.
A significant proportion of our workforce belongs to trade unions, with 
our employees represented by approximately 30 different unions. The 
majority of our employees in North America, approximately 80% of 
our UK Bus employees, and a significant proportion of our UK Rail 
employees are represented by unions.
We have a regular dialogue with employees and representatives from 
trade unions. Each division has its own information and consultation 
arrangements and levels of employee involvement in the business differ. 
In the UK, we have worked with trade unions on a number of key 
workplace matters and initiatives including the restructuring of Group 
pension schemes. 
As well as gathering feedback throughout the year through formal and 
informal channels, all employees are also given the opportunity to make 
their voice heard through our regular employee surveys. These surveys 
at Group, divisional and local level provide a useful insight into what our 
people think about the company. The priorities identified by our own 
people help to shape our future employee strategy. 
Summary
We believe that our commitment to CR supports improved business 
performance. Motivated employees, delivering sustainable operations 
focused on customer service and provided in partnership with our 
communities, are all key to our continued success and future growth.

Graduate scheme success
Our graduate scheme attracted more than 1,000 applicants for 
15 places this year and was rated in the top 300 in the UK by 
the Guardian. First ScotRail’s modern apprenticeship scheme in 
customer service, the first in the industry, is developing 
employability skills in young people and has been recognised by 
the Scottish Government as a valuable opportunity. 
First Transit employee feedback
1,800 employees took part in a survey which examined current 
perceptions of the First Transit brand and how it distinguishes itself, 
and a further survey has been conducted to determine preferred 
forms of communication. The information provided in these surveys 
will have an important influence on the future development and 
communication of the brand.  46 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Risks and uncertainties
There are a number of key potential risks 
and uncertainties that without effective 
management could have an adverse 
impact on the Group’s performance. 
Our risk management approach
We have a risk management methodology which we use throughout 
the business to allow us to identify and manage the risks that are likely 
to have an impact on the financial or operational performance of the 
Group, or which could impede achievement of its strategic objectives 
or adversely impact its reputation or stakeholder expectations, ensuring 
that we operate safely, develop and protect our people, assets, 
customers and reputation.

Each division has a designated Risk Champion who maintains a

The Risk Champions and other members of senior management form 
the Risk Group, which meets at least on a quarterly basis and 
oversees the Group’s risk management activities and reviews and 
maintains the Group Risk Register.
Our principal risks and uncertainties
Many risks inherent in a transport company such as ours will always 
exist. The challenge is to manage them effectively. Our principal risks, 
which are detailed overleaf, relate to passenger safety and security, 
our main cost drivers and the governmental, regulatory and economic 
environments.
These risks have been assessed taking into account materiality, the 
likelihood of occurrence and any change to this during the year, and 
the residual risk after the implementation of controls.
The risks listed do not comprise all those highlighted by our risk 
management processes or those that may otherwise affect the Group 
nor are those that are listed set out in any order of priority. Additional 
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently 
believe to be less material, may also impact our business.
Further information on our risk management controls is contained in 
the  corporate governance section on pages 60 and 61. Performance

Risk Potential impact Mitigation Movement
Economic and political conditions
Economic conditions, political 
developments and changes in 
government policy affecting the 
markets in which the Group operates, 
whether at a global, regional or 
national level could have a negative 
impact on the Group’s businesses 
and its ability to grow existing 
businesses, retain, or win  
new contracts.
Failure, or increased instability,  
of key suppliers.
Reduced demand for public 
transportation, reduced funding for 
and spending by local and national 
governments and other customers 
on public or student transport and/or 
changes to market structure or 
dynamics or inability to pass on  
fully to customers the impact of 
increased costs.
Supplier failure, or non-performance, 
resulting in supply chain disruption.
Many areas of the Group’s business offer a 
certain degree of protection against 
economic downturn in specific geographic 
markets, and certain current rail franchises 
have revenue support and profit sharing 
arrangements in place. To an extent, our UK 
Bus operating companies are able to modify 
services in reaction to economic and 
political impacts and our Greyhound 
operations have greater flexibility, particularly 
in the United States.
Continuous monitoring of key suppliers’ 
financial health and identification of 
alternatives to ensure Group supply  
chain resilience.
Pensions
The Group has significant defined 
benefit obligations many of which are 
in deficit. Both assets and liabilities 
can vary considerably in the short 
term when compared to their long 
term assumptions.
Material changes in the accounting 
cost and cash funding requirements 
in subsequent years as a result of the 
underlying investments and liabilities 
not moving in line with long term 
assumptions.
Through diversification of investments, 
hedging of liabilities, amendment of the 
defined benefit promises and the 
introduction of defined contribution for new 
starts in UK Bus and Group, the Group 
seeks to mitigate these risks. However, 
it is not possible to completely negate them.
Under the franchise arrangements the UK 
Rail Train Operating Companies are not 
responsible for any residual deficit at the end 
of a franchise so there is only short term 
cash flow risk within this business.
Terrorism, man-made and natural disasters
The threat from terrorism is enduring 
and continues to exist in the countries 
in which we operate. Public transport 
has previously been subject to attack 
and it remains important that we take 
all reasonable steps to help guard 
against such activity on any of the 
services we operate. 
In addition the risk of other man-made 
or natural disasters including material 
adverse weather conditions or an 
outbreak of contagious disease could 
have an impact on the services  
we provide.
Reduced public confidence in public 
transportation, and/or specifically in 
the Group’s security and safety 
record.
Reduced profits resulting from 
reduced demand for our services, 
increased costs or security 
requirements, business disruption 
and/or, in the case of poor weather, 
increased accidents.
We continue to develop and apply good 
practice and train our employees so that 
they can identify and respond effectively 
to any potential threat or incident.  48 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Risks and uncertainties

Risk Potential impact Mitigation Movement
Competitive pressures
All of the Group’s businesses compete 
in the areas of pricing and service  
and face competition from a number  
of sources.
In the UK, the main competitor remains 
the car and to a lesser extent long 
distance coach and budget airlines. 
The UK Bus market is deregulated with 
low public subsidy and is very 
competitive with over 1,200 operators 
running local bus services. 
As mentioned on page 49,  
competition for UK Rail franchises is 
also very strong from a number of 
other large public and state-owned 
entities active in the market. 
In North America, the Group’s 
businesses cover a wide geographic 
area competing with several large 
companies as well as a substantial 
number of smaller, locally owned 
operators. Our competitors in the 
school bus business also include 
school districts which themselves 
operate approximately two thirds of 
school buses in North America.
Similarly, there are a significant number 
of transit and service businesses 
operated by private entities, including 
several large companies and  
public authorities.
Our Greyhound coach operations face 
competition from a number of other 
coach operators in North America as 
well as from budget airlines.
Reduced passenger numbers  
and revenues.
To continue to help mitigate the risks posed 
by these pressures, the Group continues to 
focus on service quality and performance as 
priorities in making our services attractive to 
passengers and other customers. In its 
contracted operations, contract compliance 
and a competitive bidding strategy and 
strong bidding team are key. In addition, 
wherever possible, the Group works with 
local and national bodies to promote 
measures aimed at increasing demand  
for public transport and the other services 
that we offer. 
Information technology
The Group relies on information 
technology in all aspects of its 
business. Any significant disruption or 
failure, caused by external factors, 
denial of service, computer viruses or 
human error, could result in a service 
interruption, accident or 
misappropriation of confidential 
information (including credit card 
data). Process failure, security breach 
or other operational difficulties may 
also lead to revenue loss. 
Loss of revenue and increased 
operating costs due to increased 
capital, security or insurance 
requirements.
As a result of the continuing threat of 
cyber-attacks, the Group has increased its 
dedicated IT security resource, which in 
conjunction with policy and procedures and 
extensive security controls is designed to 
enhance the resilience and security of the 
Group’s information technology systems and 
the data they contain. Performance

Rail re-franchising
Whilst the UK DfT has announced its 
intention to extend a number of the 
Group’s rail franchises, the terms of 
those extensions have yet to be agreed 
and even taking into account the 
announced extensions, all of the 
Group’s franchises will expire between 
2014 and 2016. The timetable for 
re-franchising of the Group’s and other 
UK rail franchises has recently been 
announced. Although the terms of the 
new franchises are not yet clear, the 
competition for new rail franchises is 
expected to be intense. We bid against 
operators of current UK rail franchises 
and rail operators from other countries, 
principally from within the  
European Union. 
Lower UK Rail division contribution 
and profitability.
The Group has an experienced and 
dedicated rail bid team, which will continue 
to compete for franchises as they are re-let.
Contracted businesses
The Group is required to comply with 
certain conditions as part of its UK rail 
franchise agreements. 
The Group’s First Student and First 
Transit businesses are contracted 
businesses dependent on the ability 
to renew and secure new contract 
wins on profitable terms. 
Potential termination of relevant rail 
franchise agreement and possibly 
others if cross-default invoked 
resulting in loss of revenue and cash 
flow as well as some or all of the 
amounts set aside as security for 
performance bonds and season 
ticket bonds.
Loss of business, or failure to renew, 
leading to reduced revenue  
and profitability. 
Incorrect bid assumptions leading to 
greater than anticipated costs or losses.
Compliance with franchise conditions is 
closely managed and monitored on a 
monthly basis by senior management and 
procedures are in place to minimise the risk 
of non-compliance.
The relevant divisions have experienced and 
dedicated bid teams which undertake 
careful economic modelling of contract bids 
and, where possible, seek to negotiate risk 
sharing arrangements with the relevant 
customer or contracting authority.
Legislation and regulation
Our businesses are subject to 
numerous laws and regulations 
covering a wide range of matters 
including health and safety, 
equipment, employment (including 
working time, wage and hour and 
legislation covering mandatory 
breaks), competition and anti-trust, 
environmental, insurance coverage 
and other operating issues. These 
laws and regulations are constantly 
subject to change. 
Increased costs of compliance with 
existing or changes in regulation  
or legislation.
Reduction in operational flexibility  
or efficiency. 
Financial and reputational impact 
of failure to comply.
Negative impact on ability to bid for 
future business.
The Group has embedded operating 
policies and procedures in all our 
businesses to ensure compliance with 
existing legislation and regulation.
We have dedicated legal teams in the UK 
and North America who oversee the 
Group’s compliance and training 
programmes and advise on  
emerging issues.
The Group closely monitors the impact of 
changes in the regulatory and legal 
environment and actively engages with 
Government and transport bodies to help 
ensure that we are properly positioned to 
respond to any proposed changes. 50 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Risks and uncertainties 
continued
Risk Potential impact Mitigation Movement
Customer service 
The Group’s revenues are at risk if it 
does not continue to provide the level 
of service expected by customers.
Contracts not renewed; revenue 
levels reduced; negative impact on 
brand image.
Relevant staff undertake intensive training 
programmes to ensure they are aware of 
and abide by the levels of service that are 
required by our customers in each business.
On going engagement with customers and 
community stakeholders takes place across 
the Group, including through ‘Meet the 
manager’ events, customer panels, 
consultations and local partnerships. 
The Board also monitors, in detail, a series 
of customer service KPIs to ensure strict 
targets are being met.
Litigation and claims
The Group has three main insurable 
risks: third party claims arising from 
vehicle and general operations, 
employee injuries and  
property damage. 
The Group is also subject to other 
litigation, particularly in North America, 
which is not insured including 
contractual claims and those relating 
to employee wage and hour matters.
Increased costs; reduced availability 
of insurance cover; reputational 
impact. 
A large single claim or a large 
number of smaller claims may affect 
profitability and cash flow.
The Group has a very strong focus on safety 
– it is one of our values. The size of the 
Group’s operations is such that there is a 
high frequency of low value injury and 
property damage claims which the Group 
self-insures up to certain limits. It purchases 
insurance above these limits from reputable 
global insurance firms. Claims are managed 
by experienced claims handlers. 
Non-insured claims are managed by the 
Group’s dedicated in-house legal team, 
with external assistance as appropriate.
Treasury risks 
As set out in further detail in note 25 
to the financial statements on  
pages 106 to 111, treasury risks 
include liquidity risks and risks arising 
from changes to foreign exchange 
rates, and interest rates. 
Foreign currency and interest rate 
movements impact profit, balance 
sheet and cash flows of the Group. 
Ineffective hedging arrangements 
may not fully mitigate losses or may 
increase them.
The Group’s Treasury Policy and delegated 
authorities are reviewed periodically to 
ensure compliance with best practice and to 
control and monitor these risks effectively.
Labour cost and employee relations
Labour costs represent the largest 
component of the Group’s operating 
costs. Future labour shortages or 
decreasing unemployment rates 
could hinder the Group’s ability to 
recruit and retain qualified employees. 
In addition, it is important for a labour 
intensive Group that good employee 
relations are maintained. 
Higher than expected increase in the 
cost of recruitment, training and other 
staff costs; operational disruption 
and reduced cash flow and 
profitability.
The Group seeks to mitigate these risks by 
its recruitment and retention policies, training 
schemes and working practices including 
building communication and engagement 
with the trade unions and the  
wider workforce.
Examples of this engagement include regular 
leadership conferences, employee satisfaction 
pulse surveys, and the presence of Employee 
Directors (Directors voted for by the employees 
to represent them) on many of the Group’s UK 
divisional boards, and the FirstGroup Board. Performance

Risk Potential impact Mitigation Movement
Fuel costs 
Fuel is a significant component of the 
Group’s operating costs. Fuel prices 
and supply levels can be influenced 
significantly by international, political 
and economic circumstances. 
High prices, increased volatility of fuel 
prices or supply restrictions, 
shortages or interruptions could 
adversely impact the Group’s 
operations, cash flow and profitability. 
The Group may be unable to  
pass increased costs on fully  
to customers.
Ineffective hedging arrangements 
may not fully mitigate losses or may 
increase them.
To mitigate the risk of volatile fuel costs the 
Group regularly enters into forward hedging 
contracts providing fixed prices. In addition, 
the Group may limit the impact of 
unexpected fuel price rises through 
efficiency and pricing measures.
Retention of key management 
Attracting and keeping key members 
of senior management is vital in 
ensuring that the Group continues to 
have the necessary expertise and 
continuity to execute its strategy.  
In order that management have 
diverse and challenging careers  
they are given autonomy, within 
parameters set by the Board, to  
run their businesses. 
Inability to execute Group strategy 
resulting in reduced profitability.
The Group has a robust succession 
planning process designed to identify 
talented individuals, set development goals 
for progression to other roles and to assess 
the depth of talent and any gaps throughout 
the leadership of FirstGroup. The Group also 
offers market based compensation 
packages consisting of an appropriate mix 
of long and short term incentives.
Environmental
The Group’s operations store and 
manage large quantities of fuel at our 
maintenance sites, which presents a 
potential regulatory and financial risk 
in the event of significant loss or 
spillage and are subject to ongoing 
changes in environmental regulations.
Along with all businesses we face the 
challenge of addressing climate 
change, both managing its impact 
and reducing emissions. 
Environmental, reputational or 
financial loss resulting from 
remediation of incidents, 
prosecutions and/or penalties.
To mitigate these risks, the Group’s storage 
facilities are subject to regular inspection 
and we have detailed fuel handling 
procedures which are regularly audited. 
Robust environmental policies, strategies 
and management systems are maintained 
across the Group.
The Group continues to target reductions in 
its emissions, including through behaviour 
change initiatives and investment in  
new technology. 52 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Corporate governance
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate 
Governance Report for 2012/13. The external headwinds we have 
faced this year have been considerable. These issues, together with 
the cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise and the capital 
reorganisation that was announced in May 2013 have meant that the 
Board has had to meet more frequently than it was scheduled, 
sometimes at very short notice. At these times it is more important 
than ever that the Group maintains its commitment to the highest 
standards of corporate governance in respect of leadership, 
effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relations with 
shareholders as identified by the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
In this section of the report we provide details of our governance 
structures and processes together with the actions we are taking  
to enhance governance within the Group.
As previously announced, I have decided to step down as Chairman 
after 27 years with the Group following the appointment of my 
successor. Good governance is vital and the Board is mindful of the 
need to ensure that my successor has the experience and integrity 
necessary to ensure that the Group continues to apply the highest 
standards going forward.
Board composition
In my last report I mentioned the impending appointment of Chris 
Surch as Group Finance Director. He joined us on 1 September 2012 
and his strong financial leadership, considerable operational, 
strategic and international knowledge and experience of significant 
business improvement programmes have already made an impact 
on the running of the Group. I was also delighted to welcome Brian 
Wallace and Jim Winestock as Non-Executive Directors who joined 
our Board on 1 August 2012. Both Brian and Jim have already 
brought their individual expertise in finance and operations in large 
and complex organisations to the Board and have made significant 
contributions to the running of the Group. 
Board evaluation
In addition I am pleased to report that Independent Board Evaluation 
(IBE) carried out a detailed and comprehensive review of the Board’s 
performance, practices and procedures. They observed the Board 
and Committees in action during October 2012. All the Directors and 
key personnel were subsequently interviewed by the team at IBE, 
who thereafter compiled a full report which was presented to the 
Board in December 2012. The report indicated that the FirstGroup 
Board is changing both in composition and culture and is becoming 
more effective whilst adopting a more challenging and professional 
ethos. The arrival of new members has provided an opportunity to 
reset the culture which in turn will help the Board steer the Group 
through the period ahead. It will continue to ensure that we have 
the right mix of capability and experience to deliver and drive the 
business going forward.
Remuneration
We appointed a new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee last 
year and, as highlighted later in this report, I am confident that under 
his leadership the Remuneration Committee will ensure that the 
challenging targets set for the business going forward are properly 
reflected in the remuneration of our management team. 
No salary increase will be paid to the Executive Directors and no fee 
increase will be paid to the Non-Executive Directors for the financial 
year commencing 1 April 2013.
Group Employee Director
Our Group Employee Director has been in office now for 16 months. 
Mick has proved a most effective and invaluable presence on the 
Board and assists us in keeping in touch with issues affecting  
our employees.
Corporate Governance Code
The new Corporate Governance Code was adopted in September 
2012. Whilst this does not apply to us until the 2013/14 reporting year 
we will continue working to ensure that we will be fully compliant to 
the benefit of the Group and all our shareholders.
Martin Gilbert
Chairman Governance
55 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Company complies with all the main and supporting principles  
of good governance set out in section 1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in  
June 2010 (the ‘Code’). 
The Board
Structure and responsibilities 
The Board currently consists of the Chairman, two Executive Directors 
and six Non-Executive Directors. Nick Chevis, who was not a member 
of the Board, attended all meetings as Acting Finance Director from 
April to September 2012 at which time Chris Surch was appointed  
as Group Finance Director. During the year, the Board met 16 times 
(eight in the UK, two in the US and six by telephone conference call). 
All members attended whilst they were Directors with the exception 
of Jim Winestock and David Begg who were each absent from two 
meetings and Mick Barker and Chris Surch who were each absent 
from one meeting. 
During the year the Board set and reviewed the Company’s objectives 
and strategy, reviewed the financial and operational performance of 
each of the Group’s business units, agreed and reviewed progress 
against the Group’s annual budgets and set and reviewed on a regular 
basis its longer term business plans. In line with the matters specifically 
reserved to it, it also approved the half year and full year financial 
statements, financing arrangements, material capital commitments, 
relationships with regulatory authorities and the Group’s operating  
and accounting policies. 
The Board also discussed and reviewed the strategic disposal of 
non-core business assets, the issuance of a £325m 5.25% Bond, our 
new vision and values programme, succession planning and talent 
management, bids for the InterCity West Coast (ICWC) and Essex 
Thameside rail franchises and the subsequent cancellation of the 
ICWC competition and pause in all franchise bids and the capital 
structure of the Group. 
On 1 August 2012 Brian Wallace and Jim Winestock were appointed 
to the Board as Non-Executive Directors.
On 1 September 2012 Chris Surch was appointed to the Board as 
Group Finance Director. 
Balance and independence 
In considering Director independence the Board has taken into 
account the guidance provided by the Code. The Board, having given 
thorough consideration to the matter, considers that David Begg, 
Colin Hood, Brian Wallace and Jim Winestock are independent. 
Whilst John Sievwright, our Senior Independent Director, has served 
on the Board for over nine years, the Board has reviewed his record 
and contribution. He displays a breadth of experience, particularly in 
financial markets, and the Board firmly considers him to remain 
independent within the definition of the Code. Mick Barker is an 
employee of one of the Group’s subsidiaries and therefore cannot 
be considered to be truly independent under the Code. However, 
the Board considers that it is beneficial for its employees to be 
represented on the Board in this way as it enables important 
employee related issues to be raised at the highest level and allows 
for two way communication between the Board and employees.
Therefore, the Company complies with the Code provision that at 
least one half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, is made up 
of Non-Executive Directors who are considered by the Board to be 
independent. The Directors are satisfied that the Board possesses 
the breadth of business, financial and international experience 
necessary to manage an organisation of the size and complexity 
of the Group effectively. 
Relations with shareholders
The Group recognises the importance of regular communication 
with its shareholders. The Annual Report and Accounts and a half 
yearly report are made available to all shareholders. These reports 
are intended to provide a clear and balanced understanding of the 
Group’s operational performance, its financial results and prospects.
Investors are kept informed of key business activities, decisions, 
appointments, etc. via regulatory news and press releases and 
the Group’s website. There is also regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders throughout the year and general presentations are 
made by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director following 
the announcement of the half year and full year results. Other 
Directors, including Non-Executive Directors, attend meetings 
with major shareholders as requested, and have done so in 
relation to a number of issues during the year. 
Regular reports on investor relations activity and feedback from 
investors are submitted to the Board and senior management.

Role of the Chairman
The Chairman of the Board is currently Martin Gilbert although, as 
previously announced, he has indicated his intention to step down 
once a successor has been appointed. The Chairman has a written 
statement of responsibilities which has been approved by the Board. 
He is responsible for: 
The Board is of the opinion, reinforced by the performance evaluation 
review referred to below, that Martin Gilbert’s significant and in depth 
knowledge and experience of the Group’s business, combined with 
his external diverse business experience, will continue to enable him 
to provide effective leadership of the Board until the appointment of 
his successor and that he will continue to make a positive contribution 
to the Group’s ongoing business.
The Chairman’s other significant business commitments are 
described in his biography on page 52. The Board performance 
evaluation process referred to in the Chairman’s letter and on page 57 
confirmed that the other Board members are satisfied that until the 
appointment of his successor, Martin Gilbert will continue to have the 
necessary time available to devote to the proper performance of his 
duties as Chairman and will remain an effective leader of the Board,

direct access to senior management should they wish to receive 
additional information on any of the items for discussion. The head  
of each operating division attends Board meetings on a regular basis 
to ensure that the Board is properly informed about the performance 
of that division and the issues it currently faces. All Directors have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary

57 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
During the year Chris Surch, Group Finance Director, and Jim 
Winestock and Brian Wallace, Non-Executive Directors received  
a comprehensive induction to their new roles. They had meetings  
with the Company Secretary, management from all divisions  
of the business and external advisors and were provided with  
all documentation necessary to ensure that they had a firm 
understanding of the Company’s operations and key risks and  
issues facing the Group. They also went on site visits to some of  
the Group’s locations both in the UK and North America. In addition, 
information and guidance was provided on their responsibilities and 
obligations under law, regulation and best practice guidelines. 
The whole Board also receives updates, as required, on changes 
to the legal and regulatory regimes affecting the Group and the 
development process is supported throughout the year by a 
programme of business presentations as described above.
Performance evaluation
As mentioned in the Chairman’s letter, the Board undertook an 
external evaluation of its performance during the course of the year 
carried out by Independent Board Evaluation, who have no 
connection with the Group. The evaluation team drew up a detailed 
agenda for Board interviews and observed the Board and its 
Committees in action at their October meetings. Thereafter all Board 
members and key individuals participated in detailed interviews with 
the evaluation team. In addition, each of the Directors was individually 
assessed and this report was provided to the Chairman. An 
assessment of the Chairman’s performance was provided to the 
Senior Independent Director. A full report was provided to the 
Chairman and was laid before and discussed at the December 2012 
meeting. The report indicated that the FirstGroup Board is changing 
both in composition and culture and is becoming more effective, 
adopting a more challenging and professional ethos. The arrival of 
new members has provided an opportunity to reset the culture which 
in turn will help the Board steer the Group through the period ahead. 
No significant issues were identified in the course of the evaluation 
process. This review will benefit the Board and serve as a benchmark 
against which to measure the rate of change going forward. In 
addition management have employed Board Intelligence, who have 
no connection with the Group, to review and improve the way that 
information is presented to the Board to assist it in performing more 
effectively going forward. 
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Code, all the Directors are offering themselves 
for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
Wednesday 17 July 2013. The Chairman has announced his intention 
to retire from the Board as soon as a successor has been appointed.
Following a rigorous performance evaluation of each Director and  
the Board as a whole, all Directors are considered by the Board to  
be fully effective.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board for an initial term 
of three years, subject to re-appointment by shareholders. They have 
letters of appointment which are available on request for inspection.
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance
The Company maintained Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance 
cover throughout the year as permitted by the Companies Act 2006. 
The cover was renewed on 1 April 2013.
Committees of the Board
The Board has established Nomination, Remuneration and 
Audit Committees with specific delegated powers, duties and 
responsibilities. The Chairmen and members of these committees 
are appointed by the Board on the recommendation (where 
appropriate) of the Nomination Committee and in consultation 
with each relevant Committee Chairman. 
A fourth Committee, the Board Safety Committee was established to 
take effect from 1 April 2013 and will be reported on fully in next year’s 
Annual Report. 
The Board Safety Committee will, among other things, provide 
oversight of the Group’s operational safety risk profile as presented  
by the Group Safety Director and further promote a positive  
safety culture. The terms of reference of the Committee were adopted 
on 13 May 2013. They are available on request and are also published 
on the Company’s website.

Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee is currently chaired by Martin Gilbert. The 
other members of the Committee are David Begg, Colin Hood and 
John Sievwright. Tim O’Toole attends meetings of the Committee at 
the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee. The Group Employee 
Director also attends meetings at the invitation of the Chairman of the 
Committee to represent the Group’s employees. 
The Committee met four times during the year and all members 
attended each meeting held whilst they were Directors. The primary 
role of the Nomination Committee is to lead the process for Board 
appointments and make recommendations to the Board. The 
Committee meets as required to consider appointments of both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors to the Board. Its 
recommendations are then put to the Board for approval.
The responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:
■ ■
reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board (including 
the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity (including 
gender)) and ensuring that all members of the Board have devoted 
sufficient time to their duties
■ ■
identifying and nominating for approval by the Board candidates  
to fill vacancies as and when they arise, including utilising  
search consultants
■ ■
overseeing the succession planning process for the Board and

Committee. The Committee was assisted in its search for UK based 
Executives by JCA Group and by Spencer Stuart for its US based 
Director. The Committee will lead the search for the Chairman’s 
successor and appoint an external search agency to assist in its 
deliberations.
The Employee Director is elected by the Employee Directors’ forum, 
which comprises the Employee Directors of the Company’s UK 
subsidiaries, and serves a maximum of three, three-year terms.
The Company’s policy is to permit Executive Directors to accept a 
limited number of outside non-executive directorships, recognising 
that this is an effective way to broaden their knowledge and expertise. 
However, no such appointment can be taken up without prior Board 
approval. The Company’s policy on fees relating to such outside 
directorships is set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on  
page 68.
The Board is mindful that following the departure of Audrey Baxter in 
December 2011 it no longer has any female members. The Board is 
supportive of the Financial Reporting Council’s aim to encourage 
diversity in the boardroom and of the recommendations contained in 
the report of Lord Davies of Abersoch aimed at raising the proportion 
of women on UK boards. The Board will work towards an aspiration 
of 20% of board positions filled by women by 2015, subject to the 
availability of candidates with the right skills and experience. The 
Board remains of the opinion that Board appointments should be 
made relative to a number of different criteria, including diversity of 
gender, background and personal attributes, alongside the appropriate 
skill set, experience and expertise.
The terms of reference of the Committee were updated and adopted 
in March 2013 and are available on request and are also published on 
the Company’s website. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by John Sievwright and includes 
David Begg and Colin Hood. Brian Wallace was appointed to the 
Audit Committee in January 2013. It met four times during the year 
and all members of the Committee attended each meeting whilst they 
were members. The Group Director of Internal Audit and the 
Company’s external auditors attended all of these meetings. 
Executive Directors and other senior managers attended when 
requested and as appropriate. The Group Director of Internal Audit 
has the right of direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Board considers that each member of the Committee has 
sufficient and recent financial experience to enable the Committee to 
discharge its functions effectively.
The key role of the Audit Committee is to provide oversight and 
reassurance to the Board as to the integrity and effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk and financial reporting and internal control systems and 
to monitor and review the activities and performance of the internal 
and external auditors. It also monitors the consistent application of 
accounting policies by the Group, reviews the Group’s half and full 
year statements before they are considered and approved by the 
Board, reviews the Group Risk Register and monitors compliance 
with the Code and related guidance. 
The key judgments assessed during the year included the First Great 
Western contract provision; the Diego Garcia contract provision; 
Goodwill impairment reviews; UK Rail bid costs; DSBFirst investment 
carrying value; UK Bus sales and closures; Dagenham Depot asset 
impairments and onerous contract review; First Transit’s First Support 
Services disposal; Loss making contracts review; pensions, legal  
and environmental provisions; self insurance reserves and contract 
intangible amortisation.  Governance
59 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
In addition, each year, the Committee and the Board approves an 
annual audit plan for the internal audit department focusing on areas 
of priority as identified by risk analysis and progress against that plan. 
The outcome of the Internal Auditors’ work is monitored, reports are 
sent to senior executives of the Group and subsidiary units, and there 
is a follow up process to ensure that actions to resolve any identified 
control weaknesses are implemented. 
The Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to 
the Board in respect of the appointment or re-appointment of the 
Group’s external auditors and recommends to the Board the audit fee 
to be paid to the external auditors. The Board’s decision on these 
matters is subject to the approval of shareholders. The independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the external auditors have been 
examined by the Committee and discussions were held regarding 
their terms of engagement, remuneration and proposal for partner 
rotation. The appointment of the Senior Statutory Auditor (SSA) is 
rotated every five years. The current SSA was appointed during the 
2010/11 financial year. Deloitte LLP was originally appointed as 
external auditor in 1999.
The majority of non-audit work is put out to tender, with the exception 
of regulatory reporting work and due diligence work on acquisitions or 
potential acquisitions and disposals in both the UK and overseas, 
where the current auditors’ knowledge of the Company’s business 
processes and controls means that they are usually best placed to 
undertake this work cost-effectively on the Company’s behalf. Details 
of the audit and non-audit fees, including a breakdown of the 
non-audit fees, are set out in note 6 to the financial statements. The 
Committee concluded that the nature and extent of the non-audit 
fees did not compromise audit independence.
The Committee reviews with management a detailed analysis of the 
Group’s financial information prior to completion and announcement 
of the half year and full year results and receives a report from the 
external auditors on the audit process. If necessary, the external 
auditors also meet separately with the Committee and/or the 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The Annual 
Report and Accounts and half yearly Financial Report are subject  
to a detailed verification process involving external advisers.
The Committee may request the Executive Directors and any other 
officers of the Group to attend its meetings but none has the right of 
attendance. Committee meetings may be requested by the external 
or internal auditors if they consider it necessary.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee were updated and adopted 
in March 2013 and are available on request. They are also published 
on the Company’s website.

Remuneration Committee
The key role of the Remuneration Committee is to set the 
remuneration of the Group’s Executive Directors and the Chairman 
and to monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior 
management. It met eight times during the year and all members  
of the Committee attended each meeting held whilst they were 
members. Details of the membership of the Committee are set out  
in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 63 to 71, together  
with a statement of the Group’s remuneration strategy and policy.  
Full details of Directors’ remuneration appear in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on page 68. 
The Board has also formally delegated certain matters to:
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee comprises the Executive Directors and 
meets on an ad hoc basis to consider matters which arise in the 
ordinary course of the Group’s operations. It is chaired by the Chief 
Executive and has specific delegated powers within prescribed limits 
to deal with matters arising in the ordinary course of business which 
need to be considered before the next scheduled Board meeting.
Board Safety Committee
The Board Safety Committee comprises Colin Hood (chairman),  
Jim Winestock, Tim O’Toole and Naveed Qamar (the Group Safety 
Director) and reviews safety performance, provides oversight of the 
management of the Group’s operational safety risk profile and 
promotes a positive safety culture.
The following groups and committees also meet on a regular basis to 
review ongoing matters and make recommendations to the Board or 
one of the formally constituted committees referred to above:
Executive Management Board (EMB)
The EMB, which comprises the Executive Directors and certain senior 
management, is chaired by the Chief Executive. It acts as a general 
operating management committee and meets on a monthly basis to 
review current issues and to consider the Group’s operational and 
financial performance. 
Executive Safety Committee (ESC)
The ESC is chaired by the Chief Executive and meets on a monthly 
basis. It comprises the Divisional Heads of each of the businesses, 
other Group Directors and the Group Safety Director. The ESC 
reviews the Group’s safety performance and practices and approves 
Group safety policies and procedures. During the year a number of 
meetings were attended by independent safety experts and senior 
representatives of relevant industry bodies, including the Office of Rail 
Regulation (ORR), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Rail 
Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), Network Rail and the Rail 
Safety and Standards Board (RSSB). Since 1 April 2013 a Board 
Safety Committee chaired by Colin Hood, has provided oversight of 
the Group’s operational safety risk profile as presented by the Group 
Safety Director with the aim of further promoting a positive safety 
culture. A full report on its activities will be included in next year’s 
Annual Report.
Risk Group
Each Division has a designated Risk Champion who is responsible for 
maintaining a risk register for that Division. These risk registers are 
used to compile a Group Risk Register, which is kept under review by 
the Risk Group, which is made up of members of the senior 
management team and the divisional Risk Champions. The Risk Group 
meets on at least a quarterly basis. Further details can be found 
under the Internal Controls section below.
Financial reporting
The Directors have a commitment to best practice in the Group’s 
external financial reporting in order to present a balanced and 
comprehensible assessment of the Group’s financial position and 
prospects to its shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and 
other third parties. This commitment encompasses all published 
information including, but not limited to, the year end and half yearly 
financial statements, regulatory news announcements and other 
public information. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities for 
preparing the financial statements can be found on page 75.
Internal controls
The Board has established procedures to provide an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks 
faced by the Group and to meet the requirements of the Code and its 
related guidance on internal controls. These procedures are subject 
to regular review.
Responsibility and risk
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems for 
internal control and assessing risk. The responsibility for establishing 
detailed control and risk management procedures within each 
subsidiary lies with the Executive Directors and divisional managing 
directors. A sound system of internal control is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a Risk Group, comprising senior 
management from all of the Group’s main businesses as well as from 
the finance, treasury, legal, insurance and internal audit functions 
which reviews the significant risks facing the Group. The Risk Group 
meets at least four times annually and reports to the Audit Committee 
which in turn reports to the Board with the express purpose of 
reviewing the risk and control procedures in each of the business 
areas and support functions. As an integral part of planning and 
review, management from each of the business areas and support 
functions identify the risks facing their operations, as well as the 
controls in place to mitigate those risks. The probability of risks 
occurring as well as the likely impact on the Group’s business, should 
the risks occur, are also assessed and documented. These risks are 
assessed on a regular basis, taking into account changes in both 
external and internal circumstances, which may include alterations to 
regulatory requirements, disruption to information systems, industrial 
relations issues, control breakdowns, as well as changes in the 
political and economic climate and social, ethical and environmental 
issues. As a result of the reports submitted to it by the Risk Group, 
the Audit  Governance
61 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Committee is able to keep under regular review the major risks and 
mitigating controls facing the Group. A table of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group is on pages 46 to 51.
Control environment
The Board is committed to business integrity, high ethical and moral 
values and professionalism in all its activities, principles with which all 
managers and employees are required to comply. The Group has a 
Code of Business Ethics, which is part of the Group’s Corporate 
Responsibility Policy. A copy is available on the Company’s website.
In addition, the Board has effective controls in place (including an 
anti-bribery policy) to address the requirements of relevant anti-
corruption legislation including the UK Bribery Act 2010 and the US 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 . Internal Audit maintains a Group 
Hospitality and Gifts Register which records all hospitality or gifts 
given or received by all Board and EMB members (including all 
hospitality or gifts offered but not accepted), the value of which 
exceeds a de minimis amount. Additional Hospitality and Gift 
Registers are also maintained at the divisional level. All senior 
management in the Group are required to disclose hospitality or gifts 
given or received as well as those that are offered but not accepted 
for entry into these registers.
The Group has a defined divisional organisational structure with lines 
of authority and delegated responsibility which allows the Board to 
plan, execute, control and monitor the business in a manner 
consistent with the Group’s objectives. The day-to-day business 
management is delegated to the Executive Directors and subsidiary 
unit managing directors under the overall direction of the Chief 
Executive. As noted above, the Board reserves to itself a number of 
specific items, which ensures that it retains control over key business 
decisions and significant transactions in terms of size, type or risk. A 
number of the Group’s key functions including treasury, taxation, 
insurance, corporate finance, legal, corporate communications and 
procurement are dealt with centrally. Each of these functions is 
monitored by an Executive Director.
Monitoring
The Group adopts a financial reporting and information system which 
complies with generally accepted accounting practice. The Group 
Finance Manual, circulated by the Group Finance function to all 
subsidiaries, details the Group’s accounting policies and procedures 
with which subsidiaries must comply. Budgets are prepared by 
subsidiary company management and are subject to review by both 
senior management and the Executive Directors followed by formal 
approval at the Board. Regular forecast updates are completed 
during the year and compared against actions required. Each 
subsidiary unit prepares a monthly report of operating performance 
with a commentary on variances against budget and prior year. 
Similar reports are prepared at a Group level. Key performance 
indicators, both financial and operational, are monitored on a weekly 
basis. In addition, business units participate in strategic reviews which 
include consideration of long term financial projections and the 
evaluation of business alternatives.
Throughout the year internal audit conduct a comprehensive 
programme of reviews of internal controls within the operating units. 
These reviews have sometimes highlighted minor control weaknesses 
which are discussed with management and remedial action plans are 
agreed. Where appropriate, follow up visits to the operating entity 
then confirm that the action plans have been completed and that the 
controls that have been put in place are working effectively. No 
material losses, contingencies or uncertainties that would require 
disclosure in the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts have resulted 
from this process.
Whistleblowing
The Group has well established procedures whereby employees may, 
in confidence, raise concerns relating to personal or employment 
issues, potential fraud, health and safety, harassment, discrimination, 
security or any other matter. The confidential hotline covers all 
businesses across the Group in each country in which it operates.
The Group is confident that these ‘whistleblowing’ arrangements are 
satisfactory and enable proportionate and independent investigation 
of such matters and appropriate follow up action to be taken.
Review of effectiveness of financial controls
The Directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls for the year under review and to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts through the monitoring 
process described above. In addition, the Directors confirm that they 
have kept under regular review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function.
Treasury operations
The Board has set a policy for management of the risks from treasury 
operations and this is set out in more detail in note 25 to the financial 
statements. A Group Treasury Policy has been formulated and 
adopted to ensure compliance with best practice and to control and 
monitor effectively the risks attendant upon treasury and  
banking operations.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations and exposures
The Group’s principal operations are in the UK, the US and Canada 
and are therefore subject to currency fluctuations, both in terms of its 
trading activities and the translation of its financial statements. The 
Group currently has a significant natural hedge arising from Dollar 
denominated earnings in the US businesses offset by Dollar 
denominated interest costs and fuel costs in its UK businesses. 62 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Significant agreements – change of control
(a) Financing agreements
The Group has a US$1,250m multi-currency revolving credit and 
guarantee facility between, amongst others, the Company and The 
Royal Bank of Scotland plc dated 9 December 2010. This financing 
agreement contains provisions entitling the lenders to exercise 
termination rights in the event of a change of control of the Company. 
Following any change of control of the Company, the majority of the 
lenders are obliged to negotiate with the Company with a view to 
resolving any concerns arising from such change of control and, if the 
matter has not been resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the 
majority of the lenders in that time, then, if the majority of the lenders 
so require, the agent must cancel the total commitments under the 
facility and require prepayment of all outstanding amounts. The 
Company’s bilateral financing agreements contain similar provisions 
such that, following a change of control of the Company, the banks 
are required to negotiate with the Company with a view to resolving 
any concerns arising from such change of control and, if the matter 
has not been resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the banks in 
that time, they may (if they so require) cancel the total commitments 
under the facilities and require prepayment of all outstanding amounts. 
The US$150m 4.26% notes due in three instalments of US$50m from 
2016 to 2017 , the £250m 6.125% bonds due 2019, the £300m 8.125% 
bonds due 2018, the £350m 8.750% bonds due 2021, the £200m 
6.875% bonds due 2024 and the £325m 5.250% bonds due 2022 
issued by the Company may also be affected by a change of control 
of the Company. A change of control in respect of the £250m 6.125% 
bonds due 2019 may result in an increase of 1.5% per annum in the 
interest rate payable on those bonds. However, the interest rate on 
the bonds will only be so increased if certain further thresholds in 
relation to the credit rating of the bonds are also met. In respect of the 
£300m 8.125% bonds due 2018, the £350m 8.750% bonds due 
2021, the £200m 6.875% bonds due 2024 and the £325m 5.250% 
bonds due 2022, upon a change of control of the Company, provided 
that certain further thresholds in relation to the credit rating of the 
bonds are met, the bondholders have the option to require the 
Company to redeem the bonds. In respect of the US$150m 4.26% 
notes due from 2016 to 2017 , upon a change of control, the Company 
must make an offer to noteholders to prepay the entire unpaid 
principal amount of the notes held by each bondholder (at par) 
together with interest accrued thereon but without any ‘yield-
maintenance’ amount.
(b) UK Rail
The Group’s franchised passenger rail operators, First Capital 
Connect, First ScotRail, First TransPennine Express and First Great 
Western, are each party to a franchise agreement with the Scottish 
Ministers (in respect of First ScotRail) and with the Secretary of State 
for Transport (in respect of the other operators). These franchise 
agreements are subject to termination clauses which may apply on a 
change of control. These operators and the Group’s non-franchised 
rail operator, First Hull Trains, each hold railway licences as required 
by the Railways Act 1993 (as amended); these licences may be 
revoked on three months’ notice if a change of control occurs without 
the approval of the Office of Rail Regulation. All of these operators 
also require and hold track access agreements with Network Rail 
Infrastructure Limited under which they are permitted to access 
railway infrastructure. Failure by any of the operators to maintain its 
railway licence is a potential termination event under the terms of the 
track access agreements. The Group’s railway operators also lease 
rolling stock from specialist rolling stock leasing companies such as 
Eversholt Rail Group, Porterbrook Leasing Company Limited and 
Angel Trains Limited. A material number of the individual leasing 
agreements include change of control provisions.
(c) Joint venture agreements
The Company has joint venture agreements with Keolis (UK) Limited 
in relation to First TransPennine Express and with DSB in relation to 
DSB/First Aps and DSB Sverige AB. As is customary, these joint 
venture agreements include provisions addressing change of control.
(d) London bus operations
The Group’s UK Bus business operates London bus routes under 
contract to London Bus Services Limited. These agreements include 
change of control provisions which are significant when all the routes 
are considered together. On 9 April 2013 contracts were exchanged 
for the disposal of the majority of the Group’s existing London bus 
operations, to the extent operated from depots at Alperton, 
Greenford, Lea Interchange, Hayes, Uxbridge, Westbourne Park and 
Willesden Junction. On completion of these disposals, the Group’s 
London bus operations will cease to amount to a significant interest.
Auditors
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as 
auditors and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions to the Directors 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, at which a report is made 
on the highlights of the key business developments during the year 
under review. The Chairmen of the Nomination, Remuneration, Audit 
and Board Safety Committees attend the Annual General Meeting to 
answer specific questions from shareholders. All Directors who then 
held office were present at the 2012 Annual General Meeting.
Notice of the Annual General Meeting is circulated to all shareholders 
at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. Separate resolutions 
are proposed at the Annual General Meeting on each substantially 
separate issue. Proxy votes are counted on all resolutions and, where 
votes are taken on a show of hands, the proxy results are 
subsequently announced to the meeting. Governance
63 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors’ remuneration report
As the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to 
present my report for the year to 31 March 2013. 
The Group met its financial targets for this year despite the 
challenging and unprecedented headwinds we have faced. Our 
recovery programmes in UK Bus and First Student are on track and 
it is more important than ever that our remuneration policy results in 
the retention and continued motivation of management who have to 
drive through and deliver the changes and improvements that are 
necessary in the business. Our focus therefore remains on ensuring 
that we have remuneration packages which attract, retain and 
motivate the high calibre individuals necessary to maintain the 
Group’s position as a leader in the public transportation industry.  
Our policy is to link a proportion of this remuneration to achievement 
of demanding financial, safety, customer service and personal 
performance targets and structure rewards to align management’s 
interests with those of our shareholders and provide incentives to 
deliver the challenging transformation plans that have been outlined 
earlier in this report.
Our remuneration policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis against the 
Committee’s broad principles and in the light of emerging best 
practice in Corporate Governance.
The Remuneration Committee has not changed its remuneration 
policy during the course of the year. However it intends to undertake 
a full review of the Executive Annual Bonus Plan (EABP) and Long 
Term Incentive Plan ( LTIP) during the course of 2013/14 to ensure 
that the incentive plans in place for executives remain competitive in 
terms of our ability to attract, motivate and retain talented people and 
are aligned to the achievement of our business plans. 
For the EABP that relates to the financial year 2013/14 there will be 
no significant change to the parameters for award, with no payment 
being made for profit below 95% of budget and the targets for injury 
prevention and customer service will be set to deliver year on year 
improvements in these key areas. However, having considered 
feedback from shareholders, in addition to the current profit targets, 
a proportion of bonus will be linked to the achievement of cash 
generation targets for both Group and individual divisions in 2013/14.
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee also include 
determining targets for and payments under any performance related 
pay scheme. Whilst no changes were made to our LTIP metrics we 
reduced the quantum of awards made during the year by 20% to 
reflect the significant reduction in the Company’s share price to 
ensure they were not excessive. This lowered the maximum 
entitlement which could be earned during the 2012/13 financial year 
to 120% of basic salary in respect of our Chief Executive. Given the 
capital reorganisation announced on 20 May 2013 and the 
forthcoming review of LTIP awards, the Remuneration Committee 
decided to defer making any awards until after the Company 
announces its half year results in November 2013 and, to the extent 
required, shareholders will be consulted in advance about any 
changes that relate to the structure of the LTIP and changes to the 
performance conditions. 
Following our annual review of Executive salaries it was determined 
not to award any inflationary increases to the Directors which means 
that the Chief Executive’s salary has been frozen for a second 
successive year. 
Professor David Begg
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 64 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008. It also meets the requirements of the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how 
the Board has applied the main and supporting principles of the Code 
relating to Directors’ remuneration. The Company complies with all of 
the provisions of the Code in respect of the Directors’ remuneration 
report. A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 July 2013.
The Regulations require the Company’s auditors to report to the 
Company’s shareholders on the ‘auditable’ part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of 
the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. This report has therefore been divided into 
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by David Begg. The other 
members of the Committee are Colin Hood, John Sievwright and  
Jim Winestock who was appointed to the Committee in January 
2013. Mick Barker as Group Employee Director attends meetings  
at the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee to represent the 
Group’s employees. The Chairman of the Board, as well as the Chief 
Executive, also attend meetings of the Committee by invitation, but 
neither was present when matters relating to their own remuneration 
were discussed. The Board considers each of the members of the 
Committee to be independent in accordance with the Code. None of 
the members of the Committee has any personal financial interest 
(other than as a shareholder) in the matters to be decided, or any 
conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships or any involvement 
in the day-to-day running of the business.
The terms of reference of the Committee were updated in March 
2013 and are published on the Company’s website. Copies are 
available on request.
The principal purpose of the Committee is to consider matters related 
to the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior 
management below Board level.
The Committee met eight times during the year and all members 
attended each meeting held whilst they were members. The 
Committee was also advised on the structuring of Directors’ 
remuneration packages and trends and best practice by Towers 
Watson, Mercers and Deloitte LLP . Apart from Towers Watson acting 
as our consultants for the Group Employee Survey, neither Towers 
Watson or Mercers had any other connection with the Company. 
Deloitte LLP are the Company’s Auditors but have provided 
remuneration services in compliance with the Ethical Standards of the 
Auditing Practices Board which restrict the provision of certain 
services in order to maintain auditor independence. Advisory partners 
and staff have no involvement in audit, and are not involved in the 
preparation of audited information. The Committee is satisfied that the 
safeguards in place ensure that the remuneration advice it receives 
from Deloitte LLP is independent.
Remuneration policy
Aim
The aim of the Committee is to design remuneration packages for the 
Executive Directors and senior management which attract, retain and 
motivate the high calibre individuals necessary to maintain the 
Group’s position as a leader in the public transport industry. In doing 
so the Committee aims to align management incentives with the 
interests of shareholders and the achievement of its challenging 
business transformation plans. 
In implementing its policy, the Committee has given full consideration 
to the Principles on remuneration set out in the Code. The policy is 
reviewed on an ongoing basis against the Committee’s broad 
principles and in the light of emerging best practice in corporate 
governance.

Structure of remuneration packages 
There are five key elements to the executive remuneration package:
■ ■
basic salary and benefits in kind
■ ■
annual cash and deferred bonus (both paid under the EABP)
■ ■
LTIP
■ ■
share schemes
■ ■
retirement benefits.
The Committee considers the remuneration package as a whole, 
balancing each of the individual elements to ensure that, overall, the 
remuneration received by each Executive Director is competitive but 
not excessive, contains an appropriate balance between fixed and 
variable (performance-related) remuneration and that each Executive 
Director will have sufficient long term incentive to ensure that his 
interests are aligned with those of shareholders. 
The remuneration of the Executive Directors is made up of the 
following components:
Basic salary and benefits in kind 
The basic salary and benefits in kind for each Executive Director are 
determined by the Committee for each financial year and when an 
individual changes position or responsibility. In determining appropriate 
levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole, having regard 
to the general level of pay awards around the Group, and also the 
packages received by executives of comparable seniority, experience  
and responsibilities employed by the Company’s peers in the public 
transport sector and other companies of comparable market 
capitalisation. Details of the salaries and benefits in kind received by 
each of the Executive Directors in the year are shown on page 68.
At 1 April 2012 the Executive Directors’ salaries did not increase.  
No salary increase will be paid to the Executive Directors for the 
2013/14 financial year.
Executive Annual Bonus Plan (EABP)
The Group operates a performance-related bonus plan for its 
Executive Directors and senior management under which payment of 
bonuses has historically been linked to achievement of a sliding scale 
of challenging normalised profit targets and non-financial targets 
(injury prevention, customer service and personal performance). 
Where an Executive Director is also directly responsible for one or 
more operating divisions, payment of a proportion of the bonus is also 
linked to the profitability of those divisions.
Each year, the Board sets challenging budget targets for the Group 
as a whole and for each business unit within the Group. 
The targets set in relation to non-financial performance are key 
strategic Group objectives that are tailored to the responsibilities of 
each individual Executive Director and, in aggregate, are considered 
to be similarly challenging to the range of financial targets set. 
For the year under review, bonuses were payable for Group 
normalised profit performance against budget of between 95% and 
110%. At 95% bonus would have been assessed at nil; at 101% 
bonus would have been assessed at 50% and at 110% bonus would 
have been assessed at maximum. Adjustments operate on a straight 
line basis between these parameters. 70% of any bonus payable was 
dependent upon Group (or, as appropriate, divisional) financial 
performance against target and the balance upon the achievement of 
safety, customer service and personal objectives. The maximum 
potential bonus which can be awarded to Executive Directors is 100% 
of basic salary and 120% of basic salary in the case of the Chief 
Executive. In addition, no bonus in respect of non-financial 
performance is payable unless 95% of the Group’s normalised 
budgeted profit is achieved.
Bonus payments comprise a mixture of cash and deferred share 
awards. The share award deferral period which applies to all 
participants in the EABP is three years. Share awards will lapse if the 
relevant individual leaves the Group during the deferral period for any 
reason other than redundancy, retirement or ill-health. The Committee 
considers it is appropriate for a proportion of the annual bonus to be 
taken in the form of deferred shares as this acts as a retention 
mechanism and also aligns the participants’ longer term interests with 
those of the Company’s shareholders.
As the award of any bonus is already dependent on the achievement 
of stringent targets, the Committee considers that it is not appropriate 
to attach further performance conditions on vesting of the deferred 
share element of any bonus other than that the relevant participant 
remains employed by the Group and has not tendered his or her 
resignation prior to the end of the deferral period.
Group performance against budget for the 2012/13 financial year was 
102.6%. A bonus of 70% of salary was awarded to Tim O’Toole and 
65.8% of salary was awarded to Chris Surch. 50% of their bonus is 
payable in cash with the remaining 50% in the form of deferred 
shares. Tim O’Toole waived his bonus. 
Subject to approval of the Company’s shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company to be held on 10 June 2013, following  
the capital reorganisation announcement on 20 May 2013, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that pursuant to the rules of  
the EABP , a standard rights issue adjustment formula would be 
applied to adjust the outstanding options and/or awards granted 
under this scheme. 66 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors’ remuneration report 
continued
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP was established in 2008 and provides for an award of 
shares, exercisable at the end of a three-year performance period 
subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued 
employment. 50% of the award is subject to growth in the Company’s 
earnings per share (EPS) and the remaining 50% of the award is 
subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR).
Details of the vesting targets for both parts of the 2008, 2009,  
2010 and 2011 awards were set out in previous Directors’ 
remuneration reports.
In respect of the portion of the 2012 award which is subject to EPS 
growth:
■ ■
100% will vest if EPS at the end of the performance period is not 
less than 51.9p
■ ■
25% will vest if EPS at the end of the performance period is not less 
than 43.72p
■ ■
Between 25% and 100% will vest on a straight line apportionment 
basis if EPS at the end of the performance period is between  
43.72p and 51.9p
■ ■
There will be no vesting if EPS at the end of the performance period 
is less than 43.72p.
The portion of the 2012 award which is subject to TSR will vest if the 
Company’s TSR over the three year performance period falls within 
the top half of a ranking of the TSR of the companies within a 
comparator group. The TSR comparator group for 2012 was selected 
to provide performance measurement against a group which 
contains the Company’s industry peers and is made up of a list of 
those companies comprising the FTSE All Share Travel and Leisure 
Index at the start of the performance period.
■ ■
100% of that portion will vest if the Company’s TSR falls within the 
upper quartile of the comparator group
■ ■
25% of that portion will vest if the Company’s TSR falls at the 
median of the comparator group
■ ■
Between 25% and 100% will vest on a straight line apportionment 
basis if the Company’s TSR falls between median and the upper 
quartile of the comparator group
■ ■
There will be no vesting if the Company’s TSR is below the median 
of the comparator group.
As with the previous awards, the foregoing vesting targets for the 
2012 award and the level of the award as a factor of salary in relation 
to the Executive Directors were agreed by the Committee following 
consultation with a number of the Company’s largest institutional 
shareholders.
Awards will lapse at the end of the performance period to the extent 
that the performance conditions have not been satisfied. There will be 
no re-testing.
Following testing of the conditions for vesting of the 2010 award  
at 31 March 2013, the Committee determined at a meeting on  
13 May 2013 that neither the EPS nor the TSR targets had been  
met and accordingly the award has lapsed. The awards granted in 
2008 and 2009 also lapsed.
The Committee can set different performance conditions from those 
described above and may also vary or adjust the performance 
conditions applying to awards which have been made to take 
account of events the Committee considers exceptional, including 
technical events, such as changes in accounting standards and 
treatment and the takeover of a company in the TSR comparator 
group, provided that in the opinion of the Committee the amended 
condition is fair and reasonable and no less challenging than the 
original condition would have been but for the event.
Generally, awards under the LTIP to any participant in any one 
financial year cannot exceed one and a half times basic salary at the 
time of the award. However, in exceptional circumstances, this may 
be increased to up to two times basic salary. Awards under the LTIP 
are not pensionable.
Following the capital reorganisation which was announced on 20 May 
2013 the Committee decided to defer making any awards until after 
the Company announces its half year results in November 2013 and 
as set out in the Chairman’s letter, to the extent required, shareholders 
will be consulted in advance about any changes that relate to the 
structure of the LTIP and changes to the performance conditions.
Subject to approval of the Company’s shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company to be held on 10 June 2013, following  
the capital reorganisation announcement on 20 May 2013, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that pursuant to the rules  
of the LTIP , a standard rights issue adjustment formula would be 
applied to adjust the outstanding options and/or awards granted 
under this scheme. Governance

Share Schemes
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The Company operated an ESOS up to June 2004 for Executive 
Directors and other senior management. In common with other large 
companies the Company did not grant any further awards to Executive 
Directors or senior management under the ESOS after 2004. 
Subject to approval of the Company’s shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company to be held on 10 June 2013, following the 
capital reorganisation announcement on 20 May 2013, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that pursuant to the rules of  
the ESOS, and subject to HMRC approval, a standard rights issue 
adjustment formula would be applied to adjust the remaining 
outstanding options previously granted under this scheme.
Save As You Earn (SAYE) Scheme
The Company operated a SAYE Scheme for eligible employees 
during the year under review under which options may be granted on 
an annual basis at a discount of up to 20% of market value. The 
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the current scheme 
but have chosen not to.
Subject to approval of the Company’s shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company to be held on 10 June 2013, following  
the capital reorganisation announcement on 20 May 2013, the 
Remuneration Committee determined that pursuant to the rules of  
the SAYE and subject to approval of HMRC, a standard rights issue 
adjustment formula would be applied to adjust the outstanding 
options granted under this scheme.
Buy As You Earn (BAYE) Scheme
The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan under the title ‘Buy As 
You Earn’. The scheme, which is open to all UK employees of the 
Group, enables employees (including the Executive Directors) to 
purchase partnership shares from their gross income (before income 
tax and National Insurance deductions). The Company provides two 
matching shares for every three partnership shares, subject to a 
maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of £20 a 
month. The shares are held in trust for up to five years, in which case, 
no income tax or National Insurance will be payable. The matching 
shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are 
removed from trust within three years from award.
Retirement benefits
Tim O’Toole is the only Executive Director who is a member of a 
defined benefit Group pension scheme. His dependants are eligible 
for dependants’ pensions. Whilst Chris Surch is not a member of the 
defined benefit scheme or the Group SIPP he receives a pension 
allowance equal to 20% of his basic salary. Both Executive Directors’ 
dependants will receive payment of a lump sum in the event of death 
in service. Further details are set out on page 71.
Proportion of fixed and variable pay for Executive  
Directors 2013
A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ potential remuneration 
is performance related. This comprises annual bonuses under the 
EABP and in the case of Tim O’Toole, long term incentives under the 
LTIP . The fixed proportion of their overall remuneration comprises 
base salary and pension allowance. For Tim O’Toole achieving 
median performance, performance related pay would represent 
almost 54% of total remuneration. If performance were such that the 
maximum award achievable under each variable incentive was paid, 
performance related pay would represent approximately 70% of total 
remuneration. Chris Surch joined as Group Finance Director  
after the 2012 LTIP awards had been granted and therefore only 
participated in the EABP . At median performance, performance 
related pay would represent 30% of his total remuneration.  
At maximum performance related pay would represent 45% of  
total remuneration.

Shareholding guidelines
Following the establishment of the LTIP in 2008, shareholding 
guidelines for Executive Directors were introduced. These require 
Executive Directors to retain at least 50% of the shares, net of tax, 
vesting under an LTIP award, or any other vesting of an award under 
any other executive share plan, or otherwise acquire shares in the 
Company over a period of five years until a shareholding with a 
market value (calculated by reference to purchase price) equal to 
100% of basic salary is achieved. The Remuneration Committee 
reserves the right to relax or waive the application of such guidelines 
in certain circumstances, including the impending retirement of any 
Executive Director.
As at 31 March 2013 Tim O’Toole had a beneficial interest in  
148,438 ordinary shares and it is anticipated that he will exceed  
the shareholding guidelines at the end of the five year period. Chris 
Surch had a beneficial interest in 30,534 ordinary shares. 68 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Service agreements
It is the Company’s policy to restrict notice periods for Executive 
Directors to a maximum of 12 months. Tim O’Toole’s service 
agreement, which is dated 25 January 2011, includes a notice period 
of 12 months by either party. Chris Surch’s service agreement, dated 
1 September 2012, includes a notice period of 6 months by either 
party. Under both service agreements, the contracts contain a 
provision, exercisable at the discretion of the Company, to pay an 
amount in lieu of notice on early termination of the contract. Such 
payments are limited to basic salary plus certain benefits but would 
not include entitlement to bonus or share awards. There are no 
contractual provisions governing payment of compensation on early 
termination of the contracts. If it becomes necessary to consider early 
termination of a service contract, the Company will have regard to all 
the circumstances of the case, including mitigation, when determining 
any compensation to be paid. 
Where Board approval is given for an Executive Director to accept an 
outside non-executive directorship, unless the appointment is in 
connection with Group business, the individual Director is entitled to 
retain any fees received.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have a letter of appointment and their 
fees are determined by the Board based on surveys of fees paid to 
non-executive directors of comparable companies. The appointment 
of each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to early termination 
without compensation if he is not re-appointed at a meeting of 
shareholders where he is up for re-election. These letters of 
appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and will be made available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Details of the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are set out below. 
There will be no increase in such fees for the financial year that 
commenced on 1 April 2013.
Non-Executive Directors, other than the Group Employee Director, 
cannot participate in any of the Company’s share schemes and are 
not eligible to join a Company pension scheme. Each of the  
Non-Executive Directors (other than David Begg and Colin Hood  
who receive all of their fees in the form of shares in the Company)  
has elected to receive 40% of his fees in the form of shares in the 
Company in order to ensure that their interests are more closely 
aligned to those of the Company’s shareholders. The shares are 
purchased on a monthly basis in the market.

 The retention share award will not vest if Tim O’Toole has ceased to be employed by FirstGroup or given notice of his resignation (other than for certain good leaver 
reasons) by this date. The principal purpose of this retention share award, which was made in a prior year after consultation with a number of FirstGroup’s largest 
institutional shareholders, was the retention of Tim O’Toole as Chief Executive.

 Only Tim O’Toole participated in a defined benefit pension scheme during the year. The defined benefit Directors’ contributions in the table above have been paid via 
salary sacrifice by the Director with an equivalent contribution being paid directly to the pension scheme by the Company. The Group operates a number of pension 
schemes. Tim O’Toole participates in a final salary arrangement, restricted through a scheme earnings cap, which is not limited in membership to Executive 
Directors. This closed to new members in 2011.
2
 The inflation assumption is 2.79% using the annual change in CPI as at February 2013.
3
 The accrued pension at 31 March 2013 for Tim O’Toole is based on the actual final pensionable salary at that date. A three year average of pensionable salary is 
normally used. As Tim O’Toole has not yet completed three years service, the final pensionable salary has been averaged over two complete years.
4
 Chris Surch is not a member of the defined benefit scheme.
A ‘pension allowance’ is calculated for each Director as 20% of their basic salary in excess of the scheme earnings cap, or 20% of basic salary

Chris Surch did not participate in the Group SIPP and a salary supplement of £52,500, calculated at 20% of his basic pro rata salary, was paid 
to him.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, on 20 May 2013 and signed on 
its behalf by:
Professor David Begg
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 72 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors’ report
The Directors have pleasure in submitting 
their Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 31 March 2013.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of passenger 
transport services principally in the UK and North America  
together with some minor activities in other European countries 
including Denmark.
Review of the business
Reviews of the business and principal events and likely future 
developments are given in the Chairman’s statement and the 
operating and financial review set out on pages 16 to 39. Our review 
of the principal risks and uncertainties of the business is set out on 
pages 46 to 51.
Results and dividends
The results for the year are set out in the consolidated income 
statement on page 76. The Directors are not recommending payment 
of a final dividend this year.
Share capital
Details of issued share capital, together with details of the movements 
in the Company’s issued share capital during the year, are set out in 
note 28 to the financial statements. The Company has one class of 
ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. As at 20 May 
2013, there were 482,067 ,170 ordinary shares of 5p each in issue 
including 160,779 ordinary shares held in treasury.
Shareholders who are present at a general meeting and duly 
appointed proxies present at a general meeting can vote on a show  
of hands. They will have one vote each. On a poll, every shareholder 
present in person or by proxy will have one vote for every share  
he/she holds. The Notice of the 2013 Annual General Meeting 
accompanying this document specifies the deadlines for exercising 
voting rights. All proxy votes are counted and the number for, against 
and withheld in relation to each resolution are announced at the 
meeting and published on the Company’s website after the meeting.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions 
of the articles of association and prevailing legislation. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on 
voting rights at any meeting of the Company.
Details of employee share schemes are set out on pages 65 to 67 
and in note 35 to the financial statements.
Kleinwort Benson (Guernsey) Trustees Limited, as trustee of 
FirstGroup plc Employee Benefit Trust, holds shares in the Company 
in trust in order to satisfy awards made to participants in the 
Company’s LTIP , ESOS and EABP and abstain from voting.
Under the rules of the FirstGroup plc Share Incentive Plan (BAYE), 
employees buy shares and receive free matching shares in the 
Company. In order to preserve certain tax benefits these shares are 
held in a trust by Yorkshire Building Society for employees. Whilst 
these shares are held in trust, the voting rights attached to them are 
exercised by the trustee but only at the direction of the employees. 
The trustee does not vote on the shares if no direction is given to it.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share 
capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Authority for the Company to purchase its own shares
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company in 2012 authority was 
granted for the Company to purchase up to 10% of its ordinary 
shares. During the year, no ordinary shares were purchased. Under 
the existing authority, the Company may purchase up to 48,000,000 
ordinary shares. This authority remains in place until the 2013 Annual 
General Meeting, when it is intended to seek a further renewal.
Directors
The Directors of the Company who served during the year were 
Martin Gilbert, Tim O’Toole, Chris Surch (appointed 1 September 
2012), David Begg, John Sievwright, Colin Hood, Brian Wallace 
(appointed 1 August 2012), Jim Winestock (appointed 1 August 2012), 
and Mick Barker. Biographical details of all the serving Directors are 
set out on pages 52 and 53.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the 
Company is governed by its articles of association, the Code, the 
Companies Acts and related legislation. The Company is managed by 
the Directors, who may exercise all powers of the Company which are 
not required to be exercised by the shareholders of the Company by 
voting in general meeting.
Senior executives of FirstGroup America and its operating units have 
been provided with executive employment agreements that provide, 
in part, some compensation for any termination other than a 
termination for cause. Severance payments range from one to two 
years in duration. This is customary practice in the US market.
There are no other agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office 
or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy 
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Details of the fees and remuneration of the Directors and their service 
contracts or terms of appointment are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 63 to 71. Governance

Employees
Details of the Group’s employment practices can be found in the 
corporate responsibility section of the report on pages 44 and 45. 
Corporate responsibility
The Group publishes a separate Corporate Responsibility Report 
covering social, environmental and health and safety issues, which 
will be available on our website at www.firstgroup.com.
Charitable and political contributions
The Group made various donations to UK charities totalling 
approximately £366,000 during the year (2012: £254,000).  
No payments were made for political purposes.
Creditors
It is the Group’s policy to abide by the payment terms agreed with 
suppliers wherever it is satisfied that the supplier has provided goods 
and services in accordance with agreed terms and conditions.  
A number of significant purchases including fuel, tyres and 
commitments under hire purchase contracts, finance leases and 
operating leases are paid by direct debit. At 31 March 2013, the 
Group had the equivalent of 36 days’ (2012: 40 days’) purchases 
outstanding, based on the ratio of Group trade creditors at the end  
of the year to the amounts invoiced during the year by trade creditors. 
The Company does not have any trade creditors in its balance sheet. 74 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors’ report 
continued
Audit information 
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors of the Company 
at the date when this report was approved: so far as each of the 
Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and each of the Directors has 
taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order  
to make himself aware of any relevant audit information (as defined) 
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of  
that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Forward-looking statements
Where the Directors’ report contains forward-looking statements 
these are made by the Directors in good faith based upon the 
information available at the time of their approval of this report.  
These statements will not be updated or reported upon further. 
Consequently, such statements should be treated with caution due to 
the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk 
factors, underlying such forward-looking statements or information 
and nothing in this report should be construed as a profit forecast.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Aberdeen Exhibition 
and Conference Centre, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen, Scotland  
AB23 8BL on Wednesday 17 July 2013 at 11.00 am. The Notice of 
Annual General Meeting is contained in a separate letter from the 
Chairman accompanying this report.
Going concern 
The Directors have acknowledged the guidance on going concern 
and financial reporting published by the Financial Reporting Council in 
October 2009.
Whilst the Group is affected by macroeconomic developments, it has 
a strong balanced portfolio of businesses with approximately 50% of 
Group revenues secured under medium term contracts with 
government agencies and other large organisations in the UK and 
North America.
While any changes in economic activity will impact UK Bus and Rail 
passenger numbers this potential risk is reduced by the availability of 
revenue support for certain rail franchises and, in UK Bus, by the 
ability of the Group to modify services giving 56 days’ notice (70 days 
in Scotland) of such modifications. In North America, the First Student 
and First Transit businesses are highly contracted and, whilst 
Greyhound is more susceptible to the economy, its costs are 
largely variable.
The Group has a diversified funding structure which is largely 
represented by medium term unsecured committed bank facilities 
and long term unsecured bond debt. The Group has a US$1,250m  
committed revolving banking facility of which US$1,135m was 
undrawn at the year end. These facilities expire in December 2015 
and the Directors believe that there is every likelihood that they will be 
replaced by similar financing arrangements.
The Group’s management of exposure to financial risk, including 
liquidity, currency, interest rate and commodity risks, is disclosed in 
note 25 to the financial statements.
The Directors have carried out a detailed review of the Group’s 
2013/14 budget and medium term plans, with due regard for the risks 
and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed (of which the 
principal items are set out on pages 46 to 51), the uncertain economic 
climate and the impact that this could have on trading performance.
Based on this review, the Directors believe that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis.

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for 
that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
■ ■
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
■ ■
make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
■ ■
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements
■ ■
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
■ ■
properly select and apply accounting policies
■ ■
present information including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information
■ ■
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on 
the entity’s financial position and financial performance
■ ■
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
■ ■
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole
■ ■
the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. General information
FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 395 King 
Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the operating and financial review on 
pages 16 to 39.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and on a 
going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors’ report on page 74. The principal accounting policies adopted 
are set out below.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2013 include the results of the rail businesses for the year to 31 March 2013 and the results of all the other 
businesses for the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2013. The figures for the year to 31 March 2012 include the results of the rail businesses for the 
year to 31 March 2012 and the results of all the other businesses for the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2012. 
Total assets split by geographical area at 31 March 2012 have been restated to be consistent with the basis of presentation at 30 September 2012.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity  
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity interest therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be 
measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of their fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice 
of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the  
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisitions method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, with the exception of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to 
employee benefit arrangements, liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share based payment 
and non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders’ proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those 
policies. As a general rule, significant influence will be presumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% or 
more of the voting power, of the investee. However, where it is clear that the Group, although holding 20% or more of the voting power does not 
have significant influence, the investment is not accounted for as an associate. The Group has a 30% holding in DSBFirst but does not have 
significant influence and therefore the holding is treated as an investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except 
when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate 
in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the associate. 82 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.  
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date 
of classification.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other 
assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested 
for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their useful economic lives as follows: 
Customer contracts – over the estimated life of the contract (9 to 10 years) 
Greyhound brand and trade name – over the estimated life of the brand (20 years) 
Franchise agreements – over the term of the franchise (6 to 10 years)
Revenue recognition 
Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance 
services in the UK and North America. Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers’ travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as 
the proportion of total services to be provided. Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within ‘Season ticket deferred income’ 
and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport Scotland and amounts receivable 
under franchise revenue support arrangements. Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are 
included in operating costs. Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies (TOCs), predominantly based on 
models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts. 
UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes. Concessionary amounts are 
recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority. 
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises of amounts receivable from ticket sales. Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, and 
services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the  
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the life 
of the lease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet 
as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see opposite).
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Financial statements
83 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the 
period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period 
except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. 
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies  
(see note 25 for details of the Group’s policies in respect of foreign exchange risks). 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during 
that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising from the average or actual 
exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after amortisation charges and exceptional items but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which due to their size, nature, age and/or infrequency, require separate 
identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the underlying financial performance in the year, in 
comparison to prior years.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution 
schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. There is no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees’ benefits 
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. 
Various TOCs in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme. The Group 
is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held. The full liability is recognised on the balance 
sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Group’s obligations to fund the scheme over the 
franchise term.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance  
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
  84 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities  
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on  
a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment
Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes 
professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these 
assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised  
impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets 
in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings  50 years straight-line 
Long leasehold buildings  50 years straight-line 
Short leasehold properties  period of lease 
Passenger carrying vehicles  7 to 15 years straight-line 
Other plant and equipment  3 to 25 years straight-line
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the 
term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Capital grants
Capital grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected 
useful lives of the assets concerned. Capital grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the 
conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the 
case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and 
on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions 
and discounted cash flows. Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost. Financial statements
85 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories:
Fair value through profit and loss
This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the profit and 
loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and 
ability to hold to maturity. These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables 
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either 
fair value through profit or loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost. Gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation. 
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i.e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash 
in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from 
the date of inception and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated balance sheet cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities. All are carried on the 
balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash. The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the 
Group’s UK Rail subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up 
to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The ring-fenced cash represents that which 
is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other 
categories. After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of 
equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain 
or loss is included in the income statement. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 
by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Sterling bonds and loan notes
These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks. Use of such financial 
instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. 
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps. Such 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date. The fair values are 
calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations. 
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges for interest rate risk on certain floating rate debt, and fair value hedges for fair value 
risk relating to the LIBOR element of a fixed rate financial liability. The fuel swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of fuel price risks or 
otherwise used as economic hedges of such risks. The cross currency swaps are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk relating to 
part of the Group’s net investment in US Dollar assets. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency 
hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to 
the income statement for the period.
  86 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the consolidated financial statements  
continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
reported in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are 
considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals.
Insurance
The Group’s policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses. To provide protection above these types of losses, 
cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies. Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgements and 
estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets (including goodwill)
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated. The 
value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate 
present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £1,665.8m (2012: £1,599.3m; 2011: £1,608.0m) as set out in note 
13 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was £281.8m (2012: £318.8m; 2011: £348.6m) as set out in note 
14. The remaining useful economic lives of certain contracts were reassessed during the year as set out in note 5. The sensitivities on the key 
assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing are also set out in note 13.
Contract and franchise accounting
Judgements are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and 
liabilities arising from long term service contracts and franchises. Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of contracts and 
franchises, which require assessments and judgements relating to the expected level of revenues and costs and, in cases where options exist, 
the life of the contract or franchise.
Defined benefit pension arrangements
Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, 
expected rate of inflation of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates. The most significant of these are the 
discount rate and inflation rate assumptions. A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position 
by approximately £1m and £33m respectively. A 0.1% movement in the inflation rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position 
by approximately £3m and £23m respectively. The net pension deficit as at the balance sheet date was £247.8m (2012: £267.9m; 2011: £243.2m) 
as set out in note 36. 
Self-insurance
Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using management’s best estimate of the likely settlement of these 
incidents. The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as 
required. The Group’s total self-insurance provisions, including those classified within accruals, as at the balance sheet date were £332.6m (2012: 
£336.0m; 2011: £340.5m) as set out in note 27.

UK Bus depot sales and closures
UK Bus depot sales and closures relate to measures taken by the Group to rebalance its portfolio in the UK Bus operations, which included 
selling or closing certain operations. Shortly after the end of the year we announced the agreements to sell all of our London depots with the 
exception of Dagenham. The principal charge in 2012/13 represents asset impairments and an onerous contract provision for the remaining 
Dagenham depot.
First Transit FSS disposal and exit from Diego Garcia operations
During the year the Group disposed of the First Support Services business realising a loss on disposal of £7.7m. In addition operating profit to 
date of disposal of £1.0m has also been treated as part of the overall exceptional charge. The Diego Garcia operations were exited at the end of 
the year which resulted in a net exceptional charge of £5.9m.
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision
The Group recorded a provision in 2010/11 in respect of the UK Rail First Great Western (FGW) franchise agreement. This provision reflected the 
Group’s best estimate of the likely losses on the franchise over the two years to 31 March 2013, which would arise due to the accelerated write off 
of assets dedicated to the FGW franchise due to the Group’s decision not to exercise its option to extend the franchise agreement for a further 
three years beyond the original franchise end date. The Group recorded a further provision of £9.9m in 2012/13 due to incremental losses 
following the DfT exercising the option to extend the franchise by a further seven rail periods to October 2013.
UK Rail joint venture provision 
The carrying value of £5.0m of the investment in DSBFirst, a joint venture with a Danish rail operator, was fully written off during the year as 
current and projected trading indicates that there will be no recovery of this amount at the end of the franchise.

5. Exceptional items and amortisation charges continued
First Student onerous contract
During the year the Group provided a further £2.7m against a loss making contract that was taken on as part of the Laidlaw acquisition 
undertakings in 2007. This contract is due to expire early in the year to 31 March 2014.
First Student legal claims 
During the year, the Group incurred £2.6m of legal costs in defending old contractual claims and other litigations. In addition, the Group provided 
£17.2m to cover the estimated potential settlement amounts on certain of these historical claims.
First Transit legal settlements 
The Group settled certain historical legal claims during the year, principally a contractual dispute from 2009. The Group treated this cost as 
exceptional due to the size and age of the claims. The Group recognised an exceptional charge of £5.9m in respect of these settlements. 
First Transit Diego Garcia insurance claim
The Group settled a historical insurance claim in relation to the Diego Garcia contract in 2012/13 and recognised exceptional income of £6.7m.
UK Bus Pension Scheme changes
UK Bus Pension Scheme changes relate to measures the Group took to mitigate the risk of the pension schemes covering UK Bus employees. 
As a result of these changes, future pension liabilities of the Group decreased. In 2011/12, the Group linked pension increases to consumer price 
inflation (CPI) rather than retail price inflation (RPI), which usually shows a higher rate of inflation, and also introduced a pensionable pay cap, along 
with lower pension accrual rates. As a result of these changes, future pension liabilities of the Group decreased in 2011/12, and the Group 
realised a one-off exceptional gain of £73.3m.
UK Rail bid costs
The Group’s net UK Rail bid costs in the year represented franchise bid costs for all bids, less amounts recovered or recoverable from the DfT in 
respect of the InterCity West Coast franchise bid. The Group incurred UK Rail bid costs in both 2012/13 and 2011/12 in connection with the 
preparation of the InterCity West Coast franchise bid as well as bids for Great Western, Thameslink and Essex Thameside rail franchises.
Competition Commission costs
Competition Commission (CC) costs relate to costs incurred by the Group in 2011/12 in responding to an investigation by the CC into the UK local 
bus market. The CC issued their final report in December 2011.
Other exceptional items
Other exceptional items include principally costs incurred in effecting the changes to the UK Bus Pension Scheme in 2011/12 described above.
Amortisation charges
The charge for the year was £52.0m (2012: £30.9m) with the increase mainly due to a higher level of contract amortisation at First Student as a 
result of a reassessment of the remaining useful economic lives of the contracts acquired with the Laidlaw acquisition. Previously these contracts 
were being amortised over 20 years but are now being amortised over 10 years. As a result of this, the income statement charge increased by 
£24.8m during the year.
(Loss)/profit on disposal of properties
During the year the Group realised £9.7m (2012: £40.3m) on the disposal of selected properties predominantly in Greyhound and UK Bus 
operations. These resulted in a net loss on disposal of £2.7m (2012: profit £1.0m). 
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives
Due to the ineffective element and undesignated fair value movements on financial derivatives there was a £5.5m non-cash charge (2012: £11.0m) 
to the income statement during the year. The principal component of this non-cash charge relates to fixed interest rate swaps which do not 
qualify for hedge accounting but do provide a cash flow hedge against variable rate debt from 2013 to 2015.
Tax on exceptional items and amortisation charges
The tax credit as a result of these exceptional items was £43.3m (2012: £0.4m). In addition there was a one-off deferred tax credit of £2.0m  
(2012: £4.0m) as a result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% (2012: 26% to 24%). Financial statements

EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of £35.0m (2012: £196.2m) by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares of 481.7m (2012: 481.4m). The numbers of ordinary shares used for the basic and diluted calculations are shown in the table below.
The difference in the number of shares between the basic calculation and the diluted calculation represents the weighted average number of 
potentially dilutive ordinary share options.

Impairment testing
At the year end, the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of 
Assets. For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in 
each relevant CGU. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2013/14 and Five Year Plan projections up to 2016/17 which 
take account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments. The projections for First Student assume the 
incremental benefits of the recovery plan together with a moderate economic recovery. Cash flows in 2017/18 are extrapolated using estimated 
growth rates of 2.5% (2012: 2.5%) for the United Kingdom and 3.0% (2012: 3.0%) for North America which do not exceed the long term average 
growth rate for the Group’s businesses. A risk adjustment is then made using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% (2012: 10.0%) to arrive at the value 
in use for each of the CGUs. The pre-tax discount rates applied are derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions 
used in the calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in light of economic 
and industry forecasts. 
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause 
the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
The headroom by the principal CGUs and sensitivities thereon, which are shown on a mutually exclusive basis, are as follows:

 Net assets including goodwill above but excluding intercompany balances.
The First Student margin would need to fall in excess of 1.5% compared to future projections for there to be an impairment to the carrying value of 
net assets in this business. 
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no further impairment to any of the CGUs.

Intangible assets include customer contracts and the Greyhound brand and trade name which were acquired through the purchases of 
businesses and subsidiary undertakings. These are being amortised over their useful economic lives as shown in note 2 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The rail franchise agreements’ intangible asset represents the part of the economic benefit that is realised as a result of recognising our share of 
the rail pension deficit on the date of commencement of each respective franchise and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the initial term of 
each respective franchise. The largest element of the franchise intangible relates to the First ScotRail franchise (carrying amount £2.0m  
(2012: £3.3m)). During 2012 the First TransPennine Express franchise was extended giving rise to an addition to rail franchise agreements 
intangible assets of £1.4m. Financial statements

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from failure by a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
Credit risk exists in relation to the Group’s financial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of £641.0m (2012: £601.9m;  
2011: £555.5m), cash and cash equivalents of £682.1m (2012: £499.7m; 2011: £388.0m) and derivative financial instruments of £86.6m  
(2012: £116.1m; 2011: £123.2m).
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for all financial assets at the balance sheet date was £1,409.7m (2012: £1,217.7m; 2011: £1,066.7m). 
The exposure is spread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty 
was £51.3m (2012: £81.1m; 2011: £53.0m) at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was £3.2m (2012: £4.5m; 2011: £7.5m).
Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the UK Department for Transport, Network Rail, Transport for London, 
Transport Scotland, UK city councils and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America. The Group does not consider any of 
these counterparties to be a significant risk. Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by large banks with a minimum of ‘A’ credit 
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board. Group Treasury policy limits 
the maximum deposit with any one counter-party to £75m, and limits the maximum term to three months. Financial statements

There are also First Student yellow school buses which are surplus to requirements and are being actively marketed on the Internet. Gains or 
losses arising on the disposal of such assets are included in arriving at operating profit in the income statement. The Group expects to sell such 
yellow school buses within 12 months of them going on to the ‘for sale’ list. The value at each balance sheet date represents management’s best

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period taken 
for trade purchases is 36 days (2012: 40 days; 2011: 33 days). The Group has controls in place to ensure that all payments are paid within the 
appropriate credit timeframe. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by these subsidiaries up to the lower of the amount of their retained profits or the 
amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The ring-fenced cash represents cash which is not available for distribution and any additional 
amounts required to satisfy the liquidity ratios at the balance sheet date. Ring-fenced cash balances of £14.4m (2012: £12.5m; 2011: £14.8m) are

The loan notes have been classified by reference to the earliest date on which the loan note holder can request redemption. Loan notes of £8.7m 
(2012: £8.7m; 2011: £8.7m) are supported by unsecured bank guarantees.
The loan notes have an average effective borrowing rate of 10.1% (2012: 10.1%; 2011: 10.1%) and an average remaining term of 7 years  
(2012: 8 years; 2011: 9 years) assuming that the holders do not request redemption. The fair value of the loan notes has been determined to be 
£15.0m (2012: £15.8m; 2011: £15.1m). This has been calculated by discounting future cash flows that will arise under the loan notes.

Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market based risks principally being the effects of changes in 
foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by 
the Board. Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the 
Group Finance Director.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. The objective of the 
Group’s liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient committed liquidity resources exist. The Group has a diversified debt structure largely 
represented by medium term unsecured syndicated and bilateral committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and 
finance leases. It is a policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates. 
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such 
facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates. At 31 March 2013, the total amount of these facilities stood at £1,259.4m 
(2012: £1,178.2m; 2011: £1,222.9m), and committed headroom was £821.6m (2012: £631.8m; 2011: £526.7m), in addition to free cash balances  
of £393.9m (2012: £164.0m; 2011 £89.4m). The next material contractual expiry of revolver bank facilities is in December 2015. Largely due to  
the seasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increase again by the  
following March.  
The average duration of net debt (excluding ring-fenced cash) at 31 March 2013 was 5.4 years (2012: 5.5 years; 2011: 6.1 years).

Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash flows reported in Sterling due to movements in 
exchange rates. 
The Group’s principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant. Consequently the principal 
currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to Sterling. 
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 30% foreign currency denominated net assets to be hedged.
As at 31 March 2013, 39% (2012: 47%; 2011: 62%) of foreign currency denominated net assets were hedged with related foreign currency debt, 
debt and currency swaps.
Group treasury policy aims to protect EPS from currency movements. US Dollar earnings arising in the US are substantially protected by  
US Dollar denominated costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest costs and US Dollar tax costs so that exposure to 
EPS on a year to year basis is not material. Cash flow exposures are not material. 
IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange 
rates. The following analysis details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar. The analysis has been 
prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.  
A positive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.

Interest rate risk
The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore its net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates. The Group treasury 
policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility 
is substantially reduced year on year to EPS. The main floating rate benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
The policy objective is achieved through fixed rate debt and cash flow hedge financial instruments, being interest rate swaps. The interest rate 
swaps cover periods from April 2013 to March 2016. At 31 March 2013 the amount of gross debt that was fixed was in excess of 100% of net debt.
At 31 March 2013, 88% (2012: 81%; 2011: 73%) of gross debt was fixed. This fixed rate protection had an average duration of 5.5 years  
(2012: 5.7 years; 2011: 6.7 years). 
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing fixed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the £250.0m Sterling bond relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps. These swaps match the fair value 
movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bond. Interest income is received in January and payments 
made in March and September each year.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Group’s sensitivity to a 100 basis points (1%) increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period 
with all other variables held constant.

Interest rate hedges 
The following table details the notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date. The average interest rate is 
based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis. The differences between the fixed and floating rates are settled on a 
net basis.

The interest rate swaps with a duration of more than five years are fair value hedges of the LIBOR element within the £250m bond and the fixed 
rate represents interest receivable. All other swaps are cash flow hedges of variable rate interest where the fixed rate is interest payable. Financial statements

Fuel price risk
The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis in its UK Bus, UK Rail, US and Canadian bus operations and therefore is exposed to 
changes in diesel prices, of which the most significant element is crude oil price risk. The Group’s policy objective is to maintain a significant 
degree of fixed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are 
protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access for 
potentially lower costs over the medium term. The Group primarily uses fixed rate swap instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty. 
During the year to 31 March 2013, the Group was hedged 82% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2013 to March 2015 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to  
31 March 2014. The swaps give rise to monthly cash flow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price 
costs, except where they have a deferred start date. Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on 
qualifying hedges to achieve fixed rate fuel costs within operating results.

The current liabilities above are included within accruals in note 20.
The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date. It is anticipated that the 
majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years. The utilisation of £173.1m (2012: £162.8m; 2011: £121.2m) represents payments 
made largely against the current liability of the preceding year. 
Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases filed or thought highly likely to be filed for incidents that occurred prior to the 
balance sheet date. It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within 10 years. Also included are provisions in respect of costs 
anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
The provision for future losses on the FGW franchise will be utilised over the remaining term of the initial franchise which will end in October 2013.
The pensions provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain UK Bus companies. It is anticipated that this will be 
utilised over five to 10 years.

 35. Share-based payments continued
The fair values of the options granted during the last two years were measured using a Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes 
model were as follows:
2013 2012
Weighted average share price (pence)
– DBS 220.1 351.8
– SAYE December 2011 – 319.2
– SAYE December 2012 188.9 –
– LTIP 223.1 337.8
Weighted average exercise price (pence)
– DBS – –
– SAYE December 2011 – 271.5

Expected volatility
– DBS 43% 35%
– SAYE December 2011 – 35%
– SAYE December 2012 35% –
– LTIP 31% 42.9%
Expected life (years)
– DBS 3 3
– SAYE schemes 3 3
– LTIP 3 3
Rate of interest
– DBS 0.4% 1.5%
– SAYE December 2010 – 0.6%
– SAYE December 2011 0.4% –
– LTIP 0.4% 1.3%
Expected dividend yield
– DBS 10.8% 6.3%
– SAYE December 2011 – 7.0%
– SAYE December 2012 12.5% –
– LTIP 10.6% 6.6%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous five years. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an 
entitlement vests. The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total 
charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it. Fair values for the 
SAYE include a 10% p.a. pre-vesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive, LTIP and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for 
pre-vesting forfeitures.
The Group used the inputs noted above to measure the fair value of the new share options. 
36. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes are held separately 
from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the 
contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £8.4m (2012: £6.5m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in 
the rules of the plans.  Financial statements

36. Retirement benefit schemes continued
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American 
employees. These are principally defined benefit schemes under which benefits provided are based on employees’ number of years of service 
and either career average or final salary. The scope of benefits varies between schemes. The assets of the schemes are held in separately 
administered trusts which are managed independently of the Group’s finances by investment managers appointed by the schemes’ trustees.
The various defined benefit schemes include six UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a 
scheme operated by a local authority. These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations. 
First Greater Western Limited, First Capital Connect Limited, First ScotRail Limited and First/Keolis TransPennine Express Limited have sections 
in the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), which is an industry-wide arrangement. Under the terms of the RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared 
by the employer (60%) and the employees (40%). In calculating the Group’s pension obligations in respect of the RPS the Group has calculated 
the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19. These deficits are reduced by a ‘franchise adjustment’ which is 
that portion of the deficit which is projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund. The franchise 
adjustment, which has been calculated by the Group’s actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the 
financial performance, position and cash flows of the Group’s obligations.
At their last triennial valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 61.0% and 101.9% (2012: 61.0% and 101.9%;  
2011: 61.0% and 122.4%). The market value of the assets at 31 March 2013 for all defined benefit schemes totalled £3,777m (2012: £3,397m; 
2011: £3,289m). 
Contributions are paid to all defined benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes’ actuaries. The valuations are 
made using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is 
actuarially valued.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of FirstGroup plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of FirstGroup plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and the consolidated cash flow statement, and the related notes 1 to 37. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,  
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
■ ■give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended;
■ ■ have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
■ ■ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
■ ■ certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
■ ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
■ ■ the Directors’ statement, in relation to going concern; and
■ ■ the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review; and
■ ■ certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of FirstGroup plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 and on the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and on a going 
concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors’ report on page 74. 
The following accounting policies have been used consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in accordance with UK GAAP. 
Cash flow statement
The Company has taken the advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 (revised) not to disclose a cash flow statement.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment. For investments in subsidiaries acquired 
for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares 
issued. Any premium is ignored.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than Sterling are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the relevant balance sheet 
date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of non-monetary items at each balance sheet 
date are included in the profit or loss for the accounting period.
Tax
The charge for tax is based on the profit or loss for the year and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. Provision is made for deferred tax on all timing differences except those arising from 
the revaluation of fixed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell on property gains if it is anticipated that rollover relief will be available 
and on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is 
estimated the tax will arise. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and then for reporting purposes are remeasured to fair value at each subsequent 
balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks. Use of such financial 
instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments 
for speculative purposes. In relation to fuel price risks, the Company’s profit and loss account is affected by transactions with affiliated companies 
that give rise to cash flow volatility associated with fuel price risk.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps and collars, fuel swaps and collars, and cross currency 
interest rate swaps. Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet 
date. The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by 
counterparty confirmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency 
hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to 
the profit and loss account for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
reported in the income statement.
Related party transactions
As permitted under FRS 8, Related party transactions, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions between 
Group companies.
Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the amortisation 
of debt issuance fees in respect of the accounting period and reduced by repayments made in the period.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 132 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Notes to the Company financial statements

2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. 
FirstGroup plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 March 2013 of £65.3m (2012: £45.0m).
Fees payable to the Company’s auditors for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements are disclosed in note 6 on page 93.

  138 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Independent auditor’s report to the members of FirstGroup plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of FirstGroup plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which comprise the balance sheet, 
and the related notes 1 to 12. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
■ ■ give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2013;
■ ■ have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
■ ■ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
■ ■ the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
■ ■ the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the parent 
company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
■ ■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
■ ■ the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
■ ■ certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
■ ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of FirstGroup plc for the year ended 31 March 2013.

Electronic communication
The Company’s articles of association permit the Company to  
use electronic communication when sending information to its 
shareholders. Using electronic communications helps us reduce  
the environmental impact of our business by limiting the amount  
of paper we use and it assists us in managing our costs. We 
periodically consult with shareholders to check how they wish  
to receive information from us and a shareholder is taken to  
have agreed to website communications if a response has not  
been received.
Any document or information required to be sent to shareholders  
is made available on the Company’s website and a notification of 
availability is sent. Shareholders who receive such a notification are 
entitled to request a hard copy of the document at any time and 
may also change the way they receive communications at any time 
by contacting Equiniti.
FirstGroup plc’s policy on discounts for shareholders
Shareholders are reminded that it is not Group policy to offer travel 
or other discounts to shareholders, as they may be used only by a 
small number of individuals. The Group is focused on overall 
returns, including dividends, which are of benefit to all shareholders.

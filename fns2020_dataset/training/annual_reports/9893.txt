A STRATEGY FOR GROWTH
We have focused on a ‘buy and build’ strategy to create a diverse product range
covering a wide spectrum of music and film genres. We continue to grow organically
through the smart utilisation of our core assets; namely our catalogue of audio and
DVD material and through tactical acquisitions which have given us the opportunity to
grow market share and profitability.
Core to this strategy is the minimisation of risk. Our growth is not based on chart
success and does not require substantial finance to promote new artists. We focus on
established names with broad appeal and package them in a compelling way.
We will continue to grow the group by:
• Expanding its catalogue and diversity of product range
• Structured growth of the groups subsidiaries
• Acquisition of companies with a similar product portfolio and distribution channels
• Seeking products that complement our existing customer base and logistics

Chairman’s Statement
Introduction 
This financial year has seen a significant change in the Group structure
as expressed in the results for the financial year to March 2005. 
The major element of change is primarily a result of the acquisition of
Redworth in October 2004 and in particular the impact of its principal
trading subsidiary Music Box Leisure.
The consideration for the acquisition comprised an initial payment of
£1 7.15m in cash and loan notes with the balance satisfied by the issue
of 100,000,000 ordinary shares. Further consideration has been made
on a performance related basis satisfied by the issue of 130,276,185
ordinary shares. 
In trading terms Music Box Leisure made a significant impact on the
Group’s trading during the last six months of the financial year. I am
also pleased to report that we have also seen a strong performance
from Legacy, our North American operation, which has continued to
show consistent growth. 
Financials 
Results for the 12 months ending 31st March 2005, include a 
six-month contribution from Redworth and its subsidiaries. This period
includes the strongest trading months in a seasonal business. 
The Group’s activities have generated a 216% increase in turnover to
£49.8m (2004: £15.8m) with a 126% increase in profit before tax,
interest, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items to £4.3m (2004:
£1.9m). Acquisitions contributed £35.4m to turnover and £4.1m to
profit before tax, interest and goodwill amortisation. Normalized
earnings per share are 0.90p (2004: 0.68p). In view of this
performance the Board is recommending a maiden dividend of 0.012
pence per share for the second half-year trading period. 
The rapidly maturing DVD market in the UK has resulted in a number
of changes to market influences and pricing that affected our budget
priced DVD offering, originally acquired with Hollywood DVD. This had
a significant impact on the second half results and has caused the
Directors to consider the ongoing value of the existing budget DVD
business. The Directors have concluded that a provision for the
goodwill impairment of £2.1m is required against the carrying value of
goodwill which arose from the acquisition of Hollywood DVD. The
Group is actively seeking alternative DVD product opportunities to
strengthen its DVD portfolio. 
As part of its commitment to driving distribution synergies across the
enlarged Group, the Board has completed a strategic review and
restructuring. As a result, an exercise is underway to move all UK
distribution through the Group’s distribution centre in Lancashire and
the Board expects to see benefits from this in the second half of 
this year. 
The Board
I am pleased to report that the team of Non Executive Directors was
strengthened during the course of the year with the appointment of
Nick Fisher on the 1st December 2004. Nick is joint Chief Executive of
International Greetings plc, a leading AIM listed company and brings
with him a wealth of experience in both corporate and related industry
sectors. His experience is complementary to that of Roger Putnam,
Chairman of Ford of Britain.
The Board would like to thank all employees for their contribution
during the last twelve months in assisting the management to achieve
these results.
Summary 
The Group has begun the new financial year actively looking at
opportunities to enhance performance further following the
completion of the acquisition of Redworth, and its trading subsidiary
Music Box Leisure Limited. A strategic review has identified 
operational savings in several areas and opportunities that exist
through the increased exploitation of product and the expansion of 
the customer base. 
While the retail sector in general terms is experiencing some
difficulties, the Directors believe the sector in which the 
Group operates can continue to provide growth opportunities for
existing products.
The current policy is to address aggressively areas identified in the
strategic review as a prime objective. The Group will, however,
continue to examine any acquisition opportunities that could further
enhance the development of the Group.

FULLY EXPLOITING THE SYNERGIES WITHIN OUR BUSINESS
We are constantly seeking new ways to exploit the wealth of our catalogue and to
innovate in areas of packaging and presentation.
Music Box Leisure operates from a 100,000 square feet distribution centre. They
supply CD, DVD and software to customers. 
Music Box Leisure has a large established UK customer base which can now benefit
from the full Air Music & Media product catalogue. 
There are also great opportunities to develop the Music Box Leisure offering in our
international markets. 
We are pro-actively looking to develop new product ranges to suit the enlarged
customer base and to leverage the complementary strengths of our combined
businesses to make all our resources work harder.

Chief Executive’s Report
Introduction 
The year to 31st March 05 has been the most important year in the
Group’s history. The acquisition of Redworth in October with its trading
subsidiaries, principally Music Box Leisure, represents a step change in
the Group’s business, both in terms of size and scale and in the scope
of its operations. The acquisition, which underlines the policy of buy
and build, gives the Group a more vertically integrated operation, which
allows our publishing operations to work with the distribution
operations, in effect managing products from concept to retail store.
Trading Operation
The Group’s trading operations can now broadly be divided into
publishing and distribution. In the publishing division, the principal
trading companies have been Going For A Song and New Sound,
whose product ranges are audio based, Hollywood DVD, video
product based and Legacy Entertainment in Canada, whose
predominant product offering is audio. Each of these operations
currently only sells proprietary published goods and in the majority of
cases these are sold to distributors rather than to retailers. The
distribution operations, principally Music Box Leisure, specialise in
sales direct to retail and their current product offering, which is audio
and visual products, are largely sourced from third parties. 
I am pleased to report that the Music Box Leisure business has
performed well and whilst the contribution to Group in this financial
year has been six months, Music Box Leisure has shown growth in
that period. Throughout the year we have also seen satisfactory
growth in the audio publishing operations, with North America being
particularly strong. The Group’s DVD publishing business however,
has experienced a difficult year. The DVD market in the UK has
matured rapidly, resulting in reduced retail prices of premium and
mid-priced products which are published by the major companies.
This has put pressure on the Group’s budget film offering. As
reported by the Chairman, the Board has taken the view that the
goodwill value carried in respect of the Hollywood acquisition should
be reviewed and this has resulted in a provision for impairment. The
DVD publishing operation is now seeking alternative product
offerings, which will include licensed products from major companies
and more niche offerings including music, special interest subjects
and children’s products. In each of these areas the company is
actively considering opportunities. 
Strategy
The Redworth acquisition raised a number of challenges. I am pleased
to report that management have risen to these and programs which
include integration of systems, sales, distribution and other related
areas are well underway. In terms of management, the principle
directors of Redworth have joined the PLC board.
The completion of the buyout periods on each of the Group’s previous
acquisitions; Hollywood, New Sound and Redworth, has raised the
opportunity for further integration. During the first quarter of the new
financial year, the Group has reorganised the UK publishing
subsidiaries into two principle companies. Air Music & Media Sales will
be responsible for the sales of all group proprietary goods. The
integrated sales force will offer all of the company’s own label goods,
including Going For A Song, New Sound, Hollywood DVD and the Air
label. Air Music & Media Copyrights will be responsible for all Group
copyright activities; both exploitation of the Group’s own material and
licences from third parties. The principal activities of the copyright
company will be the creation and provision of new products for each
of the group’s audio and visual labels and most importantly, the
provision of goods for the Music Box Leisure retail customer base. On
this latter point, copyrights will seek to acquire a far broader range of
licensed rights than previously published by the Group and whilst
remaining firmly risk averse, will nonetheless result in a significantly
broader portfolio of proprietary goods with secured distribution
through Music Box Leisure.

BROADENING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
We are an ideas business. Our success is derived from being able to utilise our vast
library of music and film and find new and innovative ways to repackage it. Whether
producing a tribute to a famous artist or combining artists to produce something 
for a special event or occasion we are able to deliver popular material in new and
interesting ways.
We strive to innovate through packaging design and our artwork and sleeve design are
always a major factor in our retail success. Bundling CDs and DVDs into genre multi-
packs enhances affordability and appeal for customers and encourages them to broaden
their collections. We are always looking to exploit new ways to market our products; a
notable success in the last year has been with newspaper cover mounts and DVD box
sets. A recent film biopic has enhanced Ray Charles’ appeal across the generations, the
Rat Pack have enjoyed a phenomenal renaissance following the reworking of their music
by modern artists and Cuban/Latin music is now rising out of the alternative into the
mainstream. These are just three examples of how Air Group products can be utilised to
maximise opportunities within current trends.

Report of the Directors Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for
each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the company and the group and of the proﬁt or loss of the group
for that period.
In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
state whether applicable accounting standards are followed; make
judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
prepare the ﬁnancial statements on a going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to assume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the company and the group, and enable them to ensure
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company
and the group, and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders of Air Music &
Media Group Plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Air Music & Media Group
Plc for the year ended 31 March 2005 which comprise the Proﬁt and
Loss Account, the Balance Sheets, Cash Flow Statement and related
notes. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken for no purpose other than to draw to the
attention of the company’s members those matters which we are
required to include in an auditors’ report addressed to them. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to any party other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors
As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the
company’s directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Directors’ Report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if the
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information speciﬁed by law regarding the directors’ remuneration
and transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements within it.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a
test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of
the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the company and of the group as at 31 March 2005
and of the loss of the group for the year then ended and have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement continued
For the year ended 31 March 2005 29
1. Principal Accounting Policies
a) Accounting basis and standards
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The accounting policies are unchanged from the previous year except
as disclosed in Note 1m.
b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Air Music & Media
Group Plc and all its subsidiary undertakings up to the balance sheet
date, as detailed in Note 13. The purchase of Redworth Limited has
been accounted for in accordance with acquisition accounting
principles and hence the ﬁnancial statements include the results since
acquisition on 7 October 2004.
c) Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced value of goods sold and services
provided net of value added tax.
d) Depreciation
Depreciation on tangible ﬁxed assets is provided at rates estimated to
write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset, over its
expected useful life, as follows:-
Land and buildings leasehold
– Over the lease term
Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment
– 10%/25%/33.3%/50% straight line
Motor vehicles
– 25%/33.3% straight line
e) Intangible ﬁxed assets and amortisation
Music and ﬁlm production catalogues and rights, associated artwork
and masters are capitalised as intangible ﬁxed assets in the Group
Balance Sheet and are amortised by equal annual amounts over
periods between 3 and 20 years, as appropriate.
f) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised over the
directors’ estimate of their expected useful life after provision made for
any identiﬁed impairment, restricted to 20 years, in accordance with
FRS10.
g) Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
includes all direct costs incurred in bringing the stocks to their present
location and condition.
h) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences
between the recognition of gains and losses in the ﬁnancial statements
and their recognition in the tax computation have been recognised in
full, calculated at a rate at which it is estimated that tax will be payable
in accordance with FRS19. Deferred taxation has not been discounted.
i) Leased assets
Assets held under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts are
capitalised in the Balance Sheet and depreciated over their expected
useful lives. The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to
the Proﬁt and Loss Account over the period of the lease on a straight
line basis.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a
straight line basis over the lease term.
j) Royalties
Royalties are calculated and accounted for on the basis of sales made.
k) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into
Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the ﬁnancial year.
All exchange differences are dealt with in the proﬁt and loss account.
l) Comparative ﬁgures
It is the view of the directors that it better reﬂects the performance of
the group for distribution costs to be disclosed separately in the proﬁt
and loss account and have amended the comparatives accordingly.
The effect has been to reduce the prior year cost of sales by
£466,848, prior year administrative expenses by £404,124 and
disclose distribution costs of £870,972 on the face of the proﬁt and
loss account in the ﬁnancial statements for this year.
m) DVD licence fees
Certain ﬁlm rights held were previously included in current assets
within prepayments and written off as a royalty charge over the
economic life of the right held. In order to more correctly reﬂect the
nature of the assets held these have been transferred to intangible
assets and are being amortised over their economic life. There has
been no effect on proﬁt resulting from this change.
n) Company basis of accounting
The holding company itself is reliant upon continued ﬁnancial support
from its subsidiary undertakings, which, in the opinion of the directors,
will be forthcoming for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the
ﬁnancial statements of the company have been prepared on a going
concern basis.

9. Earnings Per Share
The basic earnings per share is based on the loss after tax of £526,809 (2004: £1,047,076 proﬁt) and the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the year of 281,672,968 2.5p shares (2004: 180,996,181 2.5p shares).
The earnings per share has been fully diluted to take into account the potential shares issuable as deferred consideration on the purchase of
Hollywood DVD Limited and The Original Record Company Limited, and the actual shares issuable as deferred consideration on the purchase of
Redworth Limited and also potentially dilutive shares held under the option agreement. This increased the weighted average number of shares used
in the basic EPS calculation from 281,672,968 to 353,845,319 used in the fully diluted EPS calculation.
Nomalised earnings per share is calculated using the (loss)/proﬁt after tax for the ﬁnancial year, having added back exceptional items and goodwill
amortisation charge over the basic weighted average shares in issue during the year.
10. Loss for the Financial Year

22. Provisions for Liabilities and Charges – Group and Company
Deferred taxation
Provision for deferred taxation has been made in these ﬁnancial statements in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 1.
Included within other debtors is a deferred tax asset of £45,619 (2004: £3,790), arising from depreciation in excess of Capital Allowances taken
by the group. The group have recognised this as the directors believe sufﬁcient future proﬁts will be made to recover this asset.
Company
At the year end, the company did not have any deferred tax assets or liabilities.
23. Capital Commitments
There are no capital commitments at the year end.
24. Financial Instruments
The group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade debtors and trade
creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to provide the working capital for the group’s
operations. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies are reviewed and amended on a regular basis as
the risks to the group change, in particular upon acquisitions into the group.
Interest rate risk
The group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁts and bank borrowings. The group borrows in the desired currencies at both
ﬁxed 3 months in advance and ﬂoating rates of interest. The group’s policy is to review the interest rate exposure on a quarterly basis.
Liquidity risk
As regards liquidity, the group’s policy has, throughout the year, been to ensure continuity of funding by a regular review of projected maximum
available facility against projected utilisation. Short term ﬂexibility is achieved by invoice ﬁnancing facilities.
Foreign currency risk
The group has one signiﬁcant overseas subsidiary – Legacy Entertainment Inc, which operates in Canada and North America and whose revenues
and expenses are denominated in Canadian and US dollars. About one seventh of the sales of the group’s business is to customers outside of the
UK. Those sales are predominantly priced and invoiced in sterling to mitigate the foreign exchange risk. Where sales are priced in local currency
the risk is regularly reviewed and managed by the holding of foreign currency. About one ﬁfth of the group’s purchases are from suppliers
outside of the UK and are not priced in sterling. Forward purchases are made to mitigate the foreign exchange risk.

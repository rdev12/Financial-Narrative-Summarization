and critics from within and
outside the company . We do 
this to maintain our competitive
edge and deliver consistently
outstanding shareholder returns.
Support 
We support employees seeking 
to meet and own challenges. 
We foster teamworking and
knowledge sharing, and 
give our employees the 
tools and training they 
need to do their job well.
Passion for customers 
This value is central to the way

service. We must be able to
anticipate our customers’ needs
and correct any errors promptly .
We must give value for money
and deliver efficient and effective
products and services.

satisfaction of our customers
and from delivering high quality
products and services. We’re
proud of our staff and their
achievements, and we
recognise and reward success.
Trust 
T rust is at the heart of our
relationships with customers.
T rust means doing what we 
say and acting with integrity . 
We demonstrate trust by
respecting and empowering 
our employees. Building trust
will help us develop strong 
future relationships with 
our stakeholders. Centrica plc report 2003 01
Chairman’ s statement
Our continued focus on understanding and providing
what our customers want has helped us to achieve
growth in both revenues and earnings.
Centrica has made steady
progress during 2003 against a
backdrop of uncertain economic
conditions, rising energy prices
and challenging regulatory
issues in some of our markets.
Our continued focus on
understanding and providing
what our customers want, and
our skill in managing the risks of
sourcing the energy to meet their
needs, have helped us to achieve
growth to record levels in both
revenues and earnings.
The development of competitive
markets is important for our
strategy . In 2003 we saw a
continuing commitment to a 
fully transparent energy market
in Britain, with new legislation to
introduce a competitive electricity
trading system in Scotland. In
Europe, the new energy directives
are now in place, and we look
forward to the establishment of 
a properly competitive market.
The regulatory environment in
North America remains varied,
but overall we have continued 
to prosper in our chosen
markets. There has been 
further progress in improving 
the competitive nature of the 
UK telecommunications market,
but there is some way to go
before a level playing field is
firmly established.
In 2003 there were sharp rises 
in UK wholesale prices in both
gas and electricity despite lower
than average consumption due
to warmer weather . The long
term outlook for gas supply in
the UK is improving, with an
increasing diversity of supply
and further links between the 
UK and mainland Europe. It
seems inevitable, however , 
that the increasing costs of
complying with the UK and EU
regulations designed to deliver 
a low carbon economy will
create upward pressure on
consumer electricity prices.
Dividend
The board of directors is
proposing a final dividend of 
3.7 pence per share to be paid 
in June 2004. This means that,
when combined with the interim
dividend of 1.7 pence per share
paid in November 2003, the 
total dividend for 2003 will be 
5.4 pence per share. This total
per share increase of 35%
reflects our continuing
confidence in the outlook for
both cash flow and earnings 
in the medium term.
The board of directors
Sir Brian Shaw retired in May
2003 and we are most grateful
for the part he played in the
development of Centrica. 
It is fitting that he continues to
chair the AA Motoring T rust, an
independent charity supported
by Centrica. Mike Alexander ,
who made a considerable
contribution to the success 
of Centrica, retired from the
company in February 2003. In
December , my own retirement
was announced and my
successor , Roger Carr , subject
to re-election to the board, will
be taking over as chairman at 
the end of the annual general
meeting (AGM) in May .
The future
Centrica has made enormous
progress over the past seven
years, rising from the bottom 
half of the FTSE 100 Index 
to position itself in the top 30
companies in the UK; growing
from our British Gas base
through the acquisition of 
the AA, the movement into
telecommunications and
international expansion. 
I am delighted that we have
established a solid platform 
from which continued delivery 
of our strategy will produce
strong medium term growth.
The commitment and dedication
of our employees have ensured
that 2003 has been another very
successful year for the group
and I would like to thank them 
all for their hard work. I am
confident that, with the 
excellent management team 
led by Sir Roy Gardner , along
with the experience brought 
by Roger Carr as the new
chairman, and the collective
efforts of all our employees, 
the company will continue 
to go from strength to strength.
The commitment and
dedication of our
employees have
ensured that 2003 has
been a very successful
year for the group.

Centrica plc report 2003 03
Every day we touch the lives of millions of people. Through our leading brands,
Centrica provides warmth, comfort and peace of mind. 04 Centrica plc report 2003 
We believe that the fundamental drivers of profitability
within our brand units will continue to improve as we 
broaden and deepen the relationships we have 
with our customers.
Chief executive’ s review
Overall the group delivered a
strong performance in 2003 with
adjusted basic earnings per
share up 11% on 2002. This was
delivered despite the impact of
the second consecutive year of
warm weather which, unusually ,
in 2003 also brought with it higher
commodity costs; both of these
depressed reported margins 
in our gas supply businesses.
However , the underlying
strength of the Centrica 
model with its unique balance 
of upstream and downstream
positions, together with the
positive impact of acquisitions,
has enabled us again to deliver
record profits despite these
adverse external factors.
T urnover and profitability
Group turnover (excluding
Accord trading revenue) was
£11.7 billion in 2003, up 17%
from 2002. Increases were
achieved in all of the main
customer facing businesses as
well as in the industrial and
wholesaling division of the
Centrica Energy Management
Group (CEMG). The highest
growth came from North
America (up 112%) due mainly
to the full year impact of the 2002
acquisitions in T exas. Despite
the unseasonably warm
weather , turnover in British Gas
increased with positive year-on-
year contributions from energy ,
home services and telecoms.
Group operating profit* of
£1,058 million was up 14% 
from £932 million in 2002. 
The lower profits in British 
Gas residential and Centrica
Business Services, due to the
impact of weather and higher
commodity and transportation
costs, were more than offset 
by significant improvements 
in other units, particularly North
America, the AA and CEMG, 
and the full year contribution
from Centrica Storage.
Cash flow, capital expenditure
and acquisitions
Group operating cash flow (from
continuing operations, including
dividends from joint ventures and
associates, before exceptional
payments) was £1,321 million for
2003 compared with £795 million
for 2002. An increase of
£141 million to £1,463 million 
in operating profit* before
depreciation was supplemented
by a decrease in petroleum
revenue tax (PRT) payments of
£109 million and the acceleration
in 2002 of transportation
payments of £168 million.
In 2003 there was a 
considerable reduction 
in acquisition expenditure
compared to the prior year .
Receipts from disposals net of
acquisitions were £292 million
versus net expenditure in 2002
of £935 million. This was
primarily due to the net receipt
on the disposal of Goldfish
Bank, partially offset by both our
purchases of the Roosecote and
Barry power stations, and
deferred consideration on the
2002 acquisition of customers in
T exas. Operating cash outflow
on discontinued activities of
£301 million mainly reflected the
repayment of Goldfish Bank
deposit accounts.
Lower spend in respect of the
business transformation
programme within British Gas
was the main contributor to the
reduction in net capital
expenditure and financial
investment, down £120 million at
£282 million (2002: £402 million).
The group’ s net cash inflow
(before management of liquid
resources and financing) was
£652 million, against a net
outflow of £918 million in 2002.
Outlook
We believe that the fundamental
drivers of profitability within our
customer facing brand units will
continue to improve as we
broaden and deepen the
relationships we have with our
customers through innovative
product offerings and improved
service and targeting. This will
be underpinned by further
investment in our gas and power
asset base.
British Gas is now part way
through its transformation with
the heavy financial investment in
hardware and software having
taken place. We believe this root
and branch reform of systems and
processes will genuinely transform
the customer experience which
is at the heart of the profitability
of the business. We are now
allocating £40 million to the
programme for costs which were
previously in other British Gas
budgets; for example property
costs, post-commissioning
running costs and the cost of
staff back-filling. T ogether with
some additional home services
functionality now specified
(£10 million) we expect the
programme to cost around
£400 million. We have decided
to extend both the pilot and
deployment phase for the cross-
selling technology and are now
around nine months behind the
original timeline; this decision
was taken to ensure the integrity
of the system and to preserve our
customer service levels as we
roll-out to the wider user base.
The delay in implementation is
not expected to materially impact
either costs or benefits from the
programme. The next two years
will be challenging as we put the
remaining elements of the systems
infrastructure in place and the
investment continues in the
wider transformation programme.
The first material net financial
benefits are still expected in 2005
and we retain our 2005 margin
target for British Gas at 8%.
With churn rates within the
British retail energy industry
stabilising, we expect recent
levels of customer losses in gas
and gains in electricity to be
maintained throughout 2004. 
As yet it is too early to assess 
the precise effect of the price rise

in January 2004 aimed at restoring
gross margins to 2002 levels. A
key aim for us will be to build on
our success in 2003 in retaining
in gas, and gaining in electricity ,
a greater proportion of higher
value customers. T o assist the
expansion of the British Gas
brand, early in 2004 we will trial 
a wholesale line rental (WLR)
telecoms solution in the UK
which would allow us to provide
a single bill to customers for 
both line rental and call charges.
This will enhance the customer
experience and give us the
platform we require to 
accelerate the growth of 
British Gas Communications
and so further contribute to
strengthening the relationship
we have with our customers.
With Centrica Business Services
we will seek to consolidate our
position as the leading supplier
of energy products to the
commercial sector in Britain.
Having integrated the
businesses acquired over the
last two years, we are now
concentrating on investing 
to transform the customer
experience, on enhancing 
our ability to react to market
changes and on cross-selling.
We intend to add to our gas and
power asset portfolio in 2004.
We continue to target further
investment of around
£100 million per year in gas
reserves to support our UK
customer demand and we also
intend to increase our equity
hedge in electricity in the UK
with an investment of around
£250 million over the next three
years. 2004 may also bring 
the first material spend on our
renewable generation assets 
as, with successful surveys, we
begin construction of the 90MW
offshore wind farm at Barrow.
We are also actively seeking
further assets in North America,
particularly in T exas, where 
we aim to acquire electricity
generation plant to support 
our retail business.
We have taken measures over
recent years to increase the
deliverability from our gas fields.
While on average, over the
medium term, gas production
from Morecambe will decline by
around 10% per year , we expect
production levels in 2004 to be
similar to 2003.
We have an ongoing programme
of maintenance work on our
Rough storage asset which 
will further improve the
operational performance 
of the asset and reduce the 
risk of material outages. With
this, and the market-driven
movement in the summer/
winter gas price differential, we
expect Rough’ s profitability to
exceed our initial expectations
and to show a marked year-on-
year improvement.
The AA will continue to seek
revenue growth through value-
adding product developments
underpinned by further
improvements in operational
efficiency . We expect to see 
real benefits from the roll-out of
new technology to the roadside
patrols with improved service 
to our customers and reduced
cost-to-serve. An integrated
single customer services
organisation will help to further
deepen the customer relationship
and enhance the cross-selling
opportunities within the AA.
In order to maintain its competitive
position in the UK telecoms
market, One.T el is establishing 
a call centre in India. We expect
this to lower the cost base
significantly while maintaining
the current levels of customer
service. A successful trial in 2004
of a WLR solution will further
enhance the customer experience.
In North America we have
achieved a scale which allows 
us to move steadily forward. 
We will add organically to our
top-line with a concentration 
on value. Alongside this we will
use our new business services
organisation to support our
current retail positions and 
enter new markets, targeting
medium sized enterprises 
with a full range of energy and
related services. We continue to
pursue acquisition opportunities
but, in the current regulatory
environment and given our
concentration on value, these
are likely to be complex and
difficult to execute.
The competitive environment 
is likely to continue to develop 
at different speeds across
Europe in the short term.
However there is a clear 
timeline for deregulation and 
we are well positioned to enter
the available markets at the 
right time and when the right
opportunity appears.
Our progress in 2003 has only
been possible because of the
efforts of our employees. We
recognise that the further growth
of Centrica depends on having
people with appropriate skills
who are committed to the success
of the company . I am pleased
that in 2003 we achieved a very
high response rate to our
employee survey which allows
us to identify the issues and
areas for improvement as we
progress our people strategy .
In summary , our strategy has
always been and remains to
maximise long term value by
deepening our relationships with
customers assisted by sharing
knowledge and best practice
across the company . At the same
time we must achieve a cost of
goods advantage through optimal
upstream procurement. This
strategy and our clear focus on
value delivery , including value-
adding acquisitions when
identified, will enable us to grow
both top-line revenue and,
through improving operational
performance, bottom line earnings
in the medium term. We remain
committed to a financial structure,
including appropriate debt
levels, which best rewards our
shareholders. We expect this to
include, in 2004, another significant
step towards our targeted
dividend payout ratio of 40%.

Operating and financial review
British Gas residential
Adverse external factors
mask strong underlying
fundamentals
In a challenging year for the retail
energy industry in Britain with
the impacts of warm weather
unusually coupled with rises in
commodity costs, British Gas
increased its turnover by 2.4%
to £6.2 billion (2002: £6.0 billion).
This was due to an increase 
in our electricity market share,
higher energy pricing and
continued growth in our 
home services business.
However , operating profit* 
was down 16% at £206 million
(2002: £244 million). The main
elements of this year-on-year 
fall were the impact of a
£54 million National
T ransmission System (NTS)
credit in 2002 and a significant
increase in commodity and
transportation costs in the
second half of 2003.
T ransportation costs for British
Gas increased by around 5% 
in 2003 as T ransco made up 
for a cost under-recovery in 
2002 when lower gas volumes
were transported as a result 
of the warm weather . We also
made further investments of
£61 million (2002: £38 million) 
to meet our obligations under
the government’ s Energy
Efficiency Commitment and
£32 million (2002: £22 million) 
on our engineer training
academy to increase our
engineer numbers to meet 
the projected demand for 
energy related services.
Correspondingly , the number 
of training centres and
partnerships with further
education establishments has
now increased to 13 across the
country with 1,267 engineers
currently in training.
The British Gas transformation
programme to deliver improved
customer service has continued
to progress in 2003 across 
the areas of data, processes,
systems and people. The
transformation impacts every
area of the business and 
will deliver a ‘one stop shop’
experience for our customers,
where a single customer 
service agent will be able to deal
with all of their enquiries. 
The customer relationship
management infrastructure 
has now been rolled out to 
9,700 staff, enabling them 
to have a single view of the
customer and giving them the 
ability to serve customers
appropriately . This insight 
will in turn create a different 
and enhanced customer
experience. For integrated
cross-selling functionality , we
have extended the testing period
between pilot and full ramp-up
to ensure system integrity
throughout. As a consequence,
we will now be testing the billing
engine in the second half of
2004, with full roll-out by early
2006. During 2003 we incurred
£11 million in revenue costs and
£67 million in capitalised costs
(cumulative spend to the end of
2003, £325 million).
During 2003, British Gas
launched a significant culture
change programme entitled
‘Doing the Right Thing’ 
designed to enhance customer
service performance and to
embed new ways of working 
to derive maximum benefits
from the investment in business
transformation. The initiative 
has been embraced by staff
across British Gas. It has also
formed the creative focus of the 
updated British Gas branding
and become the strapline of 
a highly successful marketing
campaign. Following our 
online billing television
advertisement, the British Gas
website, house.co.uk, saw an
increase in unique visitors from
140,000 to 203,000 per week.
Energy
During 2003 we continued to
focus on the value we derive
from our customer relationships
rather than simply on the
number of customers we supply .
This involved greater emphasis
on investing to retain customers.
Our analysis shows that
retention is enhanced by 
higher product holdings and
improved customer service.
Churn rates have fallen in both
fuels with gas churn down to
10% (2002: 13%) and electricity
down to 16% (2002: 23%).

The net result of this was that 
we increased our energy
customer relationships in 2003
by 145,000 against a loss of
191,000 in 2002 while spending
£30 million less on acquisition
activities. In 2003 our ability 
to target more accurately our
sales activity resulted in higher
conversion rates and an
increase in product holdings 
per customer to 1.62 from 1.53.
As part of our drive to reduce
cost-to-serve, almost 130,000
customers have now signed 
up for online e-bills since the
launch of paperless billing 
in May 2003.
Putting the customer at the 
heart of the business has 
seen improved service delivery .
This year British Gas was voted
the best gas supplier in the 
UK for customer satisfaction 
in the annual survey by research
firm JD Power & Associates. 
The quality of acquisition
processes has also improved 
as we have implemented
customer needs-based
targeting and a sales code 
of practice. Our commitment 
to stamping out incidents of 
mis-selling has yielded
significant further progress 
in reducing the number of
complaints about British Gas
sales practice reported to
energywatch. British Gas is 
also leading industry-wide 
work, supported by Ofgem 
and energywatch, to simplify 
the transfer processes,
particularly in the electricity
market, which will further
improve the customer
experience. By the end of 2003
energywatch figures showed
complaints about our selling
practices at just 38% of the 
level they were in April 2002 
with complaints about the
transfer process down 49% 
over the same time period.
Average gas consumption 
in 2003 was in line with 2002 
with similarly warm temperatures
through the year . However , 
the 2002 T ransco recovery 
and differing weather patterns,
along with a consequent lower
payout from our weather
hedging activities, led to 
a reduction in gross margin 
of £32 million. 
Energy gross margin was 
also impacted by increased
commodity cost. Wholesale
market prices in gas and
electricity increased by
approximately 15% in 2003. 
The full impact of commodity
cost increases, particularly 
in the second half, was not
anticipated and therefore 
was not recovered from
customers in 2003 in the 2.5%
price rise in April. The 5.9% 
price rise from 10 January 2004
(1 March 2004 for prepayment
customers) reflects the
commodity cost increases
experienced late in 2003.
Home services
British Gas home services
reported strong growth in 
2003 with turnover increasing 
by 4.6% to £847 million 
(2002: £810 million). Operating
profit* increased by 38% to
£84 million (2002: £61 million)
with full year operating margins
up over two percentage points 
at 10%. Our continuing 
growth in the home services
market is an indication of the
trust in and strength of the 
British Gas brand. One in 
four homes in Britain with 
gas central heating now has 
a service contract with British
Gas while the newer products 
of home electrical care, 
kitchen appliance care and
plumbing and drains care
continued to grow rapidly ,
displaying our ability to
understand and service
customer requirements. 
Our central heating installations
activity was down in 2003 with
the number of installations 
lower by 16% and turnover
down by 12% at £228 million
(2002: £260 million) due to a
contraction in the overall market.
We see home services as a
unique and growing opportunity
to increase profitability , 
improve customer service 
and strengthen the brand
attributes differentiating 
British Gas from our
competitors. Home services
products continue to have 
a positive impact on the
retention of energy customers.
We are targeting significant
growth in our share of the 
home services market and
therefore have continued to
increase our staff numbers
throughout 2003 with the 
total number of qualified
engineers growing by 955 
to 7,160.

Operating and financial review continued
we have intentionally acquired
fewer customers this year 
and focused on significantly
reducing customer churn. 
This has reduced by nine
percentage points driven
primarily by the promotion 
of the enhanced carrier 
pre-selection (CPS) product 
that was introduced in July 
2002. Ninety-one per cent 
of our fixed line customer base 
is now on CPS. These actions
have significantly reduced the
operating loss of the business 
to £14 million (2002: £35 million).
Centrica Business Services
Consolidating our leading
supply position in the
commercial sector
Centrica Business Services
continues to consolidate and
improve its position as the
number one supplier of energy to
the commercial sector in Britain,
measured by supply points, with
an overall market share of 29%
(2002: 27%). As with the
residential business, 2003 has
proved a challenging year .
T urnover was up by 16% at 
£1.1 billion due to the full year
effect of the Electricity Direct
(ED) acquisition and growth of
the electricity customer base.
Operating profit* fell to
£51 million (2002: £65 million), 
hit mainly by warmer than
average weather which 
lowered gas consumption 
and a higher than forecast 
rise in wholesale prices. 
The business also expensed
£5 million of integration costs 
for ED and £4 million in the
overhaul of customer systems
and processes. The £6 million
one-off NTS credit received in
2002 was more than matched 
by the full year effect of £7 million
from the ED acquisition.
Improving customer service
continues to be a major 
initiative. In total we expect
investment here to be £40 million
over three years. The intention 
is to rationalise the disparate
systems the business has
inherited and so enhance
service levels, lower cost-
to-serve and lower costs 
to acquire new product
relationships. Roll-out of 
new systems to the business 
will commence in 2005.
Centrica Energy
Management Group
Further well timed
investments made in power
generation and renewables
CEMG continued to apply its
assets and skills to minimise
input costs for the downstream
businesses whilst at the same
time delivering steady upstream
revenues against a backdrop of
warmer than average weather
and volatile commodity prices.
Operating profit for 2003 was 
up by 8% to £561 million.
Gas production
Despite a 4% reduction in
production volumes year -on-year ,
upstream gas profits increased
by 7% to £480 million. The impact
of reduced volumes was offset
by a 4% increase in average
selling prices and lower operating
costs due to the full year effect 
of the abolition of royalties on
offshore gas production net of
the additional PRT charge.
An extremely successful
reperforation campaign in our
South Morecambe field has
increased daily deliverability
from four wells by an average 
of 15%. Plans are in place 
to reperforate a further 10 
wells in the North and South
Morecambe fields which 
would increase deliverability 
and therefore medium term
production flexibility . After
completing the acquisition 
of the remaining 60% of Rose
field, development progressed
more rapidly than originally
anticipated, bringing first gas 
on stream in January 2004.
We also secured a contract to
develop and operate a new 
gas reception terminal at
Easington, which will land gas
from Norway’ s Ormen Lange
field. First gas through the
terminal is expected in 2006. 
The project will make more
efficient use of the Easington

As announced in January 2004,
we reached agreement to
acquire a further 280 million
therms of gas reserves with the
acquisition of interests in the
Orwell and Statfjord fields for
£60.7 million. The agreement
included nine million barrels 
of oil reserves which will 
produce a revenue stream 
and act as a valuable hedge 
to our exposure to gas 
contracts linked to oil prices.
Industrial sales and
wholesaling
Sales volumes were up by 7%
against 2002 due to increased
wholesaling activity . As with
2002, warm weather depressed
consumption in our retailing
businesses, allowing profitable
sales of excess contracted 
gas into the wholesale market,
particularly in the first half of the
year . However , operating 
profits were down by 11% at
£64 million due to a number 
of one-off costs including an
adjusting payment of £10 million
related to prior year charges 
for a wholesale electricity
purchase contract. 
Electricity generation
In April, we acquired the 229MW
Roosecote plant in Barrow 
and, in July , the 240MW Barry
plant in South Wales, taking 
our total equity generation
capacity to 2,174MW . T otal
electricity generated in the 
year was 8.7TWh (21% of our
downstream requirements) 
with the stations running on
average, for the portion of the
year they were in the portfolio, 
at a load factor of 59%.
Renewables
In the supply year April 2002 
to March 2003, Centrica 
fulfilled its obligation to source
3% of all electricity supplied
from renewable sources through
the purchase of certificates and
is on track to meet the target of
4.3% for the current supply year .
T o meet the Government’ s
renewable power generation
target, Centrica announced 
an investment programme 
of £500 million over the next 
five years, working alongside
joint venture partners. In 2003,
investments included the joint
venture with DONG and Statkraft
to build a 90MW wind farm
offshore at Barrow-in-Furness;
and the acquisition of the Inner
Dowsing and Lynn offshore 
wind farm developments in 
the Greater Wash area (with a
combined generation potential
of at least 180MW). Centrica 
was also successful in acquiring
sufficient Round 2 licences to
give the flexibility to build up to 
a further 1,250MW of offshore
wind capacity .
Accord
Despite the anticipated tough
trading environment with fewer
counterparties participating,
Accord made an operating profit
of £17 million in 2003, £13 million
of which came in the first half. 
In the second half, Accord
experienced reduced gas
trading profits due to the 
severe unplanned restrictions 
in gas flow through the
continental interconnector and
field closures in the UK North
Sea. Physical volumes traded
during 2003 were equal to 2.7
times the gas and 3.4 times the
electricity volumes supplied to
our UK downstream customers
(2002: 1.4 times and 2.2 times,
respectively), and reflected
increased activity in Europe to
support our retail operations in
Belgium and Spain.
Centrica Storage
On 18 December the Secretary
of State gave final clearance to
Centrica’ s acquisition of the
Rough storage field and
associated assets, with the
behavioural undertakings
offered addressing all
competition concerns. This
removal of any remaining
uncertainty allowed the 
forward selling of storage
services to recommence.
Operational difficulties in the 
first half were resolved and 
the field experienced no 
major outages during the
second half of the year . The
We have gas interests in both the North and 
Irish Seas.

The AA
Strong growth in AA core
business leading to 27%
increase in operating profit*
In 2003 the AA delivered strong
growth in the profitability of its
core roadside and personal
finance operations and
continued its investment 
in technology , infrastructure 
and training. Overall, turnover
grew 4.9% to £797 million and
operating profit* increased 
by 27% to £93 million.
The ‘Just AAsk’ marketing
campaign has continued to
focus consumer attention on 
the breadth of the AA ’ s product
range. Latest research shows
that prompted recognition of 
the ‘Just AAsk’ logo is now at 
an all-time high of 86%. 
The campaign, which began 
in May 2002, was recognised 
by the UK’ s marketing industry
at the Marketing Week
Effectiveness Awards 2003.
We have reorganised our 
internal operations by bringing
together all of the core sales 
and customer service teams
under one umbrella through 
the creation of a new customer
services organisation. This 
new structure will improve 
our customer service through
multi-skilling and integrated
management focus and
standardise processes 
across our sites. Creating 
a single customer services 
team will also enable us to 
build upon our successes in
cross-selling. By the end of 
2003 the average product
holdings per customer had
increased to 1.31 (2002: 1.23).
Our website, theaa.com,
continues to be developed and
the number of website visits
increased by 45% to 31 million,
with a high demand for online
routes and maps. This increase
in visits led to record online sales
figures for personal loans, up
year-on-year from 8,647 to
16,452, and membership sales,
up from 61,677 to 79,507.
AA roadside services
T urnover increased by 3% to
£492 million due to growth in 
the business services market
and an increase in personal
membership income. The
continued drive towards
increasing customer value 
rather than volume growth 
led to an increase in operating 
profit* of 13% to £61 million.
Further measures to contain 
the cost base, including the
closure of loss making sales
channels, together with
increasing productivity ,
improved the operating 
margin to 12% (2002: 10%).
AA business services won 
the contract to provide
breakdown assistance to 
the 365,000-strong fleet 
of new and used Volkswagen
vehicles, and recruited
additional dedicated patrols 
to service this contract.
Investment in roadside
assistance continued with 
all patrols now equipped 
with specialised all weather
portable computer systems 
with fault diagnostic capability ,
which will enhance patrols’
ability to fix faults at the
roadside. Called VIxEN, 
the laptop computer also
provides AA patrols with GPRS
communications functionality
which enables more efficient
deployment and better
management of call to arrive
times. In November 2003, 
VIxEN was recognised by 
the automotive industry

Idea of the Y ear Award.
The AA won the annual JD
Power & Associates UK
Roadside Assistance Study
award for customer satisfaction
for the second successive year
and for the fourth time in the six
years it has been awarded.
AA personal finance
T urnover increased by 8% to
£186 million (2002: £172 million).
Although motor insurance
premiums fell year-on-year ,
improved customer targeting
and more competitive products
enabled the business to 
increase operating profit* by 6%
to £50 million (2002: £47 million).
The total value of personal
finance advances reached
£1 billion for the first time
following the continued 
success of the AA personal 
loan and development of the
new AA Visa card, which broke
even a year ahead of schedule.
The year closed with a portfolio
of 160,000 loans (2002:
123,000); 20% of new AA 
loans were sold online in 2003.
The value of motor and home
insurance commissions grew 
by 1% despite a 2% reduction 
in the average annual premium,
driven mainly by the cyclical
nature of pricing conditions in
the motor insurance industry .
This was achieved through a
major differentiating service
initiative, ‘Keeping the 
Customer Mobile’, launched 
in March. In December this
mobility initiative was
recognised by the insurance
industry with the Insurance
Times Award for innovation 
of the year . This and other
initiatives resulted in a record
renewal rate of 82% (2002: 78%).
The growing success of the 
AA ’ s specialist insurance
service, AA Select, was
recognised by the British
Insurance Brokers Association
(BIBA), which represents 
around 2,500 UK brokers, 
in 2003. BIBA has agreed that
any member company unable 
to provide a competitive quote
for non-standard insurance will
refer the caller to AA Select.
The innovative parts and 
labour product, where AA
members are covered for the
cost of breakdown repairs, 
has continued its rapid take-up
rate. By the end of the year the
total number sold had reached
214,000 (2002: 114,000). 
All of these sales have been 
as a result of cross-selling 
to current AA members.
Relaunched on 1 January 2003,
the AA ’ s innovative and flexible
travel insurance products have
achieved record sales during 
the year despite a flat overseas
tourism market. Sales of single
trip cover are up 78% and
annual multi-trip cover is 
up 76%.
Other AA services
The AA Service Centres made 
an operating loss* of £20 million
(2002: £15 million). We have
continued to take actions to
reduce the losses, including 
a staff redeployment
programme which has 
reduced the operating cost
base. There are a number of 
new initiatives in place aimed 
at growing the customer 
base in order to build on the
year-on-year turnover 
increase of 10%.
AA T yre Fit, the mobile tyre 
fitting business acquired last
year , made an operating loss* 
of £7 million, although turnover
has increased by £6 million
following the expansion of 
the fleet from 50 vans to 
170 to provide nationwide
coverage. AA T yre Fit is the 
UK’ s first all-mobile retail 
tyre network.
Operating profit* in the driving
school more than doubled 
over 2002 as pupil and 
instructor numbers reached
record levels. Publishing, 
car data check and roadside
signs also made positive
contributions. In the Republic 
of Ireland, the AA nearly 
doubled its profits to £3 million,
due to growth in both insurance
and roadside assistance,
remaining the leading 
roadside assistance provider
and personal insurance
intermediary in the country .
One.Tel
Operating profits double with
continued brand investment
For One.T el, 2003 has been a
year of continued development
and growth. We have maintained
our focus on developing new
products and internal processes
that offer a best total cost
solution to our customers, 
whilst lobbying for regulatory
improvements to enable the
enhancement of CPS and the
delivery of WLR to encourage
open competition.
In 2003 turnover grew by 16% to
£178 million (2002: £153 million),
as a result of the growth in
customer numbers along with 
an increase in the average
products per customer to 
1.29 (2002: 1.21). Fixed line
monthly average revenue per
user (ARPU) has declined
slightly year-on-year to £16.18 
(2002: £16.20), as a result of
significant competition-related
price reductions, especially in
international and national rates.
However , the further uptake 
of CPS has enabled us largely 
to offset these price reductions.
Thirty-seven per cent of the fixed
line customer base is now on
CPS tariffs with the ARPU on
these tariffs being more than
35% higher than non-CPS
tariffs. The average minutes of
use per month increased by
21% to 345 minutes and, as a
result of product enhancements 
and service improvements, 
fixed line churn levels declined
by seven percentage points 
year-on-year. 
Our variable gross margin was
sustained as we continue to
leverage our least-cost routing
capability and negotiate
favourable transmission rates
with our carriers. We further
developed our switched 
reseller model, entering into 
an agreement with Cable &
Wireless in the third quarter 
Specialised computer systems enable our patrols
to fix more breakdowns at the side of the road.
The AA now has an integrated customer 
services team.

Operating and financial review continued 
to carry our local and national
traffic over their network, 
thereby freeing up capacity 
on our switches whilst retaining
our multiple arrangements 
with other carriers.
Operating profit* for 2003 
was £4 million, double that of
2002 (£2 million). Investment 
in our brand campaign has
increased by £1.7 million to
£3.6 million as we highlighted
the comprehensive range of
telecommunications services
available from One.T el.
Compared to the end of 2002,
when we had one call-inclusive
package, we now offer a
complete range of fixed line,
mobile and internet tariffs
addressing the many varied
needs of customers in today’ s
market. In addition, since the
deregulation of the directory
enquiries market in August 2003,
we have provided a free, brand
differentiating, directory
enquiries service to our
customers. Acquisition costs
were up 31% at £29 million
supporting a 13% growth in 
the customer base. This reflects
the higher costs of acquiring
customers, associated with
offering a greater range of
products through a wider 
array of distribution channels, 
as well as a full year of mobile
acquisition costs. Our mobile
base continues to grow steadily ,
reaching 73,000 customers at
the end of 2003 with the new 
call and text inclusive tariffs
(launched in March 2003)
successfully attracting high
value customers.
Since February 2003, all our
customers (including the
broadband customers acquired
from Iomart in 2001) have been
on our single customer care 
and billing system, enabling 
us to offer an integrated service
to our customers with all their
One.T el services summarised 
on one bill. In 2003 there was
significant progress in the
industry debate around WLR
deregulation, and we, along 
with other market entrants, 
will trial a WLR product in 
early 2004, enabling our
customers to benefit from 
a single relationship for all 
their telecommunications
requirements. Following the
success of a pilot in 2003, in
January 2004 we announced 
the setting up of a call centre 
in Bangalore, which will lower
One.T el’ s cost base.
Centrica North America
Operating profits more than
double that of 2002
We have continued to expand
and develop our presence in
North America despite the
challenging business and
regulatory environments. 
In 2003, we successfully
integrated and rationalised 
the businesses acquired in 
2002 and improved their
profitability by renewing or
acquiring only customers 
who create value. In 2003
operating profit* increased 
by 106% to £130 million 
(2002: £63 million), after
£10 million of costs relating 
to our exit from Pennsylvania
home services, the entry into
Alberta and adverse foreign
exchange movements. 
This reflected strong
performances in our 
electricity markets, especially 
in T exas where the full year
impact of the acquisition
exceeded expectations.
Residential and small
commercial gas
T urnover increased by 9% over
2002 reflecting the colder winter ,
together with revenues from
approximately 300,000
customers acquired in 2002.
Higher wholesale gas costs 
in the second half lowered
margins on renewing customers
and contributed to a reduction 
in operating profit* to £1 million
(2002: £16 million). In addition,
we increased our investment 
in brand building and
experienced increased costs 
of customer renewals in Ontario
associated with regulatory
changes which significantly
affected customer renewals 
in the prime mid-year renewal
period. Our intensive efforts
brought about favourable
changes to the regulations in
June and resulted in renewal
rates rising and the costs of
renewals falling late in the year .
The second half performance
reflected the seasonal weighting
of sales volumes towards the
first half against a much flatter
profile of operating costs.
In our US gas markets, the
regulatory climate, together 
with a volatile gas price
environment, has continued 
to make it difficult to add value-
creating customers. We will
participate only in markets that
offer an appropriate return on
capital and accordingly we
announced our withdrawal 
from Georgia and Maryland.
In the first half we re-evaluated
the returns achievable on our
original investment in Energy
America in the light of the 
current regulatory and 
business environments and
increased the amortisation
charge by £12 million in 
respect of part of the goodwill
and shortened the life over
which the remaining goodwill 
is to be amortised.

*Including joint ventures and associates, before goodwill amortisation. Centrica plc report 2003 13
Residential and small
commercial electricity
T urnover and operating profit*
increased sharply , reflecting 
the full year contribution and
performance of our recently
acquired businesses in T exas
and a full year of Ontario
electricity sales. Owing to the
high electricity consumption 
per customer in T exas, overall
average consumption rose
by 56%. 
Our T exas customers fall into
two categories. For those 
in West and South T exas,
acquired at the end of 2002,
energy prices were increased 
in March by an average of 17%
under the Price to Beat (PTB)
mechanism, allowing us to
maintain target margins 
despite a sharp increase 
in gas costs, a key driver 
of power prices. Customer
numbers have reduced by 
10% in this category as
expected in a PTB environment,
which is designed to encourage
competition by inhibiting
incumbent suppliers from
competing on price before
1 January 2005. In the second
category , we continue to build
an organic electricity business,
now under the Direct Energy
brand name, principally in 
the Houston and Dallas/
Fort Worth areas. Customer
numbers grew year-on-year 
by 59% and our focus on value
has raised average annual
consumption per customer 
from 98% to 121% of the 
overall T exas average and
significantly reduced bad 
debt levels.
The Ontario electricity market 
for residential and small
commercial customers 
remains effectively closed 
to further growth under the 
price cap introduced in
November 2002.
Customer churn has reduced
and our margins remain 
strong but it has not been
possible to acquire new
customers in the price cap
environment. The new
government recently 
announced its intention to
increase the level of the price
cap from 1 May 2004 and that
the provincial regulator , the
Ontario Energy Board, will 
take back the responsibility 
for setting retail power rates 
by 1 May 2005.
Home and business services
T urnover and operating profit*
improved with the benefits of
increases in customer numbers
and margins being partially
offset by investment in customer
service and capacity expansion.
We rebranded the Enbridge
Services Inc business acquired
in May 2002 as Direct Energy
Essential Home Services 
and Direct Energy Business
Services, and focused on driving
efficiency and growth using our
experience in the British Gas
home services business.
Integration of our home 
services and retail energy
businesses in Ontario enables
us to leverage cross-selling
opportunities. Customer
numbers in the core heating 
and cooling protection 
products increased by 16% 
to over 390,000.
During 2003, the formation 
of a new business services
group enabled us to market
energy and services to 
medium sized commercial 
and industrial customers. 
Early signs are encouraging 
with several large contracts
already signed. This will be an
area of particular focus for 2004.
In February 2003 we reduced
our holding in the Consumers’
Waterheater Income Fund 
from 41.9% to 19.9%, realising
further proceeds of £46 million 
in addition to the £304 million
raised in 2002. We continue 
to account for the earnings,
assets and liabilities of the 
fund on a fully consolidated
basis as required under FRS 5.
At the end of 2003, we
announced the closure of the
remaining nine retail stores 
in Ontario with a £16 million
exceptional pre-tax charge
taken on closure.
Upstream activities
Gas production volumes
declined marginally with 
a successful new well

Operating and financial review continued

in market price, our average 
gas selling prices reduced by
4% compared with the same
period in 2002 following the
expiry of favourably priced
forward sales contracts in
November 2002. T ogether 
with higher royalty charges, 
this had a significant dampening
effect on operating profit*.
Europe
Well positioned as European
supply market deregulates
In Belgium, the residential gas
and electricity market in
Flanders opened fully for
competition on 1 July 2003.
Centrica’ s joint venture,
Luminus, successfully switched
across its 800,000 customers
(approximately 600,000
electricity and 200,000 gas).
Luminus is the clear number 
two in the Flanders market
which is already beginning 
to see increasing competition 
as new entrants respond to the
market opening. Luminus had 
a turnover of £362 million and
produced a positive contribution
in the year . The Walloon and
Brussels markets will open, on 
a phased basis, from July 2004
to July 2007 , at which point the
residential markets will be fully
open to competition.
Centrica entered the Spanish
energy market under the Luseo
Energía brand and has been
actively acquiring commercial
electricity customers organically
since the launch in June 2003.
Reaction has been promising
and we are gaining some
valuable insights into the
operation of the market.
The European energy directives
are now in place and are being
implemented. The pace of 
actual market opening will vary
across Europe but we are well
positioned to take advantage 
of opportunities as they emerge.
Discontinued business
On 1 August Centrica
announced that Goldfish Bank
Ltd had agreed to sell its 
credit card and personal 
loan business to Lloyds TSB, 
the joint venture partner , for a
premium of £112.5 million above
the receivables book value. 
The sale included the brand, 
the loyalty programme and the
associated business assets.
This transaction was completed
on 30 September 2003.
The Goldfish credit card and 
its associated loyalty scheme
were originally developed as 
a customer retention initiative
within the group’ s energy supply
business. Since then Centrica
has retained its position as
Britain’ s leading household 
gas supplier and transformed
itself into the leading domestic
electricity supplier . With around
41% of the overall household
energy market the strategic
significance of Goldfish 
was reduced. The capital
commitment required to 
grow real scale in the near 
term, coupled with an attractive
offer for the business from
Lloyds TSB, meant that disposal
of its share of the business 
was in the best interests of
Centrica shareholders.
The operating loss* up to the
September 2003 disposal 
was £27 million. The transaction
triggered a pre-tax exceptional
loss on disposal of £51 million,
which after tax and minority
interests, amounted to a net 
loss of £43 million.
With the full opening of the market in July , Luminus
is now supplying gas and electricity in Belgium.

Group financial review
Centrica’ s aim is to achieve a
total shareholder return (TSR)
ranking in the first quartile of UK
FTSE 100 companies, taking
account of share price growth
and dividends received and
reinvested over a sustained
period. Centrica promotes
continuing growth in earnings
and cash flow and seeks to
maximise the return on capital 
it achieves in excess of its cost 
of capital, within a prudent 
risk management framework.
The remuneration report on
pages 29 to 36 summarises our
TSR performance over recent
years against our comparator
FTSE 100 group.
The group’ s closing share price
on 31 December 2003 was
211 pence (31 December 2002:
171 pence), resulting in a market
capitalisation of £9.0 billion
(2002: £7.3 billion). World stock
markets recovered somewhat 
in 2003 with the FTSE 100 Index
rising by over 13%. The group’ s
share price outperformed the
FTSE 100 by 9.8% (2002: 3.1%).
Since demerger in February
1997, Centrica’ s share price 
has outperformed the FTSE 100
Index by 221%.
Earnings
Earnings increased by
£22 million to £500 million in
2003. This reflected improved
operating profit* up £126 million,
offset by taxation up from
£250 million to £266 million and
higher goodwill amortisation, 
up by £38 million to £161 million.
Earnings before exceptional
charges and goodwill
amortisation were up 12% to
£714 million. This represents 
a return on capital employed
over the year of nearly 28% 
or 8.8% on our average 
market capitalisation.
Operating profit
Operating profit* increased to
£1,058 million from £932 million
in 2002, benefiting from a full
year of profits from our 2002
acquisitions in North America.
Exceptional charges and
goodwill amortisation
During the year , non-operating
exceptional charges of
£51 million net of tax arose
(2002: £26 million non-operating
exceptionals net of tax). These
related to the closure of our retail
outlets in Ontario and the disposal
of the Goldfish credit card and
loan business for a premium of
£112.5 million. T ogether these
resulted in a pre-tax non-
operating loss of £67 million,
related tax credits of £16 million
and a minority interest charge of
£2 million. The group’ s goodwill
amortisation charge for the year
increased to £161 million from
£123 million in 2002, mainly as a
result of our recent acquisitions
in North America.
Net interest
Net interest charged to the 
profit and loss account was
£52 million compared with
£62 million in 2002 and was
covered 20 times by operating
profit* compared with 15 times 
a year earlier . The reduction in
interest payable was due to
lower average indebtedness
mainly as a result of a reduction
in spending on fixed assets and
acquisitions, and improved
working capital management.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year 
on profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional
charges of £282 million for 2003
represented a 28% rate on
profits* (2002 comparative rate
28%). The overall charge is less
than the UK 30% statutory rate,
primarily due to the utilisation 
of tax losses in the year .
Earnings per share
and dividends
Basic earnings per share grew
from 11.4 pence to 11.8 pence
and adjusted earnings per share
from 15.2 pence to 16.8 pence.
Over the last three years the
adjusted earnings per share has
grown by a compound annual
average of over 18%, facilitating
a progressive dividend policy. 
We are proposing a final dividend
of 3.7 pence giving a total of 
5.4 pence (2002: 4.0 pence), 
an increase of 35%.
Cash flow
Group operating cash flow 
from continuing operations
(including dividends from joint
ventures and associates, 
before exceptional payments)
was £1,321 million for 2003,
compared with £795 million 
in 2002. The improvement
resulted from an increase of
£123 million in operating profit*
(from continuing operations
before depreciation and
amortisation of investments), 
as well as improvements in
working capital management.
We aim to grow our earnings and cash flow within a
prudent risk management framework. During the year 
our share price outperformed the market by nearly 10%
and since demerger in February 1997 we have
outperformed the index by 221%.
*Including joint ventures and associates, before goodwill amortisation. 16 Centrica plc report 2003 
Group financial review continued
Group operating cash outflow
from discontinued operations
was £301 million, compared 
to an outflow in 2002 of £5 million.
T otal capital expenditure was
£323 million this year , down 
from £449 million in 2002. 
This includes £72 million 
(2002: £180 million) of costs
capitalised for information
technology investments
associated with our new
customer relationship
management (CRM)
infrastructure. Proceeds 
from disposals of £409 million
(2002: £54 million) included
receipts on disposal of the
Goldfish credit card and loan
business, net of the repayment
of the working capital facility .
Acquisition expenditures of
£117 million (2002: £989 million,
net of cash and overdrafts
acquired) consisted primarily 
of our purchases of Roosecote
and Barry power stations in the
UK, as well as the payment of
deferred consideration on 2002
acquisitions. The group’ s net
cash inflow before management
of liquid resources and financing
was, as a result, £652 million,
against a net outflow of
£918 million in 2002.
Consolidated balance sheet
The net assets of the group
increased during the year from
£2,402 million to £2,754 million.
Fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets of
£1,614 million (2002:
£1,813 million) represented
goodwill that has arisen on
acquisitions. During the year , 
a further £44 million arose, 
£40 million of which resulted
from the final determination of
the fair values of 2002
acquisitions. Goodwill is
amortised by way of charges
against profits over periods
ranging from 5 to 20 years.
T angible fixed assets, mainly
comprising gas field assets 
and power stations, had a net
book value of £2,730 million
(2002: £2,763 million). During 
the year gas field assets and
power stations were acquired 
for £85 million. At the year end,
the net proven and probable 
gas reserves represented by 
our field interests amounted 
to 2,611 billion cubic feet (bcf)
(2002: 2,846 bcf), which
included 351 bcf (2002: 404 bcf)
in North America. At the year
end, hardware and software
costs relating to our major
investments in CRM had a 
net book value of £297 million
(2002: £237 million).
The group’ s investment in 
joint ventures was £94 million
(2002: £74 million), comprising
its share of gross assets of
£1,014 million and share of 
gross liabilities of £920 million.
The group’ s share of net debt in
joint ventures was £788 million.
These investments related
principally to the group’ s 60%
interest in Humber Power
Limited, its 50% interest in the
AA ’ s joint ventures with HBOS
and 50% of Luminus NV .
Working capital
Current assets less current
liabilities, excluding net
indebtedness, amounted to 
a deficit of £487 million (2002:
deficit of £243 million excluding
Goldfish balances). The increase
is attributable largely to tax and
to the final dividend payable in
June 2004.
Net debt
The group’ s cash balances
reversed from a net debt
position of £529 million at
31 December 2002 (excluding
the Goldfish facility and the 
Consumers’ Waterheater
Income Fund (non-recourse)
debt) to a net cash position at
31 December 2003 of
£163 million (excluding
£216 million of non-recourse
debt). Money market
investments increased by
£672 million to £992 million.
Provisions and other creditors
due after more than one year
Provisions and other creditors
due after more than one 
year decreased during the 
year to £1,164 million (2002:
£1,384 million), mainly due 
to decreases in deferred
petroleum revenue tax and
pension and other retirement
benefit provisions.
Financial risk management
The board has established
objectives and policies for
managing financial risks, to
enable Centrica to achieve its
long term shareholder value
growth targets within a prudent
risk management framework.
These objectives and policies
are regularly reviewed.
Currency , interest rate, liquidity
and counterparty risks are
managed centrally by a treasury
team, within parameters set 
by the board. This team is also
responsible for monitoring the
group’ s credit ratings and
managing the cost of its debt
capital. An energy management
team manages energy market
price and weather risks. 
Where appropriate, financial
instruments are used to manage
financial risks as explained
below and in note 28 on pages
67 to 71. Until its sale in
September 2003, Goldfish Bank
interest risks were managed by 
a treasury team with Lloyds TSB
Bank plc within parameters set
by the Goldfish board.
Credit rating
The group’ s debt ratings 
from Moody’ s Investors
Service/Standard & Poor’ s
remain unchanged at A2/A 
(long term) and P1/A-1 (short
term) and with a stable outlook.
Currency risk
Through wholly-owned US 
and Canadian subsidiaries, 
the group has operational
exposure in Canadian and 
US dollars. Canadian dollar
translation exposure is hedged
by maintaining a portfolio of
Canadian dollar financial
liabilities, which approximate 
to the net asset value of the
Canadian operations. US dollar
translation exposure has been
hedged by borrowing on a 
short term basis through a US
commercial paper programme.
In addition there is an element 
of translation exposure to the
euro through the 50% interest

from operating activities are 
also hedged through the use 
of forward foreign exchange
contracts. All debt raised in 
US dollars through the US
commercial paper programme,
apart from that hedging the US
translation exposure, is either
swapped into sterling or another
functional currency as part of the
translation hedging operations
described above.
Interest rate risk
The group’ s policy is actively 
to manage interest rate risk 
on long term borrowings while
ensuring that the exposure 
to fixed rates remains within 
a 30% to 70% range. This is
achieved by using derivative
financial instruments, such as
interest rate swaps, to adjust 
the interest basis of the portfolio
of long term debt (see note 28 on
pages 67 to 71). At the year end
debt has been raised on both 
a fixed and floating rate basis.
Liquidity
Cash forecasts identifying 
the liquidity requirements of 
the group are produced
frequently . These are reviewed
regularly by the board to 
ensure that sufficient financial
headroom exists for at least 
a 12 month period. The group
policy includes maintaining a
minimum level of committed
facilities and an objective that 
a proportion of debt should 
be long term, spread over a
range of maturities. Details 
of the maturity profile of
borrowings are given in note 
28 on pages 67 to 71. As at
31 December 2003, the group
had undrawn committed
facilities of £915 million, 
which were used as a backstop
for the US commercial 
paper programme.
Counterparty risk
The board’ s policy is to limit
counterparty exposures by
setting credit limits for each
counterparty , where possible 
by reference to published 
credit ratings. Exposures are
measured in relation to the
nature, market value and
maturity of each contract or
financial instrument. Surplus
cash is invested in short term
financial instruments and only
deposited with counterparties
with a minimum credit rating of
A3/A- and P1/A-1 in Moody’ s
Investors Service/Standard &
Poor’ s long term and short term
ratings respectively . Energy
trading activities are undertaken
with counterparties for whom
specific credit limits are set. 
All contracted and potential
exposures are reported to the
financial risk management
committee of the board.
Commodity price risk
The key commodity price risks
facing the group are first, natural
gas and electricity prices both in
the short term market and in
respect of long term contracts
and, secondly , escalation
indexes on long term gas
contracts, of which the most
influential are oil product prices
and general price inflation.
The group’ s policy is to hedge 
a proportion of the exposure 
for a number of years ahead
matched to the underlying 
sale and purchase risk profiles.
The group aims to manage 
its risk by using financial
instruments such as oil and 
gas swaps and gas derivatives
and bilateral agreements for 
gas and power , as well as 
asset ownership.
The financial risk management
committee regularly monitors
the extent of the group’ s
commodity price exposure 
and the level of hedging 
activity alongside the 
availability of forward prices 
and market liquidity . The net
gains from trading in energy
derivatives are set out in note 
28 on pages 67 to 71.
The acquisition of the
Roosecote and Barry 
power stations has further
contributed to the group’ s 
target to cover around a 
quarter of its electricity
requirement from its own
sources.
Weather risk
Gas sales volumes, and to 
a lesser extent electricity
volumes, are influenced by
temperature and other weather
factors. In Britain, the weather
derivatives market remains
relatively immature. We again
entered into a number of
weather derivative transactions
for the winter period October
2003 to March 2004 in order 
to hedge part of the group’ s
weather exposure.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting
policies remain unchanged 
over last year and are described
in note 1 to the accounts on
pages 41 to 44. 
The group complies with the
disclosure requirements of 
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
These disclosures are contained
in note 25 on pages 62 to 65. 
If the standard had been fully
adopted in 2003, profit would
have been reduced by
£71 million (2002: £47 million)
and net assets would have 
been reduced by £720 million
(2002: £507 million).
Conversion to International
Financial Reporting Standards
Centrica is preparing to comply
with the European regulation
requiring companies listed in 
the EU to report consolidated
financial statements in
conformity with International
Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) from 2005 onwards.
The main impact of adopting
IFRS is the potential for earnings
volatility resulting from the
requirement to mark to market
certain of the group’ s energy
contracts. The accounting
treatment of pensions, share
schemes and goodwill will 
also change significantly .

Corporate responsibility
• to ensure responsible
behaviour by being clear 
on our expectations of our
employees and of what 
we offer in return;
• to ensure the people we
employ reflect the customers
we serve so that we can deliver
appropriate services;
• to attract the best people to
work with us in achieving our
business objectives;
• to ensure that our leaders

• to develop our people in a
structured way to further 
their skills and understanding
of our values; and
• to promote a safe and healthy
working environment.
Values
Centrica has articulated its
values and introduced a new
guide to sound business
practice, setting out the
standards of behaviour we
expect from our employees on a
range of issues. The guide was
circulated to all UK employees.
Our values and business
principles are supported by
policies that ensure the support
we provide employees is both
effective and relevant. Following
a comprehensive review process,
36 new or revised policies have
been introduced in the last year .
Diversity
We are working to build an
employee profile that is both
representative and inclusive 
and that understands the
requirements of the broad
customer base we serve. 
environment and society . This
section highlights our major issues,
based around a framework
developed by Business in the
Community , under the headings
workplace, marketplace, the
environment and community .
Workplace
Our ongoing success and
sustainability as a company
critically depend on the people
we employ . Through normal
business activity , we have millions
of customer contacts every year .
The conduct of each and every
one of our employees is the
basis on which we build effective
relationships with our customers,
with fellow employees and 
with the communities in which
we operate.
We want to be an employer of
choice, developing initiatives
that help attract, develop, retain
and motivate the best people to
work with us to succeed in our
business objectives. During the
year , a coherent global people
strategy was developed to enable
us to meet specific business
needs. The strategy has been
widely shared and communicated
within and across the group. 
In many areas, there is still much
to be done but we believe we
have a framework in place that
will allow us to continue to invest
in our employees.
Our corporate responsibility
strategy in the workplace 
seeks to bring alive our values
and to realise our objective 
of becoming an employer 
of choice. The priorities for
action that we have set are:
stakeholders;
• identifying key impact areas
and ensuring that challenges
and issues are properly
addressed by our brands;
• seeking to give a balanced
view of performance by
participating in independent
benchmarking; and
• presenting information on our
impact and performance in an
intelligible and accessible way .
In order to lead the development
and application of our corporate
responsibility strategy , the
Centrica board has established
a corporate responsibility
committee, comprising senior
executives from across the group.
During 2003, the committee has
worked at group and business
unit level to define and agree the
level of performance and reporting
to be achieved for all key impact
areas of Centrica business activity
and to ensure that corporate
responsibility strategies provide
effective business support.
We review our performance
through external benchmarking.
In 2003, Centrica remained within
the FTSE4Good indices, an
indication that we had continued
to improve our corporate
responsibility performance. 
We were also ranked middle
quintile in the Business in the
Community CR Index. We were
pleased to be included within 
the Dow Jones Sustainability
World Index for the first time.
Our aim is to continue to report
fairly and transparently on the
range of factors that affect us,
including our impact on the
As a commercial organisation,
our first responsibility is to meet
our residential and commercial
customers’ needs for essential
services in and around the
home. Through our business
activities, we are an integral part
of local communities. We create
wealth for employees, generate
taxes to government, create jobs
among suppliers and deliver a
fair reward to investors who
finance the business.
We also understand that success
in the marketplace can only 
be sustained if we accept and
respond to a set of responsibilities
to society as a whole. By
understanding our impact on
society , the economy and the
wider environment, we can build
positive relationships with the
communities of which we are
part of. This approach benefits
our shareholders and employees
through the development of a
successful and sustainable
approach to doing business.
It is important that corporate
responsibility becomes an
integral part of our company
culture. At the heart of this
approach is a clear articulation
of our vision and values. This 
is supported by our business
principles, which outline our
commitment to operating
responsibly . By doing all this we
aim to create the service our
customers, suppliers, business
partners and colleagues expect.
Our corporate responsibility
strategy is based on:
• identifying, consulting with
and responding to the views of
We were pleased to be included in the Dow
Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time.
Remaining within the FTSE4Good indices
requires us continually to improve our corporate
responsibility performance.
Our ongoing success and sustainability depend
on the people we employ . Centrica plc report 2003 19
In 2003, Centrica introduced 
a new diversity strategy that
includes both employees and
customers. We have appointed
a new diversity director , and
established a diversity action
group chaired by a senior
executive. The group is driving
an integrated approach that will
build on the excellent practices
we have currently developed
and ensure they are consistent
throughout our business.
During 2003, Centrica conducted
a review of the pay levels between
men and women in accordance
with our commitment made in
the Kingsmill Report. The results
showed that the gender pay gap
in Centrica is much narrower than
national norms and our current
pay policies and practices contain
no gender bias. This review will
now be a regular report to our
executive committee.
We are working with a number of
organisations that enable us to
share best practice, learn from
others and continually improve
our approach to diversity . These
include the Employers’ Forum
on Disability , the Institute of
Employment Studies, the
Employers’ Forum on Age and
Business in the Community .
Centrica participated in the 2003
Employers’ Forum on Disability
Global Inclusion Benchmark 
that monitors the inclusion of
disability in a company’ s social
reporting process. Having been
placed sixth in 2002, our
performance improved during
2003 when we achieved second
position in the survey . 
a range of opportunities to
develop their skills, whether 
they are new to the group or
existing managers facing new
challenges. Programmes cover
company induction, change
management and leadership
skills, personal effectiveness
and team building.
Our graduate development
programme seeks to develop
future senior managers through
a thorough understanding of 
the operational aspects of 
our businesses, before
developing into a specialist 
role. Our programme is
structured to provide a 
number of key placements
including time spent within our
customer service operation.
People development
Investors in People (IIP) 
provides an ideal opportunity 
to benchmark the continual
development of everyone who
contributes to our success
against a recognised standard.
The AA gained IIP accreditation
across all of its business in
October 2002 as part of its
internal ‘Just AAsk’ launch and
in support of its brand values. 
In November 2003, it was
announced that British Gas 
had achieved business wide
recognition to the new IIP
standard, underpinning our
commitment to the development
of our people. As of November
2003, British Gas is now the
second largest business in the
UK with such accreditation.

the business strategy and
management agendas to
individual objectives. The new
system seeks to create and
maintain a high performance
culture across the group with
greater emphasis on helping 
to manage underperformance.
From 2004 onwards, managers
will use the behavioural
competencies to identify their
development needs and then
receive feedback on how they
are doing.
T raining programmes have
equipped managers with the
necessary support to review and
manage the performance of their
teams. We have also initiated a
new framework across the
group that aligns individual
rewards even more closely 
to business objectives.
In June, the executive
committee agreed actions to
develop talented managers
across the business. The
management talent review
enables the organisation to 
plan succession for the most
senior roles in the business.
Succession plans were
developed in 2003 and used 
to increase the movement of 
a number of people between
brands and across functions.
In 2003, we launched a new
range of personal and
professional development
opportunities to provide us 
with a clear understanding 
of the future leadership talent
within the organisation. The
programme offers our people 
Attracting talent
We continue to be involved in a
range of employment initiatives
across the UK to recruit people
from different backgrounds 
and groups in the community
including people with
disabilities, lone parents, carers
and the long term unemployed.
A new UK graduate recruitment
brand was developed in 2003.
The website was extensively
overhauled to enable applicants
to apply online and we
developed on-campus support
to help with marketing activities.
The number of UK graduates
Centrica recruited in 2003
increased to 42 from 12.
Leadership
Centrica recognises that quality
of leadership is a central factor 
in achieving our business
objectives and in ensuring that
the behaviour of our employees
truly reflects our values. This is 
a priority area for us.
During 2003 we identified the
key behaviours required by
leaders at all levels if Centrica is
to achieve its business goals.
Following research with our
employees, we created a clear
and concise set of behavioural
competencies for leadership
that are consistent with our
culture and values. We believe
this will create an environment
that provides the right challenges
and support to allow our people
to achieve their potential.
Based on these competencies, a
new performance management
system was developed to
A new graduate brand was developed in 2003. As of November 2003, British Gas is the second

Corporate responsibility continued
helped us develop and re-focus
our training facilities to handle
the extra training requirements
for an additional 5,000 recruits
into our engineering work force.
The academy’ s strategy is to use
not only our own training centres
but also to engage in
partnerships with further
education colleges. This enables
us to handle our peak training
requirements for technical
training within British Gas.
Our commitment to training has
been recognised by
government. Our chief executive
chairs the National Modern
Apprenticeship T ask Force and
Ambition:Energy , a New Deal
initiative to get unemployed
people into employment. We will
be extending the concept of
modern apprenticeships into
other areas of our business
during 2004, in particular into
customer service roles.
In 2003, the British Gas
Engineering Academy trained
more than 500 modern
apprentices and 1,000 adult
recruits. Our Direct Energy
Essential Home Services
business in Canada is also
initiating an apprenticeship
programme and is now a
recognised, certified body to
license technicians.
Health and safety
Making proper provision for the
health, safety and welfare at
work of our employees and
others who could be affected by
the group’ s activities is a top
priority for our business.
Centrica’ s health and safety
targets are linked to specific
performance indicators. All
targets and key performance
indicators are monitored and
reported regularly to the
Centrica board. Detailed
scrutiny of actual or potentially
significant incidents identifies
lessons to be learned and
preventative action to be taken.
Again we are pleased to report
no fatal accidents in 2003 – the
group having experienced only
one fatality since demerger . 
We have maintained a low
frequency of major injuries,
despite the significant growth 
in our operational businesses.
This has been due to our
continuing programme of risk
assessment, training, team
briefs and auditing.
We introduced a number of
occupational health and safety
initiatives to highlight and
manage particular risks within
our business. Examples
included managing
occupational road risk,
managing stress in the
workplace and reinforcing our
policy on the use of mobile
phones. In North America, a
confidential Employee
Assistance Programme is
available to all employees.
British Gas was awarded the
Gas Industry Safety Award in
2003 for supporting the
furtherance of gas safety
throughout the UK and Europe.
Communication and
engagement
Employment policies and a
range of other information are
also included on Essential, a
new intranet portal that was
launched in 2003 across all our
UK businesses. Reaching our
employees with relevant
information is critical if they are
to interact productively with
colleagues and customers in
their day-to-day activities.
Feedback to the
communications channel has
been positive and Essential will
be extended to other parts of our
business during 2004.
This year we enhanced our
employee survey to get a better
insight into their engagement
with Centrica and understand
what actions are needed. The
shift from satisfaction to
engagement is consistent with
our culture and values. Seventy-
four per cent of our employees
responded to the 2003 survey
with more than 50% completing
the survey online using the
Essential intranet portal.
Marketplace
Passion for customers is the
cornerstone of the
organisational values that we
have set for Centrica. Being
responsible in how we behave in
our customer relationships is
central to how we achieve our
company vision and how we
define our values.
Our main brands are known and
trusted in their markets. All our
brands, new and old, share a
passion for customers and
interpret this in ways appropriate
for the markets and
communities where they
operate.
Our main impacts are in the
following areas:
• ensuring that our customers
enjoy high quality service;
• making access to our services
easy through meeting the
diverse needs of all our
customers;
• ensuring that our sales
techniques inspire trust and
are credible;
• offering advice to customers
on safe and responsible use of
our services; and
• ensuring our suppliers reflect
and embody our values in their
relationships with us.
Customer service
We are committed to improving
our standards of customer
service and have a range of
quality management programmes
in place across the group. We
measure customer satisfaction
on an annual basis whilst monthly
indicators of service delivery are
reported to senior managers
throughout the group. Information
is also fed through to the Centrica
customer service committee
who determine and monitor key
customer service targets.
This reporting process enables
us to track both the performance
of our own service delivery and
that of our suppliers in areas such
as alternative media provision
and text phone availability for
disabled people. We also
provide the facility of a voluntary
service register for older or
disabled people, so they can
help us develop the services we
offer , and a language translation
service for customers whose
first language is not English.
We have maintained a low frequency of major
injuries through a continuing programme of risk
assessment, training and auditing.
Centrica is committed to continually improving
standards of customer service.
The creation of the British Gas Engineering
Academy has helped us develop and re-focus
our training facilities. Centrica plc report 2003 21
Meeting diverse needs
We have a responsibility to 
meet the diverse needs of all 
our customers. Many need 
help to benefit fully from the
services we offer and we are
investing in initiatives to 
enhance customer choice,
safety and energy efficiency ,
with a particular emphasis 
on alleviating the burden of 
fuel poverty .
Through the Energy Efficiency
Commitment programme, 
British Gas provides free and
discounted energy efficiency
measures to help customers
save energy and reduce their 
fuel bills.
Since the start of the 
programme in April 2002 
British Gas has provided energy
saving measures to over
4 million homes, nearly 45% 
of which are low income
households. We have insulated
more than 360,000 homes,
provided 1.3 million households
with energy efficient appliances,
installed 65,000 energy efficient
boilers and heating controls and
provided more than 2.3 million
homes with low energy light
bulbs. By the end of 2003, 
we had delivered more than
60% of our three year energy
saving target.
At the heart of our service ethic 
is a commitment to treat all our
customers both fairly and
equally . Each month we publish
an internal diversity report,
which looks specifically at the
services we provide to diverse
groups of customers. More than
750,000 customers are included
on British Gas, AA and One. T el
registers, advising us of their
service needs as a result of their
age or disability .
In Britain, we send out over
17,000 alternative format 
bills, statements, letters and
marketing communications
each month to our customers.
These formats include Braille,
large print and audio tape. 
In August 2003, Centrica
launched a customer diversity
intranet site, to provide additional
advice and information on a
range of customer diversity
issues to our employees.
Sales
Centrica uses a variety of
channels to sell its products 
and is committed to ensure 
that the same standards of
responsibility apply regardless 
of the sales channel. A particular
focus is face-to-face selling
through our direct sales agents.
We have reviewed our own
recruitment and training
procedures as well as
encouraged the emergence 
of industry standards.
All British Gas energy sales 
staff are EnergySure accredited,
showing they are appropriately
trained and registered on a
nationwide database designed
to protect consumers. As
founder-members of the
Association of Energy Suppliers
(AES), we have worked with 
the industry , regulator and
consumer bodies to agree 
the AES Code of Practice for
face-to-face selling.
Supplier relationships
We expect our suppliers to 
have similar high standards 
to our own in terms of workforce
practices, production
procedures for goods and
services, health and safety , 
and the environment.
Centrica has set up a team
dedicated to managing our 
top 20 strategic supplier
relationships. Establishing this
formal group-wide relationship
with our key suppliers has
certainly proved positive and
encouraged suppliers to work
more proactively with Centrica,
enabling us to gain maximum
value from the relationships. 
As a group we have derived
significant tangible benefits 
and suppliers in turn have 
also benefited.
This more structured and co-
ordinated approach has 
resulted in stronger group-wide
contract management for 
some suppliers and in a 
greater focus on process
improvement with others. 
Some suppliers are now
providing consultancy , advice
and training within their fields 
of expertise. This support
benefited the group by more
than £2.3 million in 2003.
Environment
We are working to ensure 
that we effectively manage 
our impacts on the 
environment through:
• reducing our emissions;
• our renewable energy strategy;
and
• involving our employees.
Renewable energy
We are required in the UK to
source 4.3% of our electricity
from renewable sources in
2003/2004, rising to 15.4% in
2015/2016. We continue actively
to support the development of a
traded market, to promote
development of renewables.
In July , we announced our
investment strategy for
renewable generation assets.
The intention is eventually to
source around half of our
renewable obligation from our
own assets.
Environmental management
systems
The acquisition of gas-fired
power stations and a major gas
storage facility have influenced
our environmental impact. We
are introducing environmental
management systems (EMS)
across all of our businesses to
manage this and to help identify
opportunities for improving our
performance. We aim to
implement an EMS that meets
the requirements of ISO 14001
across our established UK
businesses and key activities by
2005. T argets have been set for
2005 and we have so far
achieved certification for 13 of
the 15 selected businesses.
Currently , the major elements of
EMS are in place for the AA,
British Gas, power generation
and gas production.
T ransport and energy
In 2003, Centrica’ s commercial

roadside service and install,
maintain and repair central

products in the home. We
prioritise fuel efficiency in new
vehicles and implement travel
and fuel reduction policies. We
also run a fleet management
programme to reduce the
amount of travel by employees,
and in turn reduce impact on 
the environment.
We are committed to reducing
building energy use per
employee and increasing the
amount of waste recycled,
particularly in offices. In 2003,
energy consumption per office-
based employee was reduced
by 10%. All energy for Centrica
offices is sourced from certified
renewable supplies. Our waste
recycling programme has
achieved significant results, the
office recycling rate rising to 48%.
Involving our employees
Our employees play a vital role in
helping us to reduce the
environmental impact of our
operations. We rely on them to
work in ways that influence our
customers and suppliers to use
our products and services in a
more environmentally sensitive
way.
In early 2003, we launched
‘Natural Capital’, a UK campaign
that aims to increase levels of
employee awareness of
environmental issues and
encourage direct action through
behavioural change.
The first stage of the campaign
has targeted office employees,
with an environmental champion
on each site to promote the
initiatives of the campaign.
Roadshows have been run at 24
sites and 3,000 individual
pledges have been signed.
Feedback has been very positive
and increased awareness is
beginning to show results in
terms of the site environmental
programmes and the annual
employee survey .
Community
Our community investment
programme focuses on projects
that address social issues most
closely aligned with our
business. During 2003, we
contributed £6.6 million to
community causes. Community
contributions are measured
using the London Benchmarking
Group model that includes cash,
time and in-kind support and
helps us assess what these
resources really achieve for our
community partners. Our
strategy is to focus on
programmes that reflect our core
business, skills and experience.
The main programmes operated
by our brands are described
below including examples where
the knowledge of our
community partners has helped
us improve the experience of our
customers. In addition, our aim
is to provide opportunities for
our employees to become
involved in their communities.
British Gas
A key social issue for British Gas
is ensuring sustainable access
to energy . Through our ‘here to
HELP’ programme, British Gas
is working in partnership with
social housing providers and
seven national charities to
improve the quality of life for
individuals and families in some
of Britain’ s most deprived
communities. The programme is
providing practical ways to
make homes warm, safe and
comfortable. T o date, some
50,000 household assessments
have been completed resulting
in the installation of over 17,000
energy efficiency measures,
10,000 referrals to our charity
partners and the identification of
over £1.8 million of unclaimed
benefits, which equates to a
potential average benefit gain of
around £1,600 per qualifying
household each year .
We also engage in education,
training and job creation. British
Gas worked in partnership with
Mencap and the Employers’
Forum on Disability to publish
‘Paying your Bills’. The booklet
was developed with the help of a
cross-section of people with a
learning disability . It is a guide to
help manage household bills
and covers issues including how
to find the easiest method of
payment, how to get support if
problems arise and tips on
saving energy and money .
In July 2003, we were delighted
to receive the Business in the
Community Award for
Excellence in Education and
Lifelong Learning for the British
Gas ‘Think Energy’ programme.
‘Think Energy’ is an energy
education programme for 7 to 18
year olds and has reached 49%
of schools in the UK since its
launch in 2000. It combines a
mixture of classroom learning
and home study , helping young
people learn about the
importance of energy efficiency .
T o date, more than 17,000 UK
schools have requested ‘Think
Energy’ resources.
The AA
The key social impacts of the AA
are related motoring and
transport issues. Our main
impacts are road safety , for
drivers and pedestrians, and car
use impacts, such as traffic and
road management.
Centrica established The AA
Motoring T rust in 2002 to carry
forward and strengthen the AA ’ s
historic public interest role
looking after the interests and
safety of road users. The charity
was launched in February 2003.
The T rust’ s key road safety
programme is its European
Road Assessment Programme
(EuroRAP), which promotes road
safety by highlighting poor road
design. EuroRAP’ s second set of
results were released in
September 2003 and the
following month 24 EU transport
ministers declared action on
dangerous roads when the
programme was launched in
Italy . In its first year , the AA T rust
has won international
recognition for EuroRAP and
also received the Autocar 2003
award for safety .
The T rust also played a key role
in representing motorists’ views
over congestion charging in
London and elsewhere in the
UK. Other work in 2003 included
Anne Minto, group director , human resources,
planting a tree as part of the ‘Natural Capital’

North America
In North America, Direct Energy ,
through our ‘direct in the
community’ programme,
focuses on social issues related
to safe and affordable housing,
especially for families, older
people and the disabled. This
work combines charitable giving
with activities designed to foster
and encourage our employees
to volunteer in their communities
and support causes they value.
Important initiatives include
support of Raising the Roof,
Canada’ s only national charity
solely dedicated to finding long
term solutions to homelessness.
Direct Energy provided
C$250,000 (£108,800) in
corporate donations and
employees raised close to
C$30,000 (£13,050) during the
‘Fall Pledge’ campaign.
The mad cow disease scare of
2003 badly damaged the Alberta
beef industry . Direct Energy
donated C$50,000 (£21,800) to
the Alberta Food Bank network
and also donated C$2 for each
Albertan who contacted Direct
Energy Preferred for information
on products and services.
Through this offer , a further
C$15,000 (£6,500) was raised.
In T exas, Direct Energy supports
a ‘neighbour-to-neighbour’
programme, which helps South
and West T exas families in crisis
pay their home energy bills.
Following an initial contribution,
we will be contributing
US$350,000 (£213,700) to the
programme on an annual basis.
Our employees
The Centrica employee charity
of the year is supported by the
vast majority of our UK
employees. During 2003 our
charity partner was Meningitis
T rust for which we raised more
than £500,000. We are hoping
for similar success with our
current charity partner , Cancer
Research UK.
Launched in 2003 in North
America, the ‘direct in the
community’ programme also
supports our employees through
the ‘Dollars for Doers’
programme. Employees who
volunteer more than 10 hours
per month are eligible to apply
for a corporate donation of up to
C$500 (£220) for the registered
charity they support. In addition,
the ‘Donated Expertise’
programme encourages
employees to provide
assistance to charitable
organisations in their community
by providing paid time off during
their working day for this
important voluntary work.
Centrica has continued its
partnership with Carers UK. In
December , we supported
‘Carers’ Rights Day’, which
aimed to raise awareness of the
rights of people with caring
responsibilities and the benefits
that are available to them.
Centrica is also a member of
Employers for Carers, a group
that includes major employers,
employers’ organisations and
government agencies. It
promotes the business benefits
of supporting carers in the
workplace and seeks to
influence current employment
policy and practice to support
carers in and into work.
Reporting and assurance
In addition to this overview of our
corporate responsibility
activities, there is more detailed
information available on our
website at www.centrica.com/
responsibility . We have also
produced a short, printed report
that can be accessed via the
website.
For the first time, we have
commissioned an impartial
assessment of our website
information by a specialist
external agency , The Corporate
Citizenship Company . It has
conducted an assurance
process on the information
presented and provided a
commentary on our progress
towards being a more socially
responsible company . The full
statement is available online. 
In summary , this commends our
systems to manage and
implement our corporate
responsibility policies, especially
the adoption this year of the
statement of Centrica’ s values
and business principles. It
highlights the fact that we are
addressing responsibility issues
in our mainstream business
practice, such as customer
satisfaction, workplace morale
and the environmental impact of
our products and services, as
well as our long-standing
community engagement. 
The external commentary also
identifies areas where we have
room to improve. These include
improving performance
measurement against our stated
business principles, setting clear
targets for managers to achieve
and understanding better the
implications of our commitment
to sustainability , especially for
our energy and motoring
services businesses. We will
seek to address these issues in
everything we do.

Further details of the group’ s employment policies 
and employee communications can be found on 
pages 18 to 20.
Employee share schemes

Upon the recommendation of the audit committee, a
resolution to reappoint them as the company’ s auditors
and authorise the directors to determine their remuneration

Authority to purchase shares
The directors were authorised at the 2003 AGM to
purchase the company’ s own shares, within certain limits
and as permitted by the articles of association. Although 
no such purchases have been made to date under this
authority , the directors will seek to renew this authority at
the 2004 AGM.
Corporate governance
The group is committed to high standards of corporate
governance. During the year , the board has reviewed its
governance arrangements in the light of the new
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the new Code)
and the Guidance on Audit Committees (the Smith
Guidance) and has made changes as necessary and
appropriate. As the new Code took effect in respect of
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 November
2003, this report has been prepared on the basis of the
previous Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(the Code). Some additional disclosures have been made
as a transition towards compliance with the new Code.
Throughout the year , the company fully complied with the
provisions of the Code and applied its principles as follows:
The board
An effective board of directors leads and controls the
group. The board, which meets at least 10 times a year , has
a schedule of matters reserved for its approval. The board
is responsible for determination of strategy and major
policies; review of management performance; and
approval of the annual operating plan, the financial
statements, major projects and corporate governance.
One of its meetings each year is substantially devoted to
the development of strategy . 
Overall attendance during 2003 was 92% for the board,
88% for the audit committee, 90% for the remuneration
committee and 100% for the nominations committee. 
Non-attendance was due mainly to previously arranged
commitments of the newly appointed directors.
Comprehensive briefing papers including management
accounts are circulated to each director one week prior to
board meetings. A procedure is in place for directors to
obtain independent professional advice in respect of their
duties. They also have access to the advice and services of
the company secretary .
The names of the directors and their details including
committee memberships, appear on page 24. All of the non-
executive directors, including the chairman, are members of
the audit and remuneration committees as the board believes
that each of them adds value to the business of those meetings.
This membership structure gives the non-executive directors  Centrica plc report 2003 27
detailed insight into the nature of the matters being discussed,
brings continuity to membership and avoids undue reliance
on particular individuals. Throughout the year , the chairman
and the other non-executive directors were independent 
of management and the senior independent director was
Patricia Mann. In November , the board considered the
independence of the non-executive directors (other than 
the chairman) against the criteria in the new Code and
determined that each was independent.
The non-executive directors, including the chairman, 
meet independently of management on a regular basis.
All directors joining the board are required to submit
themselves for election at the AGM following their
appointment. Thereafter , they are subject to re-election
every third year . The non-executive directors are initially
appointed for a three year term and, subject to review and
re-election, can serve up to a maximum of three such terms.
The directors receive ongoing training including an
induction programme tailored to meet the needs of the
individual. The directors also receive regular updates on
changes and developments to the business, legislative 
and regulatory environments.
The board has delegated authority to a number of
committees to deal with specific aspects of the
management and control of the group. These committees
have specific terms of reference and meet on a regular
basis. The minutes of the meetings of these committees
are made available to all the directors on a timely basis.
Executive committee
The executive committee comprises the executive
directors and the general counsel and company secretary .
It is chaired by Sir Roy Gardner . It meets weekly and
oversees the management of the group and is the decision
making body for those matters not reserved to the board
and within the limits set out in the group’ s delegated
authority and expenditure control policies.
There are four sub-committees of the executive
committee: the group risk management committee; 
the group financial risk management committee; the
corporate responsibility committee; and the health, 
safety and environment committee. The membership 
of these committees is drawn from senior management.
Audit committee
The audit committee, which meets four times a year ,
consists of the chairman and independent non-executive
directors. It was chaired throughout the year by Roger Carr .
The audit committee, which reports its findings to the
board, is authorised to:
• monitor the integrity of the interim and annual financial
statements, including a review of significant financial
reporting judgements contained in them;
• review the company’ s internal financial controls and
internal control and risk management systems;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the company’ s
internal audit function; and 
• establish and oversee the company’ s relationship 
with the external auditors, including the monitoring 
of their independence.
Note 3(v) to the financial statements on page 47 sets out
the group’ s policy to seek competitive tenders for all 
major consultancies and advisory projects. The board 
has approved policies that restrict the types of non-audit
work that can be undertaken by the external auditors 
and restrict the employment by the group of former
employees of the external audit firms. The award of 
non-audit work within categories that the external 
auditors are permitted to carry out under the board
approved policies is subject to pre-clearance by the 
audit committee if the fee exceeds specified thresholds. 
All non-audit assignments awarded to the external 
auditors are reported to the audit committee on a 
quarterly basis, along with a full breakdown of 
non-audit fees incurred during the year .
As a matter of best practice and in accordance with
auditing standard 610, the external auditors have held
discussions with the audit committee on the subject of
audit independence and have confirmed their
independence in writing.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee, which met six times 
during 2003, consists of the chairman and independent
non-executive directors. It is chaired by Patricia Mann. 
The role of this committee and details of how the company
applies the principles of the Code in respect of directors’
remuneration are set out on pages 29 to 36.
Nominations committee
The nominations committee consists of Sir Roy Gardner ,
Patricia Mann and Sir Michael Perry , who chairs it. 
It makes recommendations to the board for the
appointment of replacement or additional directors. 
At its three meetings during the year it considered the
succession to Sir Michael Perry as chairman of the
company and, accordingly , Patricia Mann chaired 
the second and third of these meetings. Having taken
advice from executive recruitment agents and having
drawn up a list of required attributes, members of the
committee gave careful consideration to a number of
individuals, both external candidates and existing
independent non-executive directors. The committee
concluded that Roger Carr was the most appropriate
person to succeed Sir Michael Perry as chairman of the
company , having sought and received assurance that 
he had sufficient time available to devote to the position,
and recommended his appointment to the board.
The nominations committee is also responsible for
succession planning and board evaluation. It is intended
that a formal evaluation of the performance of the board,
assisted by external consultants, will be undertaken 
during 2004. 
Customer service committee
This committee determines and monitors customer 
service targets, as key drivers of the long term success  28 Centrica plc report 2003 
Directors’ report continued
of the group. It was chaired on an interim basis by 
Mark Clare between May 2002 and January 2003. 
Helen Alexander succeeded Mark Clare as chairman 
of this committee with effect from February 2003.
Relations with shareholders
The company has a programme of communication with 
its shareholders. As well as share price information, 
news releases and the annual report, the Centrica 
website includes speeches from the AGM, presentations 
to the investment community and a section for 
shareholder services.
The board believes that the AGM presents an important
opportunity for dialogue with private shareholders, 
many of whom are also customers. At the AGM, the
chairman and the chief executive present a review of the
businesses of the group. Representatives from across the
group are available to answer questions both before and
after the meeting. 
All shareholders have the opportunity to cast their votes at
the AGM by proxy , by post or via the internet. Shareholders
can register to receive all their communications online,
benefiting both themselves and the company .
Centrica also holds regular meetings with its major
shareholders. The chairman attends the meeting at 
which the preliminary results are presented to major
investors and analysts. Formal reports of investor feedback
are presented to the board at least twice a year .
Internal control
The board of directors is responsible for the group’ s system
of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives
and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Identification, assessment and management of risks
The company places great importance on internal 
control and risk management. A risk aware and control
conscious environment is encouraged throughout the
group. The board, either directly or through its committees,
sets objectives, performance targets and policies for
management of key risks facing the group. These include
strategic planning, acquisitions, political and regulatory ,
investments, expenditure control, treasury , environment,
health and safety , trading and customer service.
Across the group, each business has a risk management
committee that seeks to identify , assess and advise on the
management of operational risks. In addition, the group
risk management committee considers the risks that 
might affect the company at group level. The processes of
newly acquired companies are integrated with those of the
group. Centrica Storage operates to the same standards of
internal control and risk management as the rest of the
group; however , as a result of undertakings given to the
Secretary of State for T rade and Industry , a high level of
separation is maintained between the management of
Centrica Storage and that of the rest of the group.
Assurance
The business assurance function undertakes internal 
audit reviews according to a plan approved by the audit
committee. The results of their work are reported to the 
audit committee on a quarterly basis.
The board’ s review of the system of internal control
The board of directors, with the advice of the audit
committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
internal control system operated (as described above)
throughout the period from 1 January 2003 to the date 
of this report and is satisfied that the group complies 
with the T urnbull Guidance on Internal Control.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the board has a reasonable
expectation that the company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, we continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements, 
which are shown on pages 38 to 77.

Composition and role of the remuneration committee
The board has established a remuneration committee,
which is chaired by Patricia Mann. Helen Alexander , 
Roger Carr , Sir Michael Perry and Robert T obin were
members of the committee throughout 2003. Paul Walsh
became a member when he joined the board on 1 March
2003. All members are non-executive directors and, with
the exception of Sir Michael Perry , are independent.
The committee makes recommendations to the
board, within formal terms of reference, on the policy
and framework of executive remuneration and its cost
to the company . The committee is also responsible
for the implementation of remuneration policy and
determining specific remuneration packages for each
of the executive directors. It has access to advice
provided by the group human resources director
(Anne Minto), the group head of reward (Mike New), 
the company secretary (Grant Dawson), the chief
executive (Sir Roy Gardner) and external consultants.
During 2003, the committee consulted, but did not
formally appoint, T owers Perrin, who provided information
and advice on executive compensation to assist in the
formulation of the committee’ s recommendations.
T owers Perrin also provided advice to the group 
on retirement benefits and non-executive directors’ 
fees during the year .
This report explains how the company has applied 
the principles in the 1998 Combined Code on Corporate
Governance that relate to directors’ remuneration. 
It will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM for approval.
No director votes on any matter relating to his or her 
own remuneration.
Framework and policy on executive directors’
remuneration
The group’ s remuneration policy is designed to provide
competitive rewards for its executive directors and other
senior executives, taking into account the company’ s
performance, the markets in which the group operates
and pay and conditions elsewhere in the group.
In constructing the remuneration packages, the
committee aims to achieve a balance between fixed and
variable compensation for each director . Accordingly ,
a significant proportion of the remuneration package
depends on the attainment of demanding performance
objectives, both short and long term. In agreeing the 
level of base salaries and the annual performance 
bonus scheme, the committee takes into consideration 
the total remuneration that executives could receive. 
The committee reviews the packages and varies individual
elements when appropriate from year to year .
T o recognise performance against agreed objectives, 
the committee has put in place an annual bonus scheme
for executive directors similar to that applying to other
senior executives in the group. Annual bonuses for
executive directors are determined by the achievement 
of demanding individual, business and corporate
objectives.
Under both the executive share option scheme (ESOS)
and the long term incentive scheme (L TIS) the current
practice is to make conditional awards each year up to a
maximum of 200% and 75% of base salary respectively .
These schemes are designed to align the interests of
executive directors and other senior executives with the
longer term interests of shareholders by rewarding them 
for delivering increased shareholder value.
As a matter of policy , all executive directors and certain
senior executives are expected to retain a minimum
shareholding in the company at least equal in value
to the executive’ s base salary .
Executive directors also participate in a contributory , 
final salary pension scheme (details of which are given 
on pages 35 and 36).
The committee believes that these arrangements, which
are further explained below, are important in providing 
a potential remuneration package that will attract, retain
and continue to motivate executive directors and senior
executives in a marketplace that is increasingly challenging
and competitive in both commercial and human resource
terms. It is intended that the current remuneration policy , the
ESOS and L TIS elements of which have been approved by
shareholders, will continue for 2004 and succeeding years.
In 2003, the total compensation of the executive directors,
detailed on page 32, consisted of components in the
following proportions:
Note: Salary and benefits are amounts received during 2003; pension is the increase
in transfer value less directors’ contributions during 2003; performance bonus is that
paid in respect of 2003; and ESOS and L TIS are the estimated value of the awards made 
in 2003 based on a Black Scholes model, provided that all performance conditions
are met at the end of the relevant performance periods. In 2003, Mike Alexander served
as a director for January and February only . Because of his retirement he was not eligible
to participate in ESOS grants and L TIS allocations made in 2003, nor did he receive a bonus
in respect of the year . Accordingly , no part of his remuneration was performance related.
Components of remuneration
Base salary
The committee seeks to establish a base salary for each
executive director determined by individual performance
and having regard to market salary levels for similar positions
in comparable companies derived from independent
sources. Base salaries are reviewed annually . Base salary
is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
Annual performance bonus
At the beginning of each year , the committee reviews the
bonus scheme to ensure that it remains competitive in the
market and continues to incentivise the executive directors

and align their interests with those of shareholders. For
2003, having reviewed comparative data provided by
T owers Perrin, the committee increased the relative weight
given to financial performance targets and adjusted the
maximum bonus payable should every element of every
objective be achieved in full from 60% to 100% of base
salary . In 2003, 50% of the maximum bonus achievable
related to financial performance targets, 25% to customer
and employee satisfaction and 25% to personal
performance. For executive directors with business unit
responsibilities, the scheme is structured to reflect the
performance of their business unit as well as that of the
group. No bonus at all is payable to an individual whose
agreed minimum personal targets are not met.
Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Options granted under the ESOS only become 
exercisable if and to the extent that performance
conditions are satisfied three years after the date 
of grant. If exercisable, they remain so until the tenth
anniversary of grant. Performance conditions are 
based on the extent to which growth in the company’ s
earnings per share (EPS growth) exceeds growth in 
the Retail Prices Index (RPI growth) over a three year
performance period. EPS is calculated as fully diluted
earnings per share adjusted for exceptional charges 
and goodwill amortisation. The committee believes 
that this method of calculating EPS provides an
independent and verifiable measure of the 
company’ s performance.
In respect of each grant of options, the committee has
determined that, for the option to be exercisable in full, 
EPS growth must exceed RPI growth by 18 percentage
points or more over the three year performance period. 
No part of the option grant will be exercisable if EPS 
growth fails to exceed RPI growth by at least 9 percentage
points over the performance period. The proportion 
of the option grant exercisable by the executive will
increase on a sliding scale between 40% and 100% 
if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between 9 and 
18 percentage points over the performance period.
The company’ s EPS growth may be re-measured
annually for a further two years, but always from the 
date of grant of the options, with the performance
conditions increasing proportionately . The committee
believes that, in relation to the ESOS, EPS growth in 
excess of RPI growth is the most appropriate measure 
for determining the increase in value delivered to
shareholders by the company’ s executive directors
and senior executives. The committee reviews the
appropriateness of the performance measure and
the specific targets set when considering each 
new grant of options.
In March 2003, options were granted to each executive
director equal to 200% of his base salary and, at the same
or lower rates, to certain other senior executives. Details 
of options granted to executive directors are shown on
page 34. It is the company’ s intention that new shares be
issued, subject to institutional guidelines, to satisfy the
exercise of options granted under the ESOS.
One executive director holds an option under the
restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS).
The RESOS was put in place to replace options which
executives had previously held over British Gas plc
shares and which were cancelled at demerger . There
are no performance conditions attaching to options
under the RESOS. Further details are given on page 34.
Long term incentive scheme (L TIS)
Allocations of shares are made annually to executive
directors and other senior executives under the L TIS.
These awards are subject to challenging performance
conditions based on the company’ s total shareholder
return (TSR) relative to the returns of a comparator
group, since this ensures that the executives are not
rewarded unless the company has outperformed its 
peers in creating shareholder value. The committee has
determined that, in the absence of a meaningful ‘natural’
comparator group for the company , the companies
comprising the FTSE 100 at the start of the relevant
performance period (the L TIS comparator group) 
constitute the most appropriate comparator group for 
the purpose of the L TIS. The committee reviews the
appropriateness of the performance measure and 
the specific target set when considering each new
allocation of shares under the L TIS. In assessing the
extent of satisfaction of the performance condition,
the committee uses data provided by Alithos Limited.
Allocations made prior to May 2001 are subject to
a performance period of either three or four years 
(at the participant’ s choice), followed by a retention 
period of two years. Changes to these arrangements 
were approved at the 2001 AGM. Allocations made 
from May 2001 will be released to the participant 
under normal circumstances after the three year
performance period, provided the performance 
conditions have been met.
The actual number of shares eventually released to the
participant depends on the company’ s TSR over the entire
performance period relative to the L TIS comparator group.
The maximum annual allocation of shares only vests and
is released to the executive if the company’ s TSR over the
performance period is ranked in 25th position or above
relative to the 99 other companies in the L TIS comparator
group. No shares vest if the TSR over the performance
period is ranked below 50th position in the L TIS
comparator group. Between 25th and 50th position, 
shares vest on a sliding scale from 100% to 40%.
In April 2003, L TIS allocations equal to 75% of base 
salary were awarded to executive directors and,
at the same or lower rates, to certain other senior
executives. The maximum number of shares that 
could eventually be transferred to each executive 
director upon satisfaction of the performance criteria
appears on page 33.
Prior to 2002, the trustee of the L TIS bought shares 
in the market to match the likely future requirements 
for shares under L TIS releases. Any shortfall will be 
satisfied by the issue of new shares. Centrica plc report 2003 31
TSR – Centrica and FTSE 100: 1999-2003
The table above shows graphs of the company’ s TSR
performance and that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five
years ended 31 December 2003. As required by the
Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, this
uses a rolling definition of the FTSE 100, whereas the
definition used for the purposes of the L TIS is the FTSE 100
as constituted at the beginning of the period. In order to
demonstrate the delivery of shareholder value during the
relevant performance period, the TSR graph for the L TIS
award that vested in October 2003 is shown on page 33.
Pension
Executive directors also participate in a contributory , final
salary pension scheme (details of which are given on pages
35 and 36).
Other employment benefits
In common with other senior management, executive
directors are entitled to a range of benefits, including a
company car , life assurance, private medical insurance 
and a financial counselling scheme. They are also eligible,
on the same basis as other employees, to participate in
the company’ s Inland Revenue approved sharesave 
and share incentive plans. These are open to all eligible
employees and provide a long term savings and
investment opportunity .
Service contracts
It is the company’ s policy for the notice period in executive
directors’ service contracts not to exceed one year . The
committee retains a level of flexibility in order to offer
contracts to new executive directors that contain an initial
notice period in excess of one year , provided that after the
first such period the notice period reduces to one year . 
The executive directors’ service contracts have no fixed
term but provide that either the director or the company
may terminate the employment by giving one year’ s 
written notice and that the company may pay
compensation in lieu of notice.
The dates of the executive directors’ service contracts 
are set out in the table on page 32.
Upon Mike Alexander’ s retirement from the board on
28 February 2003, he forfeited all of the options granted
to him under the ESOS (see the table on page 34) and the
conditional allocations of shares made to him under the
L TIS on 2 October 2000, 1 October 2001 and 2 April 2002
(see the table on page 33). The performance targets in
respect of the allocations of shares made to him under the
L TIS on 1 October 1998 and 7 October 1999 had previously
been achieved and those shares were or will be released to
him at the end of the retention periods on 30 September
2003 and 30 September 2004 respectively . Mike Alexander
has not received and will not receive any payments other
than his pension, the details of which are disclosed
on pages 35 to 36.
External appointments of executive directors
The board believes that experience of other companies’
practices and challenges is valuable both for the personal
development of its executive directors and for the
company . It is therefore the company’ s policy to allow 
each executive director to accept one non-executive
directorship of another company , although the board
retains the discretion to vary this policy . Fees are retained
by the individual director . 
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not hold service contracts. 
The dates of their appointment are shown in the table on
page 32. Their appointment is subject to the articles of
association. Their fees are determined having regard 
to the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and
experience, the time and responsibilities entailed and the
fees paid by other companies. Their fees are approved 
by the board, upon the recommendation of the executive
committee, whose members are the executive directors
listed in the second table on page 32, together with 
Grant Dawson, general counsel and company secretary .
The executive committee received survey and other
information from the remuneration consultants, T owers
Perrin. The non-executive directors, including the
chairman, do not participate in any of the company’ s 
share schemes, incentive plans or pension schemes.
In addition to his fees as a non-executive director of the
company , Sir Brian Shaw received fees for consultancy
services to The Automobile Association Limited.
The remuneration report from page 29 to page 31 up to this
statement has not been audited. From this point until the
end of the report on page 36, the disclosures, with the
exception of the line graph on page 33, have been audited.

(i) At the end of the performance period to 30 September 2001, the company ranked in fourth position in the relevant
L TIS comparator group. Accordingly , 100% of the allocations were released on the vesting date of 1 October 2003
following the expiry of the two year retention period. These shares were subject to income tax at the individual’ s
marginal rate and national insurance contributions (NICs) at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at
the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly , the
directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which is reflected in the shareholdings as at
31 December 2003 in the second table on page 32.
(ii) At the end of the performance period to 30 September 2002, the company ranked fourth in the relevant L TIS
comparator group. Accordingly , 100% of the allocations are being held in trust for a further two years, at the end
of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustee’ s discretion.
(iii) At the end of the performance period to 1 October 2003, the company ranked in fortieth position in the relevant L TIS
comparator group. Accordingly , 75% of the original allocations are being held in trust for a further two years, at the end
of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustee’ s discretion.
(iv) The respective performance periods relating to these allocations will end on 30 September 2004, 1 April 2005 and
31 March 2006. If, and to the extent that, the performance conditions are met, the allocations will vest and the relevant
number of shares will be released to the directors at the trustee’ s discretion.

(i) Executive share option scheme (ESOS)
Options were granted to executives under the terms of the Centrica executive share option scheme on 31 May 2001,
2 April 2002 and 24 March 2003. Details of the operation of this scheme are provided on page 30.
(ii) Sharesave scheme
The company operates an Inland Revenue approved all-employee savings related share option scheme. The scheme
is designed to provide a long term savings and investment opportunity for employees and is described on page 26.
(iii) Restructured executive share option scheme (RESOS)
Options granted to company employees under the British Gas plc executive share option scheme prior to February
1997 were cancelled and replaced at demerger by non-Inland Revenue approved options to acquire Centrica shares.
The replacement options were granted on the same terms as British Gas executive share options, with the same
exercise date and aggregate exercise price per share, and the number of shares placed under option was adjusted to
take account of the demerger . No further options have been or will be granted under this scheme.
(iv) Exercise of share options
Options were exercised at the following dates and prices: 
(a) 28 August 2003 at 177 pence; and
(b) 4 April 2003 at 158 pence.
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2003 (31 December) was 211 pence. The range 
during the year was 212.75 pence (high) and 131.5 pence (low). Centrica plc report 2003 35
Directors’ pensions

are shown below.
The Centrica pension scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary , occupational pension scheme. 
Its rules provide for the following main features:
• normal retirement at age 65 (see note on normal retirement age below);
• right to an immediate, unreduced pension on retirement at age 60;
• right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 55, subject to 10 years’ service and 
company consent;
• right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service on reorganisation or for redundancy after age 50;
• life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary;
• spouse’ s pension on death in service payable at the rate of two thirds of the member’ s prospective pension and, 
on death after retirement, two thirds of accrued pension. Children’ s pensions are also payable;
• members’ contributions payable at the rate of 4% of pensionable earnings;
• pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health;
• pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI; and
• no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits. Where such limitation is due to the earnings ‘cap’, benefits are increased
to the level that would otherwise have been paid and are provided via the Centrica unapproved pension scheme. This
scheme is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over Centrica’ s assets to give security equivalent to the
pensions provided to other employees. An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the
company’ s balance sheet.
Normal retirement age
Having considered external market practice and the retirement provision made within Centrica for other senior managers, 
it has been agreed that the executive directors and certain other senior executives will be offered a one-off opportunity to
leave the Centrica pension scheme and join the Centrica management pension scheme. This offer is consistent with the
historical treatment of the Centrica senior management population.
The Centrica management pension scheme has a normal retirement age of 62. Individual accrual rates in respect of past 
and future service will be increased so that the pension expectations of individuals transferring across will be the same 
at the retirement age of 62 as they would have been had they retired at age 65. No individual transferring will receive benefits
from Centrica which when added to their retained benefits elsewhere exceed two thirds of their final pensionable salary .
Further , any request for early retirement will require company consent.
For those members who are affected by the operation of the earnings ‘cap’, Centrica provides top up benefits via 
an unapproved arrangement. The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules 
as apply in respect of the approved portion of the members’ benefits.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 65, based on eligible service to
31 December 2003.
(ii) The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any pension arising from additional voluntary contributions.
The increase in accrued pension adjusted to exclude inflation may be derived by discounting the figure in the first
column by the rate of inflation (2.8% – see note (iv)) and subtracting the figure in the second column.
(iii) Contributions were paid in the year by the directors under the terms of the scheme up to the maximum rate of 15% 
of the earnings ‘cap’.
(iv) The rate of inflation used was 2.8%, the annual rate to 30 September 2003, the date used for pension increases 
under the scheme.
(v) The accrued pension shown for Mike Alexander includes a credit in relation to a transfer from a previous 
employer’ s pension scheme. 36 Centrica plc report 2003 
Remuneration report continued
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year that give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and the group
and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements the directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group
will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the
above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the company and 
the group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the company and the group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
(vi) With effect from 1 January 1998, the pensions for Mike Alexander and Mark Clare have accrued at the rate of
2.26% (approximately 
1
/ 44 ) and 2.28% (approximately 
1
/ 44 ) of pensionable salary respectively for each year of
pensionable service. Pensions in relation to service prior to 1 January 1998 will continue to accrue at the rate of
1.67% (
1
/ 60 ) of pensionable salary .
(vii) Mike Alexander retired from the Company on 28 February 2003. In accordance with the rules of the scheme he
receives an unreduced pension. The significant increase in the transfer value between 31 December 2002 and 
31 December 2003 is almost all accounted for by the fact that the pension is now in payment whereas, as at
31 December 2002, it was calculated on the basis of an assumed retirement date at age 60. Because the increase 
in the amount of pension is less than the rate of inflation (see note (iv)) no figure is given in the final column of the
table. This is because that column is derived from the increase in pension as distinct from the increase in the value
of the pension.
(viii)The pension for Phil Bentley accrues at the rate of 2.31% (approximately 
1
/ 43 ) of pensionable salary for each year
of pensionable service.
(ix) The pensions for Sir Roy Gardner and Roger Wood accrue at the rate of 3.33% (
1
/ 30 ) of pensionable salary per year
of service.
(x) Had the change in normal retirement age for individuals referred to above been implemented at 31 December 2003
it would have resulted in the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension excluding inflation for Phil Bentley ,
Mark Clare, Sir Roy Gardner and Roger Wood being £156,155, £344,343, £1,640,835 and £937,152 respectively;
and the increase in accrued pension for those directors being £16,700, £34,000, £104,600 and £51,600 respectively .

Independent auditors’ report to the members of
Centrica plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise
the profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the cash
flow statement, the statement of total recognised gains
and losses and the related notes, which have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and the
accounting policies set out in the principal accounting
policies note. We have also audited the disclosures
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act
1985 contained in the directors’ remuneration report 
(‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual
report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the statement
of directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also
responsible for preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration 
report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report
including the opinion has been prepared for and only 
for the company’ s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose 
or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the auditable part of the 
directors’ remuneration report have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ 
report is not consistent with the financial statements, 
if the company has not kept proper accounting records, 
if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual
report and consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other
information comprises only the directors’ report, the
unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report, the
chairman’ s statement, the chief executive’ s statement, the
operating and financial review, the group financial review,
the statement of corporate responsibility , the corporate
governance statement and the gas and liquids reserves. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement
reflects the company’ s compliance with the seven
provisions of the Combined Code issued in 1998 specified
for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority , and we report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the board’ s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the company’ s or group’ s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the company’ s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion 
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the company and the group at
31 December 2003 and of the profit and cash flows 
of the group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the directors’ remuneration report 
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies 
Act 1985 have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the financial statements
1 Principal accounting policies
Accounting principles
The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with applicable accounting standards and
under the historical cost convention and the Companies
Act 1985 except for the accounting policy for energy
trading activities. Further details explaining this departure
are contained in note 28(f) to the financial statements. 
The accounting policies, where applicable, are in
accordance with the SORP issued by the Oil Industry
Accounting Committee entitled Accounting for Oil 
and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and
Decommissioning Activities.
Basis of preparation
The group financial statements consolidate the accounts
of the company , all of its subsidiary undertakings and
incorporate the results of its share of all joint ventures 
and associates. The results of undertakings acquired 
are consolidated from the date the group gains control. 
No profit and loss account is presented for the company 
as permitted by Section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985.
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund has been
consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary in accordance with
FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of T ransactions.
A joint venture is an entity in which the group has a long term
interest and shares control with one or more co-venturers.
The consolidated financial statements include the group
portion of turnover , operating profit or loss, exceptional
items, interest, taxation, gross assets and gross liabilities 
of the joint venture (the gross equity method).
An associated undertaking (associate) is an entity in which
the group has a long term equity interest and over which it
exercises significant influence. The consolidated financial
statements include the group portion of the operating 
profit or loss, exceptional items, interest, taxation and 
net assets of associates (the equity method).
Turnover
T urnover represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided in the normal course of business, net 
of trade discounts, VA T and other sales related taxes.
Energy supply: T urnover for energy supply activities
includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers
between the date of the last meter reading and the year 
end (unread). Unread gas and electricity is estimated 
using historical consumption patterns and is included 
in accrued energy income within debtors.
Energy trading: T urnover comprises amounts realised 
from physical sales of natural gas and electricity
recognised in the period of delivery .
Storage services: Storage capacity revenues are
recognised evenly over the contract period, whilst
commodity revenues for the injection and withdrawal 
of gas are recognised at the point of gas flowing into 
or out of the storage facilities.
Home services: Where the group has an ongoing obligation
to provide services, revenues are apportioned on a time
basis and amounts billed in advance are treated as
deferred income and excluded from current turnover .
AA road services: Membership subscriptions are
apportioned on a time basis over the period of 
the membership.
Financial services: T urnover includes interest, fees and
commissions receivable from financial services activities.
T elecommunications: T urnover is recognised on the 
basis of telephony services provided to customers 
in the financial period.
Cost of sales
Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity
produced and purchased, and related transportation, 
royalty costs and bought in materials and services. Gas
production costs include petroleum revenue taxes (PRT)
calculated on a unit of production basis, with changes in
estimates dealt with prospectively over the remaining lives
of gas fields. Home services cost of sales include direct
labour and related overheads on installation works, repairs
and service contracts. AA road services cost of sales
includes AA patrol and third party agents costs, as well 
as central deployment costs. Financial services cost of
sales includes finance charges on working capital facilities
used to finance banking receivables and interest payable
on customer deposits.
Employee share schemes
The group has a number of employee share schemes,
detailed in the directors’ report on page 26 and on pages
30 to 31. As permitted by UITF Abstract 17 , the group does
not recognise the difference between market value and
option price to employees in relation to the UK and Irish
sharesave schemes within the profit and loss account, on
the basis that the schemes are offered to all employees in
those countries. The cost of potential share awards under
the group’ s long term incentive scheme is charged
to the profit and loss account over the period to which the
performance criteria of each allocation relates. Cost is
defined as the difference between the contribution
receivable from employees and the market value at the
date of grant, or the actual cost of shares where market
purchases are made at, or around, grant date. Cost also
includes provision for employer’ s National Insurance
charges expected to arise at exercise dates.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development expenditure is charged 
to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint
ventures are translated into sterling at average rates of
exchange for the relevant period. Differences resulting from
the retranslation of the opening net investment in overseas
subsidiary undertakings and from the retranslation of the  42 Centrica plc report 2003 
Notes to the financial statements continued
1 Principal accounting policies continued
opening net assets and the results of these entities for the
year are taken to reserves, and are reported in the
statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings,
foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts
used to finance or hedge foreign currency net investments
in overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures 
are taken directly to reserves and are reported in the
statement of total recognised gains and losses. All other
exchange movements are recognised through the profit
and loss account.
Intangible fixed assets
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business 
acquired after 1 January 1998 is included in the balance
sheet at cost, less accumulated amortisation and any
provisions for impairment. On the acquisition of a
subsidiary undertaking (including unincorporated
businesses), joint venture or associate, fair values are
attributed to the assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill,
which represents the difference between the purchase
consideration and the fair values of those net assets,
is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over
a period which represents the directors’ estimate of its
useful economic life. Goodwill which arose on acquisitions
after 1 January 1998 is being amortised over periods
ranging from 5 to 20 years. Goodwill which arose prior to
1998 was written off directly to the profit and loss reserve. 
If an undertaking is subsequently sold, the appropriate
unamortised goodwill or goodwill written off to reserves
is dealt with through the profit and loss account in the
period of disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
T angible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are included in the balance sheet 
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any 
provisions for impairment.
In the case of investments in customer relationship
management (CRM) and other technology infrastructure,
cost includes contractors’ charges, materials, direct labour
and directly attributable overheads. Capitalisation begins
when expenditures for the asset are being incurred and
activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use 
are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially
all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset 
for use are complete. Depreciation commences at the
point of commercial deployment.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible fixed assets,
except exploration and production assets, are depreciated
on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the
cost, less estimated residual values, of individual assets
over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation periods
for the principal categories of assets are as follows:
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years
Plant 5 to 20 years
Power stations 20 years
Equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years
Storage up to 28 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term or their useful economic life.
Exploration and production assets are capitalised 
using the successful efforts method and depreciated 
from the commencement of production in the fields
concerned, using the unit of production method, 
based on all of the proven and probable reserves of 
those fields. Changes in these estimates are dealt 
with prospectively . The net carrying value of fields in
production is compared on a field-by-field basis, with 
the likely future net revenues to be derived from the
estimated remaining commercial reserves. A provision 
is made where it is considered that recorded amounts
are unlikely to be fully recovered from the net present
value of future net revenues.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised 
and included in tangible fixed assets at cost. The
obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance
charges in respect of future periods, are included 
within borrowings. The interest element of the rental
obligation is allocated to accounting periods during 
the lease term to reflect the constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the obligation for each
accounting period. Rentals under operating leases 
are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-
line basis.
Asset impairments
Intangible and tangible fixed assets are reviewed for
impairments if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the
recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the 
net present value of expected future cash flows of the
relevant income generating unit or disposal value, if higher .
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce the
carrying amount to its estimated recoverable amount.
Investments
Other fixed asset investments are included in the balance
sheet at cost, less accumulated provisions for amortisation
and any impairment.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost
and net realisable value.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net
realisable value.
T ake or Pay contracts
Where payments are made to external suppliers under
T ake or Pay obligations for gas not taken, they are 
treated as prepayments and included within debtors.
Decommissioning costs
Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated
cost of decommissioning gas production facilities at the
end of the producing lives of fields, and decommissioning
storage facilities at the end of the useful life of storage  Centrica plc report 2003 43
1 Principal accounting policies continued
facilities based on price levels and technology at the
balance sheet date. Changes in these estimates are dealt
with prospectively . When this provision gives access to
future economic benefits, a decommissioning asset is
recognised. The decommissioning asset is amortised
using the unit of production method, based on proven and
probable reserves. The unwinding of the discount on the
provision is included in the profit and loss account within
the net interest charge.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits
Pensions and other post retirement benefits are accounted
for in accordance with SSAP 24 Pension Costs. Additional
disclosures are also made in the notes to the financial
statements as required under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other
benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the
periods benefiting from employees’ service. The difference
between the charge to the profit and loss account and the
contributions paid to the pension schemes is shown as 
a provision in the balance sheet. The regular pension cost,
variations from the regular pension cost and interest are 
all charged within employee costs, and the straight-line
method is applied for amortising surpluses and interest.
Long term sales contracts
Provision is made for the net present cost, using a risk free
discount rate, of any expected losses on long term sales
contracts, which at inception are onerous. The provision 
is based on the difference between the contracted sales
price and the expected weighted average cost of gas.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, 
is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered)
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing
differences that have originated but not reversed at 
the balance sheet date where transactions or events 
that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future 
or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences
between the group’ s taxable profits and its results as
stated in the financial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in 
periods different from those in which they are recognised 
in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and
therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely 
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in 
the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are
revalued unless, by the balance sheet date, there is a
binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the 
gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised
in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not recognised
when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not 
that the taxable gain will be rolled over , being charged 
to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained
earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only 
to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends
have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement 
to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered
into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted
by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Financial instruments
a) Debt instruments
Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net 
proceeds received after deduction of issue costs, 
adjusted to amortise any discount or premium evenly 
over the term of the debt.
b) Derivative financial instruments
The group uses a range of derivative financial instruments
for both trading purposes and to manage (hedge)
exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign
exchange and energy price risks arising in the normal
course of business. The accounting treatment for these
instruments is dependent on whether they are entered into
for trading or non-trading (hedging) purposes. A derivative
instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes
when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of
the group in line with the group’ s risk management policies.
In addition, there must be a demonstrable link to an
underlying transaction, pool of transactions or specified
future transaction or transactions. Specified future
transactions must be reasonably certain to arise for the
derivative to be accounted for as a hedge.
A discussion on how the group manages its financial risks 
is included in the group financial review on pages 15 to 17.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as follows:
Energy trading activities: The group engages in swaps,
futures, forwards and options in gas, electricity and
weather , for trading purposes. Financial and physical
trading positions are marked to market using externally
derived market prices. Marked to market gains and losses
are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account,
within cost of sales. This is a departure from the
Companies Act 1985 as disclosed within note 28(f). 
The corresponding fair value debtors or creditors 
are included within the balance sheet.
Energy hedging activities: The group engages in gas,
electricity , oil and weather derivatives to hedge against
price exposures arising within the energy supply ,
procurement and retail operations. The derivatives are  44 Centrica plc report 2003 
Notes to the financial statements continued
1 Principal accounting policies continued
matched to the specific exposures they are designed 
to reduce, with gains and losses recognised in the profit
and loss account in the same period as the income and
costs of the underlying hedged transactions.
T reasury hedging activities: The group uses interest rate
swaps, forward rate agreements, foreign currency swaps
and forward exchange contracts to manage exposures 
to interest rates arising on underlying debt and cash
positions or probable future commitments and foreign
exchange risks arising on foreign currency assets and
borrowings, foreign currency forecasted transactions 
and the retranslation of overseas net investments. 
All instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter 
the risk profile on existing underlying exposures and
probable future commitments in line with the group’ s 
risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest 
rate swaps and forward rate agreements are recognised 
as adjustments to the net interest charge over the term 
of the contracts.
Currency swap agreements and forward exchange
contracts are retranslated at the rates ruling in the
agreements and contracts. Resulting gains or losses 
are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses 
on the related borrowings or , where the instrument 
is used to hedge a committed future transaction, 
are deferred until the transaction occurs. Where used 
to hedge overseas net investments, gains or losses 
are recorded in the statement of total recognised 
gains and losses, with interest recorded in the profit 
and loss account.
Where derivatives used to manage interest rate risk or
to hedge other anticipated cash flows are terminated
before the underlying debt matures or the hedged
transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognised
on a basis that matches the timing and accounting
treatment of the underlying debt or hedged transaction.
When an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to 
occur or finance debt is terminated before maturity , 
any deferred gain or loss that has arisen on the related
derivative is recognised in the profit and loss account,
together with any gain or loss on the terminated item.

Overseas losses or taxation not available for credit – 17
Group current tax charge for the year 285 179
c) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the
standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30%. A supplementary charge of 10% is also currently applicable on the
group’ s UK upstream profits. Fair values are attributed to fixed assets on acquisition of businesses and companies and
amortisation or depreciation is subsequently provided based upon those amounts. Were the assets to be sold at the book
values at the balance sheet date without the benefit of tax planning arrangements, the amount of tax that would be
payable is estimated in aggregate to be £180 million (2002: £168 million) of which £121 million (2002: £146 million) is
provided as a deferred tax liability . There is, however , no intention to sell any of these assets in the foreseeable future and
therefore the crystallisation of the above tax charge is considered to be remote. 50 Centrica plc report 2003

9 Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings for the year of £500 million (2002: £478 million) 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 4,235 million (2002: 4,181 million). 
The number of shares excluded 26 million ordinary shares (2002: 27 million), being the weighted average number of 
the company’ s own shares recorded on the group balance sheet during the year in accordance with UITF Abstract 13
ESOP T rusts.
The directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per
ordinary share adjusted for goodwill amortisation and exceptional charges assists with understanding the underlying
performance of the group. The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows:

(i) Acquisitions include adjustments to goodwill totalling £40 million, following final determinations of the provisional 
fair value estimated for Direct Energy Services Inc (formerly Enbridge Services Inc), Electricity Direct, Rough storage 
and WTU/CPL acquisitions made in 2002. Details of the revisions are provided below:
Direct Energy Services Inc
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Direct Energy Services Inc has increased by £10 million to £203 million 
as a result of: a reduction in tangible fixed assets of £7 million to £220 million following final determination of the
depreciated replacement cost; an increase in net current liabilities of £9 million to £13 million following final
determination of debtor recoverable amounts and liabilities arising at acquisition; a decrease in provisions of
£13 million to £31 million following final determination of deferred tax at acquisition; and increased consideration 
of £7 million to £445 million relating to the costs of the acquisition.
Electricity Direct
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Electricity Direct has increased by £12 million to £92 million as a result of: 
a reduction in debtors (amounts falling due within one year) of £17 million to £32 million following final determination 
of the recoverable amounts at acquisition; and increased creditors (amounts falling due within one year) of £7 million
to £62 million following final determination of liabilities at the date of acquisition. On the acquisition of Electricity Direct, 
consideration of £12 million was paid but held in escrow, contingent upon verification of certain working capital
balances acquired. Following verification, an amount of £12 million was repaid to the group. Final consideration
totalled £38 million.
Centrica Storage
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Rough storage has remained unchanged at £nil, however the following
adjustments were made to the fair values at acquisition: a reduction in tangible fixed assets by £18 million to
£445 million following final determination of the value in use; a reduction in creditors (amounts falling due within 
one year) by £2 million to £16 million; a reduction in provisions of £17 million to £140 million following identification 
of certain non-qualifying deferred tax assets during the completion period; and increased consideration of £1 million 
to £489 million relating to the costs of the acquisition.
WTU/CPL
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of WTU/CPL has increased by £18 million to £185 million as a result of: 
a reduction in debtors (amounts falling due within one year) of £19 million to £84 million following final determination 
of the recoverable amounts at acquisition; a reduction in creditors (amounts falling due after more than one year) of 
£17 million to £23 million following final determination of liabilities arising at acquisition; and an increase in contingent
consideration of £16 million to £17 million to reflect expectations at 31 December 2003. Contingent consideration is
dependent on business performance to 2006 and is stated net of an amount recoverable from the vendor in relation to
the liability for regulatory clawback, dependent upon the retention of customers above specific levels in 2002 and 2003. 52 Centrica plc report 2003

(i) The group’s share of net assets of associates was £1 million (2002: £2 million). The group’s share of joint ventures’
gross assets and gross liabilities principally comprised its interests in Humber Power Limited (power generation),
Centrica Personal Finance Limited (AA and British Gas personal loans activities), AA Financial Services (AA credit
card activities) and Luminus NV (energy supply).
The group’s share of joint ventures’ gross liabilities included loans payable to the group amounting to £nil 
(2002: £4 million). The share of Humber Power Limited’s gross liabilities included £268 million (2002: £269 million) of
lease finance, of which £249 million (2002: £254 million) was repayable after more than five years. Although the group
holds a majority of the voting rights in Humber Power Limited, it is restricted in its ability to exercise these rights under
an agreement with the other shareholder . Consequently the investment has not been consolidated but has been
accounted for as a joint venture.

Notes to the financial statements continued
18 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued
(iii) Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage 
facilities at the end of their useful lives. The estimate has been based on proven and probable reserves, price levels 
and technology at the balance sheet date. The timing of decommissioning payments are dependent on the lives 
of the facilities but are anticipated to occur between 2005 and 2042. The profit and loss charge includes £6 million 
of notional interest (2002: £4 million).
(iv) The provision for tax on gas and oil activities has been calculated on a unit of production basis.
(v) This provision included the difference between charges to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the
pension schemes in respect of retirement pensions and other related benefits (note 25).
(vi) The provision represented costs relating to surplus properties, redundancy and other costs relating to reorganisations.
The provision relating to surplus properties was calculated as the lower of the difference between rental costs and 
sub-let income over the remainder of the leases and the potential cost to surrender those leases. The provision for
redundancy costs reflected announced restructuring plans. The majority of these sums are expected to be spent
between 2004 and 2005.
(vii) The sales contract loss provision represented the net present cost, using a risk free discount rate, of expected losses on
long term sales contracts, which at inception are onerous, based on the difference between contracted sales prices and
the expected weighted average cost of gas. These contracts terminate between 2005 and 2006. The profit and loss
charge represents £14 million of notional interest (2002: £14 million).
In previous years, the group renegotiated certain long term T ake or Pay contracts which would have resulted in
commitments to pay for gas that would be excess to requirements and/or at prices above likely market rates. 
The provision represented the net present cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the
renegotiations, which are due for settlement in 2008.
(viii)Other provisions principally cover estimated liabilities in respect of claims reflected in the group’ s insurance
subsidiaries, outstanding litigation and provision for National Insurance payable in respect of long term incentive
scheme liabilities. The National Insurance provision was based on a share price of 211 pence at 31 December 2003
(2002: 171 pence).

Long term incentive scheme
At 31 December 2003, 37 million shares (2002: 34 million) were outstanding in respect of allocations made under the long
term incentive scheme, which includes allocations of 27 million shares (2002: 23 million) that are subject to performance
conditions and allocations of 10 million shares (2002: 11 million) that have reached the conclusion of the performance
period but are subject to a two year retention period. Details of the operation of the long term incentive scheme, in which
the executive directors participate, can be found in the remuneration report on pages 30 and 31.
The Centrica employees share trusts were established to acquire ordinary shares in the company , by subscription 
or purchase, with funds provided by way of interest free loans from the company to satisfy rights to shares on the vesting
of allocations made under the company’ s long term incentive arrangements.
Since the beginning of 2002, no further shares have been acquired by the trust. Any future shortfall will be satisfied 
by the allotment and issue of new shares.
At 31 December 2003, the trusts held 21 million ordinary shares in the company which had a market value of £45 million
(2002: 27 million ordinary shares with a market value of £47 million). Dividends due on shares held in trust are waived in
accordance with the trust deeds. All administration costs are borne by the group.

in the profit and loss account should there be a subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
(ii) Exchange gains of £42 million (2002: £84 million) on net investment in overseas undertakings have been offset 
in full in reserves against exchange losses of £46 million (2002: £92 million) on foreign currency borrowings.
(iii) Centrica intends to fund certain of its long term incentive schemes through the issue of new shares when these
schemes vest. The amount shown represents the expected value of the shares to be issued using the market 
price at the date allocations were granted.

(i) Acquisitions
During the year the group acquired the business and assets of two gas fired power station businesses (Roosecote and
Barry). The group also made a number of smaller acquisitions, including a further equity interest in the Rose gas field in
exchange for its 1.5% equity interest in the Armada field which are aggregated in section (c). The acquisition method of
accounting was adopted in all cases. The analysis of assets and liabilities acquired, and the fair value of these acquisitions
were as shown below. The fair values stated below are provisional because the directors have not yet reached a final

25 Pensions
Substantially all of the group’ s UK employees at 31 December 2003 were members of one of the four main schemes in the
group: the Centrica pension scheme (formerly the Centrica staff pension scheme), the Centrica engineers’ pension
scheme, the Centrica management pension scheme and the AA staff pension scheme. These schemes are defined
benefit schemes and are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified
actuary certifies the rate of employers’ contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the
employees and proceeds from the schemes’ assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under 
the schemes.
The Centrica unapproved pension scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees
whose benefits under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the earnings cap.
Independent actuarial valuations for SSAP 24 purposes at 31 March 2001 showed aggregate actuarial asset values and
those values relative to benefits due to members, (calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and services on an
ongoing basis using the projected unit method) as follows:

past employees. The triennial independent actuarial valuation undertaken at 31 December 2001, assuming a 2.5% 
per annum real increase in premiums, disclosed a liability of £27 million. The provision under this scheme as
recognised under SSAP 24 was £24 million (2002: £21 million). The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under
this scheme was £3 million (2002: £3 million).
(ii) The group has a commitment to provide certain pension and other post retirement benefits to employees of 
Direct Energy Marketing Limited (Canada). The Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan was established on 
1 March 2002 and an independent actuarial valuation carried out on 7 May 2002, which disclosed a surplus in 
respect of pension benefits of £6 million and a deficit in respect of non-pension post retirement benefits of £4 million,
resulting in a net surplus of £2 million. The provision under this scheme as recognised under SSAP 24 was £1 million
(2002: £1 million surplus). The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was £2 million (2002: 
£1 million).
The total net cost to the group of other retirement benefits on a SSAP 24 basis was £5 million (2002: £4 million).
Additional disclosures regarding the group’ s defined benefit pension schemes, the unapproved pension arrangement 
and the post retirement medical plan are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits. 
The disclosures provide information which will be necessary for the full implementation of FRS 17 in due course.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March
2001, the unapproved pension scheme at 6 April 2002, the Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan at 7 May 2002
and the post retirement medical liability at 31 December 2001. These have been updated to 31 December 2003 for the
purposes of meeting the requirements of FRS 17. Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at market value.

26 Commitments and contingencies
a) Acquisitions
On 10 December 2002 the group reached agreement to acquire the retail gas and electricity supply business of the A TCO
Group in Alberta, Canada for consideration of approximately £52 million, payable over two years.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
b) Capital expenditure
At 31 December 2003, the group had placed contracts for capital expenditure amounting to £74 million (2002: £106 million) 
of which £41 million relates to the investment in customer relationship management infrastructure (2002: £72 million).
c) Decommissioning costs
The company and its wholly owned subsidiary , Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide security 
to BG International Limited, which, as original licence holder for the Morecambe gas fields, will have exposure to
decommissioning costs relating to the Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully discharged by the group. 
The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields falls below
150% of the estimated cost of such decommissioning. The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and
will remain in force unless and until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant
Department of T rade and Industry decommissioning notice in respect of the Morecambe gas fields has been revoked.
d) Lease commitments

At 31 December 2003 there were £1 million of finance lease commitments for which inception occurs after 31 December 2003
(2002: £nil).
e) Litigation
The group has a number of outstanding disputes arising out of its normal activities, for which provisions have been made,
where appropriate, in accordance with FRS12.
f ) Guarantees and indemnities
The company has £915 million of bilateral credit facilities (2002: £1 billion). Hydrocarbon Resources Limited and British
Gas T rading Limited have guaranteed, jointly and severally , to pay on demand any sum which the company does not pay
in accordance with the facility agreements.
The group and BG Group plc have agreed, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify each other against certain actual
and contingent liabilities associated with their respective businesses.
In relation to the sale and leaseback of the Morecambe gas field tangible fixed assets recorded in these financial
statements, the group has given guarantees amounting to £60 million (2002: £92 million).
The group has given guarantees in connection with the finance lease obligations relating to Humber Power Limited
referred to in note 12. A fixed collateral payment amounting to £225 million (2002: £225 million) is required in the event of 
Centrica plc failing to retain at least one credit rating which is not on credit watch above the BBB+/Baa1 level, and further
collateral of £75 million (2002: £75 million) is required if the credit rating falls further . 66 Centrica plc report 2003 
Notes to the financial statements continued
26 Commitments and contingencies continued
Group companies have given guarantees and indemnities, subject to certain limitations, to various counterparties in
relation to wholesale energy trading and procurement activities, and to third parties in respect of gas production and
energy transportation liabilities.
In connection with their energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain group companies have entered 
into contracts under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a
significant deterioration in credit worthiness. The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the 
third party at the point of deterioration.
Following the closure of the British Gas Energy Centres Limited (Energy Centres) operations in July 1999, guarantees
have been signed on certain former Energy Centres’ properties as a result of reassignment of leases.
g) Gas purchase contracts
The group is contracted to purchase 76 billion therms of gas (2002: 65 billion therms) in Britain under long term contracts. 
The significant increase on last year is largely due to the addition of a contract agreed in 2002 with Statoil to procure 
17 billion therms over 10 years from 1 July 2005. Last year this contract was not included in the numbers below as it was
conditional, however during 2003 it became unconditional. The gas contract commitments include several contracts with
prices linked to the market price for gas and legacy contracts at prices, mainly determined by various baskets of indices
including oil prices and general inflation, which may exceed market gas prices from time to time.
The total volume of gas to be taken under these long term contracts depends upon a number of factors, including 
the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis. Based upon the
minimum volume of gas that the group is contracted to pay for in any year , the profile of the contract commitments 
is estimated as follows:
2003 2002
million million
therms therms
Within five years 43,500 45,900
After five years 32,400 19,200
75,900 65,100
The directors do not consider it feasible to estimate reliably the actual future cost of committed gas purchase as the
group’ s weighted average cost of gas from these contracts is subject to a variety of indexation bases. The group’ s average
cost of gas from its contracts with third parties for the year ended 31 December 2003 was 20.8 pence per therm (for the
year ended 31 December 2002: 19.6 pence per therm).
2003 2002
The commitment profile on this same basis is set out below: £m £m
Within one year 2,200 1,900
Between one and five years 6,800 7,000

(iv) The fair values of energy derivatives are calculated as the product of the volume and the difference between their strike
or traded price and the corresponding market prices. The market price is based upon the corresponding closing price
of that market. Where there is no organised market and/or the market is illiquid, the market price is based upon
management estimates, taking into consideration all relevant current market and economic factors. Energy derivatives
held for trading includes both physical and financial energy contracts entered into for trading purposes. Prior year
amounts have been restated to include the fair value of physical energy trading contracts as explained in note 28f.
(v) The fair values of these financial instruments are based upon discounted cash flows, using discount rates based upon 
the group’ s cost of borrowing.
(vi) Fair values have been determined by reference to closing prices at 31 December . 70 Centrica plc report 2003 
Notes to the financial statements continued
28 Financial instruments continued
f) Gains and losses on financial instruments held for trading
The group engages in swaps, futures, forwards and options in gas, electricity and weather , for trading purposes. Financial
and physical trading positions are marked to market using externally derived market prices and any gain or loss arising is
recognised in the profit and loss account. This is not in accordance with the general provisions of Schedule 4 of the
Companies Act 1985, which requires that these contracts be stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value or that, if
revalued, any revaluation difference be taken to a revaluation reserve. However , the directors consider these requirements
would fail to provide a true and fair view since the marketability of energy trading contracts enables decisions to be taken
continually whether to hold or sell them. Accordingly the measure of profit in any period is properly made by reference to
market values. The effect of this departure from the historical cost convention on the financial statements for the year is an
increase in profit for the year amounting to £5 million (2002: £7 million) and an increase in net assets at 31 December 2003
of £14 million (2002: £9 million).
Energy derivatives held for trading include both physical and financial energy contracts entered into for trading purposes.
Prior year amounts in note 28e have been restated to include the fair value of physical energy trading contracts amounting
to a net liability of £22 million. The net gain from trading in energy derivatives included in the profit and loss account for 
the year ended 31 December 2003 is £17 million (2002: £nil). The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held
for trading purposes at 31 December 2003 amounted to £125 million and £115 million respectively (2002: £94 million
financial assets and £111 million financial liabilities). The average fair value of instruments held during the year ended
31 December 2003 did not materially differ from the year end position.
g) Gains and losses on hedges
The group uses financial instruments to hedge its currency , interest, energy price and weather exposures. 
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives used are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged 
position itself is recorded therein. Unrecognised and deferred gains and losses on hedges arose as analysed below:

h) Additional disclosures for Goldfish Bank
Prior to 30 September 2003, the three core products of Goldfish Bank were the Goldfish credit card, loans and savings
accounts. On 30 September 2003 Goldfish Bank sold its credit card and loan business to Lloyds TSB Bank plc and on the
same day repaid the balance on the working capital facility , with the surplus cash invested in short term deposits. 
Since that date, the company has wound down its savings product balances, and at 31 December 2003 transferred 
the small residual balances on these accounts to a trust managed by Barclays Bank plc. Goldfish Bank ceased trading 
on 31 December 2003 and ended all regulated business at that point.
Goldfish Bank did not hold any derivatives at 31 December 2003. All derivatives previously held were used to hedge
interest rate risk. Goldfish Bank did not hold any derivatives for trading. At 31 December 2003 Goldfish Bank held short
term deposits amounting to £143 million, with a maturity date of no more than three months, and other non-interest
bearing assets of £15 million.

The Fund commenced operating on 17 December 2002. At 31 December 2003 Centrica held a 19.9% interest in the Fund
(2002: 41.9%), through its wholly owned subsidiary , Enbridge Services Inc, which holds 100% of the Class B
exchangeable units in Waterheater Holding Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the Fund. Class B Exchangeable Units
attract comparable voting rights to Units of the Fund and are exchangeable into Class A Units of the Fund.
Class A units of the Fund are traded on the T oronto Stock Exchange and represent the minority interest included in the
group financial statements. The Fund’ s full financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting practices in Canada, and accordingly there are differences between the Fund’ s financial statements and the
amounts included within the financial statements of the Centrica group.
(i) Creditors (amounts falling due after more than one year) comprise C$500 million of bonds issued by the Consumers’
Waterheater Income T rust, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund. These bonds carry interest at a fixed rate and an
expected final repayment date of between 11 and 13 years. The issuer , guarantor and holders of this debt have
acknowledged in writing that the notes do not represent obligations (as to principal or interest) of any person other 
than the issuer and each of the guarantors. Accordingly there is no recourse to the group. 74 Centrica plc report 2003

Challenge 
We are constantly striving for
continual improvement; we are
never satisfied. We engage
constructively with advocates
and critics from within and
outside the company . We do 
this to maintain our competitive
edge and deliver consistently
outstanding shareholder returns.
Support 
We support employees seeking 
to meet and own challenges. 
We foster teamworking and
knowledge sharing, and 
give our employees the 
tools and training they 
need to do their job well. 
Passion for customers 
This value is central to the way
we work. We have an ethos of
delivering outstanding customer
service. We must be able to
anticipate our customers’ needs
and correct any errors promptly .
We must give value for money
and deliver efficient and effective
products and services.
Pride 
Pride comes from the
satisfaction of our customers
and from delivering high quality
products and services. We’re
proud of our staff and their
achievements, and we
recognise and reward success.
Trust 
T rust is at the heart of our
relationships with customers.
T rust means doing what we 
say and acting with integrity . 
We demonstrate trust by
respecting and empowering 
our employees. Building trust
will help us develop strong 
future relationships with 
our stakeholders. Centrica plc review 2003 01
Centrica has made steady
progress during 2003 against a
backdrop of uncertain economic
conditions, rising energy prices
and challenging regulatory
issues in some of our markets.
Our continued focus on
understanding and providing
what our customers want, and
our skill in managing the risks of
sourcing the energy to meet their
needs, have helped us to achieve
growth to record levels in both
revenues and earnings.
The development of competitive
markets is important for our
strategy . In 2003 we saw a
continuing commitment to a 
fully transparent energy market
in Britain, with new legislation to
introduce a competitive electricity
trading system in Scotland. In
Europe, the new energy directives
are now in place, and we look
forward to the establishment of 
a properly competitive market.
The regulatory environment in
North America remains varied,
but overall we have continued 
to prosper in our chosen
markets. There has been 
further progress in improving 
the competitive nature of the 
UK telecommunications market,
but there is some way to go
before a level playing field is
firmly established.
In 2003 there were sharp rises 
in UK wholesale prices in both
gas and electricity despite lower
than average consumption due
to warmer weather . The long
term outlook for gas supply in
the UK is improving, with an
increasing diversity of supply
and further links between the 
UK and mainland Europe. It
seems inevitable, however , 
that the increasing costs of
complying with the UK and EU
regulations designed to deliver 
a low carbon economy will
create upward pressure on
consumer electricity prices.
Dividend
The board of directors is
proposing a final dividend of 
3.7 pence per share to be paid 
in June 2004. This means that,
when combined with the interim
dividend of 1.7 pence per share
paid in November 2003, the 
total dividend for 2003 will be 
5.4 pence per share. This total
per share increase of 35%
reflects our continuing
confidence in the outlook for
both cash flow and earnings 
in the medium term.
The board of directors
Sir Brian Shaw retired in May
2003 and we are most grateful
for the part he played in the
development of Centrica. 
It is fitting that he continues to
chair the AA Motoring T rust, an
independent charity supported
by Centrica. Mike Alexander ,
who made a considerable
contribution to the success 
of Centrica, retired from the
company in February 2003. In
December , my own retirement
was announced and my
successor , Roger Carr , subject
to re-election to the board, will
be taking over as chairman at 
the end of the annual general
meeting (AGM) in May .
The future
Centrica has made enormous
progress over the past seven
years, rising from the bottom 
half of the FTSE 100 Index 
to position itself in the top 30
companies in the UK; growing
from our British Gas base
through the acquisition of 
the AA, the movement into
telecommunications and
international expansion. 
I am delighted that we have
established a solid platform 
from which continued delivery 
of our strategy will produce
strong medium term growth.
The commitment and dedication
of our employees have ensured
that 2003 has been another very
successful year for the group
and I would like to thank them 
all for their hard work. I am
confident that, with the 
excellent management team 
led by Sir Roy Gardner , along
with the experience brought 
by Roger Carr as the new
chairman, and the collective
efforts of all our employees, 
the company will continue 
to go from strength to strength.
Our continued focus on understanding and providing
what our customers want has helped us to achieve
growth in both revenues and earnings.

Business review 
I am delighted to report that we
have achieved record profits in
2003. Overall the group
delivered a strong performance
with adjusted basic earnings
per share up 11% on 2002 and
group turnover (excluding
Accord revenue) up 17%.
In the home
Did you know... ?
> British Gas is the biggest
supplier of both residential
gas and electricity in Britain.
> We have 7,160 qualified
engineers and 844
contractors who completed
around 7.2 million jobs during
the year .
> One in four homes in Britain
with gas central heating has 
a ServiceCare contract 
with British Gas.
> Almost 130,000 customers
have signed up to online 
e-bills since the launch of
paperless billing in May 2003.
Operating profit* of £1,058 million
was up 14% from £932 million in
2002. The reduction in operating
profit in British Gas residential
and Centrica Business Services,
because of the warm weather
and higher commodity and
transportation costs, was 
offset by much improved
performance in Centrica 
North America, the AA, Centrica
Energy Management Group 
and a full year contribution 
from Centrica Storage.
Outlook
British Gas is now part way
through a major business
transformation. This root and
branch reform of systems and
processes will transform the
customer experience, which is 
at the heart of the profitability of
the business. However , we have
taken the decision to extend the
testing and deployment period 
in order to be confident in the
integrity of the systems and our
ability to maintain customer
service levels. The additional
functionality and a £40 million
reallocation of costs previously
budgeted elsewhere in British
Gas bring the expected spend 
to £400 million. While the next
two years will be challenging 
we still expect to see the first
benefits in 2005.
With churn rates in the British
retail energy industry stabilising,
we expect recent levels of
customer losses in gas and
gains in electricity to be
maintained through 2004.
However , it is too early to 
assess the precise effect 
of the price rise in January 
2004. A key aim will be to build
on our success in 2003 with
higher value customers. T o
assist the expansion of the
brand and the retention of
energy customers, early in 2004
British Gas Communications 
will trial a wholesale line rental
(WLR) telecoms solution, which
means customers would receive
a single bill for line rental and 
call charges. 
At Centrica Business Services,
we will seek to consolidate our
position as the leading supplier of
energy products to the commercial
sector in Britain. We are now
concentrating on investing 
to transform the customer
experience, on enhancing 
our ability to react to market
changes, and on cross-selling. 
We intend to add to our UK gas
and power asset portfolio in
2004. W e expect to invest around
£100 million per year in gas
reserves and £250 million over
the next three years in electricity
assets. There is a clear strategy
in place for renewable energy
generation and in 2004 we expect
to begin building the 90MW
offshore wind farm at Barrow.
We have taken measures over
recent years to increase the
deliverability from our gas fields.
While gas production from
Morecambe will decline in the
medium term, we expect 2004
levels to be similar to 2003.
We have a programme of
maintenance work on our 
Rough gas storage facilities,
which will further improve 
the operational performance 
of the asset. We expect the
profitability of this asset to
outstrip our initial expectations
and show a marked year-on-
year improvement.
The AA will continue to seek
growth by developing products,
improving operational
efficiencies and realising
benefits from the rollout of 
new technology to the roadside
patrols. An integrated customer
services organisation will deepen
our customer relationships.
T o maintain its competitive
position in the UK telecoms
market, One.T el is establishing a
call centre in India. W e expect this
to lower costs while maintaining
the current customer service
levels. In this business too, we
will be trialling a WLR solution.
In North America, we plan to
move forward steadily . We 
aim to grow organically by
concentrating on value. Our
business services organisation
will enter new markets, targeting
medium sized enterprises. We
will seek to underpin our retail
electricity customer operations
in Ontario and T exas with
investment in power generation.
Competition in Europe is likely to
continue to develop at different
speeds in the short term. We are
well positioned to enter available
markets at the right time.
Our progress in 2003 has only
been possible because of the
efforts of our employees. Further
growth depends on having
skilled people who are committed
to the success of the company .
We have a clear strategy . Our
focus on value delivery , including
value-adding acquisitions, will
enable us to grow both revenue
and earnings in the medium term.
We remain committed to a
financial structure which best
rewards our shareholders. We
expect this to include, in 2004,
another significant step towards
our targeted dividend payout
ratio of 40%.
An increasing number of British Gas engineers
are equipped with diagnostic laptops for central
heating repairs.
We believe the fundamental drivers of profitability in our
brand units will continue to improve as we broaden and
deepen the relationships we have with our customers.

British Gas 
‘Doing the Right Thing’ to build the brand
British Gas increased its turnover by 2.4% to £6.2 billion as a
result of an increase in our residential electricity market share,
higher energy pricing and more growth in home services. But
the warm weather and higher commodity and transportation
costs led to a 16% fall in operating profit* to £206 million. 
We spent £61 million to meet our obligations under the
government’ s Energy Efficiency Commitment and invested
£32 million in our engineer training academy.
The British Gas transformation programme to enhance
customer service has continued to progress. It will eventually
offer a ‘one stop shop’
experience with each 
call dealt with by a single
customer service agent 
from start to finish. A major
culture change programme
‘Doing the Right Thing’ was
launched to help embed 
new ways of working.
Home services
Our home services business grew in 2003, with turnover increasing
4.6% to £847 million and operating profit* up 38% to £84 million. Our
continuing improvement is an indication of the strength of the British
Gas brand. Rapid growth came with newer products – home electrical
care, kitchen appliance care and plumbing and drains care. 
Home services products have a positive impact on the retention 
of energy customers, so we have increased our staff, with the total
number of qualified engineers growing by 955 to 7,160.

British Gas Communications
British Gas takes care

A 13% improvement in average revenues per customer helped push
turnover up 8% to £56 million. This year , we intentionally acquired
fewer customers, focusing on reducing customer churn. The decline
in churn resulted mainly from the promotion of an enhanced carrier
pre-selection product. This has all combined to cut the operating
loss of the business from £35 million to £14 million.
Our commitment to stamping
out mis-selling has led to a
reduction in the number of
complaints reported to
energywatch. Complaints about
our selling practices at the end of
2003 were just 38% of the April
2002 level. The company is
leading an industry-wide project,
supported by UK energy
regulator Ofgem and by
energywatch, to streamline the
process of switching suppliers.
During the year , we focused our
efforts on enhancing the value we
derive from our relationship with
customers rather than simply
seeking to increase the number
we serve. The net result of this is
that we have managed to increase
our customer relationships by
145,000 while reducing
acquisition costs and churn. Renewables
We have entered a joint venture with DONG and
Statkraft to build a 90MW offshore wind farm at
Barrow and have acquired the Inner Dowsing and
Lynn offshore wind farm developments in The
Wash, with a combined generation potential of
180MW . In the April 2002/March 2003 supply year ,
Centrica fulfilled its obligation to source 3% of
electricity from renewable sources through the
purchase of certificates and is on track to meet the
4.3% target for the current supply year .
Accord
Accord made an operating profit of £17 million,
£13 million of which came in the first half of the year .
In the second half, gas trading profits fell because of
severe restrictions in gas flow through the continental
interconnector and field closures in the North Sea.
06 Centrica plc review 2003 
Through the year , Centrica
Business Services has
maintained its position as the
number one supplier of energy
to the commercial sector in
Britain (measured by supply
points) with a market share of
29%. However , 2003 was a
challenging year . T urnover was
up 16% to £1.1 billion due to the
full year impact of our Electricity
Direct acquisition. But operating
profit* fell to £51 million, hit
mainly by warmer than average
weather , lower gas consumption
and a rise in wholesale prices.
We are rationalising the
business systems we have
inherited and plan to roll out new
systems from 2005 to improve
service and lower costs.

New investment brings a wind of change
Gas production
Upstream gas profits increased by 7% to £480
million despite a 4% fall in production volumes.
We won a contract to develop and operate a new
gas reception terminal at Easington, which will land
gas from Norway’ s Ormen Lange field. First gas is
expected through the terminal in 2006.
After acquiring the remaining 60% of the Rose field,
development progressed more rapidly than
planned, bringing first gas on stream in January
2004. We reached agreement to buy a share of 
the Orwell and Statfjord fields for £60.7 million 
in January 2004, bringing us 280 million therms 
of gas and nine million barrels of oil reserves.
Industrial sales and wholesaling
Sales volumes rose by 7% as warmer weather
reduced consumption in our retailing businesses,
allowing profitable sales of excess contracted gas
into the wholesale market particularly in the first half
of the year . However , one-off factors in the second
half lowered operating profit by 11% to £64 million.
Electricity generation
In April 2003, we acquired the 229MW Roosecote
plant in Barrow and, in July , the 240MW Barry plant
in South Wales, taking our total generation
capacity to 2,174MW . T otal electricity generated

The AA now has an integrated customer
services team.
We work around the clock to produce energy
for our customers.
Specialised computer systems enable our
patrols to fix more breakdowns at the side of
the road.
The AA ’ s innovative parts

insurance products have
achieved record sales despite 
a flat overseas tourism market.

The AA Service Centres made 
an operating loss* of £20 million
on turnover up 10%.
T urnover for AA T yre Fit, our
mobile tyre-fitting business,
climbed by £6 million following
the expansion of the fleet from
50 to 170 vans to provide
national coverage. 
Operating profit* in the driving
school more than doubled, with
record numbers of pupils and
instructors. Publishing, car data
check and roadside signs also
made positive contributions. In
the Republic of Ireland profits
nearly doubled.

One.T el has continued to develop new products and internal
processes that work better for customers. We have also
lobbied for regulatory improvements on carrier pre-selection
(CPS) and wholesale line rental (WLR).
T urnover rose by 16% to £178 million as a result of the growth in
customer numbers, along with an increase in the average products
per customer to 1.29.
Our fixed line average revenue per user has declined slightly because
we had to make competitive price cuts, especially in international
and national rates. But the uptake of CPS, which means customers
do not have to use a prefix number or a dialler box, has largely offset
the reductions. 
Business review continued

Centrica North America
Operating profits more than doubled 
Residential and small
commercial gas
T urnover climbed by 9%
because of the colder winter and
the additional 300,000 customers
acquired in 2002. However ,
operating profit* fell to £1 million
because of higher wholesale gas
costs, investment in brand
building and increased costs of
customer renewals in Ontario
caused by regulatory changes –
the regulatory situation improved
late in the year . In the US, the
regulatory climate and volatile
prices make it difficult to add
value creating customers. W e
withdrew from Georgia and
Maryland because of insufficient
return on capital.
Residential and small
commercial electricity
T urnover and operating profit*
rose sharply , due in part to full
year contributions from our
Ontario business and to a strong
performance from our recently
acquired businesses in T exas. 
For customers in W est and South
T exas acquired in 2002, the nature
of the regulated tariff kept margins
high in an environment of rising gas
input costs. In the Houston and
Dallas/Fort W orth areas we saw
continued growth with customer
numbers up 59%. In Ontario the
market is still effectively closed to
further growth because of the
price cap. However , this has, in
the short term, reduced customer
churn and our profit margins
remain strong.
Home and business
services
We rebranded the Enbridge
Services business we bought in
May 2002 as Direct Energy
Essential Home Services and
Direct Energy Business Services.
Integrating our home services
and retail energy businesses in
Ontario gives us more cross-
selling opportunities. Customer
numbers in the core heating and
cooling areas rose by 16% to
more than 390,000.
During 2003, we formed a new
business services group, which
enabled us to market energy 
and services to medium sized
commercial and industrial
customers. Early signs are
encouraging. This will be an area
of particular focus for 2004.
Upstream
Gas production volumes declined
slightly . A new well programme
offset the natural decline rates

Luminus lights up the Flanders energy market
The residential gas and
electricity market in the
Belgian region of Flanders
opened for competition on
1 July 2003. Centrica’s joint
venture, Luminus, successfully
switched across its 800,000
customers (about 600,000
electricity and 200,000 gas).
The company is now the clear
number two in the Flanders
energy market. 
We entered the Spanish
electricity market in June 2003
under the Luseo Energía brand,
focusing on small and medium
sized firms. The pace of market
opening will vary across Europe
but we are well positioned to
take advantage of opportunities
as they arise.
In September 2003, the sale 
of the Goldfish credit card and
loan business was completed
for a premium of £112.5 million
above the book value. 
Operating loss* for 2003 was
£27 million. The sale triggered 
a pre-tax exceptional loss of
£51 million. 
Goldfish
Direct Energy provides a range of services in the home.
With the full opening of the market in July , Luminus
is now supplying gas and electricity in Belgium.
We have continued to expand our presence in North America despite
the challenging business and regulatory environment. Operating
profit* increased by 106% to £130 million, reflecting strong
performances in electricity markets, especially in T exas, where
profitability has exceeded expectations.

Corporate responsibility
Through the ‘here to Help’
programme, British Gas has
installed more than 17,000
energy efficiency measures,
referred 10,000 people to charity
partners and helped individuals
identify more than £1.8 million in
unclaimed benefits.
British Gas also worked with
Mencap and the Employers’
Forum on Disability to publish
‘Paying Y our Bills’ (a guide to
household budgeting for people
with a learning disability) and
received the Business in the
Community Education and
Lifelong Learning Excellence
Award for its ‘Think Energy’
programme.
Other highlights included the
launch of The AA Motoring T rust
and raising more than £500,000
for our UK employee charity of
the year , the Meningitis T rust. 
In North America, Direct Energy
combined charitable giving 
with a drive to encourage 
more employees to volunteer 
in their communities.
Reporting and
assurance
There is more detailed
information on our corporate
responsibility activities 
available on our website at
www.centrica.com/responsibility.
We have also produced a short,
printed report that can be
accessed via the website. 
For the first time, we have
commissioned an impartial
assessment of our website
information by a specialist
external agency , The Corporate
Citizenship Company . It has
conducted an assurance
process on the information
presented and provided a
commentary on our progress
towards being a more socially
responsible company . The full
statement is available on-line.
We highlight our major activities
based around a framework
developed by Business in the
Community , under the headings
workplace, marketplace, the
environment and community .
Living our values 
in the workplace
In 2003, we published a guide to
business practice that sets out
the standards of behaviour we
expect from employees. We also
introduced 36 new or revised
workplace policies. Diversity was
identified as a key area and we
appointed a diversity director .
Quality of leadership is a key
factor in achieving our
objectives. We have developed 
a set of leadership guidelines,
incorporating our approach to
running a sustainable business,
and these formed the basis of a
new performance management
system. The number of
graduates we recruited in the 
UK in 2003 increased to 42, up
from 12 in the previous year . 
We created the British Gas
Engineering Academy to 
help train an additional 5,000
engineering recruits, and
introduced a range of
occupational health and safety
initiatives designed to help us
reduce risks within our business.
Improving service 
in the marketplace
We believe we should treat all
our customers fairly and inclusively .
We measure customer
satisfaction yearly , and monthly
indicators are reported to senior
managers. More than 750,000
customers are included on
British Gas, AA and One.T el
registers, advising us, voluntarily ,
of their service needs as a result
of their age or disability . In 2003,
we launched a customer diversity
intranet site to provide employees
with additional advice in this area.
Each month we send out more
than 17,000 bills, statements,
letters and marketing
communications in a variety of
formats including Braille, large
print and audio tape.
We expect our suppliers to
maintain high standards of
behaviour and we set up a team
dedicated to managing our top
20 supplier relationships. This
formal relationship has
encouraged suppliers to work
with us more closely – and has
benefited the group by some
£2.3 million in 2003.
Reducing impact 
on the environment
The acquisition of gas-fired
power stations has influenced
our environmental impact. In
response, we have updated the
environmental management
systems across all our businesses.
We are committed to reducing
building energy use per
employee and increasing the
amount of waste recycled,
particularly in offices. In 2003,
energy consumption per office
based employee was reduced
by 10%. All energy for Centrica
offices is sourced from certified
renewable supplies. Our waste
recycling programme has
achieved significant results, the
office recycling rate rising to 48%.
Our employees play a vital role 
in helping to reduce our
environmental impact. In 2003,
we launched ‘Natural Capital’, a
campaign that aims to increase
employee awareness of
environmental concerns and
encourage direct action.
Working with the 
wider community
Our community investment
programme focuses on social
issues closely aligned with our
business. During 2003, we
contributed £6.6 million to
community causes using the
London Benchmarking 
Group model.
By better understanding our impact on people, 
the economy and the wider environment, we aim to
develop a sustainable approach to doing business.
The creation of the British Gas Engineering Academy has helped us develop and re-focus our training facilities.

from our own assets.
> Since April 2002, the 
British Gas energy

During the year our share price outperformed the market
by nearly 10% and since demerger in February 1997 
we have outperformed the FTSE 100 by 221%.
Centrica’ s aim is to achieve a
total shareholder return ranking
in the first quartile of UK FTSE
100 companies, taking account
of share price growth and
dividends received and
reinvested over a sustained
period. Centrica promotes
continuing growth in earnings
and cash flow and seeks to
maximise the return on capital 
it achieves in excess of its cost 
of capital, within a prudent risk
management framework.
The group’ s closing share price
on 31 December 2003 was
211 pence (31 December 2002:
171 pence), resulting in a market
capitalisation of £9.0 billion
(2002: £7.3 billion). World stock
markets recovered somewhat 
in 2003 with the FTSE 100 rising
by over 13%. The group’ s share
price outperformed the FTSE
100 by 9.8% (2002: 3.1%). Since
demerger in February 1997,
Centrica’ s share price has
outperformed the FTSE 100 
by 221%.
Operating profit
Operating profit* increased to
£1,058 million from £932 million
in 2002, benefiting from a full
year of profits from our 2002
acquisitions in North America.
Exceptional charges and
goodwill amortisation
During the year , non-operating
exceptional charges of
£51 million net of tax arose
(2002: £26 million non-operating
exceptionals net of tax). These
related to the closure of our retail
outlets in Ontario and the
disposal of the Goldfish credit
card and loan business.
The group’ s goodwill
amortisation charge for the year
increased to £161 million from
£123 million in 2002, mainly as a
result of our recent acquisitions
in North America.
Net interest
Net interest charged to the profit
and loss account was £52 million
compared with £62 million in
2002 and was covered 20 times
by operating profit* compared
with 15 times a year earlier .
Taxation
The tax charge for the year 
on profit before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional
charges of £282 million for 2003
represented a 28% rate on
profits* (2002 comparative rate
28%). The overall charge is less
than the UK 30% statutory rate,
primarily due to the utilisation 
of tax losses in the year .
Earnings
Earnings increased by
£22 million to £500 million in
2003. This reflected improved
operating profits* up £126 million,
offset by taxation up from 
£250 million to £266 million and
higher goodwill amortisation, up 
by £38 million to £161 million.
Earnings before exceptional
charges and goodwill
amortisation were up 12% to
£714 million. This represents 
a return on capital employed
over the year of nearly 28% 
or 8.8% on our average 
market capitalisation.
Basic earnings per share grew
from 11.4 pence to 11.8 pence
and adjusted earnings per share
from 15.2 pence to 16.8 pence.
Cash flow
Group operating cash flow 
from continuing operations
(including dividends from joint
ventures and associates, 
before exceptional payments)
was £1,321 million for 2003,
compared with £795 million 
in 2002. The improvement
resulted from the increase in
operating profit as well as
improvements in working 
capital management.

The auditors have issued an unqualified report on the full
financial statements and remuneration report containing
no statement under section 237 (2) or section 237 (3) of 
the Companies Act 1985.
Full report and accounts 
This summary financial statement is a summary of the full
Centrica report and accounts. It does not contain sufficient
information to allow as full an understanding of the results
and state of affairs of the group and of its policies and
arrangements concerning the directors’ remuneration as
would be provided by the full report and accounts. Certain
2002 comparatives have been restated. If you would like a
copy of the Centrica report and accounts for 2003 and/or
future years, free of charge, please contact the Centrica
shareholder helpline (see page 18 for contact details).
Summary directors’ report
This is a summary of the full directors’ report, which 
is contained in the annual report, copies of which are
available from the Centrica website at www.centrica.com
or the Centrica shareholder helpline (see page 18 for
contact details). 
Directors
The biographical details of the directors appear on page 14. 
Principal activities 
The principal activities during 2003 were:
• the provision of gas, electricity and energy-related
products and services in Great Britain, North America
and Europe;
• the operation of gas fields in Great Britain and 
North America and power stations in Great Britain;
• gas storage in Great Britain;
• energy trading in European and North American markets; 
• roadside assistance and other motoring services 
in the UK and Europe;
• the provision of financial services in the UK and Ireland; and

Post balance sheet events
January 2004: agreement to acquire interests in Statfjord
and Orwell gas fields in the North Sea.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 1.7 pence per ordinary share was
paid on 12 November 2003. The directors recommend
that, subject to approval at the annual general meeting 
on 10 May 2004, a final dividend of 3.7 pence per ordinary
share be paid on 16 June to those shareholders registered
on 30 April 2004. This would make a total dividend for the
year of 5.4 pence per share (2002: 4.0 pence per share).
Political and charitable donations
An outline of the group’ s involvement in the community
appears on page 10. Charitable donations in the UK during
the year amounted to £5.3 million (2002: £4.7 million). 
In line with group policy , no donations were made for
political purposes.
Corporate governance
The group is committed to high standards of corporate
governance. During the year , the board has reviewed its
corporate governance arrangements in the light of the 
new Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the 
new Code) and the Guidance on Audit Committees 
(the Smith Guidance) and has made changes as 
necessary and appropriate. As the new Code took effect 
in respect of accounting periods commencing on or after
1 November 2003, this report has been prepared on the
basis of the previous Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the Code). Some additional disclosures 
have been made as a transition towards compliance 
with the new Code. Throughout the year , the company 
fully complied with the provisions of the Code.
Details of how the company applies the principles of the
Code are set out in the report on corporate governance 
in the full report and accounts for the year ended
31 December 2003.  The board
An effective board of directors leads and controls the
group. The board, which meets at least 10 times a year , 
has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval. 
One of its meetings each year is substantially devoted 
to the development of strategy . 
The board is responsible for:
• determination of strategy and major policies;
• review of management performance; and 
• approval of the annual operating plan, the financial
statements, major projects and corporate governance.
The board has delegated authority to a number 
of committees to deal with specific aspects of the
management and control of the group. They are the
executive, audit, remuneration, nominations and 
customer service committees. Directors’ membership 
of these committees is shown on page 14. Full details 
of their respective terms of reference can be found in 
the annual report.
Internal control and business assurance
The board of directors is responsible for the group’ s 
system of internal control, which is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The group’ s business assurance function undertakes
internal audit reviews according to a plan approved 
by the audit committee. The results of their work are
reported to the audit committee on a quarterly basis.
Summary remuneration report 
This is a summary of the full remuneration report, which 
is contained in the annual report, copies of which are
available from the Centrica website at www.centrica.com
or the Centrica shareholder helpline (see page 18 for
contact details).
Composition and role of the remuneration committee
The board has established a remuneration committee,
which is chaired by Patricia Mann. Helen Alexander ,
Roger Carr , Sir Michael Perry and Robert T obin were
members of the committee throughout 2003. 
Paul Walsh became a member when he joined the 
board on 1 March 2003. All members are non-executive
directors and, with the exception of Sir Michael Perry , 
are independent.
The committee makes recommendations to the 
board, within formal terms of reference, on the policy 
and framework of executive remuneration and its cost 
to the company . The committee is also responsible 
for the implementation of remuneration policy and
determining specific remuneration packages for each 
of the executive directors. It has access to advice 
provided by the group human resources director
(Anne Minto), the group head of reward (Mike New), 
the company secretary (Grant Dawson), the chief 
executive (Sir Roy Gardner) and external consultants. 
Framework and policy on executive directors’
remuneration
The group’ s remuneration policy is designed to provide
competitive rewards for its executive directors and other
senior executives, taking into account the company’ s
performance, the markets in which the group operates,
and pay and conditions elsewhere in the group.
In constructing the remuneration packages, the committee
aims to achieve a balance between fixed and variable
compensation for each director . Accordingly , a significant
proportion of the remuneration package depends on the
attainment of demanding performance objectives, both
short and long term. In agreeing the level of base salaries
and the annual performance bonus scheme, the committee
takes into consideration the total remuneration that executives
could receive. The committee reviews the packages and
varies individual elements when appropriate from year to
year . As a matter of policy , the notice periods of the executive
directors’ service contracts do not exceed one year . It is
intended that the current remuneration policy , the executive
share option scheme (ESOS) and the long term incentive
scheme (L TIS) elements of which have been approved by
shareholders, will continue for 2004 and succeeding years. 
Components of remuneration
The components of remuneration for each executive
director include a base salary and an annual performance
bonus. In addition, an annual grant of options is made
under the ESOS and an allocation of shares is made under
the L TIS, both of which are subject to performance
conditions. The performance conditions for L TIS awards
are based on the company’ s total shareholder return (TSR)
relative to the returns of FTSE 100 companies over a three
year performance period. The performance conditions for
the ESOS are based on the extent to which growth in the
company’ s earnings per share exceeds growth in the
Retail Prices Index over a three year performance period.
The following table shows graphs of the company’ s TSR
performance and that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five
years ended 31 December 2003.
Other employment benefits
In common with other senior management, executive
directors are entitled to a range of benefits, including
participation in a contributory final salary pension scheme,
a company car , life assurance, private medical insurance
and a financial counselling scheme. They are also eligible,
on the same basis as other employees, to participate in the
company’ s Inland Revenue approved sharesave and share
incentive plans. These are open to all eligible employees and
provide a long term savings and investment opportunity .

(vii)
4,327 3,913
(i) T otal emoluments include all taxable benefits arising from employment by the company , mainly the provision of a
company car . 
(ii) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 65, based on eligible service to
31 December 2003. Having considered external market practice and the retirement provision made within Centrica 
for other senior managers, the remuneration committee has agreed that the executive directors and certain other
senior executives will be offered a one-off opportunity to leave the Centrica pension scheme and join the Centrica
management pension scheme. This offer is consistent with the historical treatment of the Centrica senior
management population. The Centrica management pension scheme has a normal retirement age of 62. Individual
accrual rates in respect of past and future service will be increased so that the pension expectations of individuals
transferring across will be the same at the retirement age of 62 as they would have been had they retired at age 65. 
Full details of the directors’ pension scheme arrangements can be found in the annual report.
(iii) Options granted to company employees under the British Gas plc executive share option scheme prior to February
1997 were cancelled and replaced at demerger by non-Inland Revenue approved options to acquire Centrica shares
under the restructured share option scheme (RESOS). The replacement options were granted on the same terms 
as British Gas executive share options, with the same exercise date and aggregate exercise price per share, and the
number of shares placed under option was adjusted to take account of the demerger . No further options have been 
or will be granted under this scheme.
(iv) Options were granted under the ESOS on 31 May 2001, 2 April 2002 and 24 March 2003.
(v) T otal allocations held under the L TIS shown above include allocations of shares that are subject to performance
conditions and allocations that have reached the conclusion of the performance period but are subject to a two year
retention period. The performance targets in respect of the allocation of shares held on behalf of Mike Alexander were
achieved in full in September 2002. The shares will be released to him at the end of September 2004.
(vi) The figure above for Sir Brian Shaw includes fees of £7,232 (2002: £20,000) in respect of consultancy services to 
The Automobile Association Ltd while a director of Centrica plc.
(vii) The total emoluments figure for 2002 excludes £22,000 paid to Sir Sydney Lipworth for his services as a director of the
company and one of its subsidiaries during part of that year .
(viii)The aggregate of the amount of gains made by executive directors on the exercise of share options was £1,029,874;
and the aggregate value of shares vested to executive directors under the L TIS was £1,648,680.
As at 9 February 2004, the beneficial shareholdings of the executive directors increased from the totals shown 
at 31 December 2003 by the following number of shares: Phil Bentley 81; Mark Clare 81; and Sir Roy Gardner 81.

Financial highlights
Explanatory notes:
 i)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators.  Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share are stated before 
exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss 
on disposal of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments, and acquisition transaction costs. The narrative 
that follows is based on underlying operating profit, profit before tax and earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide 
a more consistent measure of operating performance.
*  The weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic earnings per share was 266.0 million in 2010 and 211.6 million in 2009, 
following the Rights Issue announced in October 2009.

Chairman’s statement
Strategy
Laird’s strategy is driven by the 
overarching objective of creating 
and growing shareholder value, 
by developing a unique capability 
to provide our customers with a 
wide range of performance critical 
electronics products, systems and 
solutions. Our growth strategy 
encompasses five key elements:
1.  Focus on specialist high 
growth markets
2.  Increase content and value-add 
in each electronic device/unit
3.  Exploit innovation and technology, 
and product convergence
4.  Develop systems and controls 
combining hardware and software
5.  Maintain a culture of operational 
excellence allied to corporate 
social responsibility
Our strategy, developed over a 
number of years is, we believe, 
enduring, and has survived the 
recession. We believe that “breadth 
is strength” and that, together 
with the elements outlined above, 
will over time deliver superior 
shareholder value.
Dividend 
The Board’s dividend policy is to 
increase returns to shareholders over 
time, while taking account of both 
the underlying profitability and cash 
requirements of the business. 
The 2009 full year dividend was 
set at 6.0 pence per share (2008, 
10.31 pence), a level which allowed 
funding of growth opportunities 
while pursuing a progressive 
dividend policy. The Board then 
declared an interim dividend for 2010 
of 2.1 pence, and is recommending a 
final dividend of 4.2 pence per share, 
giving an annual dividend of 6.3 
pence, growth of 5%.
Corporate and Social 
Responsibility
As a forward-thinking business, 
we recognise the need to behave 
as a good corporate citizen 
and therefore corporate social 
responsibility remains an integral 
part of our everyday business. 
We have continued our focus on 
improvement across our business in 
all areas of corporate responsibility 
and have retained our inclusion in 
the FTSE4Good index. Further details 
of Laird’s corporate responsibility 
activities are available in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
section of this report.
Our Employees
In these challenging times I never 
cease to be impressed by the levels 
of enthusiasm and commitment of 
our employees at all levels of the 
organisation. On behalf of the Board 
I would like to pay tribute to our 
global team who have worked 
so hard to make this year’s result 
achievable.
Outlook
During 2010 Laird emerged strongly 
from the global recession and 
financial crisis. The benefits of 
maintaining our spend, during this 
period, on R&D and engineering 
has resulted in our expanding our 
customer base and increasing our 
penetration with most of our existing 
customers. The majority of our 
markets also showed a progressive 
recovery during 2010. We believe 
our strategy to be enduring, the 
fundamentals of our markets remain 
attractive, our financial position is 
strong, and we are well placed to 
pursue further profitable growth.

Chief Executive’s review
Overview
Laird is a leader in the design, 
manufacture and supply of 
customised, performance critical 
products, systems and controls 
for wireless and other advanced 
electronic applications. We design, 
develop and supply the technology 
that allows people, organisations, 
industrial applications and electronic 
devices to connect eff iciently, locally 
and globally. We provide technology
for a connected world. 
In 2010 we began the recovery from 
the global recession and associated 
credit constraints that prevailed during 
the second half of 2008 and during 
2009. We saw the benefits of the 
decisive actions we took during that 
period to reduce costs, and from our 
decisions to maintain engineering 
and R&D expenditure. This allowed 
us to increase our new product 
development, broaden our customer 
base, and improve our operating 
margins, resulting in underlying pre-tax 
profits growing by more than 50%. 
Through our acquisition of Cattron 
Group International Inc. (“Cattron”) 
late in 2010, we have expanded into 
the wireless systems and controls 
area which brings with it services and 
aftermarket revenues. This acquisition 
will form a base for further expansion 
into other “vertical markets” with 
requirements for hardware, software 
and systems applications.
We are well placed to make further 
good progress during 2011.
Results
Revenue from continuing operations in 
2010 was £567 .4 million, up 7% (2009, 
£528.8 million). Excluding Mechanisms 
whose closure was announced at the 
half year, revenues increased 15% in 
the year. T otal revenues in the second 
half of 2010 were up 7% on those in 
the first half expressed in Sterling. 
We saw good growth in 2010 
compared to 2009 in both our 
Performance Materials and Wireless 
Systems divisions. 
 
Sales to our largest OEM customer 
in 2010 accounted for 19% of 
total revenues (2009, 40%). This 
percentage is expected to reduce 
further to between 10% and 15% 
of total revenues in 2011, and is 
expected to stabilise in this range by 
the end of this year. We have grown 
all other revenues by 44% in the year, 
broadening our customer base, in 
particular with a leading supplier 
of smartphones and tablets.
Underlying operating profit from 
continuing operations was £46.4 
million in 2010, up 38% (2009, £33.6 
million). Operating margin was 8.2%, 
up from 6.4% in 2009. The operating 
profit in the second half of 2010, at 
£27 .9 million, grew strongly compared 
with the £18.5 million in the first half. 
Underlying operating margin in the 
second half of the year was 9.5%, 
compared with 6.7% in the first half.
Underlying profit before tax from 
continuing operations was £40.2 
million in 2010, up 52% (2009, £26.5 
million). We believe this to be a very 
creditable result, given the significant 
reduction in revenues from our largest 
customer, rising China labour costs, 
and the adverse eff ects of exchange 
rate movements.
We announced the closure of our 
Mechanisms business at the half 
year, and subsequently undertook 
restructuring actions including 
headcount reductions and the 
consolidation of manufacturing 
facilities, particularly in respect of 
handset antennae and the combining 
of our EMI shielding and handset 
metals product lines. These actions 
resulted in exceptional costs from 
continuing operations of £36.9 million 
being incurred in the year, of which £21.1 
million were non cash costs, principally 
asset impairment charges arising 
from the closure of the Mechanisms

business. Exceptional cash spend in the 
year was £6.9 million, including cash 
spent on exceptional items provided 
for in 2009, and cash spend on 
these items in 2011 will be £11.1 million. 
Annualised savings are expected to 
be approximately £10 million.
Statutory loss before tax from 
continuing operations in 2010, after 
exceptional items, the amortisation 
of acquired intangibles, the gain or 
loss on the disposal of businesses 
and the fair valuing of financial 
instruments, was £8.6 million 
(2009, £4.6 million profit).
We again focused strongly on cash 
generation in 2010, limiting the 
working capital outflows despite 
revenue growth, and with capital 
expenditure held below depreciation. 
Operating cash flow after capital 
expenditure from continuing 
operations was £41.2 million (2009, 
£49.7 million). Cash conversion after 
capital expenditure was healthy at 
89% despite the volume and revenue 
growth (2009, 148%, reflecting the 
marked fall off  in revenues in that year 
compared to 2008).
Net borrowings at 31 December 2010 
were £103.6 million (2009, £45.4 
million), with the increase largely 
due to the acquisition of Cattron in 
November 2010. Net debt to EBITDA 
at year end was a very comfortable 
1.4 times, giving both balance sheet 
strength to withstand any external 
shocks, as well as headroom to pursue 
additional value added acquisitions.
Underlying earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 11.8 pence, 
up 23% (2009, 9.6 pence, adjusted 
for the bonus element of the October 
2009 rights issue), reflecting the higher 
profits off set by the greater number 
of shares in issue.

Interview with Peter Hill
What have been the key 
challenges for you in the 
global electronics markets? 
Although we have visibility on 
customers’ demands on us we 
don’t have visibility on the rest 
of the supply chain. As everybody 
knows, 2009 with the recession 
and the ‘credit crunch’ resulted in 
reduced demand right across the 
board. This covered virtually all 
electronic markets and geographies 
but was particularly pronounced in 
North America and Europe.
Secondly we are very reliant on our 
customers’ own forecasts that they 
make to us, because we have to 
be in a position to supply. So one 
challenge for us is that even if we 
believe that a downturn is coming, 
and if our customers don’t appear 
to, we still have to maintain stock. 
What we saw at the end of 2008 
was a very sudden and very rapid 
de-stocking across the whole of 
the electronic supply chain. 
On top of this, we had to deal with 
our major customer making strategic 
decisions to alter its sourcing 
patterns, which resulted in reduced 
demand for our products from that 
specific customer.
How did Laird meet these 
challenges? 
We very rapidly restructured our 
operations, reduced significantly 
our cost base, and accelerated the 
relocation of manufacturing from 
higher cost areas to Asia. 
At the same time, however, we 
made the strategic decision to 
maintain spending on technology, 
research and development, which 
allowed us to broaden successfully 
our customer base and increase our 
penetration with key customers. 
We also reorganised our divisional 
structure to provide increased 
focus and to maximise synergies 
between our businesses. The recent 
acquisition of Cattron, a leading 
designer and supplier of wireless 
controls, systems and aftermarket 
services for the global industrial, 
rail and mining markets, furthers 
our strategy of diversifying our 
customer and market base, and 
enhanced our ability to provide 
systems and aftermarket services 
to customers. It also builds on 
previous acquisitions, providing 
technology, product development 
and revenue synergies. It is proving 
to be a great acquisition.
What would you say have been 
Laird’s key achievements? 
The actions that we took in late 
2008 and through 2009 benefited 
us strongly in 2010. Assisted by 
a recovery in the majority of our 
markets, underlying profits in 2010 
were 52% higher than in 2009. A 
specific key achievement has been 
the broadening of our customer 
base and the increase in customer 
penetration.
Maintaining our investment in R&D. 
This has resulted in a range of new 
products being introduced, and has 
enabled our Corporate Research 
Laboratory in Bangalore to continue 
its path of innovation. 
The higher speed, power and performance
of electronic devices, as well as the 
universal trend to wireless connectivity,
drives an increasing need for our 
products and solutions.

Many challenges
clearly remain.
However, we will
continue to innovate, 
to seek out new markets
and investment
opportunities, and
expect to make further
signiﬁ cant progress 
in 2011.  7
CSR – How important is 
sustainability and social 
responsibility to you?
It is extremely important. We are 
committed to the Electronics 
Industry Citizenship Coalition 
Code of Conduct, which sets out 
performance, compliance, auditing 
and reporting guidelines across five 
areas of social responsibility: labour, 
health and safety, environmental, 
management systems and ethics.
We are very mindful of our 
responsibilities to our work force 
and their working conditions. 
Competition is increasing for 
talent and skills at all levels, be that 
manufacturing employees, engineers 
or managers – we want to be the 
employer of choice.
We work with our customers on the 
development of new environmentally 
friendly products, and our KPIs 
include continuous improvement in 
our use of resources.
What are your business strategy 
and plans for 2011 and beyond? 
Our goal is to achieve sustainable 
growth through technology 
leadership, a diversified product, 
customer and market base, and 
through our ability to respond 
rapidly to changes in our customers’ 
demands and market dynamics. 
We will continue to expand the 
breadth and depth of customer 
relationships, particularly through 
new product introductions and 
penetration of new market segments. 
Our strategy is to build long-term 
relationships with our customers 
and to increase the proportion 
of our revenues from systems 
and after market revenues. Another 
key element of our strategy is our 
well-established low cost 
manufacturing base. 
 
We are not complacent and we 
expect increasing pressure on 
labour rates and certainly input 
prices. We are well placed though 
to continue to improve our 
manufacturing eff iciencies, including 
greater automation and over time 
expect to add capacity in new lower 
cost regions.
Finally, what excites you the most 
about the year ahead? 
Although the world remains a 
turbulent place we see opportunities 
to maintain our growth both 
organically and through acquisitions. 
Laird’s hallmark has been its ability 
to reinvent and adapt and we believe 
we can continue to do this. 
The fundamentals of our markets 
remain very attractive. Ultimately, 
the higher speed, power and 
performance of electronic devices, 
as well as the universal trend to 
wireless connectivity, drives an 
increasing need for our products 
and solutions. By broadening our 
technology capabilities over recent 
years we are now in a position to 
off er a unique range of components 
and systems, which in turn gives us 
access to new, high growth market 
segments.
Many challenges clearly remain. 
However, we will continue to 
innovate, to seek out new markets 
and investment opportunities, and 
expect to make further significant 
progress in 2011.

in each electronic device/unit
3.  Exploit innovation and technology, 
and product convergence
4.  Develop systems and controls

enduring, and has proved its mettle 
in the recession. We believe that 
“breadth is strength” and that, 
together with the elements outlined 
above, will over time deliver superior 
shareholder value.
Focus on specialist high growth 
markets
Choice of markets is key to our 
growth strategy. In recent years 
we have focused on those showing 
high growth potential, extending 
our presence via capital investment 
in technological and operational 
excellence and via strategic 
acquisitions. We are focusing on a 
“path to growth” that builds on our 
materials science and component 
products, and our wireless antennae 
off ering, leading to convergence 
products and total systems.
Increase our content and value-add 
in each electronic device/unit
Higher speed, power and 
performance of electronic devices, 
as well as the increasing trend to 
wireless connectivity, drives an 
increasing need for our products 
and solutions. By broadening our 
technology capabilities over recent 
years we are now able to off er a 
unique range of components and 
systems, which in turn gives us 
access to new, high growth market 
segments and ensures we are well-
equipped to develop and deliver the 
solutions required by our customers 
in the future.
Exploit innovation and technology, 
and product convergence
A valuable source of technology-
based competitive advantage is 
our ability to combine products and 
solutions and exploit convergence, 
both technological and physical, 
by the bundling of components 
and in the supply of modules and 
sub-assemblies, allowing us to 
deliver multi-functional value to our 
customers, whilst simplifying their 
supply chain.
Develop systems and controls 
combining hardware and software
We believe that we can achieve both 
higher margins, and more sustainable 
revenue streams, including services 
and aftermarket revenues, through 
an increasing focus on systems and 
controls that combine hardware, 
software and assemblies. Building 
on our acquisitions in the wireless 
M2M areas and our acquisition of 
Cattron with its wireless systems 
controls, we see this as a key growth 
area for the future in a number 
of selected markets.
Laird’s enduring strategy is driven 
by the overarching objective of creating 
and growing shareholder value, by
developing a unique capability to provide
our customers with a wide range of
performance critical electronics products,

Operating review: Performance Materials division
The division designs and supplies a full
range of EMI shielding materials, handset
metal products, thermal management
solutions and signal integrity products. 
These provide critical protection for a wide
range of electronic devices, allowing them 
to function and connect effectively, whether
for voice or visual communication or for high
quality data storage and transmission.
As part of the new divisional 
structure, we combined our EMI 
shielding product lines with our 
handset metals product lines at 
the end of the year, providing 
greater focus, the ability to better 
exploit product synergies, and the 
opportunity to take out duplicate 
costs. The figures have been stated 
accordingly.

their operation and performance; 
our thermal management materials 
protect and improve a device’s 
performance through the transfer 
of heat, while our ferrite-based 
signal integrity products remove 
and filter unwanted or harmful 
electromagnetic “noise” generated 
by active components.
Divisional revenues increased 
by 25% in 2010 to £287.4 million 
due to increased customer 
demand, penetration of new 
market segments as a result 
of new product developments, 
and market share gains.
The majority, 68%, of the divisional 
revenues in 2010 were from EMI 
shielding materials including board 
level shields for mobile handsets and 
tablets, with 22% from our thermal 
management solutions and 10% from 
our signal integrity products.
By market segment, 46% of the 
division’s revenues in 2010 were 
to the IT, telecommunications 
and datacommunications sectors, 
15% were to the mobile handset 
market, with the balance to the 
consumer electronics, industrial 
and instrumentation, medical, 
aerospace and defence markets.
The division has performed well, 
across all of its product lines, 
growing revenues in excess of 
market growth. We have seen strong 
growth in sales to the IT, telecoms, 
datacoms and consumer segments, 
and good but more modest growth 
in our military/aerospace, medical 
and industrial sales. Revenues into

segments were flat year on year, with 
volume growth off set by reductions 
in average selling prices. 
Our EMI shielding product lines 
performed well, with revenues up 
19% year on year, with the reduction 
in board level shield (BLS) sales for 
mobile phone handsets to our largest 
customer being more than off set 
by strong growth in BLS revenues 
for other smartphones and into the 
tablet segment.
Following a number of new product 
introductions in our thermal 
product lines, particularly gap 
fillers, thermoelectric coolers and 
PCB thermal products for LED 
applications, our thermal revenues 
increased by 31% year on year, to 
another record level. 
Following a re-engineering of 
our signal integrity product lines, 
revenues from these increased by 
59% year on year, also to a record 
level.
Underlying operating profit in the 
division increased 40% in the year 
to £38.7 million (2009, £27.6 million), 
and return on sales was up from 
12.0% in 2009 to 13.5% in 2010. 
The closure of our signal integrity 
products manufacturing in 
Mexico, and its transfer to China, 
was completed successfully. The 
division’s EMI and thermal production 
capacity and capabilities were 
further enhanced at our Shenzhen 
and Tianjin facilities in China, while 
production in the Czech Republic 
and Sweden was maintained at 
similar levels to 2009.
The higher power, speed and 
performance of electronic devices 
is expected to underpin demand 
for our Performance Materials 
division’s products. We continue 
to concentrate on new product 
development, and on enhancing the 
performance and competitiveness 
of our products. The division is well 
placed to make further progress 
in 2011. 16 Laird PLC
Operating review: Wireless Systems division
We design and supply a range of
customised, high speciﬁ cation wireless
antennae, machine-to-machine (“M2M”)
wireless modules which can include micro
processors and embedded software, and
software enabled wireless control systems.
We are also a leading global supplier 
of customised, high performance antennae
and products to the global mobile 
phone handset and handheld 
device manufacturers.
As part of the new divisional structure, 
we combined our handset antennae 
into our Wireless Systems division, to 
better obtain product and technology 
synergies. The figures have been 
stated accordingly.
We design and supply a range 
of customised, high specification 
wireless antennae, machine-to-
machine (“M2M”) wireless modules 
which can include micro-processors 
and embedded software, and 
software enabled wireless control 
systems, for the infrastructure, 
automotive, rail, transportation, 
municipal, industrial, mining, 
instrumentation, datacom, security, 
retail and asset management markets. 
We are also a leading global supplier 
of customised, high performance 
antennae and products to the global 
mobile phone handset and handheld 
device manufacturers, enhancing 
connectivity, performance and 
physical functionality.
Divisional revenues increased by 5% 
in 2010 to £262.3 million (2009, £249.9 
million).
50% of the division’s revenues in 2010 
were to the mobile handset market, 
with telematics antennae into the 
automotive market representing 
29%. 13% of revenues were from the 
infrastructure, datacom, security and 
asset management sectors, 6% from 
sales of wireless M2M modules and 
2% from industrial control systems.
Our handset antennae systems 
product line has been successful 
in diversifying its customer base 
and in shipping higher volumes of 
antennae units. Our new generation 
of three dimensional laser directed 
structure antennae went into full 
commercial production during the 
year, and we made further progress 
in the development of a unique 
“full metal cover antennae”, that 
uses the external cover of a phone 
as an antenna, increasing external 
design options for the customer and 
improving antenna performance.
However, design changes by 
customers, the eff ect of programme 
mix and customer price-downs 
resulted in a further decline in average 
selling prices. These eff ects more than 
off set the higher volumes, with the 
result that handset antennae revenue 
declined by 20% year on year.
We saw excellent growth in our 
telematics product line, as a result 
of a recovery in underlying demand, 
a broadening of the customer base, 
and market share gains. Revenues into 
this segment grew 55% year on year.

Our commercial wireless module 
sales, predominantly into the industrial 
and electronics point-of-sale markets, 
doubled year on year.
Our infrastructure antennae product 
lines grew well overall, despite a 
slow start to the year, with total 
infrastructure antennae sales growing 
20% year on year. The growth was 
driven largely by a recovery in wireless 
local area networks in North America, 
and our successfully gaining market 
share in Asia and Europe. WiMax, land 
mobile and portable radio, cellular 
and RFID antennae sales also grew.
The division’s underlying operating 
profit increased 30% in the year to 
£15.0 million (2009, £11.5 million). 
Return on sales increased from 4.6% 
in 2009 to 5.7% in 2010, with the 
margin increase driven primarily by 
the overall rise in revenues, as a result 
of increased activity in the automotive 
sector. Underlying operating profit 
showed strong growth in the second 
half of 2010 (£10.2 million) compared 
with the first half (£4.8 million), as a 
result of the higher revenues; return 
on sales in the second half increased 
to 7.4% compared with 3.8% in the first 
half of the year.
Towards the end of 2010 we 
commenced a restructuring of our 
handset antennae product lines. 
This involves further headcount 
reductions in Europe and North 
America, the relocation of antennae 
assembly from Chennai, India, and 
Korea to China, and the consolidation 
of all manufacturing and assembly 
into our Beijing facilities. These 
actions will reduce the cost base 
overall, benefiting both 2011 and 2012, 
notwithstanding the rising cost 
of direct labour in China.
In telematics and in our infrastructure 
antennae product lines we are 
working on improving margins 
through greater vertical integration 
of our manufacturing processes, 
particularly in respect of surface 
mount PCB technology and injection 
moulding. We also expect the 
continuing revenue growth in these 
product lines to provide greater 
economies of scale.
Cattron, acquired in November 
2010, is bedding in well and has 
performed above our expectations. 
The acquisition has brought a 
diversification in terms of customers 
and end-markets, a greater focus 
on software and systems, and 
aftermarket revenues from services, 
parts and spares, all at margins higher 
than our historical average.
We expect some further reduction 
in average selling prices in our 
handset antennae product lines, 
before stabilising during the 
second half of 2011. In telematics, 
infrastructure antennae, wireless M2M 
modules and our Cattron business, 
on the other hand, we expect further 
revenue and margin growth as a 
result of growing demand from 
these market segments, our new 
product development programmes, 
the enhancement of our technology 
capabilities and through continuing 
geographic expansion. Overall, we 
expect the division to demonstrate 
further progress in 2011. 18 Laird PLC
Operating review: Technology and Innovation
Many of our customers need products that 
perform multiple functions and look to us 
to integrate multiple components into their 
operating systems.
We add value to our customers’ 
products not only by our own 
products that we sell but also 
by our science, technology and 
engineering capabilities that 
we use across a broad range of 
disciplines, applications, products and 
geographies. In all of our products we 
establish and deliver on roadmaps 
that keep us in the forefront of 
technology delivered to the market. 
Our core areas of technical expertise 
include basic science, product 
engineering, prototyping, production 
and process engineering, and in 
diverse fields including heat transfer, 
electromagnetic interference 
prevention, signal propagation and 
reception, acoustics, metal deposition 
and processing, polymer processing, 
semiconductor materials, and 
software and controls. We support 
our customers through our global 
network of technology, engineering 
and prototyping centres which 
can operate independently or in a 
concurrent or “follow the sun” model 
as the customer requires.
Our diff erentiation as a technology 
provider is supported both in product 
and process technology by continued 
investment in training, employee 
development, and recruiting. In 
2010 we trained nearly our entire 
professional workforce in lean 
techniques. In addition, nearly 200 
are certified in Six Sigma with over 
10% having Black Belt certification. 
We maintained our investment in R&D 
in 2010, at £42.2 million before £9.5 
million of capitalised development, 
compared with £42.8 million in 2009. 
Expenditure was 7.4% of sales in 2010, 
compared with 8.1% in 2009.
Continued Development of 
Technology Footprint
In 2010 we have already achieved 
results from our expansion of our 
M2M (machine to machine) wireless 
module design in Bangalore, India. 
The launch of a configurable wireless 
gateway for M2M applications, 
designed by the new team in 
Bangalore, has moved us into the 
realm of a total M2M hardware 
solution provider. Many new M2M 
service providers are seeking 
suppliers to provide the entire 
systems design and functionality, so 
they can focus on their core business 
of data services, and these landmark 
products uniquely position us to 
enable their own market vision.
We continue to develop and 
expand our university partnerships. 
For instance, we are developing 
measurement techniques and 
modelling tools to characterise 
electromagnetic noise reduction in 
various electronic assemblies with 
the University of Missouri-Rolla, are 
identifying universities for potential 
alliances in antennae simulation and 
design, and are targeting technology 
partnerships with leading Chinese 
universities.
Innovation in Technology 
and Product Convergence 
Many of our customers need 
products that perform multiple 
functions and look to us to integrate 
multiple components into their 
operating systems. Advanced 
Telematics applications need highly 
integrated solutions combining 
antennae, wireless modules, input/
output interfaces and ruggedised 
mechanical design. We are meeting 
these needs with Smart Antennae, 
which combine our multi-functional 
antennae and amplifiers, combined 
with software, in innovative packages 
through integrated design of these 
systems. 
Our investments in vertically 
integrated production of flexible 
printed circuits (FPC) for antennae 
have allowed us to extend the limits 
of this technology by making ultra-
thin FPCs which can actually stretch 
and conform to three dimensional 
shapes. We believe that we now off er  Laird PLC 19
Section Header Operating review: Technology and Innovation (continued)
the most complete product off ering 
for applications requiring a three 
dimensional antenna.
In Shenzhen, China we developed 
physical vapour deposition and 
laser engraving technologies to 
create brilliant colours and 2D and 
3D patterns for logos and other 
decorations for our mobile device 
customers. We also installed 
the capability for stainless steel, 
aluminium and titanium forgings.
A new thermal interface material with 
unprecedented high performance 
was developed to meet the needs 
of the most challenging applications 
for cooling electronics, while at the 
same time lowering overall costs 
and exceeding the latest “ green” 
standards. A new platform of silicone-
free thermal interface materials for 
use in silicone sensitive applications 
such as hard drives and LCD TVs was 
launched.
In our elastomers product group we 
launched a line of custom engineered 
gaskets that build on our proprietary 
co-extrusion technology for EMI 
shielding specifically designed for 
improved electrical performance 
with enhanced environmental 
characteristics.
We developed a wide range of 
conductive and non-conductive 
pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) 
for use in our EMI products, including 
a new conductive fabric tape with a 
flame retardant which earned a UL510 
FR rating – only three companies in 
the world off er this type of product. 
We also continue to develop PSAs 
with enhanced thermal characteristics 
for our LED TV customers.
In our Infrastructure Antennae unit, 
we launched a broad line of antennae 
that enable connection to the 
emerging LTE (Long-Term Evolution / 
“ 4G”) standard, for use inside buildings 
as well as for external applications. 
Robust Intellectual Property 
Portfolio 
Our sustained investment in R&D 
continues to add to our solid 
intellectual property position. During 
the year we filed for 150 new patents 
and had 66 new patents granted. 
While patents are a significant method 
of protecting our investment in 
R&D, we protect the majority of our 
intellectual property as trade secrets.
Corporate Research Laboratory 
Our Corporate Research Laboratory 
(CRL) in Bangalore, India continued 
its path of innovation in 2010. With 
eight ongoing projects in “state 
of the art” technologies, ranging 
from thermoelectrics to ferrites, 
progress was substantial. Towards 
this, CRL was heavily involved 
in applying nanotechnology to 
a number of its projects to take 
advantage of its unique properties. 
Another development area was 
on commercialising thermally 
conductive polymer composites 
based on in-house developed 
technology. With its inherent superior 
properties, the material has generated 
tremendous interest with a leading 
LED manufacturer, for thermal 
management applications. The 
performance evaluation is in its final 
stages and the interim feedback has 
been very positive. The prototype 
developments of the components are 
complex in shape, high performance 
in meeting technical requirements 
and aesthetically pleasing in 
appearance.
Innovation in Continuous 
Improvement in all Operations
The markets in which our products 
are used typically value and require 
constant reduction in size, weight and 
cost while simultaneously improving 
performance. We address these needs 
by our new product development 
activities as well as by our aggressive 
continuous manufacturing 
improvement approach. 
20 Laird PLC Tooling fabrication process 
improvements and tool room capital 
investments in our Shenzhen facility 
have nearly doubled our internal 
tooling capacity in 2010, while also 
improving capability, reducing lead 
times and improving tooling quality.
Implementation of a three 
dimensional “plastic printing” process 
has significantly reduced the time 
required to make prototype parts. 
By localising sources for many raw 
materials and components, we have 
shortened our lead time, reduced 
our working capital, and reduced 
our operating costs. Development 
of an integrated processing system 
for complicated multi-piece metal 
products are made in a single 
production line, eliminating all 
queuing of intermediate parts and 
reducing scrap and downtime.
We successfully replaced an existing 
powder roll compaction process with 
a water-based tape casing process to 
make ferrite signal integrity products, 
which gives significant quality and 
yield improvement. A low-cost 
ferrite material was also developed, 
delivering a 13% saving in material 
costs for the price-sensitive cable 
core product line, both of these for 
our signal integrity products.
Replacement of photochemical 
etching with laser cutting for some 
of our requirements in our EMI metals 
products business yielded cost 
reductions, unique capabilities 
and cycle time reduction. 
Several years of investment in 
our thermoelectric module 
production process has resulted 
in improved yields and throughput 
in this multi-step process, while 
delivering significant improvement 
in the reliability and performance 
of the products.

Revision to Segments
In 2010, Laird changed its organisational structure to 
respond to developments in its principal markets served. 
The three divisions disclosed in 2009, Performance 
Materials, Handset Products and Wireless Systems, 
became two as the Handset Products division was 
disassembled. Specialty Precision Metals (previously 
known as Handset Metals) became organised under 
Performance Materials and Handset Antennae became 
organised under Wireless Systems. Handset Actuation 
Mechanisms is being closed and is disclosed separately. 
Revenue 
Revenue from continuing operations increased to £567.4 
million in 2010 from £528.8 million in 2009. Performance 
Materials revenues were 25% higher, Wireless Systems 
revenues were 5% higher and Mechanisms revenues 64% 
lower. The table below shows revenue for each half year 
for both 2009 and 2010.
Revenue on the new segmental basis is also disclosed 
in note 3. The old segmental basis, as used in the 2009 
Report and Accounts, is disclosed in note 36. 
Revenue invoiced to the largest customer in 2010 
represented 16% of total revenue (2009, 35%). Total 
revenue in respect of that customer including revenue 
invoiced indirectly through its suppliers amounted to 19% 
of revenue (2009, 40%). The top 5 customers accounted 
for 40% (including revenue invoiced indirectly through 
their suppliers) of revenue in 2010 (2009, 51%). 
Underlying Operating Profit / Net Margins
The table below shows underlying operating profit. Net 
margins for the full year were 8.2% in 2010 (2009, 6.4%). 
Margins were 6.7% in the first half and 9.5% in the second 
half of the year.

Gross margins increased by 2.8% 
to 33.3% notwithstanding labour 
inflation in China adding some 
£4 million to the cost base and 
exchange rate imbalances adding 
a further £4 million.
Net margins for Performance 
Materials were 13.5% in 2010 (2009, 
12.0%) and for Wireless Systems net 
margins were 5.7% (2009, 4.6%). 
The Mechanisms business is being 
closed and following a significant 
reduction in overheads as its 
products go end of life, it was back 
in surplus in the second half.
Profit 
The loss before tax from continuing 
operations was £8.6 million (2009, 
profit of £4.6 million). There was 
no profit or loss from discontinued 
operations in 2010 (2009, loss of 
£1.9 million).
Underlying Profit
Continuing underlying profit before 
tax in the year was £40.2 million 
(2009, £26.5 million). Underlying 
profit is defined as profit before tax, 
exceptional items, amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, the gain 
or loss on sale of businesses, the 
impact arising from the fair valuing 
of financial instruments, and 
acquisition transaction costs, 
as set out in note 14. 
Exceptional Costs
Exceptional costs of £36.9 million 
were incurred in the year (2009, 
£10.2 million) of which £21.1 million 
is non-cash. The closure of the 
Mechanisms business accounts 
for £20.0 million of the charge and 
includes asset impairment charges 
of £18.1 million. 
The disassembling of the Handset 
Products division, the restructuring 
of the Handset Antennae business 
to align its cost structure to a lower 
revenue base and the consolidation 
of the Handset Metals product line 
business into Performance Materials 
added £9.8 million to the exceptional 
charge. These initiatives reduce the 
cost base by approximately £10 
million in a full year and £7 million 
in 2011.
In addition, the transaction costs 
of £2.2 million, for acquiring Cattron, 
have been disclosed as exceptional.
Note 7 analyses these costs by 
division. The cash outlay in the 
period was £6.9 million (including 
cash spent on exceptional items 
provided for in 2009) with a further 
cash outlay of £11.1 million to come 
in 2011 for costs provided for in 2010. 
Finance Costs 
Finance costs, excluding a gain 
on the fair valuing of financial 
instruments of £1.2 million (2009, 
gain of £1.6 million) were £6.2 
million compared to £7.1 million in 
2009. Interest cover was 8 times, 
compared to the minimum of 2.5 
required by the covenant in the 
Group’s principal loan agreements.  24 Laird PLC
Finance Director’s report (continued)
Taxation 
The underlying tax charge on total 
underlying profit before tax is 
equivalent to an average tax rate of 
21.9%, a reduction on 23.4% in 2009. 
The average tax rate is likely to be 
around 20% in 2011.
Profits in the USA continue to be 
sheltered by amortised goodwill 
deductions resulting from 
acquisitions. A significant proportion 
of profits are also from jurisdictions 
with low tax rates or with tax 
incentives. An analysis of the total 
tax charge is given in note 11. 
Underlying Earnings 
Continuing underlying earnings 
per share were 11.8p (2009, 9.6p). 
Underlying earnings are based on 
underlying profit less underlying 
tax and exclude deferred tax on 
acquired intangible assets and 
goodwill. Following the Rights Issue 
in October 2009, there were more 
shares in issue throughout 2010 with 
an average of 266.0 million in 2010 
(2009, 211.6 million).

Treasury Policies
Laird has a centralised Treasury 
function whose objectives are to 
monitor and manage the financial 
risks of the Group and to ensure that 
suff icient liquidity is available to meet 
the requirements of the business. 
Group Treasury is not a profit centre 
and operates within a framework 
of policies and procedures.
Laird’s Treasury uses derivative 
financial instruments to assist 
in the management of foreign 
exchange and interest rate risk, 
principally forward foreign exchange 
contracts and interest rate swaps. 
All hedging is carried out centrally 
and speculative trading is specifically 
prohibited by Group Treasury policy.
Interest Rate Risk
Laird is exposed to interest rate risk 
as it holds borrowings on both a fixed 
and floating basis. Laird’s policy for 
this risk is to optimise the mix of fixed 
and floating rate borrowings using 
interest rate swaps and forward 
rate agreements to manage Laird’s 
finance costs. Laird PLC 25
Credit and Counterparty Risk
Laird’s policy on counterparty risk 
management is to place cash deposits 
and other financial instruments with 
our relationship banks, all of whom 
also provide credit facilities to Laird. 
The level of exposure to each bank 
is continually monitored. As at 31 
December 2010 all cash and short-
term deposits had a maturity of less 
than one month.
Foreign Exchange Management
Laird aims to minimise its exposures 
to US Dollar transactional currency 
exposures by matching local currency 
income with local currency costs. 
Laird aims to cover forward at least 
75% of the unmatched cash flows 
on a quarterly basis.
Foreign currency borrowings are used 
to hedge partially the currencies of our 
principal assets and cash flows. Where 
foreign currency borrowings are in the 
same currency as our investment in 
overseas assets they are treated as a 
hedge of the net investment.
Net Borrowings and Debt Facilities
Overall, net borrowings increased by 
£58.2 million to £103.6 million; £55.5 
million of the increase due to the 
acquisition of Cattron.
A cornerstone of Laird’s financial 
planning is to ensure that the 
Group maintains committed loan 
finance which provides suff icient 
headroom above expected borrowing 
requirements and has a significant 
proportion with terms that exceed 
one year. Laird has £265 million (2009, 
£265 million) of bilateral revolving 
credit facilities which do not expire 
until August 2012. Laird is currently in 
discussions with its banks to replace 
these facilities with new five year 
facilities. 
In addition, Laird has in issue $146.7 
million (£93.4 million) of US Dollar 
Private Placement notes which are 
repaid over 2011 and 2012 ($6.7 million), 
and 2014 ($97 million) and 2016 
($43 million).
Covenants
A key consideration for financial 
planning is to maintain suff icient 
headroom between borrowings 
and the ceiling set by the covenants. 
Laird’s bank facilities and US Private 
Placement loan notes contain two 
principal financial covenants; net debt/
EBITDA (earnings before exceptional 
items, interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation), and interest cover.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, 
net borrowings were 1.4 times EBITDA, 
40% of the maximum permitted of 
3.5 times. Interest cover was 8.0 times 
against the minimum requirement 
of 2.5 times. Thus, there was suff icient 
financial headroom. 
Going forward, as a matter of course 
we estimate our headroom against the 
covenants and we test their sensitivity 
to a number of alternative scenarios 
to ensure ongoing compliance. We 
do not anticipate approaching our 
covenant limits.    
Currencies in 2010 
The average and period end 
exchange rates are set out in note 
5. In 2010, some 60% of revenues 
were negotiated in US Dollars. With 
just under 40% of the cost base in 
US Dollars, there is a large US Dollar 
surplus. Some 25% of revenues are 
negotiated in Renminbi (which was 
pegged to the US Dollar for most of 
the first half of 2010) and 7% in Euros. 
In most currencies, (other than the 
US Dollar and Euro), costs exceed 
revenues, the most significant being 
the Renminbi, and to a much lesser 
extent, the Swedish Krona, the 
Japanese Yen and the Korean Won. 
These imbalances led to an adverse 
impact of some £4 million compared 
with the average exchange rates 
prevailing in 2009. 26 Laird PLC
Finance Director’s report (continued)
We strive to balance local currency 
exposures but we operate a global 
business and this creates currency 
imbalances where we are unable to 
match operating and procurement 
costs with revenues in local currencies. 
If 2010 year end rates were to prevail 
throughout 2011, approximately £6.5 
million (US Dollar 10 million) would 
be added to the cost base in 2011 
compared to 2010. As steps were 
taken early in 2011 to hedge the 
Renminbi exposure, at least 60% 
(£4.0 million) of this exposure should 
materialise in the year. 
In addition, there is a translation impact 
in converting profits into our reporting 
currency (Pound Sterling); each 
US$0.01 appreciation against sterling 
approximates to an annual increase 
in operating profit of £0.5 million. 
The majority of the Group’s assets are 
held overseas and these are hedged 
in part by foreign currency loans. 
Pensions 
There are 12 employees who are active 
members of defined benefit plans 
and approximately 1,600 deferred and 
current pensioners. There is an overall 
defined benefit pension scheme 
deficit under IAS 19 of £0.1 million at 
31 December 2010. At 31 December 
2009, there was an overall deficit of 
£2.5 million.
The principal causes of the reduction 
in the deficit was the £6.8 million 
increase in asset values. The bond rate 
used to discount liabilities was 5.5% 
in 2010 compared to 5.65% in 2009 
and contributed to the increase in the 
estimate of liabilities.
Shareholders’ Funds 
Shareholders’ funds at the 2010 year 
end were £574.9 million (2009, £579.6 
million). The reconciliation is set out 
in the Group statement of changes 
in equity.
Return on Capital Employed 
Return on capital employed 
(underlying profit before interest 
and tax as a proportion of average 
shareholders’ funds plus net 
borrowings during the year) was 
7.0% compared to 5.1% in 2009. 27 Laird PLC Laird PLC 27 28
Corporate Social Responsibility
Laird PLC and its subsidiary 
undertakings (“Laird”) designs and 
supplies innovative, value-added 
products that advance performance 
and protection across the electronics 
market, improving the quality of life for 
people who use them. As a member of 
the FTSE4Good index, a financial index 
series that is designed to identify and 
facilitate investment in companies that 
meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards, we recognise 
the need to balance our social and 
environmental impacts in a manner 
that best serves the needs of all our 
stakeholders, including investors, 
employees, customers, suppliers and 
local communities.
GOVERNANCE
Risk Management
The delivery of improvements 
in controls and operational risk 
management, including health, 
safety and environment initiatives, is 
driven by the Laird Risk Management 
Committee (“RMC”), chaired by 
the President of one of Laird’s 
business divisions and with senior 
representatives of both divisions 
and key corporate functions. 
Risk management strategy, risk 
performance monitoring and oversight 
at corporate level rests with the Laird 
Risk Management Group (“RMG”), 
to which the RMC reports. The RMG 
is chaired by the Laird PLC Chief 
Executive and reports to the Board. 
The RMC and RMG each meet at least 
twice a year.
Business Ethics
Laird believes that high standards 
of business ethics are critical in 
today’s business world and therefore 
places high priority on compliance 
with all legislative and regulatory 
requirements, and on the maintenance 
of high ethical standards, within each 
of the territories and jurisdictions in 
which we conduct our business. It is 
our policy that our businesses should 
compete enthusiastically and fairly 
in the marketplace and must comply 
with the relevant competition laws of 
each country in which we operate.
Laird commits to conducting itself, 
and expects all employees to conduct 
themselves, in an honest, ethical 
manner in all dealings on its behalf 
and to behave professionally and with 
integrity and fairness. We apply these 
same standards to all of our business 
dealings with customers, suppliers 
and other stakeholders.
Laird has an established set of Global 
Values and Global Code of Conduct; 
the latter includes policies and 
guidelines relating to human rights, 
equal opportunity, ethics, compliance, 
anti-harassment, conflicts of interests 
and regulatory compliance. Our global 
Ethics Hotline provides a confidential 
way for employees to raise concerns 
about inappropriate behaviour. 
The hotline utilises an independent 
telephone and internet provider, 
off ering support in local languages 
and has an internal escalation and 
resolution process driven by the Risk 
Management Committee. The Chief 
Executive, in his capacity as Chairman 
of the Risk Management Group, takes 
the lead on Equal Opportunity matters.
A copy of Laird’s Business Ethics and 
Conduct Policy statement is available

Company on request.
MARKETPLACE
Product Stewardship
As a forward-thinking business, we 
recognise the need to behave as a 
good corporate citizen and pursue 
environmentally-conscious design and 
manufacturing practices, via various 
strategies including maximising 
resource productivity and minimising 
energy intensity.
As a member of the FTSE4Good index, 
we recognise the need to balance our 
social and environmental impacts in 
a manner that best serves the needs 
of all our stakeholders, including 
investors, employees, customers, 
suppliers and local communities.
Laird PLC Our environmentally-friendly product 
design strategies have recently 
delivered Beryllium-free Recyclable 
Clean Copper™ gaskets, EcoGreen™ 
fabric over foam gaskets which 
off er a halogen-free option with 
uncompromised EMI shielding 
eff ectiveness, and halogen-free 
casings for signal integrity products. 
The Thermal unit has developed 
thermoelectric generator assemblies 
that convert waste heat to electrical 
energy and thermoelectric controllers 
have been redesigned to adjust 
power for optimal eff iciency. Laird 
also actively develops products which 
encourage responsible energy use, 
including thermal management 
products for customers working with 
less energy-intensive LED lighting. 
In terms of process-based initiatives, 
within our Metals business continued 
eff orts are being made in Shenzhen, 
China and Chennai, India to eliminate 
the need to degrease stainless 
steel gaskets by utilising improved 
evaporative oils and tool conditioning, 
consequently reducing water and 
chemical use. All metals are recyclable 
and 100 per cent of metal process 
scrap is recycled. In addition, in-house 
design technology is employed to 
optimise the strength of the metals, 
which in turn helps to reduce the 
amount required, thus making 
products lighter, which in turn reduces 
overall raw material use. 
Product-based initiatives in the Visual 
Metals product line include the use 
of PVD chrome finishing and the laser 
engraving of metal surfaces, replacing 
nickel chromium plating and chemical 
etching processes.
Electronic Industry Citizenship 
Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct
The EICC Code of Conduct, a 
code of best practice adopted and 
implemented by some of the world’s 
major electronics brands and their 
suppliers, sets forth performance, 
compliance, auditing and reporting 
guidelines across five areas of social 
responsibility:
• Labour
• Health and Safety
• Environmental
• Management Systems
• Ethics
Laird is committed to ensuring that 
its supply base complies with the 
EICC Code of Conduct, and we 
have therefore implemented these 
requirements into our business 
systems and continue to audit and 
work with our suppliers to ensure 
compliance. Current suppliers are 
certified and we ensure all new 
suppliers are compliant with all our 
requirements and systems before 
approval. We have established 
processes and practices in the 
areas of labour, health and safety, 
environmental, management systems 
and ethics with the goal of meeting, 
or have a road map for compliance 
with, these requirements at all of our 
sites. We regularly audit and review our 
processes and practices to ensure we 
are in compliance and our operations 
are using Best in Class processes, and 
are audited several times a year by 
various customers. 
Employees receive annual training 
on our Global Code of Conduct and 
written acknowledgement is required 
as testimony of their understanding. 
The Global Ethics Hotline has been 
actively promoted and used around 
the world and has provided valuable 
insight into processes requiring 
attention in our operations. 
Continuous Improvement
We continued to see gains in 
our manufacturing processes, 
product quality and customer 
satisfaction ratings, alongside cost 
reductions, through our Six Sigma 
CIP (Continuous Improvement 
Process) programme during 2010, 
which delivered approximately $14 
million in savings by the end of the 
29 Laird PLC 30 Laird PLC
Corporate Social Responsibility (continued)
year. The combined Six Sigma and 
CIP approach has established a 
foundation for best practice across 
Laird for problem solving and since its 
inception in 2005 has delivered solid 
results year on year. A major emphasis 
of the 2010 CIP programme was Lean 
Manufacturing: a formal Four Phase 
Lean Development and Assessment 
process was launched at all key 
manufacturing sites with the goal 
of eliminating waste and improving 
performance on key indicators 
relating to quality, delivery and cost. 
Preliminary results show strong 
improvement in 2010 and this process 
will be expanded in 2011. With a well 
established system and infrastructure 
in place, we will continue to expand 
and broaden the initiative across all of 
our facilities to support our strategies 
and strengthen our capabilities. 
WORKPLACE
Human Rights
The International Labour Organisation, 
a tripartite UN agency bringing 
together governments, employers 
and workers of its member states in 
common action to promote decent 
working conditions throughout 
the world, has identified eight Core 
Conventions as being fundamental 
to the rights of human beings at 
work. These Core Conventions 
cover: commitment to freedom of 
association and collective bargaining, 
equal remuneration for men and 
women workers for work of equal 
value, the abolition of forced labour, 
the elimination of discrimination on 
grounds of race, colour, sex, religion, 
political opinion, national extraction 
or social origin, and the abolition of 
child labour. Laird has expressed its 
support for the International Labour 
Organisation eight Core Conventions, 
and we have stated our commitment 
to the principles within these 
conventions. During 2011 we will be 
implementing an audit, carried out by 
an independent third party which is 
a specialist in this area, of our facilities 
in China.
A copy of Laird’s Employment and 
Human Rights policy statement is 
available on the Company’s website 
or from the Company on request.
Employee development 
and communication 
Laird recognises that the success 
of the business relies on the skill 
and dedication of its employees. 
Consultation is encouraged at 
local level and performance and 
development reviews reinforce the 
link between business goals, an 
employee’s contribution and his/
her remuneration. A leadership 
assessment tool has been 
implemented for relevant appointed 
and/or promoted candidates. T otal 
spend on employee training in 
2010 was £774,194 and annualised 
employee turnover rate was 10.9%.
We communicate regularly with our 
employees, including information 
on key events within the business, 
charity and community involvement 
and employee achievements. During 
the year we held global monthly site 
meetings and ‘T own Hall’ meetings led 
by the executive team and conducted 
employee satisfaction surveys.
Health, Safety and 
Environmental Policy 
A copy of our Health, Safety and 
Environmental Policy statement is 
available on the Company’s website or 
from the Company on request.
We are committed to pursuing 
high standards of environmental 
performance including the 
maintenance of safe and healthy 
working environments and maintain 
a proactive communications strategy 
amongst all employees to stimulate 
continuous improvement and 
promote and develop good health, 
safety and environmental practices. 
Laird recognises that the success of the 
business relies on the skill and dedication 
of its employees. Laird PLC 31
Laird’s Beijing, China, facility received 
a 2010 Great Wall Award for Lean 
Manufacturing Excellence in 
December, presented at the Great 
Wall 2010 Ceremony and Annual 
Forum in Shanghai. 
Through the setting of targets 
and the implementation of a 
corresponding measurement 
system alongside a comprehensive 
training programme, Laird was 
recognised for successfully instilling 
a Lean Manufacturing philosophy 
throughout the Beijing facility
2010 saw further progress in 
overall performance in the areas of 
Health, Safety and Environmental 
management, driven by the 
continuation of our ISO 14001/OHSAS 
18001 integrated Health, Safety and 
Environmental management system 
accreditation programme; a joint 
standard to which thirteen Laird 
facilities are certified, all of which 
successfully completed re-certification 
or surveillance audits during the year. 
This is in addition to the majority of our 
main manufacturing facilities being 
ISO 9000 and ISO 9001 certified. 
The results of the health, safety 
and environmental audits and their 
follow up are monitored by the RMC. 
Health, safety and environmental 
training is provided, and reinforced via 
refresher courses where necessary, to 
designated employees and focuses 
on the perceived risk within each 
business. 
Health and Safety Management
Worldwide employee headcount 
for our operations increased from c. 
12,290 at the end of 2009, to 12,577 at 
the end of 2010. The average number 
of Laird employees in 2010 was 12,605 
(2009, 11,765).
We record near misses, minor and 
reportable accidents, based on a 
uniform reporting standard, at all 
facilities along with total hours worked 
which together provides an aggregate 
annualised minor/reportable accident 
rate per 100 employees. 
There were no work-related fatalities in 
2010 (2009, zero). The total number of 
reportable accidents increased 14% in 
2010 but the reportable accident rate 
fell from 0.15 to 0.14 per 100 employees 
annualised, on a 17% increase in total 
hours worked. Minor accident rates 
increased 16% to 0.22/100 employees 
annualised. These figures need to 
be seen against a background of 
improved reporting and awareness.
2010 Health and Safety 
achievements
•  Laird’s facility in Schaumburg, USA 
reduced reportable workplace 
accident rates by 76% in 2010

ENVIRONMENT
Environmental Management
Detailed policies are developed, 
implemented and regularly reviewed 
by Laird and our businesses to reflect 
their specific trading activities and 
the associated risks. Our minimum 
requirements are for our businesses 
to comply with local legislation and 
to operate continuous improvement 
programmes, to ensure that eff icient 
use is made of all resources, including 
energy, water and raw materials, that 
emissions are restricted to within best 
practice levels, waste is minimised 
and accidents are prevented through 
comprehensive training.
Laird undertakes a rolling programme 
of environmental audits covering all 
of its manufacturing sites, the results 
of which are monitored by the RMC. 
The formalisation of environmental 
management systems via the 
certified Environmental and Health 
and Safety standards promotes 
continuous improvement and allows 
consistent monitoring of energy 
source reduction, waste treatment 
and the re-use and reclamation of 
natural resources. 
Our environmental strategy targets 
reductions in energy usage, 
greenhouse gas emissions and waste 
sent to landfill, sharing successful 
ideas and best practice wherever 
appropriate across all plants globally. 
Environmental indicators for 2010 
reflect continued market driven 
reduction in operations with a low 
energy and carbon profile (such 
as handset assembly) but strong 
demand-driven growth in higher 
impact operations, set against low 
energy usage and emissions in 2009 
as a result of the global economic 
downturn. 
Set against this context, Laird’s CO2 
emissions per £1m of sales increased 
by 8% to 74,345 kilograms, while 
power consumption increased 8% 
to 187,940 KwH per £1m of sales. 
Reductions were achieved in 2010 for 
waste to landfill relative to sales, which 
decreased 6% to 1,251 kilograms total 
waste to landfill per £1m of sales. For 
2011, as part of our environmental 
strategy, we have set a CO2 emissions 
reduction target of 5% in total metric 
tonnes CO2-e relative to 100K hours 
worked for our 9 largest sites. This 
target will be applied across smaller 
sites in 2012.
RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous 
Substances)
RoHS is European Community 
Regulation 2002/95/EC which came 
into force on 1 July 2006. The Directive 
After conducting a Health & Wellness 
survey across North American 
employees in 2009 Laird established 
a Health & Wellness programme in 
order to promote a work culture that 
supports the value of choosing a 
healthy lifestyle, through the provision 
of access to a wide range of fitness, 
health and nutritional resources. The 
programme includes the organisation 
of activities, speaker events, on-site 
biometric screenings and regular 
newsletters on a dedicated Health & 
Wellness intranet site. The programme 
has been rolled out in North America 
and is being shared with facilities in 
other countries. Laird PLC 33
restricts the use of six substances in 
electronic products: lead, mercury, 
cadmium, hexavalent chromium, 
polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) 
and polybrominated diphenyl 
ethers (PBDEs). 
As part of our Restricted Substance 
Management Plan, our facility in 
Shenzhen, China utilises an in-house 
RoHS testing facility to ensure product 
compliance. This facility is testimony 
to our proactive approach to RoHS 
compliance, which is driven by a plan 
implemented at all manufacturing 
locations to manage processes 
and procedures associated with 
the Directive and other customer-
specific restricted substance product 
requirements. We have also invested 
in in-house RoHS testing laboratories 
in Kunshan, China, along with 
screening equipment in Tianjin, 
China and Cleveland, USA, to enable 
internally verified RoHS and restricted 
substance product compliance. 
In 2010 over 10,500 samples were 
tested for RoHS restricted substances 
in our laboratories, resulting in net 
savings of approximately $1.5 million 
versus conducting the equivalent 
testing at an accredited third party 
laboratory. To date there have been no 
instances of major non-conformance 
with respect to RoHS/restricted 
substance compliance with 
our customers.
REACH (Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of 
Chemical substances)
REACH is a European Community 
Regulation on chemicals and their 
safe use (EC 1907/2006) which came 
into force on 1 June 2007 and will be 
phased in over an eleven year period.  
We are committed to being proactive in 
the addressing of REACH compliance 
and will support implementation 
of the regulation as required. We 
have completed a REACH baseline 
applicability assessment involving the 
classification and review of all products 
and preparations and the identification 
and survey of applicable suppliers in 
the EU and internationally. We continue 
to eff ectively address customer 
enquiries for REACH compliance data 
for our products and develop our 
supply chain to ensure it continues 
to meet all REACH legal compliance 
obligations and supply products into 
the EU without disruption.

Strategic & Markets
Competition and 
Market Conditions
Laird operates in market sectors which are 
characterised by a high level of competition 
between suppliers and which are driven by 
rapid technological change. Changes in market 
dynamics could have a material adverse eff ect 
on Laird’s financial condition and prospects.
Laird’s competitive position may suff er were 
it unable to respond promptly and eff ectively 
to technological change and customers and 
competitors innovations.
Laird’s products and solutions include 
technologies in which it holds intellectual 
property rights which may be subject to 
infringement or misappropriation. Claims could 
be asserted against Laird that it has infringed 
intellectual property owned by others and 
such claims might require Laird to incur legal 
costs or face legal restrictions on selling certain 
products. 
The loss of a major contract or key customer 
whether through competitive action or any 
change in strategy or ordering requirements 
from customers could have a material adverse 
eff ect on Laird’s financial condition and 
prospects.

Macro Economic and 
Political Factors
During an economic downturn or delayed

postpone anticipated orders, or apply pressure 
to prices and margins, any of which may result 
in lasting changes in terms of trade pricing 
policies, delivery capabilities and market 
expectations.

Acquisitions Laird has made and is likely to make further 
strategic acquisitions of complementary 
businesses, assets and companies with 
the intention of accelerating growth and 
strengthening and developing its market. 
If such acquisitions cannot be successfully 
integrated and the risks managed, Laird’s 
business, financial condition and the results of 
its operations may be adversely aff ected.

Operations
China Operational 
Concentration – 
Labour costs
Laird faces continued pressure on China labour 
costs, particularly with reference to base pay, 
reductions in overtime and increasing social 
costs. The result of these pressures may lead to 
reduced profits or other adverse eff ects on the 
business.
   Processes improvements to increase 
productivity
   Increased automation
   Developing options for relocation of 
certain manufacturing operations 
processes to Western China and other

Supply Chain and 
Raw Materials
Laird’s ability to deliver according to market 
demands depends in large part on obtaining 
timely and adequate supplies of components 
and raw materials. 
Failure in the supply chain could interrupt 
Laird’s product supply, limit sales and increase 
costs. 
The raw materials used include commodities 
such as copper, beryllium copper, steel, 
aluminium, silver and zinc – all of which may 
be subject to price volatility. This may impact 
Laird’s operating profits.

Laird is committed to operating in compliance 
with all environmental, health and safety laws 
and regulations to which it is subject. However, 
there may be unforeseen expenditures to cover 
environmental and health liabilities, to maintain 
compliance with current or future laws and

performance of its employees and failure to 
retain such individuals could have an adverse

Significant contracts
Laird has arrangements with its major customers and suppliers whereby regional or global terms of supply are agreed. 
However, these arrangements do not amount to contractual obligations to purchase and supply as these are covered 
by individual purchase orders.
Share capital
The Company has only one class of share and the rights attaching to each share are identical. Details of the rights and 
obligations attaching to the shares are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association which are available on its 
website. The Company may refuse to register any transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. At a general 
meeting of the Company, every member has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll one vote for each share held. 
Details of the voting procedure are set out in the notice of meeting. 
At 31 December 2010 the issued share capital of the Company was 266,302,206 ordinary shares of 28.125p each. 
Details of the share capital and options outstanding as at 31 December 2010 are shown in note 29 on page 99.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 6 May 2011, the shareholders will be requested to renew the directors’ 
power to allot shares, or grant rights for or to convert any security into shares, in the Company; the disapplication of 
pre-emption rights and authorise the Company to make purchases of up to 10% of its ordinary shares on the London 
Stock Exchange. As at 9 March 2011 no shares have been purchased pursuant to this authority. Shareholders will be 
requested to renew these authorities at the Annual General Meeting and details are set out in the notice of meeting.
Directors
Re-election of directors
The directors as shown on pages 36 and 37 were all directors throughout the year to 31 December 2010. The Company’s 
Articles of Association (which require shareholder approval for any amendments), set out the powers of the directors 
and the regulations for their appointment and removal. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “new Code”), which will apply to the Company next year, recommends that 
all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election by shareholders. The directors have decided 
to adopt this provision of the new Code early, on a voluntary basis. Accordingly, all of the directors of the Company will 
off er themselves for re-election at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Mr N J Keen who has served longer than nine years on the Board fulfilled the criteria for independence as set out in the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance at the time of his appointment and the Board is satisfied that Mr Keen 
remains free from any relationship with the executive management of the Company which could materially interfere 
with the exercise of his independent judgement. During his Chairmanship, Mr Keen has overseen the restructuring of 
Laird PLC, which resulted in Laird becoming a focused electronics and technology company. He has also overseen the 
strengthening and development of the Board. The Board believes that Mr Keen makes a valuable contribution and 
wishes him to continue as Chairman because of his wide experience of business, particularly in the high technology 
area and his long-standing financial experience. None of the non-executive directors off ering themselves for re-election 
has a service contract with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Biographical details and reasons for reappointment 
for the non-executive directors are given in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ interests
No director had, in the year to 31 December 2010, a material interest in any third party contract of significance with the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries. Directors’ shareholdings at 31 December 2010 are shown below. These interests 
were unchanged at 9 March 2011. Details of share options are shown in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 52

Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
With eff ect from 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts 
and potential conflicts of interest, where appropriate. This is subject to only directors who have no interest in the matter 
taking the decision and having acted in good faith for what they consider to be most likely to promote the Company’s 
success. The authority for directors to act in situations of conflict and the rules governing their duties in such situations 
are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. A register of conflicts or potential conflicts of interest has been 
prepared and it is available at every Board Meeting. 
Directors’ Indemnities
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company has indemnified the directors in respect of proceedings 
brought by third parties and such indemnification was in place throughout the year.
In 2005 two of Laird’s final salary pension schemes were merged and in 2008 a further three schemes were merged. 
The trustees of the schemes, including Mr Keen who is Chairman of the trustees of the surviving scheme, received an 
indemnity from the Company against any claim or other liability arising out of or in connection with the pension 
schemes and their agreement to the merger.
Employment policy
Laird conducts business in multiple locations and is committed to complying with the relevant legal requirements in 
each of those regions. Business unit management are responsible for implementing and communicating the Laird 
Employment and Human Rights Policy Statement within their own business unit. Various methods are used throughout 
Laird as appropriate in each location for tracking morale, motivation, retention rates and training, which are reported 
regularly to local management teams.
Laird is committed to providing equal opportunities in terms of recruitment, training and career development for all 
employees, including those with disabilities. 
A copy of Laird’s Employment and Human Rights policy statement is available on the Company’s website.
Employee participation
The Board recognises that the success of the business relies on the skill and dedication of its employees and therefore 
encourages two-way communication. Operating subsidiaries encourage consultation at local level and performance 
and development reviews reinforce the link between business goals, an employee’s contribution and his/her 
remuneration. Laird communicates regularly with its employees, including information on key events within Laird, 
charity and community involvement and employee achievements. Subsidiaries are encouraged to make all employees 
aware of the financial and economic factors aff ecting the performance of their companies.  Laird PLC 45
Change of control arrangements
Four employees of the Company have long-standing agreements which provide compensation, in addition to the 
contractual notice period, of up to a maximum of two years’ base salary for loss of employment which occurs as a result 
of a takeover off er or scheme. This additional compensation reduces pro rata to zero over the two years following the 
date of change of control. No director benefits from these arrangements.
On a change of control, the Company’s 5 year bilateral revolving credit facilities may be cancelled by the lenders by 
not less than 30 days notice to the Company.
Corporate social responsibility 
In recognition that Laird’s businesses and its activities involve a wide community of stakeholders including investors, 
employees, customers, suppliers and local communities, the Board reviews the significance of social, environmental 
and ethical matters which may aff ect Laird. A Corporate social responsibility report providing further detail can be 
found on pages 28 to 34.
Health and safety at work
Laird is committed to providing a safe working environment for its employees and continuous improvement is sought 
by the setting of objectives and targets based on relevant national and international health and safety standards and 
monitoring performance against these. In addition Laird maintains a proactive communications strategy amongst all 
employees to promote and develop good health and safety practices. Further information is shown in the Corporate 
social responsibility report on pages 28 to 34.
Research and development
Investing in research and development programmes fosters product innovation and manufacturing improvements 
within Laird. Expenditure in 2010 on research and development amounted to £42.2 million (2009, £42.8 million), of 
which £9.5 million has been capitalised (2009, £11.1 million). Laird continues to develop its technology capabilities, with 
research and development expenditure during the year running at 7.4% of sales (2009, 8.1%).
Basis of preparation of the accounts
As set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities on page 63, the accounts have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. A statement on going concern relating to a business requires judgement at a point in time about future 
events which by their nature are inherently uncertain. The directors have considered the ability of Laird to maintain 
committed loan finance, meet existing debt covenants and the impact of foreign currency exposures, as discussed in 
the Finance Director’s report on pages 22 to 26. The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Financial assets and liabilities
An analysis of debt is given in note 22 to the financial statements. An analysis of financial instruments at carrying value 
and fair value is given in note 28 to the financial statements. Financial instruments and related disclosures together 
with a discussion of financial risk management objectives and exposures to credit and liquidity risk are in accordance 
with IFRS 7.
Supplier payment policy
Laird requires its subsidiaries to negotiate clear and satisfactory arrangements for the payment of suppliers, as part of 
the overall terms and conditions of the supply, and to make payment accordingly. At the year end Laird had two UK 
operating subsidiaries and they had 52 days of purchases outstanding.
Auditors
It is recommended that Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed as auditor.
Shareholders
At 31 December 2010 there were 3,592 shareholders. Directors’ report (continued) for the year ended 31 December 2010

Substantial equity interests
The Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTRs”) issued by the Financial Services Authority require notifications relating 
to control over exercising voting rights attached to shares. Categories of notifiable interests include direct interests 
(holdings of shares with voting rights attached), indirect interests (those with access to voting rights) and financial 
instruments (which give the holder the formal entitlement to acquire shares with voting rights attached). Notification 
must be made of each category, and also the aggregate of combined holdings, which exceed or fall below the 
notifiable threshold. The requirements of the DTRs specify that notifications of holdings of over 3% only have to be 
made when a full percentage point increase or decrease occurs. The Company has only one class of shares, and does 
not hold treasury shares, so the total number of voting rights under the DTRs is equivalent to the number of shares 
in issue.
As at 8 March 2011 the Company had received the notifications of control of 3% or more over the Company’s total 
voting rights and capital in issue as set out below.

information.

Corporate governance report for the year to 31 December 2010
The Board considered that during the year ended 31 December 2010 the Company was in compliance with all of the 
provisions of section 1 (Companies) of the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance. (Available from the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at http://www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm).
The Board
The responsibilities and objectives of the Board
The Board is appointed by the shareholders who are the owners of the Company. The Board’s principal responsibility is 
to act in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole within the legal framework of the Companies Act 2006. The 
Board establishes the aims and objectives for the Company, approves the strategic direction and plans and the 
operating budgets proposed by the Chief Executive, and monitors performance against them. The Board is also 
responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the Company, for exercising proper and 
appropriate corporate governance, for establishing and ensuring the eff ectiveness of the Company’s systems of 
internal control and for reviewing management performance. Through the Chief Executive, the Board has regard to the 
necessary financial and human resources required to meet the Company’s objectives.
The composition of the Board
The composition of the Board is outlined on pages 36 and 37. The Board comprises an appropriate mix of executive 
and non-executive directors and is of a size and includes the skills and experience appropriate for the requirements of 
the business. There is a clear written division of responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive which has 
been agreed by the Board. Mr Reading is the senior independent non-executive director. The principal role of the senior 
independent non-executive director is to be available to shareholders if they have concerns which have not been 
resolved through the normal channels of Chairman or Chief Executive. As has been the practice for a number of years, 
the major shareholders were off ered the opportunity to meet with the senior independent non-executive director 
during the year. 
All the non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent. Mr Keen, the Chairman, was appointed 
to the Board as an independent non-executive director in 1993. Mr Keen fulfilled the criteria for independence as set out 
in the Combined Code at the time of his appointment and the Board is satisfied that Mr Keen remains free from any 
relationship with the executive management of the Company which could materially interfere with the exercise of his 
independent judgement. The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are available from 
the Company on request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting. All of the directors stood for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting in 2010 and will now do so each year, in accordance with the new UK Corporate 
Governance Code which comes into force for accounting periods beginning on or after 29 June 2010.
The operation of the Board
The Board meets at least eight times a year. A schedule of meetings and principal matters to be discussed is normally 
set out at least twelve months in advance. The Board makes periodic visits to the Company’s operations, and in 
addition the heads of the operating divisions and the Head of Global Human Resources periodically attend Board 
Meetings. The Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration, Nominations and 
Administration Committees which are described below. The Board determines the membership and Chairmanship of 
the Committees. Minutes of those Committee meetings are circulated to Board Members prior to each Board Meeting. 
Prior to the Meetings, all directors receive Board Papers, which include detailed financial information and a 
comprehensive operational overview from the Chief Executive. The Chairman and the non-executive directors meet at 
least twice a year without the executive directors present and the senior independent director meets at least annually 
with the non-executive directors without the Chairman present.
There is a schedule of key operational matters reserved for Board approval, including for example significant long term 
obligations such as capital investments, acquisitions and divestments above certain levels, the raising of new capital 
and entering into loan agreements. The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the business to the Chief 
Executive.
Performance of the Board
During the last twelve months the Board has conducted a self-evaluation assessment of itself and its committees. 
Following completion of questionnaires by all directors, the Chairman held one-to-one discussions with each director 
and led discussions to consider the Board’s “behaviours” and “processes”. Certain areas were identified for improvement 
or action. The Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees also considered their own performance and reported 
to the Board thereon. The performance of individual directors has been considered by the Chairman and Chief  48 Laird PLC
Corporate governance report (continued) for the year to 31 December 2010
Executive in discussion with other non-executive directors. The non-executive directors have considered the 
performance of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the executive directors. The Chairman and Chief 
Executive have considered the performance of the executive directors which is also discussed with the non-executive 
directors. The Board’s evaluation processes will be reviewed by an independent third party during 2011.
New directors are provided with training prior to taking up the role and existing directors are provided with training as 
necessary, this can take the form of reports and briefings from external advisers and senior employees, attendance at 
seminars and conferences and bespoke training. As part of the annual Performance Review each director is asked what 
training is required.
Board attendance
The Board had ten meetings during 2010. Mr Robb was unable to attend one Board Meeting, otherwise all of the 
directors attended all of the meetings. Whenever a director is unable to attend a meeting, the director, if possible, 
consults with the Chairman prior to the meeting and is briefed by the Chairman after the meeting.
There were five Audit Committee meetings, six Remuneration Committee meetings and two Nominations Committee 
meetings during the year; at all of which there was full attendance.
Communications with shareholders
Communication with shareholders takes place through the Annual Report and Accounts and the Interim Report. 
Additional information, including interim management statements, copies of other press releases, presentations and 
webcasts, is published on the Company’s website. Presentations covering strategic issues as well as financial and 
operating performance were made to major shareholders through investor roadshows in the UK during the year. 
Laird PLC, within the limits imposed by the Listing Rules, enters into a dialogue with institutional shareholders to develop 
an understanding of their views and to communicate and explain the Company’s objectives. The Chief Executive and 
Finance Director meet regularly with shareholders and report to the Board following these meetings. The Board is kept 
up to date with investors’ views through the distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ notes. In addition, the Company’s 
stockbroker periodically contacts shareholders and provides non-attributable feedback which is reported to the Board. 
Following presentations to analysts of the interim and full year results, confidential exit polls are conducted by outside 
consultants and the results are reported to the Board. From time to time more extensive formal surveys on a 
non-attributable basis are commissioned.
The Chairman and the senior independent non-executive director are available for meetings with shareholders in the 
event that there are any concerns which cannot be addressed through management, or in connection with any 
significant change to the Company’s strategy, remuneration policy or governance arrangements. The Chairman and 
senior independent non-executive director discussed governance and remuneration with certain institutional investors 
during the year. 
The Board views the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate with both private investors and 
institutional shareholders and encourages them to attend. Shareholders are invited to ask questions and are given the 
opportunity to meet the directors informally after the meeting. The Chairman gives a formal report on the Company’s 
progress at the meeting. A copy of his statement is issued to the London Stock Exchange and is published on the 
Company’s website. All of the directors, with the exception of Dr Spivey who was unable to attend (due to travel 
disruption caused by the Icelandic volcano eruption), attended the AGM in 2010. The chairmen of the Remuneration 
and Audit Committees were available to answer questions relating to their areas of responsibility. The number of proxy 
votes cast for, against or withheld on the resolutions are reported to the meeting and, following the meeting, are 
published on the Company’s website.
Committees of the Board
The written Terms of Reference of the Committees are available on the Company’s website, from the Company on 
request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman of each Committee reports to the Board, 
as appropriate, and the minutes of all Committee meetings are circulated to the Board. Laird PLC 49
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee members are all independent non-executive directors. The Chairman of the Committee is 
Mr A M Robb and the other members of the Committee during the year were Mr A J Reading and Dr W R Spivey. The 
Board ensures that at least one member has recent and relevant financial experience, currently Mr Robb, and it is 
satisfied that the Committee as a whole has suff icient financial, international and commercial experience to enable it 
to carry out its duties. The non-executive directors who are not members of the Audit Committee are also invited to 
attend meetings and frequently do so. The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the 
Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the external auditor are given notice of all meetings and may be 
invited to attend and speak at any meeting. The Committee and the external auditor met formally without any 
executive directors present once during the year. The external auditor has the opportunity to meet with the Committee 
without any executive directors present whenever necessary and the Committee ensures that this happens at least 
once a year in order to discuss any issues or concerns from either party.
The Audit Committee, which met five times during the year, is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Company which are relied upon by the Board. The Audit Committee Terms of Reference (which are 
available on the Company’s website) set out its responsibilities and procedures. The Committee reviews the Group and 
Company’s financial statements prior to their publication with particular reference to significant financial reporting 
issues and judgements. During the year, the Annual Report and Accounts, the AGM and interim management 
statement, the Interim Report on the Results for the half year and the October interim management statement were 
reviewed by the Committee before recommending them to the Board for approval. During the year, the Committee has 
overseen the Company’s work on the Bribery Act 2010, which included reviewing the Company’s existing Business 
Ethics and Conduct Policy in the light of the new Act and appointing Deloitte LLP to conduct an internal review of the 
Company’s procedures. It also received two formal reports on litigation and claims. 
The Committee oversees the internal audit function and also has responsibility for reviewing the internal financial 
controls. The Committee considers the scope and planning of internal financial audits and reviews the process for 
identifying and managing financial risk and the findings of those audits. Deloitte LLP , who provide global internal audit 
services under the direction of the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit, attended one Committee meeting 
during the year. The Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit briefed the Audit Committee three times on key 
internal audit matters and findings of internal audit investigations. He had the opportunity at each meeting to meet 
with the Audit Committee without any executive directors present and he met separately with the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee on one further occasion during the year.
The Committee reviews the Company’s procedure for handling allegations from whistleblowers as set out in the 
Company’s Business Ethics and Conduct Policy (which is on the Company’s website) and any whistleblowing events 
are brought to its attention. A whistleblowing service, which off ers a relevant language service in all countries in which 
Laird operates, is made available to all employees through an independent telephone and internet provider. Employees 
have the right to remain anonymous. A monthly report on any calls received is sent to senior management. 
Investigation of all whistleblower communications is overseen by the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit 
with findings reported to the Board.
The appointment and terms of engagement of Ernst & Young LLP , the external auditor, including the proposed fee 
structure, were considered and the independence of the external auditor assessed. The Committee considered the 
scope and planning of the external financial audit and assessed the eff ectiveness of the audit process, including a 
report on the audit firm’s own internal quality control procedures. 
The Committee has reviewed Ernst & Young’s key policies for maintaining objectivity and independence, including the 
policy for the rotation of audit partners which requires a new lead audit partner to be appointed every five years. In 
accordance with this policy, there will be a change in the lead audit partner after the Annual Report and Accounts for 
2010 have been signed.
The Committee also recommends for Board approval a policy for non-audit services to be performed by the auditor, 
particularly in cases where the auditor’s opinion is required by statute such as circulars to shareholders, so as to ensure 
that the provision of non-audit services does not impair the external auditor’s independence or objectivity. This policy 
prohibits the use of the external audit firm for certain specified matters and the hiring of its former employees. There 
are often sound commercial and practical reasons, including confidentiality, for using Ernst & Young LLP to provide 
non-audit services. During the year, Ernst & Young LLP provided tax planning and compliance advice, regulatory  50 Laird PLC
Corporate governance report (continued) for the to ended 31 December 2010
compliance work and undertook work in connection with the acquisition of Cattron Group International, Inc. in 
November 2010. Where applicable, competitive quotes are obtained. Details of fees for non-audit work are set out in 
note 6 on page 79. 
The Committee has authority to seek any information it requires from any off icer or employee of the Company or any 
of its subsidiary undertakings. It believes that it has received suff icient, reliable and timely information from 
management to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities during the year. The Audit Committee can take such independent 
professional advice as it considers necessary. 
The Committee recommended to the Board, the re-election of Ernst & Young LLP as the external auditor. 
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of the Chairman and at least two non-executive directors. It is chaired by 
Mr N J Keen and comprised Mr A J Reading and Sir Christopher Hum. Mr A M Robb attended the Committee meeting 
when Mr Reading’s re-appointment was considered. It met twice in 2010. The Committee, in consultation with the 
Chief Executive, regularly reviews the structure, size and composition (including the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience) required of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes. At least 
annually the Committee reviews the performance of the Chief Executive. It is responsible for nominating, for the 
approval of the Board, candidates for appointment to the Board having regard to the overall skills balance and 
composition of the Board. It reviews and advises upon succession planning and takes into account the need to refresh 
the Board ensuring that changes to the Board’s composition can be managed without undue disruption. The 
Committee is assisted by external search consultancies in identifying suitable candidates. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr A J Reading and currently comprises the Chairman, Mr N J Keen, and all 
the other non-executive directors, who are all considered to be independent. It met six times in 2010 and is responsible 
for recommending to the Board the Company’s general policy on remuneration and in particular to determine the 
remuneration and benefits of the executive directors, the grant of all options and award of shares under the 
Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme. In accordance with the Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee, 
the Chairman of the Board is not the chairman of the Committee. The Remuneration Committee, excluding the 
Chairman, determines the remuneration of the Chairman and the terms of his appointment. 
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, when requested by the Chairman of the Committee, attends a 
portion of the meetings. In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive is consulted on general policy matters and 
matters concerning the other executive directors and employees. Further details on the Remuneration Committee are 
to be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 52 to 62. 
Administration Committee
The Administration Committee of the Board consists of any two or more directors and deals with items of a routine and 
administrative nature. 
Share Capital
Information on the Company’s share capital is set out on page 43 of the Directors’ report and in note 29 on page 99.
Internal control
Laird PLC is a holding company registered in the UK with businesses primarily located overseas. These businesses are 
organised as subsidiary companies where the management of these companies are appointed to manage within the 
framework established by the Laird PLC Board, as well as complying with local statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Overall responsibility for Laird’s systems of internal control and reviewing their eff ectiveness lies with the Laird PLC 
Board, who ensure that a review is carried out at least annually to assess the adequacy of those systems. Primary 
responsibility for systems of internal control rests with the managers of the subsidiaries. Laird PLC’s executive directors 
are responsible for implementing Group policy and for monitoring the businesses and performance of operating 
companies and units and reporting to the Board thereon. The financial information received by Laird PLC is reviewed at 
divisional level as well as by the Finance Department of Laird PLC which reviews the consolidation and financial 
statements to ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are appropriately reflected.  Laird PLC 51
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group is in place and 
complies with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control and is regularly reviewed by the Board. This 
process has been in place for the full financial year and up to the date the accounts were approved by the Board. The 
systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives as well as safeguarding the Group’s assets. These systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Group operating rules are issued periodically to the managers of subsidiaries setting out their responsibilities and 
delegated authorities. These rules require approval for specific transactions and call for accurate and relevant financial 
information to be delivered on a timely basis. The ability to identify risk is enhanced by the timely reporting of 
management information and the short lines of communication with operating managers.
Subsidiaries submit their budgets annually to Laird PLC’s executive directors. In addition, through a risk and controls 
self-assessment process, they are required to identify the key risk and control issues that their businesses face and set 
out the strategies they will employ to manage them. The issues raised by the subsidiaries are reviewed by the Board as 
part of the annual risk review process. A risk management update, reporting emergent risks and any changes to the risk 
environment, is presented at all Board Meetings. This process is supplemented by papers submitted to the Board by the 
executive directors throughout the year and by meetings from time to time between the Board and the management of 
the subsidiaries, some of which take place at the premises of the operating companies. The Chief Executive presents 
the Group’s business objectives which are approved by the Board, and the Board also addresses those risks which 
aff ect Laird as a whole. The Board instigates further reports and investigations as it considers necessary.
Risk management strategy, risk performance monitoring and risk oversight at Group level for all areas including 
operational, environmental and health and safety risk rests with the Laird Risk Management Group (“RMG”). The RMG is 
chaired by the Group Chief Executive and reports to the Board. Co-ordination of risk identification and review and 
actions in all areas below corporate level and improvements in controls and operational risk management are driven 
by the Laird Risk Management Committee (“RMC”), chaired by the President of one of Laird’s business divisions, with 
representation for all divisions and Laird’s functions. During the year, the RMC met three times and the RMG met twice, 
with the third RMG meeting replaced by a facilitated risk review exercise conducted with the full Board. The Director of 
Risk Management and Internal Audit and the Chairman of the RMC are members of both committees, reinforcing 
consistency and linking between Laird’s risk management strategy and its implementation in all countries. Further 
details on the RMG and RMC are set out in the Corporate social responsibility report on pages 28 to 34.
The Chief Executive and the Managing Director review in detail, at least twice a year, the environmental, health and 
safety policies and at least annually, the Director of Risk Management presents these findings to the Board. 
Environmental, health and safety updates are provided at each Board meeting. Further details are set out in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 28 to 34. 
As noted above, the Audit Committee reviews the Group and Company’s financial statements. It also has responsibility 
for reviewing the process for identifying and managing financial risk and for reviewing the internal financial controls 
and considers the scope and planning of internal and external audits. It reviews reports on internal financial control 
including reports by the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the Finance Director and the results from 
internal financial audits. As part of their audit, the external auditor, to the extent they consider necessary to support 
their audit opinion, review and test the systems of internal control and the data contained in the accounts, including an 
independent and objective review of the approach of management to the reporting of the operating results and 
financial condition.

The Directors’ remuneration report sets out the Company’s policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive 
directors together with details of the directors’ remuneration and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year. The Committee’s remit is to ensure that the remuneration 
policy continues to attract and retain executives of the appropriate calibre and experience needed to manage the 
international complexity of Laird’s operations.
Remuneration Committee – key actions:
• consulted with key shareholders on the EPS target, vesting threshold and quantum for options awarded in 2010. 
• reviewed independent remuneration consultants and appointed Deloitte LLP .
• requested Deloitte LLP to conduct a review of base remuneration for the three executive directors and selected other 
senior executives involving benchmarking against comparable companies, including for the US-based Managing 
Director, against US companies. 
• determined that, at the request of the executive directors, their base salaries would not be increased but would be 
considered in July 2011.
• concluded, following the review by Deloitte, that the basic structure of salary, annual bonus and longer term share 
incentives provided an appropriate remuneration structure but certain changes to performance targets for the 
longer term share incentives were desirable and that changes should be implemented for grants to be made in 2011, 
after consultation with key shareholders.
• identified a revised list of companies (including six US corporations) to be used as the comparator group for the total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) performance condition (to provide greater correlation than the FTSE 250) to apply to the 
longer term share incentive grants to be made in 2011. 
• agreed to amend the performance conditions for the 2011 awards under the Share Option Plan and the Long Term 
Incentive Plan, to include both underlying earnings per share (“EPS”) as well as TSR measures for both schemes and 
consulted with key shareholders during February 2011 on the proposals.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, is responsible for recommending to the Board the Company’s general policy on 
remuneration and in particular determining the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors, 
and the grant of all options and awards of shares. The Chairman does not attend discussions on his own remuneration. 
The Board, as a whole, is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors. 
The members of the Remuneration Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership is reviewed at least 
annually. The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board and cannot be the Chairman of the Board. 
Mr A J Reading is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The other Committee Members are the Chairman, 
Mr N J Keen, and Sir Christopher Hum, Professor M J Kelly, Mr A M Robb and Dr W R Spivey, all independent 
non-executive directors. The Board considers it essential that the Chairman of the Board be involved in setting 
remuneration policy and therefore Mr Keen is a member of the Remuneration Committee. Miss A M Downie, the 
Company Secretary, acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, attends the meetings. The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee 
meetings. In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters 
concerning the other executive directors and employees. The written Terms of Reference of the Remuneration 
Committee are available on the Company’s website and from the Company on request. They will also be on display at 
the Annual General Meeting. 
As mentioned above, during the year, the Remuneration Committee undertook a review of its remuneration 
consultants and appointed Deloitte LLP . During the year, both T owers Watson, the previous remuneration consultant, and 
Deloitte LLP provided independent external professional advice. Towers Watson also provide pension actuarial services 
to Laird PLC and to the Trustees of the Laird P ension Scheme and Deloitte LLP provide internal audit services to Laird 
PLC. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that no conflict of interest exists in the provision of these services. The 
Remuneration Committee has also sought the views of the Chief Executive, Mr P J Hill, during the year. 
Directors' remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2010 Laird PLC 53
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has 
established a policy for the non-executive directors. 
The policy for the executive directors is to structure the remuneration package so that no single aspect dominates. 
Therefore there is a mixture of fixed remuneration and performance-related remuneration, with the latter split between 
annual bonuses with a range of diff erent measures and longer-term share incentives, which use more than one 
performance target. Further details are set out below.
The Remuneration Committee believes that having an incentive-driven remuneration package promotes the alignment 
of interests of executive directors and shareholders. That policy is based upon the following principles:
• the need to link remuneration to achieving strategic objectives and to sustainable long-term corporate success 
having due regard to environmental, social and governance issues and the overall risk profile of Laird;
• the reward opportunity off ered to executive directors should be suff iciently competitive to recruit and retain 
management of the appropriate calibre and experience; 
• the need to provide a total compensation package which reflects the international complexity of Laird’s operations; 
and
• to be mindful of Company performance and overall shareholder returns, and the implications of this for 
executive remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors is regularly reviewed taking into 
account market practice, the individual’s performance, the performance of Laird and other pay structures within Laird. 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance incentive awards up to a maximum percentage of 
base salary, pensions and other benefits, and long term performance awards which are reviewed annually by the 
Remuneration Committee. On a regular basis, the Committee requests its independent consultants to undertake a 
benchmarking exercise on base pay, the most recent benchmarking exercise, completed in December 2010, covered 
all aspects of the remuneration package for the executive directors and other senior executives. The previous 
benchmarking exercise was carried out in July 2008. Benefits comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, 
disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance incentive award scheme and membership of 
a pension scheme. Neither performance incentive awards nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package. Since 2003, the Remuneration 
Committee has granted options and awards under the Company’s executive share option plan and Long Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). A summary of these arrangements is set out below. The Committee believes that a combination 
of share option plans and the LTIP for senior executives is the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create 
substantial improvement in the Company’s performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and 
shareholders.

Directors' remuneration report (continued) for the year to 31 December 2010
In view of the challenging economic climate, executive directors’ salaries, at their request, have not been increased 
since 1 July 2008 (Mr Hill: 1 July 2007). The Remuneration Committee agreed that a “freeze” in base salaries was 
appropriate. The Remuneration Committee annually reviews salaries, the individuals’ and the Company’s performance 
and salary levels for other company executives and has taken the pay and conditions of other employees of Laird into 
account, including any base salary increases awarded. There were no increases in base salary in 2010 for employees in 
Laird’s Head Off ice and other UK employees received an average increase of 1.4%. The increases in Laird Technologies 
in 2010 for management level employees ranged from zero to 10% depending on several factors, including region. 
Greater increases were awarded to certain individuals as a result of promotions or significant increases in the scale or 
geographic scope of their responsibilities. 
Service Agreements
Each of the executive directors has a service agreement. Messrs Hill and Silver’s service agreements are dated 8 March 
2004. Mr Rapp’s service agreement is dated 31 December 2004. In line with the Company’s policy, the executive 
directors’ service agreements are not for a fixed term and provide for twelve months’ written notice of termination from 
either party. Mr Rapp’s service agreement is with Laird Technologies, Inc. and he has a separate letter dated 7 March 
2008 from the Company in respect of his appointment as an executive director. In 2006, the terms of employment for 
the executive directors in the UK were amended to change the contractual retirement date from age 60 to age 65 to 
comply with the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 which came into force in the UK on 1 October 2006. The 
executives may still retire at age 60 with their retirement benefits unchanged from the previous arrangements. The 
Company’s policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service 
agreement. The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice. The payment would be calculated as 
the total of the director’s base salary plus the value of his benefits, in each case by reference to the period of the 
unexpired notice of termination. 
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts. They are appointed under letters of appointment which 
provide for a review after an initial three year term. After the initial three year term, the appointment is reviewed and, in 
the past, the appointment would be renewed for a further three year term. However, due to the change in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which will apply for future accounting periods, requiring annual re-election of directors, it 
has been decided that the term of appointment for a non-executive director will now be one year after an initial three 
year term. Messrs Reading and Robb, whose terms came up for review in September 2010 have therefore been 
re-appointed for one year terms, subject to annual review thereafter. The appointment of a non-executive director is 
subject to termination if he ceases to be qualified to act as a director of the Company; if he resigns by written notice; or 
he is not re-elected under the Company’s Articles of Association. Dates of appointment are shown on pages 36 and 37.
Shareholding Guidelines
Shareholding guidelines, under which executive directors will be expected to retain, as shares, all of the after-tax profit 
on the gains made on the vesting of LTIP awards and the exercise of existing or future executive share options, until 
they have acquired a shareholding equal in value to their base salaries, were introduced in 2003. At 31 December 2010, 
Messrs Hill, Silver and Rapp had an interest in shares equivalent to a multiple of 0.86 (2009, 0.62), 1.94 (2009, 1.41) and 
0.39 (2009, 0.28) of their base salaries respectively.
Outside Appointments
The Board believes that there can be significant benefits, to both the Company and the individual, from executive 
directors accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside the Group. The Board takes into account the 
likely time commitment for such appointments prior to approving them. The executive directors are entitled to retain 
the fees for such appointments.
During the year, Mr Hill was a non-executive director of Meggitt plc until 31 March 2010 and a non-executive director of 
Cookson Group plc from 1 February 2010. He was entitled to retain the fees of £11,250 (2009, £45,000) from Meggitt plc 
and £36,667 from Cookson Group plc. Mr Silver was a non-executive director of INVESCO Income Growth Trust plc 
during the year and he was entitled to retain fees of £21,000 (2009, £21,000).
Pensions
Mr Rapp, who is based in the USA, is a member of an employee managed defined contribution programme to which 
Laird Technologies, Inc. makes a 50% match of the member’s contributions up to 6% of gross earnings, subject to a 
cap. The amount paid in by Laird Technologies in 2010 for Mr Rapp was £5,276. In addition, Mr Rapp receives a taxable 
cash payment of 30% of base salary in lieu of any other pension contribution.  Laird PLC 55
Messrs Hill and Silver are members of a UK Group contributory defined benefits scheme. The main benefits are: on 
pension retirement at age sixty, a maximum pension of two thirds final salary (excluding bonuses and other benefits) 
dependent on service; on death in retirement, a dependant’s pension of 60% of the member’s pension; on death in 
service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependant’s pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the member’s expected 
pension, if higher. Pensions in payment for Messrs Hill and Silver will increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail 
price index or 8.5% per annum compound. Transfer values provided on leaving service do not include any allowances 
for discretionary benefits.
Mr Hill’s benefits in the defined benefits scheme are subject to an earnings cap. They are supplemented by an 
unfunded arrangement to maintain the same level of benefits as if the earnings cap did not apply. Since 1 July 2008, 
Mr Hill has received a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future accrual of the unfunded 
arrangement.
Following the introduction of the A Day legislation in April 2006, Mr Silver’s pension has ceased to accrue within the 
defined benefits scheme. In light of the Company’s previous pension commitment to Mr Silver, he now receives a 
taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future pension accrual under the pension scheme. 
These payments in respect of Messrs Hill and Silver are expected to reduce future pension risks for the Company. 
Payments in lieu of pension provision are excluded from the calculation of any bonus entitlements and share scheme 
awards and are not included in the calculations below.

Mr Silver ceased to accrue further pension benefits from 6 April 2006, however, his benefits accrued at that date

Annual Performance Incentive Awards
The maximum award, for exceptional performance, that could be earned for 2010 was 100% of base salary for the UK 
executive directors and 125% for Mr Rapp. Target awards were 75% of base salary for the UK executive directors and 
100% of base salary for Mr Rapp. The award criteria established for 2010 were based on targets of:
• underlying profit before tax (approximately 45% of the maximum); 
• working capital metrics (approximately 10% of the maximum);
• the achievement of criteria designed to assess and drive performance against a number of key, measurable 
strategic objectives for the Company, including those relating to environmental, safety and social and corporate 
responsibility issues (approximately 20% of the maximum); and
• an additional 25% of the maximum being available to be awarded for exceptional performance. 
The specific criteria used are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but include, inter alia, expansion of the 
customer base, market share gains, turnarounds in the profitability of certain businesses, and aggressive cost 
reduction targets. The profit target was based on a combination of budgets and market estimates for the year. 
Actual awards determined by the Remuneration Committee as a percentage of base salary in respect of 2010 for 
Messrs Hill and Silver were 55% each and for Mr Rapp 75% (2009, 10% each). These took into account the underlying 
financial performance and the strategic development of Laird and the achievement of measurable strategic objectives 
and reflected the achievement of greater than 50% of the targets.  56 Laird PLC
Directors' remuneration report (continued) for the year to 31 December 2010
The Remuneration Committee took into account that underlying profit before tax in 2010 was 52% higher than in 2009, 
and that operating cash conversion, after capital expenditure, in 2010 was strong at 89% notwithstanding the 
significant growth in profits in the year. No awards were made for exceptional performance.
Share Plans
The share incentive schemes currently operated by the Company for the executive directors are the Long Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and the Executive Share Option Plans, which the Remuneration Committee believes are the most 
appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Company’s continuing long-term 
performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders. Each time awards are made under the 
LTIP and the Executive Share Option Plans, the Committee carefully considers the performance measures to be used, 
including whether to use non-financial Key Performance Indicators. For the awards made in 2010 it was concluded that 
the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) and underlying Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) were the most appropriate measures for 
aligning the objectives of executives with those of shareholders. As advised last year, the Share Price Improvement Plan 
(“SPIP”) introduced in 2008 was cancelled in 2010.
The LTIP and Share Option Plans may use either market purchased shares or newly issued shares, provided that any 
newly issued shares count towards the overall dilution limit of 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue from time to 
time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans and all other share 
schemes operated by the Company.
a) Long Term Incentive Plan (“L TIP”)
The LTIP involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets 
measured over three years. Executive directors are eligible for annual awards of shares. The maximum annual award 
value under the LTIP is one times base salary. In setting the level of awards the Remuneration Committee takes into 
account options granted to executive directors under the 2003 Executive Share Option Plans in the same financial year.
Awards under the LTIP in 2003 to 2010 inclusive took the form of nil cost options or conditional awards (in order to 
comply with US tax legislation), to be satisfied by shares from the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) 
purchased in the market. Further details on the Trust are on page 60. 
In 2009 the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the level of awards in the light of the Company’s business 
performance and the then current share price level and the awards made equated to 41.7% of salary for Mr Hill; 41.9% 
for Mr Silver and 45.3% for Mr Rapp, compared with 100% of salary in previous years. The level of awards in 2010 was 
considered by the Committee and the awards made to each director equated to 95% of base salary. In deciding this, 
the Committee took into account the level of awards under the Executive Share Option Plan described below. These 
awards should promote the interests of executives and shareholders in the delivery of above market growth in 
shareholder value in future years.
The awards made on 19 April 2010 were calculated with reference to a share price of 123.4p being the higher of the 
closing mid-market price on 16 April and 19 April 2010. They will, apart from Mr Rapp’s awards, be exercisable between 
19 April 2013 and 19 April 2015, to the extent to which the performance criteria are met. In accordance with US 
requirements, Mr Rapp’s award will vest automatically on 19 April 2013 if the performance criteria have been met. In 
accordance with the rules of the LTIP , outstanding awards may become exercisable before their normal vesting date in 
the event of a change of control of the Company.
The amount charged to the income statement during the year in respect of the LTIPs granted to the executive directors 
was £541,000 (2009, £551,000). The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated as 41.6% of the face value of 
the awards made in 2010.
The extent to which awards granted under the LTIP in 2010 vest will be determined by reference to the Company’s total 
shareholder return relative to FTSE 250 companies (excluding investment trusts) and the following targets will apply:
Total Shareholder Return 
Performance Level
Amount of Award Vesting
%
Upper Quartile
Median to Upper Quartile
Below Median
Full vest ng
Pro rata between 30% and full vesting
Nil Laird PLC 57
These performance conditions will be measured only over a single three year period. There is no provision for retesting. 
In addition, no awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained 
improvement in the Company’s underlying financial performance.
The LTIP awards made in 2008 lapsed at the end of 2010 as the performance criteria for total shareholder return to 
31 December 2010 was not met. The awards made in 2007 lapsed, at the end of 2009, also as a result of the 
performance criteria not being met.

*Mr Rapp’s conditional awards vest automatically, in order to comply with US tax legislation.
b) Share Options
The executive directors have outstanding options under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2003 
Executive Share Option Plan (No.1). The 1994 scheme was replaced by new share option schemes approved by 
shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting. Since May 2001 the basis for calculation of the maximum grant of 
options to executive directors and other employees is the equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant 
of up to one times base salary in any one year and up to two times base salary in special circumstances, such as the 
recruitment or promotion to a key management position. 
The 2003 Executive Share Option Plans
There are two plans which were approved by shareholders in 2003. One plan permits the grant of options approved by 
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to be made to individuals who may be eligible for capital gains tax relief on the 
exercise of options; otherwise both plans are identical in all material respects. 
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee takes into account both the level of awards made to executive 
directors under the LTIP and the prevailing share price. 58 Laird PLC
Directors' remuneration report (continued) for the year to 31 December 2010
For the options awarded in 2003 to 2008 (inclusive) the performance criteria was the increase in earnings per share 
measured against the rate of UK retail price inflation plus a specified percentage per annum over a fixed three year 
period, as shown in the table below.

Applicable Performance Target: 
Average Annual growth in earnings per share in excess of inflation

pro rata to the multiple of salary
UK RPI + 5% to 7.5% per annum 
applied pro rata to the multiple of 
salary
The Remuneration Committee considered that a consistent and real rate of growth in earnings per share is an 
appropriate performance target as it is a good guide to the underlying financial performance of Laird PLC. However, 
due to the uncertain economic circumstances aff ecting the Company’s performance in 2009, the Committee 
considered the basis for the earnings per share (“EPS”) targets and, after consultation with major shareholders, set the 
following specific underlying EPS performance targets:
Level of vesting in 2012
Applicable Performance Target:
2011 Earnings per share (EPS)
Threshold 50% vesting 18.7 pence
Full vesting 21.3 pence
With a pro-rata vesting on a straight line basis where underlying EPS is between 18.7 pence and 21.3 pence. The EPS 
figures were adjusted, from those set at the time of the grant, for the 2009 Rights Issue.
Based on the reported underlying EPS for 2009, of 9.6 pence, to achieve the 2011 threshold requires EPS growth 
between 2009 and 2011 of 39.6% per annum and, for full vesting, EPS growth of 49.0% per annum, between 2009 and 
2011. The Remuneration Committee believes these are stretching targets.
In 2010, the Remuneration Committee after considering the performance criteria and threshold at which options would 
vest, agreed the following performance condition:
Level of vesting in 2013
Applicable Performance Target:
2012 Earnings per share (EPS)
Threshold 30% vesting 16.6 pence
Full vesting 21.3 pence
With a pro-rata vesting on a straight line basis where underlying EPS is between 16.6 pence and 21.3 pence.
Based on the reported underlying EPS for 2010, of 11.8 pence, to achieve the 2012 threshold requires EPS growth 
between 2010 and 2012 of 19% per annum and, for full vesting, EPS growth of 35% per annum, between 2010 and 2012. 
The Remuneration Committee believes these are stretching targets.
The performance conditions under the Plan are based on the Company’s earnings per share growth adjusted to 
exclude items which do not reflect the Company’s underlying financial performance. Underlying EPS and underlying 
profit are defined on pages 10 and 11.
The performance conditions are measured at the end of a three year period. There is no provision for retesting and to 
the extent that the performance conditions have not been met, the options will lapse.
The rules of the 2003 Plan permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change 
of control, death or retirement. In accordance with the rules of the Plan, outstanding options may become exercisable 
before their normal exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company. Laird PLC 59
The maximum level of awards under the 2003 Plan is normally one times base salary, however, the Remuneration 
Committee considers the level of awards in the light of the Company’s business performance and the then current 
share price level when it decides on the number of share options to be awarded. In 2010 the awards equated to 50% of 
base salary as the Remuneration Committee considered that the potential for future growth was higher and that these 
awards, together with awards under the LTIP described above, should incentivise executive directors in the delivery of 
above market growth in shareholder value in future years. 
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of the share options granted to the executive directors was 
£34,000 (2009, £68,000). The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated at 35 per cent of the face value of 
grants made in 2010.
The share options granted in 2007 did not meet the performance criteria and have therefore lapsed. 
The directors’ interests in options under the 2003 Executive Share Option (No. 1) Plan in respect of new shares to be 
issued are shown in the table below:

J C Silver 680,702 134,507 58,791 756,418
The performance criteria are set out on page 58.
1994 Share Option Scheme
Under the 1994 scheme options were granted over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise (and also over 
existing shares). The exercise of options under the 1994 scheme is dependent upon the attainment of performance 
criteria set by the Remuneration Committee. The scheme permitted the grant of both approved and unapproved 
options. Options were granted at the closing middle market price on the last dealing day prior to grant and are 
exercisable after three years but not more than ten years from the date of grant.
In 2006 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions and agreed that the earnings per share target for the 
grants made in 2002 (the last year in which options were granted under this Scheme) had been met and that there 
had been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.

The Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”)
The Trust purchases and holds shares in Laird PLC to meet the requirements of share option awards and grants under 
the LTIP . The Trust, which is financed by a loan of £3.7m from the Company, currently holds 1,037,070 ordinary shares 
which relate to the LTIP . Currently there are no outstanding share options, other than those granted under the LTIP , to 
be satisfied by the Trust. Whilst shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are 
exercisable by the trustee, in accordance with its fiduciary duties. Laird PLC 61
Non-executive Directors
The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors. The Chairman does 
not attend discussions on his own remuneration.
Non-Executive Directors
Laird’s policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and 
experience that is relevant to Laird’s global businesses. In this context, it is the Board’s policy for the non-executive 
directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions and is suff icient to attract individuals with appropriate 
knowledge and experience.
Chairman
Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Mr Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the 
Company. Mr Keen also acts as Chairman of the trustees of a Laird pension scheme for which he receives no 
additional remuneration. Mr Keen’s fees for his services, for which he must account to Imperialise Limited, are £175,000 
per annum. Imperialise is responsible for Mr Keen’s National Insurance (“NI”) and is paid a sum equivalent to the NI on 
those fees of £22,400, for which it accounts to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) whereas for the other 
non-executive directors, who are paid through Laird’s payroll, NI is paid directly to HMRC. NI payments are not included 
in the table below. Mr Keen’s initial period of appointment as Chairman was for three years commencing 5 June 2000. 
His term of appointment, was extended by the Board for three further three year periods commencing 5 June 2003, 
5 June 2006 and 5 June 2009. The appointment, which is subject to the rotation provisions of the articles of 
association, may be terminated by either party giving not less than six months notice.
Non-Executive Directors’ Fees
The non-executive directors’ annual fee is £36,000 per annum. Messrs Reading’s and Robb’s emoluments include fees 
at the rate of £7,000 per annum to reflect their chairmanship of Board Committees. Dr Spivey who is based in North 
America, received additional remuneration of £15,000 during the year to take account of additional time spent on the 
Company’s business. Sir Christopher Hum’s services as a non-executive director are supplied by Qilin Consulting 
Limited. The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not receive any other benefits.

Statement of directors' responsibilities in relation to the Group financial statements
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditor’s statement of their responsibilities on 
pages 64 and 65, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors 
and the Auditor in relation to the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and those International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present a true and fair view of 
the financial position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In 
preparing those financial statements on a going concern basis, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insuff icient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time, the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. They 
are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may diff er from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:
(i)  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and result of the Group taken as a whole; and
(ii)  the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
By order of the Board

9 March 2011 64 Laird PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Laird PLC for the year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise 
the Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group statement of changes in 
equity, the Group statement of financial position, the Group cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 37. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 63, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Group financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements suff icient to 
give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the Group financial statements.
Opinion on Group financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s aff airs as at 31 December 2010 and of its loss for the year then 
ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements; and
• the information given in the Corporate governance report set out on pages 47 to 51 with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is 
consistent with the Group financial statements.

1  Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 9 March 2011 and the statement of financial position was signed on the Board’s behalf by P J Hill and 
J C Silver. Laird PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales and its ordinary 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted for use in the European Union (IFRS) and the principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set 
out in note 2. 
2 Accounting policies
 Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivative financial 
instruments, that have been measured at fair value, and accounting for pensions. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand unless 
otherwise indicated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles requires the directors to make judgements and assumptions that aff ect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense 
during the reporting periods. Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the directors’ best knowledge 
of the amount, events or actions, actual results may diff er from these estimates.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the measurement and impairment of goodwill, the 
measurement of defined benefit pension assets and obligations and the measurement of income and deferred taxes. 
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of the value in 
use of the cash generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated. This involves estimation of future cash 
flows and choosing a suitable discount rate (see note 17). Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires 
estimation of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality rates, the expected return on assets and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate (see note 35). The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions 
and judgements are applied in deciding the level of provisions for income taxes. To the extent that the final outcome 
diff ers from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to provisions held in the period the determination 
is made. 
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial information.
 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Group comprises Laird PLC and its subsidiary undertakings (‘‘the Group’’). The financial statements of 
the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies where 
appropriate. Intra–group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date 
on which the Group ceases to control them.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of a business combination 
is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group. For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, costs directly 
attributable to the combination were capitalised. The identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured 
initially at fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest 
in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature and liabilities is 
recognised as goodwill.
 Currency translation
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries are prepared using its functional currency. The functional 
currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates. The presentation currency 
of the Group is sterling.
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 Laird PLC 71
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In the Group accounts the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling using weighted 
average rates of exchange for the period. Net investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the 
rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange diff erences arising from retranslating opening net 
investments and the retained profits for the period of overseas subsidiaries, less exchange diff erences on foreign 
currency borrowings that provide a hedge against overseas investments, are shown as movements in equity. All other 
exchange diff erences are dealt with in the income statement for the period. 
Exchange diff erences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. 
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange diff erences held in shareholders’ equity that relate to the 
disposed operation are transferred to the income statement.
 Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received and excludes intra–group sales and value–added 
taxes and represents net invoice value.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party, 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group.
 Retirement benefit obligations
Under IAS 19 the assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans are recognised at fair value in the statement 
of financial position and the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pension plans are recognised in the 
income statement as operating costs and interest costs respectively. Variations from expected costs, arising from 
the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the 
projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current 
service cost) and to the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) and is 
based on actuarial advice. The assets of defined benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the statement of financial 
position and the liabilities are recognised at present value using a high quality corporate bond rate. 
The Group applies IFRIC 14, which allows the Group to recognise a surplus in schemes where an unconditional right to 
a refund or benefit available in the form of reduced contribution rates exists. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they 
become payable.
 Share based payments
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Restricted Share Plan (RSP) shares awarded is estimated at the 
date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the LTIP and RSP shares were awarded including market based performance conditions. The fair value of share options 
granted is estimated at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which share options were granted. Non–market company performance and service conditions 
are not taken into account when estimating the fair value. 
No expense is recognised for grants that do not vest and charges previously made are reversed except that an 
expense is recognised for grants where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied. 
2 Accounting policies (continued)
 Currency translation (continued) Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements (continued) for the year ended 31 December 2010
72 Laird PLC
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non–market 
conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market 
condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance 
sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity. 
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of 
the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of 
cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately. 
 Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets, including patents, trade secrets, brand names and customer relationships, are recognised 
separately from goodwill and capitalised at fair value and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives. 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight–line basis. The estimated useful life of an intangible 
asset ranges between 3 and 20 years depending on its nature.
 Research and development
Research and development expenditure is expensed as it is incurred, except for certain development costs, which 
are capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that the development project will be commercially viable, 
and certain criteria, including commercial and technological feasibility have been met. Intangible assets arising in 
this manner are amortised over their useful economic lives, from the product launch date, which is typically less than 
three years. Intangible assets relating to products in the development phase, both internally generated and externally 
acquired, are subject to an impairment review at each balance sheet date, or earlier should indication of impairment 
arise. Any impairment losses are written off  immediately to the income statement.
 Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair 
value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are 
indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill set off  to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
 Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary diff erences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary diff erence arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction eff ects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary diff erences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary diff erences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary diff erences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary diff erences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised
2 Accounting policies (continued)
 Share based payments (continued) Laird PLC 73
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. 
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
 Dividends
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they 
become a legal liability of the Company.
 Interest
Interest is recognised in the income statement using the eff ective interest method.
 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost comprises the purchase price and directly attributable costs, for example, initial delivery and handling costs and 
installation and assembly costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. For all other property, plant, and equipment 
depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost less residual values of the assets over their useful lives 
as follows:
Freehold buildings  50 years or less
Leasehold buildings   50 years or the lease term if less
Computer equipment  5 years or less
Motor vehicles  4 years
Other plant and machinery  13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
 Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash–generating unit’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use. This is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If the asset does not generate 
cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre–tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses 
of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the 
function of the impaired asset.
 Leases
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is 
treated as a finance lease. All other leases are treated as operating leases, and the related charges are expensed to 
the income statement evenly over the lease term.
2 Accounting policies (continued)
 Income taxes (continued) Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements (continued) for the year ended 31 December 2010
74 Laird PLC
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at fair value. Each 
asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. The obligations relating to finance 
leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under current, or non–current, 
trade and other payables. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting periods during the 
lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period. 
 Segment reporting
Segments are identified on the basis of management information which is presented to the Group’s Chief Operating 
Decision Maker to assess the performance of each segment.
 Exceptional items
These items are presented within the relevant income statement category. The separate reporting of exceptional items 
helps provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. Events which may give rise to the 
classification of items as exceptional include the restructuring of businesses, the transaction costs of acquiring new 
businesses, the integration of new businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, and asset impairments.
 Financial assets 
Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Trade and other receivables are recognised 
on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset and are measured at amortised 
cost less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as 
the probability of insolvency or significant financial diff iculties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all 
of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through 
use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable. Trade and 
other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. 
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Derivative financial assets are classified as held for trading, unless they are designated as hedging instruments. These 
assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses in value being recognised in the income 
statement.
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is 
derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
 Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less, in the case of a liability not at fair value through pro fit or 
loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Measurement after initial recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes 
in the carrying amount being taken through the income statement.
 Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, interest–bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are 
recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
they occur.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
2 Accounting policies (continued)
 Leases (continued) Laird PLC 75
 Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to 
hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments 
are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are taken to the income statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive 
and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts 
with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values 
for similar instruments. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 these are Level 2 derivative financial 
instruments.
For those contracts designated as hedges the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. This documentation 
identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how 
eff ectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are 
expected to be eff ective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing eff ectiveness.
 Cash flow hedges
These are used to hedge potential changes in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions. For cash flow 
hedges, the eff ective portion of the fair value movement on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, 
while the ineff ective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income 
statement when the hedged transaction aff ects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where 
the hedged item is the cost of a non–financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial 
carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to 
profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or 
if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non–financial 
asset or liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss.
 Net investment hedges
These are used to hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net assets of foreign 
operations. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an eff ective hedge is 
recognised in shareholders’ equity, with any ineff ective portion recognised in the income statement. 
 Treasury shares
The Laird PLC shares held in the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”) are classified in shareholders’ equity as 
‘treasury shares’ and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in 
equity, with any diff erence between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash in the statement of financial position comprises cash at bank and in hand and short–term deposits with an 
original maturity in three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For finished goods and work in progress, cost 
includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses (principally administration costs) are excluded. Net 
realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred 
in marketing, selling and distribution.
2 Accounting policies (continued) Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements (continued) for the year ended 31 December 2010
76 Laird PLC
 Provisions
These comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is material.
 New Standards and Interpretations not applied 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not 
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet eff ective for the financial period:
International Accounting Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS) Eff ective date
IAS 32 Amendment – Classification of Rights Issues 1 February 2010
IAS 24 Amendment – Related Party Disclosures 1 January 2011
IFRSs Improvements 1 January 2011
IFRS 7 Amendment – Financial Instruments : Disclosures 1 July 2011
IAS 12 Amendment – Income Taxes 1 January 2012
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement 1 January 2013
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments   1 July 2010
IFRIC 14 Amendment – Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement   1 January 2011
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact 
on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application and plan to adopt these standards and 
interpretations in line with their eff ective dates.
3 Segmental analysis 
In 2009, the Group reported the following segments: Performance Materials, Handset Products and Wireless Systems. 
During 2010, the Group reorganised the Handset Products division. It was announced that the Mechanisms business 
would be exited and it is anticipated that all Mechanisms activity will cease during 2011. Once production has ceased 
the product line will be transferred to discontinued operations. This business unit is shown separately in the analysis 
below.
The mobile antenna business that was previously in the Handset Products division is now included in the Wireless 
Systems division. The specialty metals products business that was previously in the Handset Products division is now 
included within the Performance Materials division. Following the reorganisation there is no longer a Handset Products 
division.

Performance Materials – designs and supplies a range of EMI shielding materials, thermal management solutions and 
signal integrity products to a wide variety of electronic devices.
Wireless Systems – designs and supplies a range of high specification wireless antennae, and machine–to–machine 
(“M2M”) wireless modules for a number of markets including infrastructure and automotive markets.
Mechanisms – designs and supplies a range of mechanical actuation devices for mobile phone handsets.

Capitalised development costs
Internally generated assets arising from the capitalisation of qualifying development expenditure in 2010 typically 
have a finite expected useful life of less than 3 years. Capitalised development expenditure is amortised on a straight 
line basis. All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits. The total amount of 
research and development activity incurred during 2010 is £42.2m (2009, £42.8m) of which £9.5m (2009, £11.1m) was 
capitalised. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for assessment of impairment in accordance with IAS 36. No 
impairment to goodwill was identified.
Goodwill was tested for impairment for the following cash generating units (CGUs):
• Performance Materials division
• Wireless Systems division excluding the Antennae Systems business
• Antennae Systems business
All goodwill relating to the Mechanisms business was written off  during the year. Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements (continued) for the year ended 31 December 2010
88 Laird PLC
Performance Materials had a goodwill balance of £212.2m at the year end (2009, £206.8m). Wireless Systems 
(excluding Antennae Systems) had a goodwill balance of £146.0m at the year end (2009, £117.2m). Antennae Systems 
had a goodwill balance of £123.1m at the year end (2009, £118.5m). Mechanisms had a goodwill balance of £nil at the 
year end (2009, £8.0m). All of the recoverable amounts are based on value in use. 
The key assumptions were:
• A pre–tax discount rate of 9.6% (2009, 10.5%)
• Revenue growth rates for each CGU were based on relevant external market estimates and management 
knowledge. 
The discount rate has been applied to cash flow forecasts for 2011 to perpetuity. 
The forecast cash flows for 2011 are based on what has been approved internally by the Board for the 2011 budget. 
Revenue estimates which underpin the forecasts for 2012–2015, have been based on external market estimates for 
handsets, PCs and Telecoms but after reflecting Managements’ views of average selling prices, product penetration 
trends and their impact on the size of the addressable market. Cash flows for 2015 onwards for all three divisions have 
been increased by 3% per annum (2009, 3% per annum).
Downside sensitivities have been applied to the cash flow estimates to assess the impact upon the headroom over the 
carrying value of the assets and provide further comfort that no impairment is required. Performance Materials has 
the greatest amount of headroom and Antennae Systems the least. Revenues would have to be some 14% less than 
forecast for each period before some form of impairment would have to be considered.
Other acquired intangible assets
Assets in this class are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged against operating profits. 
The following useful lives have been determined for acquired intangible assets:
Brand names – 5 years
Trade secrets – 8 to 15 years
Trade marks and names  – 5 to 15 years
Patents – the remaining duration of the 17 year legal right
Licence – the remaining duration of the 20 year legal right
Customer relationships  – 10 to 20 years
The expected life assigned to acquired customer relationships is an estimate and is not secured by any legal obligation 
on the customer to continue business with the Group for any finite period. Other than goodwill, the Group does not 
hold any intangible assets with an indefinite life.

 Acquisition of businesses in 2010
On 22 November 2010, Cattron Group International, Inc., which designs, develops and manufactures wireless 
controlled automation systems, was acquired for a total consideration of £55.5m. This purchase has been accounted 
for as an acquisition and all intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The fair values are 
provisional due to the acquisition being completed close to the year end. The residual excess over the net assets 
acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.

The Group has acquired a 100% interest in the acquisition noted above. Underlying profits before tax for the entity 
acquired were £1.2m following acquisition. If the acquisition had been held for the full year, 2010 revenues would have 
been £32.3m higher, at £599.7m and the loss before tax would have been £4.0m lower, at £4.6m. Profit before tax for 
the entity acquired following acquisition on an IFRS basis was £0.9m. Included in the £25.3m of goodwill recognised 
above are certain assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. These items 
include the expected value of synergies.

Notes
(a)   There are no borrowings secured on the assets of subsidiary undertakings (2009, £nil). 
(b)   US Private Placement loans, arising from private placements of debt with US insurance companies, comprise 
$6.7m (2009, $10m) repayable between 2011 and 2012 at a fixed rate of interest of 7.44% and $140m (2009, 
$140m) repayable between 2014 and 2016 at an average fixed rate of interest of 5.64%.
(c)   The Group had committed bilateral revolving bank loan facilities of £265m which were underwritten in excess of 
one year. Drawings by Group companies under these facilities were £62.8m (2009, £nil). Although these drawings 
are repayable within one year they are classified as long term as they can be refinanced under the terms of the 
facilities. 
(d)   Ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are amortised over the term of the 
facility, using the eff ective interest rate method. Laird PLC 93

Unrecognised tax losses
Deferred tax assets have not been established on trading losses of £20.4m (2009, £14.4m) where it is unlikely that future 
relief would be available at the balance sheet date. Of these losses, £8.6m (2009, £3.6m) have expiry dates between 
2010 and 2029 and £11.8m (2009, £10.8m) are available indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on 
other deductible temporary diff erences of £23.8m (2009, £22.4m) where their use is restricted indefinitely.  
Temporary diff erences associated with Group investments
Deferred tax of £1.1m (2009, £1.3m) has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries where 
it is likely there will be income tax consequences attached to the payment of dividends. No deferred tax liability has 
been recognised on temporary diff erences of £42.9m (2009, £29.7m) relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary diff erences and it is probable they 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary diff erences at 31 December 2010 represent only the unremitted 
earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, 
principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. 
Factors aff ecting future tax charges
A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement. The 
UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 27% eff ective 1 April 2011 and disclosure of deferred tax has been adjusted to 
reflect the enactment of the revised rate but with no significant impact on these financial statements. The June 2010 
Budget also announced subsequent reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 24% by 1 April 2014. These changes 
had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are not included in these financial statements. The 
company expects the impact of these changes to the financial statements will be negligible.

Warranty claims are in respect of potential liabilities arising from the disposal of businesses.
Other provisions consist primarily of amounts provided in respect of events arising from trade and various other provisions 
that do not fit into distinct categories. The timing of cash outflows for warranty claims and other provisions are by their 
nature uncertain and dependent upon the outcome of related events. The best estimates are shown in the table above.

Derivative financial instruments 
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign exchange exposures. The forward contracts 
have a principal value of £16.0m (2009, £33.7m) and are mainly denominated in US dollar, Euro and Swedish krona. 
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the increase in fair value during 2010 of £1.2m 
(2009, £2.1m increase) has been taken to the income statement.
28 Financial instruments (continued) Laird PLC 97
Interest rate and currency profile
The Group’s policy is to maintain an appropriate balance between variable and fixed interest rate borrowings. Interest 
rate swaps and similar instruments are used to manage interest costs. At 31 December 2010 approximately 59 per cent 
of debt is at fixed rate. This position is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it is still appropriate.
Interest rate risk
The following table shows the sensitivity to a change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the 
Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity. The 
interest rates considered are Sterling and US dollar, being the currencies in which the Group have historically issued 
debt and held investments.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non–derivative fixed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but 
includes those recognised at fair value as well as all non–derivative floating rate financial instruments. Where the 
Group has taken out fixed to variable interest rate swaps, the impact from changes in interest rates is also included for 
the purpose of the sensitivity analysis.

Credit risk
Laird’s customer base is largely focused in the global electronics market where it has leading positions in its principal 
products with customers who themselves have significant market shares. Inevitably this results in levels of business 
and trade receivables that are material in the overall Group context. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is 
equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to transactional currency exposures on sales and purchases denominated in currencies other 
than the functional currency of the subsidiary. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollar, Euro and 
Renminbi. The Group policy is to match out the sales and purchases in these currencies wherever possible and then 
hedge out the residual exposures.

The following table shows the sensitivity to a possible change in US dollar, Euro and Renminbi exchange rates against

Net investment hedging
Included in borrowings are US $231.7m of debt which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in 
the United States subsidiaries. This is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk on these 
investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are transferred to equity to off set any gains or 
losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.

Undrawn committed borrowing facilities
The Group’s financial policy is to maintain committed borrowing facilities, which provide substantial headroom over 
and above its day to day borrowing requirements.

Loan covenants
The principal covenants in the Group’s committed loan facilities and loan note agreements that place restrictions on 
net borrowings are based on frozen UK GAAP 2004 and are set out below:
Interest cover
The interest cover covenant is for earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax and amortisation (“EBITA”) to be not 
less than 2.5 times interest payable.
Net borrowings: EBITDA ratio
Net borrowings must not exceed 3.5 times earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (“EBITDA”).
The Group was in compliance with the covenants detailed above at 31 December 2010.
Fair value of financial instruments
The US Private Placement loans with a book value of £93.4m (2009, £92.6m) have an estimated fair value of 
£98.4m (2009, £94.4m) which has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing coupon rates as at 
31 December 2010.
There are no material diff erences between fair value and book value on any of the other financial instruments.

All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £1.0m was recognised in the year (2009, £1.6m) before 
employer’s national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded 
and the share options granted.

(2009, 282,027) in the price range 398p to 510p are subject to the higher performance targets set out in the table on 
page 58 of the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including the market based 
performance conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of 
calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non–market 
performance conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the 
fair value. 
The weighted average fair value (in pence) of LTIP , RSP and share options granted during the year was as follows:

The expected life of the share based payments is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise 
patterns that may occur. 
The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. 
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not 
necessarily prove to be the actual outcome. Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into 
account in calculating the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre–vesting.
31 Reserves
Merger reserve
On 28 October 2009 the Company announced a 1 for 2 Rights Issue at 100 pence per new share. It was executed using 
a structure which created a merger reserve arising under Section 612–3 of the Companies Act 2006. After receipt of 
the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued 
of £58.0m has been transferred from the merger reserve to retained earnings.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve is used to record exchange diff erences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign subsidiaries. It is also used to record the eff ect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
Treasury shares
The investment in Laird shares as held by the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”), as described on page 60 
of the Directors’ remuneration report, are treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes. At 31 December 2010 the 
Trust held 1,037,070 shares (2009, 119,457 shares) which all relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan. The shares held by 
the Trust had a total market value at that date of £1.8m (2009, £0.2m).

Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes of both the defined benefit and defined contribution types.
12 employees (2009, 12) are members of two diff erent defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 
1,600 (2009, 1,700) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during the 
year were £0.3m (2009, £0.3m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2010, at their market value, is estimated at £98.2m 
(2009, £91.4m) and the liabilities estimated at £95.3m (2009, £92.7m). 
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 which, depending on the rules of individual schemes, allows the Group to recognise 
pensions surpluses on the statement of financial position where there is an unconditional right to a refund or 
benefit available in the form of reduced contributions. The resultant aggregate net pension liability under IAS 19 is 
£0.1m (2009, £2.5m). 
The market value of the schemes’ assets, the present value of the schemes’ liabilities and the net pension assets and 
liability under IAS 19 at 31 December were as follows:

Surplus/(deficit) in the 
schemes 5.5 (5.6) (0.1) 2.3 (4.8) (2.5)
The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.4% per annum (2009, 4.7%) and those for 
equities at 8.1% per annum (2009, 8.2%). The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates 
of return from the main asset classes. For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in 
the markets for these assets has been assumed. For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been 
assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities. Laird PLC 107
The mortality assumption used at the 2010 and 2009 year end is based on 92 series tables with an allowance for 
improvements in line with the medium cohort based on each member’s year of birth, subject to a minimum level of 
future improvement of 1.5%. Executive and director members have an age rating of - 1 years and all other members have 
an age rating of +2 applied to the base table. The expected lifetime of a participant who is age 65 and the expected 
lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 years are shown in years below based on these mortality tables:

Age Males Females Males Females
65 21.2 24.5 24.1 27.4
65 in 15 years 23.3 26.7 26.2 29.5
For IAS 19 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial 
assumptions were inflation of 3.7% per annum (2009, 3.8%), salary increases of 4.7% – 5.7% per annum 
(2009, 4.8% – 5.8%) and a discount rate for liabilities of 5.5% per annum (2009, 5.65%).

is a loss of £15.9m (2009, £18.4m loss) since 1 January 2004. The directors are unable to determine the amount of 
actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income from 
the date of inception of the company schemes to 31 December 2003.
The Group estimates that the total value of contributions to defined benefit schemes will be £0.4m in 2011.

Within Sweden, the Group operates a scheme, included within a multiemployer plan, for its employees which is insured 
with Alecta. This scheme is a defined benefit scheme, but Alecta is currently unable to provide suff icient information 
to report the Group’s proportional share of the defined benefit commitments and the assets under management and 
expenses associated with the scheme. Consequently, Alecta cannot provide the information regarding the Group’s 
proportional share of the surplus or deficit in the scheme. As a result the scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined 
contribution scheme, although it is actually a defined benefit scheme.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation to the accounts
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the report of the independent auditor set out on 
page 116, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of 
the auditor in relation to the accounts.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true 
and fair view of the state of aff airs of the Company as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for the financial year.
The directors consider that in compiling the accounts on pages 117 to 129, which have been prepared on a going 
concern basis, the Company has used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by 
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and that all accounting standards which they consider to be 
applicable have been followed.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Company which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply 
with the Companies Act 2006.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. They are also responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 116 Laird PLC
Independent auditor’s report to the members of Laird PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Laird PLC for the year ended 31 December 2010 which 
comprise the Parent company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 15. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 115, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the parent company financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements 
suff icient to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
parent company financial statements.
Opinion on parent company financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s aff airs as at 31 December 2010;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Laird PLC for the year ended 31 December 2010.

 Financial statements of parent company
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
The accounts of Laird PLC are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The accounts have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments and 
accounting for pensions under FRS 17. This is in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. As consolidated 
financial information for financial instruments and financial risk management has been disclosed under IFRS 7 in the 
Group accounts, the parent is exempt from FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The disclosures in respect of 
the Company are included in the Group accounts. Pensions are disclosed in accordance with FRS 17. The financial 
statements present information about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about the Group.
Profit and loss
As permitted by the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has not presented its own 
profit and loss account. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write off  the cost or valuation of fixed assets evenly over their expected useful lives, 
principally as follows:
Computer equipment 5 years or less
Motor vehicles 4 years
Other plant and machinery 13 years or less
A proportion of one year’s depreciation is charged in the year the asset comes into service or is sold.
Pensions
The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to the operating profit or 
loss in the year. The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service and gains and losses 
arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments are also charged to the operating profit or loss in the year. The 
expected return on the assets of the schemes during the year based on the market value of scheme assets at the 
start of the year and the expected increase in liabilities of the schemes are included within other finance (charges)/
income. Diff erences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of 
recognised gains and losses in the year together with diff erences from changes in assumptions. The deficit on defined 
benefit pension schemes, net of deferred tax, is reported on the balance sheet as the pension liability. The accounts 
include pension schemes where the parent company is the principal employer.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends
Dividends paid are charged to retained earnings on the earlier of the date of payment or the date on which they 
become a legal liability of the Company.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing diff erences that have originated but which have not reversed at the 
balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay 
more, or a right to pay less, or to receive more tax subject to the following:
(a)  Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale 
agreement exists at the balance sheet date. Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is not 
recognised.
(b)  Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries unless dividends have been accrued as 
receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements of parent company
for the year ended 31 December 2010 Laird PLC 119
(c)  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as 
recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future 
reversal of the underlying timing diff erences can be deducted.  
Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of transaction. Foreign currency 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets  
Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Where the 
time value of money is material, debtors are carried at amortised cost. Provision is made when there is objective 
evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off  when the probability of 
recovery is assessed as being remote. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset 
or group of financial assets is impaired. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the loans 
and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. Trade and other 
receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, inclusive of any transaction costs. Measurement after initial 
recognition is at amortised cost, with the changes in the carrying amount being taken through the profit and loss 
account.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are 
recognised respectively in finance income and finance expense.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as currency swap contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge 
its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is 
negative. 
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts 
with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values 
for similar instruments.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
taken to the profit and loss account. 
Share based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, the expense recognised in the Company profit and loss 
account relates to equity settled grants made after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on 1 January 2005.
The fair value of Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) shares awarded is estimated at the date of award, using a Monte 
Carlo simulation technique, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded 
including market based performance conditions. The fair value of share options granted is estimated at the date of 
grant using a binomial lattice method of calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share 
options were granted. Non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.

7 Financial instruments  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 29 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and has 
not disclosed information required by that standard as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the 
Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”.
  Financial statements of parent company (continued) 120 Laird PLC
For grants that ultimately do not vest, charges previously made are reversed except that an expense is recognised for 
awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition and these are treated as vesting irrespective of whether 
or not the market condition is satisfied, provided all the other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market 
conditions, the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market 
condition, be treated as vesting as described above. 
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the profit and loss 
account, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms for an equity settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of 
the share based payment, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
In circumstances where the equity settled grant is cancelled or settled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of 
cancellation or settlement, and any expense not yet recognised for the grant is recognised immediately. 
2 Tangible assets
The fixed assets of the Company were acquired at a cost of £0.9m (2009, £0.8m) and have accumulated depreciation 
of £0.7m (2009, £0.6m) charged against them. There were additions of £0.1m and no disposals during the year and 
depreciation in the year was £0.1m (2009, £0.1m).

10 Pension schemes
The Company operates two defined benefit schemes.
12 employees (2009, 12) are members of these defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,600 
(2009, 1,700) deferred and current pensioners. The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year 
were £0.3m (2009, £0.3m). 
The total assessed value of the schemes’ assets at 31 December 2010 at their market value is estimated at £97.1m 
(2009, £91.4m) and the liabilities estimated at £93.8m (2009, £92.7m). 
The market value of the schemes’ assets, the present value of the schemes’ liabilities and the net pension liability under 
FRS 17 at 31 December were as follows:

Present value of scheme liabilities (93.8) (92.7)
Funded status 3.3 (1.3)
Disallowed assets (8.5) (3.5)
Deficit in the schemes (5.2) (4.8)
The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.4% per annum (2009, 4.7%) and those for 
equities at 8.1% per annum (2009, 8.2%). The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements of parent company (continued) 
for the year ended 31 December 2010
  Financial statements of parent company (continued) Laird PLC 123
Asset return assumptions have been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long term real rates 
of return from the main asset classes. For gilts and corporate bonds, a return in line with the returns available in 
the markets for these assets has been assumed. For equities, a higher rate of return than for bond assets has been 
assumed, to reflect the greater returns anticipated over the long term from a mixture of UK and overseas equities.
The mortality assumption used at the 2010 and 2009 year end is based on 92 series tables with an allowance for 
improvements in line with the medium cohort based on each member’s year of birth, subject to a minimum level of 
future improvement of 1.5%. Executive and director members have an age rating of - 1 years and all other members 
have an age rating of +2 applied to the base table.   
The expected lifetime of a participant who is age 65 and the expected lifetime of a participant who will be age 65 in 15 
years are shown in years below based on these mortality tables:

members
Age Males Females Males Females
65 21.2 24.5 24.1 27.4
65 in 15 years 23.3 26.7 26.2 29.5
For FRS 17 the schemes’ liabilities have been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial 
assumptions were inflation of 3.7% per annum (2009, 3.8%), salary increases of 4.7% – 5.7% per annum 
(2009, 4.8% – 5.8%) and a discount rate for liabilities of 5.5% per annum (2009, 5.65%).

No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
A loss after taxation of £11.1m (2009, £24.1m profit) has been deducted from the profit and loss account brought 
forward of the Company after charging exchange losses of £7.1m (2009, £5.5m gains) and crediting dividends from 
subsidiary undertakings of £0.4m (2009, £1.8m). Other movements in the profit and loss account included within total 
recognised gains and losses were a loss of £0.8m (2009, £0.9m). 
  Financial statements of parent company (continued) 126 Laird PLC
The special reserve of £55.5m was created by a transfer from the share premium account under High Court Sanction 
in December 1989. 
The movements on merger reserve in 2009 were as a result of the 1 for 2 Rights Issue at 100 pence per new share. It 
was executed using a structure which created a merger reserve arising under Section 612-3 of the Companies Act 
2006. After receipt of the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of net proceeds over the nominal value of 
the share capital issued of £58.0m has been transferred from the merger reserve to retained earnings.
The investment in own shares are those held by the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust (“the Trust”), as described on 
page 60 of the Directors’ remuneration report. At 31 December 2010 the Trust held 1,037,070 shares (2009, 119,457 
shares) which all relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan. The shares held by the Trust had a total market value at that 
date of £1.8m (2009 £0.2m).
13 Contingent liabilities
At 31 December 2010 the Company had contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees relating to the performance of 
contracts of subsidiary undertakings. 
There are legal claims against the Company but none where the Board takes the view that it is likely that damages will 
be awarded against the Group which would have a materially adverse eff ect on its financial position. 
14 Share based payments
The Directors’ remuneration report on pages 52 to 62, sets out the general terms and conditions including vesting 
requirements for the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share 
Option Plan. Shares awarded under the Restricted Share Plan (RSP) vest 3 years after they have been awarded to the 
employee at nil cost, provided the employee is still employed by Laird. 
All share based payments are equity settled. An expense of £1.0m was recognised in the year (2009, £1.6m) before 
employer’s national insurance and was based on the fair value of the LTIP shares awarded, the RSP shares awarded 
and the share options granted.
The following table shows the number of awards under the Share Price Improvement Plan (“SPIP”) in issue at the 
beginning and at the end of the year. The executive directors to whom awards were made under the SPIP waived those 
awards in March 2010, and the SPIP was cancelled.

All options in the table above were recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as noted above. No options were exercised in 
2010 or 2009. For the share options outstanding at 31 December 2010, the weighted average remaining contractual life 
is 6.5 years (2009, 6.7 years). 1,596,053 options (2009, 912,886) in the price range 115p to 205p, 372,629 options (2009, 
388,522) in the price range 206p to 280p, 160,811 options (2009, 162,542) in the price range 281p to 397p and 146,518 
(2009, 282,027) in the price range 398p to 510p are subject to the higher performance targets set out in the table on 
page 58 of the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of LTIP shares awarded is estimated as at the date of award, using a Monte Carlo simulation technique, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the LTIP shares were awarded including the market based 
performance conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The fair value of share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial lattice method of 
calculation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which share options were granted. The non-market 
performance conditions set out in the Directors’ remuneration report are not taken into account when estimating the 
fair value.

The expected life of the share based payments is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise 
patterns that may occur. 
The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility; average of monthly activity over the last three years. 
Expected volatility reflects the assumptions that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not 
necessarily prove to be the actual outcome. Dividends are not payable on shares prior to vesting and this is taken into 
account in calculating the fair value. 
For the share option schemes, no allowance is considered necessary for leavers pre-vesting.
15 Auditor’s remuneration
The Company paid £28,000 (2009, £27,000) to its auditor in respect of the audit of the financial statements of the

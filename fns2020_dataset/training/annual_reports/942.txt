A helping hand 
ANGLE has developed world-leading technologies to care for the
unborn baby. ANGLE’s ante-natal healthcare companies offer the
potential for non-invasive health care for the unborn baby for the first
time and increased success for IVF pregnancies. High Potential
Parsortix
Testing the unborn baby’s health
can only be done at present by
invasive procedures to capture
foetal cells for analysis, such as
amniocentesis or chorionic villus
sampling. These procedures present
health risks for both the baby and
the mother and consequently are
only applied where there is an
identified high risk to the baby’s
health.
ANGLE’s US based company,
Parsortix has developed a
breakthrough new procedure to
capture foetal cells from a simple
blood test for the mother. 
The technology is unique and
patent protected worldwide. 
Trials have been completed under
independent review to demonstrate
the successful capture of foetal cells
and discussions are in place with
major diagnostic companies to
launch the procedure as a routine
test for all unborn babies, not just
those in a high risk category.
Early definitive diagnosis for
chromosomal abnormalities
associated with Down’s, Turner, 
and Klinefelter syndromes, as well 
as other disorders due to genetic
abnormalities such as spina bifida,
can help physicians better care for
both the mother and the foetus
during pregnancy. The addressable
market is expected to exceed $1.2
billion per annum in the US alone.
Novocellus 
Novocellus is commercialising a
unique technology for IVF (in vitro
fertilisation) to assess the viability of
a fertilised egg before transfer to the
mother. The process is non-invasive
and works by measuring the amino
acid profile of the culture medium.
For the first time, it will allow the
clinician to select the most viable
egg for transfer and is expected to
increase pregnancy success rates
by at least 30%. 
The intellectual property is
protected and owned by
Novocellus worldwide and a 
final stage of clinical trials is under
development. With projected
increases in IVF and the move 
to single embryo transfer, it is
estimated that Novocellus’ directly
addressable market will exceed 
$1 billion per annum by 2015.
Novocellus is seeking a
collaborative corporate deal.

patent protected technology
platform, with the potential to
revolutionise the growing computer
games market. Its first commercial
product, Enlighten, delivers
dramatically improved lighting effect
capabilities for computer games. 
Rapid computation of light reflection
and refraction in computer animation
is a key factor in the creation of
greater realism in computer games. 
The computer gaming market is
forecast to grow at an average 
11.4% compound annual rate to
$46.5bn by 2010, with strong demand
anticipated from Asia Pacific and
EMEA regions. 
Enlighten was launched at the
Games Developer Conference in
February 2008 and is now being
evaluated by many of the leading
games developers in the world.
Geomerics is a partner in both
Microsoft’s X-Box 360 Tools
programme and Sony’s Play Station 3
tools and middleware programme
and is developing relationships with
many major technology companies
worldwide, who want access to
Geomerics’ unique technology
capability.

digital doubles and other real world
materials. Chairman’s Statement
Page 08 ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
I am pleased to report a number of significant achievements and
improved results for the year ended 30 April 2008.
Results
The Group profit before controlled investments and tax was £3.4 million
(2007: loss £6.1 million). Profit before tax was £1.1 million (2007: loss £9.3
million). After careful management and an expensed investment of £2.3
million (2007: £3.1 million) into the existing portfolio, cash at £1.0 million
(2007: £2.6 million) remains materially unchanged from that at the
interims. The fair value of the portfolio doubled to £7.3 million (2007: £3.7
million) and this does not include the fair value of the controlled
investments in the portfolio.
Management services
This business has improved its focus, cost efficiency and profitability. As
well as winning a number of significant new business opportunities, the
division has leveraged its existing strong client relationships to secure
extensions to existing contracts.
The UK has performed particularly strongly but the Company also has a
number of new quotation opportunities in the Middle East to replace the
existing Qatar contract as it approaches successful completion in March
2009. The long term nature of ANGLE’s management contracts provides
the Company with a high level of visibility of future cash generation and
therefore enables costs to be matched against known contract
requirements. The portfolio is maturing well with a substantially enhanced
valuation reported in the year and there is now a reduced
demand on ANGLE’s cash. The Management services business
has, at the same time, become more efficient and more resilient.
Investment Portfolio
Our investment strategy continues to be focused on the existing portfolio.
The core aim is to maximise the development of each business, but also
move towards a position where each operation becomes both less
dependent on financing from ANGLE and more attractive to new third
party investors or acquirers, both from financial and industry sources. 
ANGLE has seen good progress to date in its portfolio companies. Aguru
has won and successfully delivered its first contract to a major film studio;
Geomerics is building a significant prospect list for its computer game
graphics; Parsortix has proved its ability to separate foetal material using
a blood sample from the pregnant mother and has had the results
independently assessed by a leading independent expert in the field.
Each of these operations has proven proprietary technology addressing
large growth markets.
ANGLE’s business model of holding substantial equity stakes and playing
an active role in the management of its investments enables the
Company to help drive value creation and maximise the prospect of
ANGLE receiving a substantial return on its investment at exit.
Bid approach
In April, ANGLE announced that it had received an approach, which
may or may not lead to a formal offer for the Company. The proposed
consideration is in the prospective bidder’s shares. 
The Board is considering the proposal with particular regard to whether
the offer would be likely to result in enhanced value for ANGLE
shareholders taking into account a range of factors. These include the
strategic fit of the two businesses, the impact of a merger upon the
generation of significant realisations from ANGLE’s investment portfolio
and the quality of the prospective bidder’s paper.
Outlook
The portfolio is maturing well with a substantially enhanced valuation
reported in the year and there is now a reduced demand on ANGLE’s
cash. The Management services business has, at the same time, become
more efficient and more resilient. Cash will continue to need careful
management but the Board believes that the opportunity remains for the
portfolio to produce significant shareholder returns from the currently
available resources. 
The substantial efforts involved to achieve these goals reflect the hard
work of ANGLE’s staff and the Board thanks them sincerely for their
continuing efforts.

ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Page 09 Chief Executive’s
Statement
Page 10 ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The year ended 30 April 2008 has been a year of successful restructuring
for ANGLE and we have established a strong platform for the future.
Costs have been reduced, revenues increased and a tight focus
maintained on the existing portfolio. Taking these actions has placed the
Company in a better position to weather the increasingly tight financial
markets and to successfully achieve our aim of delivering shareholder
value from our combined revenue and capital based business model. 
Both the Management services business and the Investment Portfolio
have moved into profit during the year with the result that the Group
generated a profit before controlled investments and tax of £3.4 million.
This compares to a £6.1 million loss in the year ended 30 April 2007.
During the year, controlled investments into majority owned portfolio
companies amounted to £2.3 million (2007: £3.1 million). After these
investments, which are expensed, profit before tax was £1.1 million,
compared to a loss of £9.3 million in the previous financial year.
Reflecting the maturing portfolio, the level of ongoing expenditure on
controlled investments is now substantially reduced.
Cash generated by the business in the second half of the year met all
the operating costs and investment in the portfolio during that period. 
As a result the cash balance at 30 April 2008 of £1.0 million was materially
unchanged from the cash balance at 31 October 2007 of £1.1 million. ANGLE’s Management services business is a key feature of the
Company’s business model. Its value to ANGLE goes beyond 
its financial contribution to the business.
Management services
ANGLE’s Management services business is a key feature of the
Company’s business model. Its value to ANGLE goes beyond its financial
contribution to the business. The division also provides the Company with
a high quality pool of in-house expertise and talent as well as access to
leading academic, research and science organisations internationally,
raising the profile of the whole Group and providing access to high
quality IP commercialisation opportunities.
The three key aims for this division during the year were to:
� generate a profit and strong cashflow; 
� focus on larger, longer term contracts with a high degree of financial 
visibility; and 
� increase the overall number of contracts.
I am very pleased to report that in the last twelve months the
Management services business has achieved all three of these aims.
Financial performance was strong with turnover rising 14% to £3.8 million
(2007: £3.4 million). As importantly, the quality of earnings from this
business materially improved leading to profit for the year from the
Management services division of £1.1 million (2007: loss £0.4 million).
During the year ANGLE continued to win new management services
contracts. These included significant wins with Innovation Lincolnshire, 
a contract worth £0.9 million over 21 months and with the London
Development Agency’s (LDA) Knowledge Connect Programme now,
subject to contract, increased in value from £3.7 million to £5.4 million
over three years. 
In addition to new UK contracts, the pipeline of potential opportunities
includes further major contracts in the Middle East. As at 30 April 2008,
ANGLE’s sold order book for the next three years (including the expected
LDA extension) was £8.2 million (2007: £5.1 million) and the management
remains extremely active in implementing initiatives to extend this order
book further. 
The improvement in ANGLE’s profile in the market and the increasing
recognition of the added value that the Management services business
delivers is demonstrated in the order book itself. In the last four years the
scale of individual contracts has grown five-fold, with the average value
size per contract now being in excess of £450,000 per annum. Accessing
larger and more significant contracts not only improves profitability but
also enables management time to be used more effectively. 
ANGLE’s reputation in the industry as a high quality provider of
management services is growing. Even discounting the important
benefits that are generated for the venture portfolio, the Board believes
that as a stand alone business the Management services division is an
important and valuable business in its own right. Further, in more
challenging economic conditions, this division provides ANGLE with a
core strength and robustness not seen elsewhere in the IP
commercialisation space. 
Investment Portfolio
In the last twelve months ANGLE has continued to manage its portfolio of
investment companies effectively. The benefits of this focused approach
are also being seen in both the operational and financial performance
of this division. 
A coherent strategy has been deployed across the portfolio with the
intention of maximising ANGLE’s investment return, whilst controlling the
investment risk and cash requirements of the individual companies.
Where additional capital has been required to continue the
development of high quality IP commercialisation opportunities, this has
been made available. We have also continued to work closely with each
of the underlying investment portfolio companies providing expertise
and management support as required. 
A key feature of ANGLE’s portfolio, and indeed a key differentiator for the
business model, is that ANGLE looks to maintain significant stakes in each
portfolio company. This ensures that ANGLE retains a high level of
influence on the development of each opportunity. This is becoming
increasingly important as our portfolio of companies reaches maturity
and exit strategies are being developed. Many of our companies have
developed well beyond the start up phase, with our average portfolio
company now having been in existence for over four years.
As with the Management services division, ANGLE’s strategy for its
investment portfolio is being reflected in strong financial performance.
During the year, a fair value gain in the portfolio was achieved of £3.9
million (2007: loss £2.0 million) and the fair value of the portfolio on the
Balance Sheet doubled to £7.3 million (30 April 2007 £3.7 million). 
It is important to highlight that this Balance Sheet figure does not include
the fair value of the Company’s controlled investments, which to date
have received direct investment of £3.7 million from ANGLE.
During the year, cash of £0.5 million was realised from mature investments
(2007: £1.1 million).

investment objectives and moved to profitability.

Portfolio progress highlights 
ANGLE’s investment portfolio now contains ten companies. Whilst
progress continues to be made across the portfolio, the most significant
developments during the year have occurred in three of our “High
Potential Return” investments. 
1 Aguru Images
Rapid capture & recreation of photo-realistic images – 75% holding
The company has completed both its product development and also
the successful first commercial sale to a major film maker in Los Angeles.
The contract utilised Aguru’s proprietary devices to measure faces,
materials and objects for visual effects shots on a major feature film. 
Aguru’s advanced capture technologies reduce the time, cost and
complexity of pre-production, production and post-production rendering
for simulations and interactive computer graphics. Aguru has exclusive
rights to highly innovative technologies developed at the University of
Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies and New York
University’s Courant Institute as well as other rights. The company’s target
markets include visual effects in motion pictures, computer and video
games, animation, and design – for improved renderings by interior,
fashion, architectural and industrial designers.
Aguru is building the world’s largest online library of stock shapes and
textures, comparable to photographic image libraries. Aguru is also
generating revenue and brand awareness by offering products and
services that enable the capture, editing and application of real-world
textured surfaces for use in 3D computer-generated imagery.
Aguru’s first target market is the visual effects industry of over 500 films
produced each year, where Aguru’s facial image capture provides a
photo-realistic result currently unattainable by other methods. Thereafter
Aguru intends to expand into the computer games market and then sell
products to over 50,000 architecture, interior design, fashion, industrial,
online catalogue and advertising companies.
The company is supported by a world class Advisory Board comprising
executives from Industrial Light & Magic, Digital Domain, Pixar,
DreamWorks, RFX, Adobe, Autodesk, Electronic Arts, University of Southern
California and New York University. 2 Geomerics
Enhanced computer game graphics – 47% holding
In the last twelve months, this company has seen the successful
development and launch of its “Enlighten” product, which dramatically
improves the lighting effect capabilities for computer games. In addition,
£2.0 million of investment was raised from new investors during the period
under review. A number of major customers are evaluating the product
and significant sales are expected in the current year. 
ANGLE founded Geomerics in 2005 to commercialise technology
developed by the University of Cambridge’s Astrophysics Department.
With the assistance of ANGLE’s proven management capabilities,
Geomerics has developed a unique patent protected technology
platform for the computer games industry. Its first commercial product,
“Enlighten”, delivers dramatically improved lighting effect capabilities 
for computer game programmers. 
Rapid computation of light reflection and refraction in computer
animation is a key factor in the creation of greater realism in computer
games.  The computer gaming market is forecast to grow at an average
11.4% compound annual rate to $46.5 billion by 2010, with strong
demand anticipated from Asia Pacific and EMEA regions. Geomerics is
well positioned to benefit from the growth in this market. 
3 Parsortix
Prenatal diagnostics – 68% holding
Parsortix has achieved a world technology break-through by isolating
foetal cells in maternal blood and this has been independently verified
by a leading independent expert in the field. For the first time this allows
completely non-invasive testing of the unborn baby. 
Pregnant women have a very small number of their baby’s cells
circulating in their blood, thought to be at most one foetal cell in every
500 million maternal cells. Parsortix has developed a patent protected
micro fluidic device which, when 1.5 ml of the mother’s blood is flowed
through the device, can for the first time capture these foetal cells for
analysis. 
Early definitive diagnosis for chromosomal abnormalities associated with
Down’s, Turner, and Klinefelter syndromes, as well as other disorders due
to genetic abnormalities such as spina bifida, can help physicians better
care for both the mother and the foetus during pregnancy. It also gives
families earlier information with respect to the health of the unborn child
and is increasingly important as the mother’s average age increases.
At present, diagnosis is only possible through invasive procedures such as
amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). These carry a risk to
both the baby and the mother and as a result are limited only to high risk
pregnancies. Parsortix’s new device allows completely non-invasive
testing of the unborn baby removing the risk and allowing diagnosis to
be extended as a matter of course to all babies not just those known to
be at high risk. The physical separation process used is simple and cost-
effective. It requires no pre-treatment of the sample and no reagents.
Commercially, Parsortix’s unique patented separation technique will
reduce overall medical costs. In the high risk category, there are currently
375,000 tests per annum in the US market alone. With a non-invasive test,
the market is likely to expand to cover lower risk patients with a
theoretical maximum in the US market alone of 2.6 million tests per
annum. Parsortix has the potential to secure a dominant position in this
separation market. The current cost of the amniocentesis procedure in
the US is around $1,200. The Parsortix technique is expected to reduce
this cost by at least 60%. 
A number of multinationals have already expressed interest in Parsortix
and ANGLE is now focused on completing development of the product
and securing regulatory approval. 
Outlook
ANGLE has reduced its operating costs, met its investment objectives 
and moved to profitability.
ANGLE is now structured so that cash generated by the Management
services business, which is already secured through existing long term
management contracts, is expected to more than cover all the
operating costs of the business over the next 12 months. Investment will
continue at a reduced level during the first half. Cash balances are
expected to decline in the first half but to recover in the second half.
ANGLE has built a strong position in the field of IP commercialisation, not
only in the UK, but also Internationally. The Board looks forward to
continuing to leverage the significant opportunities that are present
throughout the business to generate substantial cash returns for
shareholders.

ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Page 13 Financial Review
A year of progress
Page 14 ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
The investment portfolio continues to develop and mature with progress
being made to create future growth in capital value for shareholders. 
The Management services business has continued to develop strongly
and we are now seeing this business deliver profits in line with our
expectations. There is a strong sold order book that provides a platform
to develop this activity further, cover other operating costs and to help
realise value from our investments.
The financial results for the year reflect value being created in the
maturing portfolio and the planned reduction in Ventures operating 
costs while we focus on the existing portfolio rather than investing in new
companies. ANGLE’s control through significant equity stakes means
controlled investments’ losses are consolidated into our results, however,
on becoming non-controlled (typically through the issue of new equity 
on fund raising resulting in a deemed disposal) their fair value is
recognised on the Balance Sheet. These are medium term investments
that can take several years to mature, however, measurable progress is
now being seen from the portfolio. In particular, Geomerics announced 
a £2.0 million funding, launched its “Enlighten” product and is expecting
sales soon, Aguru has completed product development and secured
initial sales, and Parsortix has announced a world technology 
break-through.  Turnover (Note 2)
Turnover for the year increased by 15% to £3.9 million (2007: £3.4 million).
Management services revenues account for the majority of this and
have grown by 14% year-on-year; the long term nature of the contracts
provides the Group with a high degree of visibility of revenues, profits and
cash. The Management services order book, including the London
Development Agency Knowledge Connect contract extension,
amounted to £8.2 million (2007: £5.1 million) with revenues relating to the
current year forecast in excess of £4.5 million. The Qatar Science and
Technology Park contract completes in March 2009; the Group is actively
developing new business opportunities to replace this and has a number
of good pipeline opportunities already identified. The Group continues to
supply services to the portfolio companies but to the extent that these
are controlled investments, applicable revenues are removed from
turnover on consolidation.
Change in fair value (Note 11)
The overall fair value gain for the year was £3.9 million (2007: loss £2.0
million), with the fair value gain from Geomerics being the most
significant part of the overall profit.
Operating costs (Note 3)
Staff costs are the Group’s most significant individual cost item, however,
reflecting the restructuring of the business and a change in status of
some controlled investments, costs were reduced by 28% to £3.9 million
(2007: £5.5 million), excluding share based payments.
Other operating costs have also reduced by 40%. The Group remains
committed to maintaining as low and flexible a cost base as possible.
Results for controlled investments are consolidated into the Group
accounts and, in contrast to the treatment of non-controlled investments,
no value is shown on the Balance Sheet. This is described further in the
“Investment portfolio” section. 
A restructuring credit of £0.1 million occurred in the year from the release
of an unutilised provision as a result of improved business performance
requiring a lower level of restructuring charge. The 2007 restructuring
charge of £0.5 million related to the reduction of operating costs and
staffing to focus on the development of the existing portfolio and on the
profitable Management services business.
Retained profit for the year
The Group has generated a profit before controlled investments and tax
of £3.4 million (2007: loss £6.1 million) in line with market expectations. 
The Group has produced a profit after tax of £1.2 million (2007: loss £9.1
million) resulting in a basic and fully diluted profit per share of 4.52p (2007:
loss 34.02p).
ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Page 15
Investment portfolio (Note 11)
The year to 30 April 2008 was one of significant investment and progress
in the investment portfolio. ANGLE’s investment portfolio at 30 April 2008
comprised shares in one listed company (2007: one) and eight unlisted
companies (2007: seven) together with one earn-out (2007: one).
Controlled investments are consolidated into the results of the Group
and none of their value is reflected in the Balance Sheet. As planned,
there has been significant expenditure of £2.3 million (2007: £3.1 million)
to develop the controlled investments to the point where they can meet
value enhancing milestones and are in a position to move to the next
stage of development, typically with third party funding. Such funding
generally means the investment becomes non-controlled, which
generates a fair value gain and it is no longer consolidated into the
Group’s results.
The fair value of the portfolio, comprising non-controlled investments and
an earn-out, has doubled to £7.3 million (2007: £3.7 million). Non-
controlled investments are held on the Balance Sheet at fair value of £5.4
million (2007: £1.8 million). Acolyte Biomedica was sold to 3M Corporation
in the prior year; there is a potential £4.7 million earn-out in respect of
which a fair value of £1.9 million is held on ANGLE’s Balance Sheet under
“Other receivables” (2007: £1.9 million).
The Provexis plc share price recovered in the first half of the year and
ANGLE took the opportunity to realise some £0.5 million in cash, doubling
the return in less than a year from the support it provided in Provexis’ last
funding round. However, the share price had declined by the year end
resulting in a fair value loss of £0.2 million on our remaining stake.
Cash
The Group ended the year with a cash balance of £1.0 million (2007: £2.6
million), which was materially unchanged from the half year (£1.1 million),
reflecting the fact that ANGLE was cash generative at the operating
level, before expenditure on investments. The long term nature of
ANGLE’s management contracts provides the Group with a high level of
visibility of future cash generation. Cash balances are expected to
decline in the first half as ANGLE continues to invest in its portfolio and
then to recover in the second half.
There were cash realisations in the year of £0.5 million (2007: £1.1 million)
which were reinvested into the portfolio. The maturing portfolio is
becoming more independent from ANGLE and has secured third party
funding and / or is generating sales resulting in a reduced demand on
ANGLE’s cash; the level of ongoing expenditure on controlled
investments is now substantially reduced. The tightening credit market
may produce pressures on valuation for future funding and portfolio
companies are focusing on sales generation, where appropriate, 
to ensure they remain in as strong a position as possible.
The Group is carefully executing its business plan so that business
activities are in line with the available cash resources and cash will
continue to be carefully managed.

Supplier payment policy
It is Group policy to communicate clearly and agree the terms of payment at the start of business with suppliers and to pay in accordance with the
agreed terms of the contract and other legal obligations. Where no contract terms are specified, then assuming suppliers have met their obligations,
the policy is to pay within 30 days of receipt of a correct invoice. The Group supports and endeavours to follow the Better Payment Practice Group
guidelines. The Group had 44 days’ purchases outstanding for payment at 30 April 2008 (2007: 25 days), based on the average daily amount invoiced

Charitable and political donations
The Group made no charitable donations during the year (2007: £nil). The Group made no political donations during the year (2007: £nil).
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the Group and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the Company. Company law
requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
�
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
�
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
�
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial
Statements; and
�
prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and other information in the Annual Report in
accordance with company law in the UK.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Information published on the website is accessible over the
internet in many countries. The Group’s website is based on meeting the legal requirements for the UK and not to meet the different legal
requirements relating to the preparation and dissemination of financial information in other countries. 
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the projections for the forthcoming 12 month period from the date of signing of these Financial Statements and based
on the level of existing cash, projected income and expenditure, the Directors are satisfied that the Company and Group have adequate resources
to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the going concern basis has been used in preparing the Financial Statements.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 385 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing that Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP be reappointed as auditors of the
Company will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at 2:00 pm on 11 September 2008 at ANGLE’s offices, 20 Nugent Road, The Surrey Research
Park, Guildford, GU2 7AF . The notice of meeting is enclosed with this report.

Compliance with the Combined Code
The Company’s shares were admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange on 17 March 2004. 
AIM listed companies are not required to comply with the disclosures of the Combined Code (2006) of Corporate Governance. However, the Board
supports the principles contained in the Combined Code and is committed to maintaining high standards of Corporate Governance. In respect 
of the year ended 30 April 2008 the Board has sought to comply with the provisions of the Combined Code in so far as it considers them to be
appropriate to a company of this size, nature and structure, and has explained any areas of non-compliance with those provisions. 
Below is a brief description of the Board, its role and its committees followed by details of the Group’s systems of internal control.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the proper management of the Group. Its aim is to provide leadership and control in order to
ensure the growth and development of a successful business, while representing the interests of the Company’s shareholders.
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, one Non-executive and two Executive Directors and is responsible to shareholders for the governance
of ANGLE plc and for the effective operation and management of the Group. Different Directors hold the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive and
there is a clear division of responsibilities between them. The Chairman is responsible for overseeing the running of the Board, ensuring that no
individual or group dominates the Board’s decision making and ensuring that the Non-executive Directors are properly briefed on matters. The Chief
Executive has responsibility for implementing the strategy of the Board and managing the day-to-day business activities of the Group through his
management of the Executive Directors and senior managers. Individual directors possess a wide variety of skills and experience and biographical
details of the directors are set out on page 17.
The Non-executive Director is considered by the Board to be independent of management and free of any relationship which could materially
interfere with the exercise of his independent judgement. The Board considers that the Non-executive Director is of sufficient calibre to bring the
strength of independence to the Board. The Board has not nominated a Senior Independent Director, as recommended in the Combined Code, as
there is currently only one Non-executive director and in any case it believes issues can be raised through the normal channels of the Chairman,
Chief Executive and Finance Director and where necessary the Non-executive director can be approached directly.
Management supply the Board with appropriate and timely information. All Directors are able to take training and/or independent professional
advice in the furtherance of their duties if necessary. All Directors also have access, at the Company’s expense, to experienced legal advice through
the Company’s legal advisors and other independent professional advisors as required.
The Board has at least eight meetings per year with additional special meetings as required. As well as regularly reviewing trading performance and
significant risks, the Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision, including the review and approval of:
�
Group policy and long term plans and strategy for the profitable development of the business;
�
interim and annual Financial Statements;
�
major investments and divestments;
�
other significant financing matters such as acquisitions and capital item purchases;
�
annual budgets and amendments; and
�
senior executive remuneration and appointments.
In addition certain other responsibilities have been delegated to the Committees of the Board, each of which has clearly defined terms of reference
(available from the Company Secretary).
Board effectiveness and evaluation
The Company supports the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling the Company. The Board therefore undertakes a periodic
evaluation of its performance, its Directors and its Committees, the most recent of which was undertaken in 2007. The review, led by the Chairman,
involves each Board member providing:
�
an evaluation of performance of the Board as a whole against a series of criteria, the summary of which is used as the basis for a collective
discussion;
�
an evaluation of the effectiveness of individual members of the Board, the summary of which is used as the basis for individual discussion between
the Chairman and the Director concerned; and
�
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Chairman, the summary of which is used as the basis for individual discussion between the head of the
Audit Committee and the Chairman.
The results of the evaluations have led to a number of specific actions to improve certain areas.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
The two Executive Directors Andrew Newland and Ian Griffiths have service contracts with the Company dated 9 March 2004 and effective from 
17 March 2004. The contracts are not set for a specific term, but include a rolling 12-month notice period by the Company or the individual.
The Chairman Garth Selvey has a letter of appointment dated and effective from 7 September 2006. The Non-executive Director David Quysner has
a letter of appointment dated 9 March 2004 and effective from 17 March 2004. These letters are issued in place of service contracts. These
appointments are not set for a specific term and are terminable at will without notice by either party. Election
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, newly appointed Directors are required to resign and seek re-election at the first Annual General
Meeting following their appointment, and all Directors are required to seek re-election at intervals of no more than three years. All Directors were re-
elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 20 September 2007. Accordingly no Directors are seeking re-election this year.
Committees of the Board
The Board maintains Nominations, Audit and Remuneration Committees. All committees operate with written terms of reference. Their minutes are
circulated for review and consideration by the full Board of Directors, supplemented by oral reports on matters of particular significance from the
Committee Chairmen at Board Meetings.
The revised Combined Code recommends there are two Non-executive Directors on the Audit and Remuneration committees. In September 2007
Garth Selvey was appointed as Chairman and has remained on the Audit and Remuneration Committees as the Board believed it was inappropriate
to only have one Member on the Audit and Remuneration Committees. Although this is non-compliant with the Combined Code, as the Chairman is
not considered independent under the provisions of the Code, the Board believed it offered an appropriate solution in both avoiding only having one
Member of the Committees and in reflecting the requirements of the Company.
The following committees assist the full Board in the exercise of its responsibilities by dealing with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs:
Audit Committee
The members of the Committee are the Non-executive Director David Quysner (Chairman of the Audit Committee) and Chairman Garth Selvey, and
it meets at least three times a year to review the interim and annual accounts before they are submitted to the Board. The external auditors, Finance
Director and Chief Executive may attend by invitation. Provision is made to meet with the auditor’s at least once a year without any Executive
Director present.
The Committee has adopted formal terms of reference and considers financial reporting, corporate governance and internal controls. Its review of
financial reporting includes discussion of major accounting issues, policies and compliance with generally accepted accounting standards, review of
key management judgements and estimates, review of our risk assessment and risk management activities and going concern assumptions. It also
reviews the scope and results of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the auditors and makes recommendations to the Board
on issues surrounding their remuneration, appointment, resignation or removal. The Audit Committee is also responsible for monitoring the provision of
non-audit services provided by the Group’s auditors and assesses the likely impact on the auditor’s independence and objectivity before awarding
them any material contract for additional services.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Committee are the Chairman Garth Selvey (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee) and the Non-executive Director 
David Quysner, and it meets at least twice a year. None of them has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided (other than as
shareholders), potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships nor any day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Chief
Executive and Finance Director may attend by invitation but are not present when matters affecting their own remuneration arrangements are
considered.
The Committee has adopted formal terms of reference and the Committee reviews and sets the remuneration and terms and conditions of
employment of the Executive Directors and senior management. It also agrees a policy for the salaries of all staff and has been responsible for the
development of the Company’s remuneration scheme. The decisions of the Committee are formally ratified by the Board. 
Details of Directors’ remuneration and service contracts together with Directors’ interests are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 23 to 24.
Nominations Committee
The members of the Committee are the Chairman Garth Selvey (Chairman of the Nominations Committee) and the Non-executive Director David
Quysner, and it meets at least twice a year. The Chief Executive and Finance Director may attend by invitation. 
The Committee has adopted formal terms of reference and is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and for
recommending to the Board suitable candidates for both executive and non-executive Board appointments.

Internal controls
Internal control systems are designed to meet the particular needs of the Group and the risks to which it is exposed, and by their nature can only
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The system of internal control is designed to manage the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives, rather than to eliminate it. 
An internal audit function is not considered necessary or practical due to the size of the Group and the close day to day control exercised by the
Executive Directors and senior management. The Board will continue to monitor the requirement to have an internal audit function.
The key procedures that the Directors have established with a view to providing an effective system of internal control are as follows:
Management structure
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and focuses on the overall Group strategy and the interests of shareholders. There is a schedule of
matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board. The Board has an organisational structure with clearly-defined responsibilities and lines of
accountability and each Executive Director has been given responsibility for specific aspects of the Group’s affairs.
Quality and integrity of personnel
The integrity and competence of personnel are ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training courses. High quality personnel
are seen as an essential part of the control environment.
Identification of business risks
The Board is responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Group and for determining the appropriate course of action to manage
those risks. The Audit Committee also considers and determines relevant action in respect of any control issues raised by the auditors.
Budgets and reporting
Each year the Board approves the annual budget which includes an assessment of key risk areas. Performance is monitored and relevant action
taken throughout the year through regular reporting to the Board of variances from the budget and preparation of updated forecasts for the year
together with information on the key risk areas. Underpinning these budgets is a system of internal financial control, based on authorisation
procedures and tiers of authority.
Investment and divestment appraisal
All material investment and divestment decisions require appraisal, review and Board approval.
During the year the Board reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal controls and has a process for the continuous identification,
evaluation and management of the significant risks the Group faces. Assessment considers the external environment, the industry in which the Group
operates, the internal environment and non-financial risks such as operational and legal risks. The risks identified are ranked based on significance
and likelihood of occurrence. The Board reviews the controls in place to mitigate those risks and improvements are made where required. A number
of improvements have been made in the year and others have been identified and are being progressed. Day-to-day responsibility for effective
internal control and risk monitoring rests with senior management.
Shareholder relations
The Company seeks to maintain and enhance good relations with its shareholders and analysts. The Company’s and Group’s Interim and Annual
Reports are supplemented by regular published updates to investors on commercial progress. All investors have access to up-to-date information 
on the Group via its website, www.ANGLEplc.com, which also provides contact details for investor relations queries, details on the Company’s share
price, share price graphs and share trading activity. The Company also distributes Group announcements electronically. Shareholders and other
interested parties wishing to receive announcements via email are invited to sign up to the “Email alerts” facility on the Company’s website.
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its shareholders, especially considering the specialist
and medium term nature of the business. Institutional shareholders, private client brokers and analysts are in contact with the Directors through a
regular programme of briefing presentations and meetings to discuss issues and give feedback, primarily following the announcement of the interim
and preliminary results, but throughout the year as required. The Board also receives formal feedback through the Company’s stockbroker and
financial PR firms.
All shareholders are invited to make use of the Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) to raise any questions regarding the strategy,
management and operations of the Group. The Chairmen of the Nominations, Audit and Remuneration Committees are available to answer any
questions from shareholders at the AGM. Remuneration Report
ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Page 23
The Company is not required by either the AIM Listing Rules or the Companies Act to produce a remuneration report, but has done so because of its
commitment to maintaining high standards of Corporate Governance. The Company’s remuneration policy is the responsibility of the Remuneration
Committee.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and incentivise the Directors and staff in a manner consistent with the goals of good
corporate governance. In setting the Company’s remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including the
basic salary, incentives and benefits available to Executive Directors, senior managers and staff of comparable companies. Consistent with this policy
the Company’s remuneration packages awarded to Executive Directors and senior management are intended to be competitive, comprise a
significant proportion of performance related remuneration and align employees with shareholders’ interests. 
Basic salary and benefits
Salary levels are reviewed annually. The Committee believes that basic pay should be competitive in the relevant employment market and reflect
individual responsibilities and performance. Medical health insurance and life cover benefits are also provided to employees and in addition US
employees have dental insurance and a defined contribution pension scheme. 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
The aim of the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan is to incentivise employees to achieve stretching annual performance targets and to align short term
performance with long term shareholder interests by encouraging employees to defer bonuses into ANGLE plc shares.
Bonus targets under the plan are linked to Group and/or Business Unit profitability, operational performance and individual performance. The
Remuneration Committee establishes the targets which must be achieved by Directors in order to receive a payment and these are reviewed
annually. 
Directors and other senior management are required to compulsorily defer 50% of any earned bonus into ANGLE plc shares for a further three years
subject to continued employment over the period. Additionally individuals have the opportunity to voluntarily defer any of their remaining bonuses
into shares, and receive one free matching share for each voluntarily deferred share at the end of the three year period. 
All employees in the Group (excluding controlled investments) are eligible to participate to some extent in the plan though the bonus potential and
performance targets reflect the seniority and responsibility of the individual. 
Venture Incentive Plan 
Executive Directors, regional chief executives and venture team staff are eligible to participate in the Venture Incentive Plan. The aim of the plan is to
provide a long term incentive linked to the realised cash gains from the Ventures business and is therefore closely aligned with the interests of
shareholders.
The level of cash bonus received by participants is a function of the cash profits realised from the Ventures business and the number of participation
points an individual has earned. The cash profits are determined after recovering all ventures costs and achieving a hurdle rate.
Share options
The Company does not normally intend to grant share options to employees participating in the Deferred Annual Bonus and Venture Incentive Plan.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to grant share options in special circumstances. 
None of the awards under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, Venture Incentive Plan or Share Option arrangements are pensionable.
Non-executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services and the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings. The
remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole within the overall limits stipulated in the Articles of Association.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s incentive schemes.

Continued Independent Auditor’s Report
To the shareholders of ANGLE plc
ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Page 25
We have audited the Group and parent company Financial Statements on pages 26 to 52.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and for preparing the parent company Financial
Statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Financial Statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the Financial Statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Financial Statements. The other
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement, Financial Review, Investment Portfolio and
Management services review, Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Report and Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial
Statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
�
the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
affairs as at 30 April 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
�
the parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2008;
�
the Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
�
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial Statements.

1.1 Basis of preparation
The Annual Report and Accounts have been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) in issue that have been endorsed by the EU for the year ended 30 April 2008. They have also been prepared in accordance
with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 that apply to companies reporting under IFRS.
Standards and Interpretations not applied
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards and Interpretations (International Financial Reporting
Interpretation Committee – IFRIC), which have not been applied in these Financial Statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
�
IFRS 8 Operating segments
�
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements
�
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
�
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction
�
IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate
�
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a foreign operation
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the Financial
Statements of the Group when the relevant Standards and Interpretations come into effect.
IFRS has only been applied to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has elected to keep and prepare its parent company Financial
Statements in accordance with UK GAAP .  The Financial Statements and accounting policies of the Company are presented on pages 50 to 52.
1.2 Accounting convention
These Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets at fair
value, as required by IAS 39. The basis of consolidation is set out below. 
1.3 Presentation of Financial Statements
The financial information, in the form of the primary statements contained in this report, is presented in accordance with International Accounting
Standard (IAS) 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements”. IAS 1 provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the Income Statement, but states
that key items should be disclosed. It also encourages additional line items to be added and the re-ordering of items presented on the face of the
Income Statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance. ANGLE has reviewed the items disclosed
separately on the face of the Income Statement and the components of financial performance considered by management to be significant, or for
which separate disclosure would assist, both in a better understanding of financial performance and in making projections of future results. This has
been done taking into account the materiality, nature and function of components of income and expense.
1.4 Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the projections for the forthcoming 12 month period from the date of signing of these Financial Statements and based
on the level of existing cash, projected income and expenditure, the Directors are satisfied that the Company and Group have adequate resources
to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly the going concern basis has been used in preparing the Financial Statements.
1.5 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiary undertakings are consolidated on the basis of the purchase method of accounting. Under this method of accounting the results of
subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the Income Statement up to, or from the date control passes. Intra-group transactions and balances are
eliminated fully on consolidation and the consolidated accounts reflect external transactions only.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding
of more than half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered when assessing whether the Group controls an
entity . Subsidiaries’ accounting policies are amended where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Deemed disposals
Where the Group ceases to control an entity by means other than disposal of equity, such as the entity issuing shares to third parties, the entity
ceases to be a subsidiary and is no longer consolidated. Any gain or loss arising on the “deemed disposal” is recognised in the Income Statement. 
Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally accompanied by a shareholding of between
20% to 50% of the equity or voting rights. The Group has elected to treat such investments in associates as accounted for in accordance with IAS 39
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and upon initial recognition these investments are designated as at fair value through the
Income Statement.
Other investments
Other investments are generally investments where the Group owns less than 20% of the equity or voting rights.
In accordance with IAS 39, upon initial recognition such investments are designated as at fair value through the Income Statement.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the year ended 30 April 2008 ANGLE plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Page 31
1 Accounting policies continued
1.6 Investments
The Directors consider that a substantial measure of the performance of the Group is assessed through changes in fair value arising from the
investment activity of the Group. Consequently the Group classifies all its investments that are not controlled investments as being designated on
initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through the Income Statement.
Treatment of gains and losses arising on fair value
Investments that are not controlled investments are shown on the Balance Sheet at their fair value and any associated changes in fair value are
included in the Income Statement in the period they arise.
Valuation policy
In determining fair value, investments have been valued by the Directors in compliance with the principles of the International Private Equity and
Venture Capital Guidelines, updated and effective 1 January 2005, as recommended by the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA).
Listed investments – the fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices at the Balance Sheet date.
Unlisted investments – the valuation methodology used most commonly by the Group is the “price of recent investment”, reflecting the early stage
nature of the investments. The following considerations are used when calculating the fair value using the “price of recent investment” guidelines:
�
Where the investment being valued was itself made recently, its cost will generally provide a good indication of fair value; and
�
Where there has been any recent investment by third parties, the price of that investment will provide a basis of the valuation.
Where a fair value cannot be estimated reliably the investment is reported at the carrying value at the previous reporting date unless there is
evidence that the investment has since been impaired.
Earn-outs are a deferred payment conditional on the future performance of the acquired asset and are shown on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Directors consider a number of valuation methodologies including a “balance of probabilities” and discounted cash flow in order to determine a
fair value. The earn-out is revalued based on any new information received relating to progress against plans, levels of sales and any other relevant
factors.
Convertible loan notes
As well as direct investment into Progeny
®
companies the Group uses other financial instruments such as convertible loans.
Under IAS 28 Investments in Associates, financial instruments that are presently exercisable are taken into account in determining control and
significant influence and this may affect the basis of consolidation.
Under IAS 39 convertible loan notes are financial assets and are defined as compound financial instruments consisting of a liability component and
an equity component. At the date of issue there is a requirement to split the instrument between its debt and equity components. 
The debt component is classified under investments as “Loans and receivables” and subsequently carried in the Balance Sheet at cost less any
impairment.
The equity component is classified under investments and subsequently carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value. The right to convert the loan into
equity represents an embedded derivative (the option) and as such needs to be re-measured to fair value at each reporting date with any changes
in fair value of this right taken through the Income Statement.
Convertible loans issued in a different functional currency to the issuing entity are treated the same, however, there may also be an associated
financial instrument [see policy 1.15 below] to manage the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
1.7 Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for goods and services net of value added tax.
Management services revenues are recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of each project. The stage of completion takes into
account the milestones achieved in relation to the project deliverables.
1.8 Employee benefits
Share based payments
Share based incentive arrangements which allow Group employees to acquire shares of the Company are provided to staff. The fair value of options
granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity. In accordance with IFRS 2, Share options granted after 
7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 May 2005 are valued at the date of grant using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged
to operating costs over the vesting period of the award. The annual charge is modified to take account of options granted to employees who leave
the Group during the performance or vesting period and forfeit their rights to the share options and in the case of non-market related performance
conditions, where it becomes unlikely they will vest. The fair value of options granted to professional advisors as part consideration for services in
connection with fund raising is recognised as an expense against share premium account with a corresponding increase in equity. Such options vest
and are expensed on successful completion of the services. 1 Accounting policies continued
Pension obligations
Pension costs are charged against profits as they fall due and represent the amount of contributions payable to a defined contribution scheme in
the US or to employee personal pension schemes on an individual basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have
been paid.
A liability for short term compensated absences, such as holiday, is recognised for the amount the Group may be required to pay as a result of the
unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date.
Bonus plan
The Group operates a Deferred Annual Bonus Plan for its employees and Directors.
Venture Incentive Plan
The Group operates a Venture Incentive Plan for its employees and Directors involved in the Ventures area of the business. The Group recognises a
liability and an expense for bonuses that are accruing through the creation of value in the Group’s portfolio of equity investments but that have not
yet been realised in cash.
1.9 Income taxes
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all differences resulting from the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base. Deferred tax is
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply
when the related deferred tax liability is settled or deferred tax asset realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on any increase in the fair value of investments to the extent that substantial shareholdings relief may be
unavailable. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent to which they are expected to be recovered in the near future. IAS 12 Income
taxes requires the separate disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Group’s Balance Sheet. 
1.10 Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and subject to impairment review. Cost includes
expenditure that is attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated
residual value of each asset over its expected useful economic life. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful
economic life on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, the lease term. Assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
The following rates are used:
Computer equipment 33.33% Straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 33.33% Straight line
Laboratory equipment 20% Straight line
1.11 Intangible assets
Computer software
Under IAS 38 – Intangible Assets, acquired computer software should be capitalised as an intangible asset unless it is an integral part of the related
hardware (such as the operating system) where it remains as an item of property, plant and equipment. 
Internally developed computer software will be capitalised in accordance with the research and development accounting policy. If the software is
developed for in-house use the capitalised amount is reclassified from research and development to computer software.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the software over its estimated useful economic life.
Research and development
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. 
Development expenditure is also written off, except where the Directors are satisfied that a new or significantly improved product or process results
and other relevant IAS 38 criteria are met as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects that would allow such costs to
be capitalised. In such cases, the identifiable expenditure is capitalised and amortised over the period during which benefits are expected.
Patents
Patents have a finite useful life and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to
allocate the cost of patents over their estimated useful economic lives. 
Impairment
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.

1 Accounting policies continued
1.12 Leases
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases, and any other leases that entail taking substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of an asset, are capitalised on the Balance Sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
Obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the
rental payment is charged to the Income Statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in 
each period.
1.13 Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) to assist with the obligations under share option and other employee remuneration
schemes. The ESOT is consolidated as if it were a subsidiary. Shares in the Group held by the ESOT are stated at cost and presented in the Balance
Sheet as a deduction from equity under the heading of “ESOT Shares”. Finance and administration costs relating to the ESOT are charged to
operating costs.
1.14 Foreign currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency . The Group
determines the functional currency of each entity and items included in the Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that functional
currency. The functional currencies of the Group’s operations are sterling and US dollars.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and held at cost use the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and held at fair value use the exchange rate at the date that the fair value
was determined.
Profits and losses on both the individual transactions during the period and monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the Income Statement.
On consolidation, the Income Statements of the foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates for the period and the Balance
Sheets at the exchange rates at the Balance Sheet date. The exchange differences arising as a result of translating Income Statements at average
rates and restating opening net assets at closing rates are taken to the translation reserve. On disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred
cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the Income Statement.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1 “First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” which allows the cumulative
translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS. The Group has similarly elected that the profit or
loss on any subsequent disposal of any foreign operation shall exclude translation differences that arose before the date of transition.
1.15 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments as appropriate to manage the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations from its activities
and changes in interest rates on borrowings. This is achieved by the use of foreign currency contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. All
derivative financial instruments are held at fair value. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently re-measured to fair value at each
reporting date. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts for contracts with
similar maturity profiles. The fair value of currency swaps and interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest
and exchange rates. All changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are taken through the Income Statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses
reported in the Income Statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short term deposits in the Balance Sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less.
For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term deposits as defined previously and other
short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, net of
outstanding short-term borrowings.
Deposits
Deposits in the Balance Sheet comprise longer term deposits with an original maturity of greater than three months.
Bank loans, loan notes and borrowings
All loans and borrowing are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings. After
initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the
estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the liabilities. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any
discount or premium on settlement. 1 Accounting policies continued
Other assets
Assets, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated at their cost less impairment losses. They are reviewed at each
Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows. Any change in the level of impairment is recognised directly in the Income Statement.
An impairment loss is reversed at subsequent Balance Sheet dates to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed its carrying value
had no impairment loss been recognised.
Other liabilities
Liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be
payable in respect of goods or services received up to the Balance Sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that the Group will be required to
settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. The provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the
amount to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, and are discounted back to present value if the effect is material.
1.16 Segmental reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from
those of other business segments. A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that is subject
to different risks and returns from other segments in other economic environments.
1.17 Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges are accrued against operating income in the period in which management has committed to a plan and in which the liability
has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
1.18 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates
and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those
estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities relate to
the valuation of unlisted investments held at fair value, and to the valuation of earn-outs, which are valued on the basis in Note 1.6 above. There is a
risk that should these estimations require significant downward revision, there would be a material adverse impact on the Income Statement for the
year.
2 Turnover and segmental analysis
The Group operates in one principal area of activity – technology wealth creation through the commercialisation of intellectual property and the
development of technology industry. 
The primary business segments are:
�
Management services – provision of Management services to clients including research organisations, corporate and governmental organisations
on a fee-for-service basis. This business segment provides a platform for the Ventures activities.
�
Ventures – activities to establish, develop and create value in technology companies. The Group uses a proprietary Progeny
®
process to develop
these companies, which are referred to as Progeny
®
companies. ANGLE’s unique business model involves ANGLE founding new companies which
it controls during the critical early stages of development, before securing third party funding.
Under IFRS, the accounting for Progeny
®
companies divides into controlled investments and non-controlled investments:
– Controlled investments – Progeny
®
companies where the Group has control, typically as a result of owning in excess of 50% of the equity. 
These are consolidated and the Group’s investment costs are expensed in the Income Statement.
– Non-controlled investments – Progeny
®
companies where the Group does not have control. These investments are held on the Balance Sheet at
fair value, with changes in fair value passing through the Income Statement.
The nature of these operations is significantly different. The primary format and segmentation by class of business has been provided on the face of
the Consolidated Income Statement.
The secondary format would be by geographical format. Segmental revenue by geographical revenue is shown on page 35. Over 90% of segment
assets by geographical location are based in the UK.
The turnover of the Group for the year has been primarily derived from its Management services activities. Some £0.3 million (2007: £0.1 million) of the
fees relate to reimbursable operating expenditure incurred on management contracts.
In addition the Group provides management services to investments in the form of non-executive director services, management, accounting and
administration support for which it receives fees.

to £40,235 (2007: £58,237). Contributions totalling £5,832 (2007: £7,797) were payable to the fund at the year end and are included in trade and other
payables. The Group made UK pension costs payments of £187,775 (2007: £230,193) directly to personal pension plan schemes. Contributions to
personal pension plan schemes of £8,169 (2007: £25,370) were payable at year end and are included in trade and other payables.

9 Tax
As a result of the Group’s furtherance of its core activity of establishing and developing technology and biotechnology companies, taxable losses
have been incurred which are available for offset against future taxable profits. The Group is also eligible for, and takes advantage of, the substantial
shareholdings relief UK corporation tax exemption. This results in the gain from any disposals of UK investments where the Group has an equity stake
greater than 10%, and subject to certain other tests, being free of corporation tax. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these
losses as the Group does not anticipate taxable profits to arise within the foreseeable future.

The Group’s investment portfolio comprises investments in Progeny
®
companies. Progeny
®
companies are businesses established by ANGLE to
commercialise intellectual property using ANGLE’s proprietary Progeny
®
process.
Where the Group has control of a Progeny
®
company (typically owning more than 50% of the equity), these are defined as “controlled investments”
and they are consolidated as subsidiaries. At the point control no longer exists, a deemed profit arises and the “non-controlled investment” is held at
fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the year to 30 April 2008 net costs before taxation relating to controlled investments of £2,295,342
were charged to the Income Statement (2007: £3,188,101). 
Where the Group does not control a Progeny

company Acolyte Biomedica was sold to 3M Corporation in February 2007. ANGLE’s share of the proceeds was an initial 
£0.9 million in cash and an earn-out of up to £4.7 million receivable early in 2010. A fair value of £1.9 million of this potential £4.7 million earn-out is
held on ANGLE’s Balance Sheet under the “Other receivables” category.
Change in fair value

ANGLE’s accounting policy is that, in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, upon initial recognition of an
investment it is designated at fair value through the Income Statement. As a result of 1) securing third party funds and reducing the equity position
in Geomerics Limited; 2) securing third party funds and taking account of the potential voting rights in Synature Limited; and 3) a stock
redemption agreement with Aberro Inc, then these are “deemed” disposals as the status has changed from a subsidiary (controlled investment)
which is consolidated to an associate (non-controlled investment) which is held at fair value.

14 Acquisitions
During 2008 and 2007 a number of acquisitions were made by controlled investments in share for share exchanges under the terms of IP Option
Exercise Agreements. The acquisitions were made to secure IP (patents, copyright, know-how) relevant to the controlled investment and as a result
this accounts for substantially all of the fair value of the acquisitions.

15 Other financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, treasury deposits, overdraft, finance leases and various items such as trade receivables and trade
payables which arise directly from its operations. 
In addition the Group holds an investment portfolio comprising loans and equity investments (listed and unlisted) in technology based companies
(Note 11). 
It is the Group’s policy that no trading in financial derivatives shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are adverse interest rate movements, adverse currency rate movements, liquidity risk and
investment risk.
Financial assets
Financial assets of the Group comprise cash at bank and in hand as well as treasury deposits and loan notes. Other financial assets on which no
interest is earned comprise non-current and current asset investments and details are provided in Note 11. It is the Group’s policy to place surplus
cash resources on deposit at both floating and fixed term deposit rates of interest with the objective of maintaining a balance between accessibility
of funds and competitive rates of return. Fixed term deposits are for varying periods ranging from one to six months, to the extent that cash flow can
be reasonably predicted.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities of the Group in the normal course of business comprise overdraft facilities and finance leases (see Note 19 for profile), but not
borrowings. It is the Group’s policy to use various financial instruments with floating and fixed rates of interest with the objective of maintaining a
balance between continuity of funding, matching the liability with the use of the asset, and finding flexible funding options for a reasonable charge. 
The Group currently does not utilise overdraft facilities. The Group believes that it has a good long-standing banking relationship and that these
facilities can be reinstated if required. Finance leases and hire purchase agreements are held under fixed rate contracts. The Group has no long term
borrowings or undrawn committed borrowing facilities. Therefore the Group is not exposed to any interest rate risk on its financial liabilities. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) Fixed rate assets attracted interest of 4.4% in 2007. Fixed rate liabilities attracted interest of between 8% and 14% during the year (2007: 10.9% to 15.0%).
(2) Floating rate cash deposits in Sterling earn interest at 0.5% below the Bank of England Base rate (2007: 0.5%). The weighted average interest rate on Sterling cash
deposit for this period was 4.5% (2007: 4.4%). The weighted average interest rate on US dollar cash deposit for this period was 2.2% (2007: 2.5%). 
With the exception of non-current investments, other receivables (non-current) and loans and borrowings, all amounts have maturity dates of less
than 12 months. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group has overseas subsidiaries, the revenues and expenses of which are denominated in Sterling and US dollars. As a result, the Group’s Sterling
Income Statement and Balance Sheet may be affected by movements in the US dollar : Sterling exchange rate.
The majority of the Group’s operating revenues and expenses is in Sterling and US dollars. Sales are priced in Sterling or US dollars for preference
although the Group has a limited amount of revenues and expenses denominated in other currencies. A natural hedge exists through the matching
of anticipated foreign currency operating expenses with foreign currency revenues. The excess exposure over and above this natural hedge is
managed for all significant foreign currencies using forward currency contracts or currency swaps. In exceptional circumstances the Board may
approve of contracts in excess of twelve months.
Sensitivity analysis
The impact of a 5% variation in the US dollar rates on the profit / (loss) for the year is as follows:
2008 2007

Profit / (loss) – 5% strengthening (107,727) (132,825)

Liquidity risk
The principal risk to which the Group is exposed is liquidity risk. The nature of the Group’s activities means it finances its operations through retained
earnings, including equity disposals, and the issue of new shares to investors. The principal cash requirements are in relation to developing new
ventures, funding investments and meeting working capital requirements. The Group seeks to manage liquidity through planning, forecasting, careful
cash management and managing the investment risk. 
Early stage companies typically experience significant negative cash flows, which ANGLE covers initially until sufficient progress is made to attract
further funding. Investments may be unable to obtain financing due to lack of operational progress or market conditions and the Group may feel it
necessary to provide additional investment and/or management time to support these companies further. Adverse market conditions may also
delay liquidity events, thereby requiring additional investment, and ANGLE may also find it difficult to raise additional capital under these conditions.
Investment risk
Equity investments are held to achieve capital growth in their value with the intention of subsequent disposal at a profit. The main risks arising from
these equity investments are technological risk and market price risk. The Group seeks to manage investment risk by using investment appraisal
processes and monitoring procedures with regular reports made to the Board on the status of investments. The Group’s Progeny
®
model is built on
robust risk management processes combined with experienced management.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
Other than as disclosed, the Directors believe that the fair value and the book value of financial assets and financial liabilities is not materially
different. Trade payables and receivables have a remaining life of less than one year so their value on the Balance Sheet is considered to be a fair
approximation of fair value. The valuation policy for investments and other receivables (non-current) is detailed in Note 1.6.

The key disclosures that enable the user of the Financial Statements to understand the nature and extent of share based payment charges through
the Income Statement relate to ANGLE plc and not to the controlled investments.
Company – Share Option Schemes
The Company operates Approved and Unapproved Share Option Schemes as a means of encouraging ownership and aligning interests of staff 
and external shareholders. Share options were a key part of the remuneration package and were granted at the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee taking into account the need to motivate, retain and recruit high calibre executives. In 2007 the Company introduced a new
remuneration scheme involving deferred shares and options are expected to only be used in exceptional circumstances going forward. 
Options are not exercisable until three years after the date of grant and cease to be exercisable after seven years from the date of grant. Options are
forfeited if the employee leaves the Group unless the conditions under which they leave are such that they are considered to be a “good leaver”; in
this case their options remain exercisable for a limited period of time. Share option agreements in place require the employee to reimburse the
Company for the cost of employer’s National Insurance Contributions, and other equivalent taxes, and accordingly the Company does not accrue for
such taxes that would otherwise be due on share option gains. 
The movement in the number of employee share options is set out below:

Options are issued at market price, with the exception of tranche 10 (see table below) which were issued at the placing price. The options
outstanding at 30 April 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of three years and nine months (2007: four years and four months). 
The Company uses the “Black-Scholes” model to determine the fair-value of the Company’s share options. The Group has elected to apply the
share-based payment exemption under IFRS 1. The Company has not applied IFRS 2 to those options granted before 7 November 2002.

On 30 April 2008, 312,500 options with an exercise price of £1.44 (representing 5% of the value of the Placing Shares at the Placing Price) over
ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company were outstanding to KBC Peel Hunt (2007: 312,500 at £1.44). The options were issued as part
consideration for its services in connection with the flotation and placing in March 2004, vested immediately and cease to be exercisable on 
10 March 2011.
Company – Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme
Bonuses under the Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) scheme are paid partly in cash and partly in deferred shares. The cash element is accrued in the
year it relates to and is included in wages and salaries. The deferred shares, comprising Mandatory and Matching shares, are deferred for three years
at which point they vest. Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, unless the conditions under which they leave
are such that they are considered to be a “good leaver”; in which case their award vests but may be pro-rated.

The share based payment charge for the Company Share Option Schemes and DAB scheme was £213,759 (2007: £355,525).
Controlled investments
Controlled investments individually operate Unapproved, or equivalent, share option schemes and restricted share schemes as a means of attracting
start-up management, encouraging ownership and aligning interests of staff with shareholders. Share options are a key part of the remuneration
package and are granted at the discretion of the individual controlled entity boards taking into account the need to recruit, motivate and retain
high calibre executives. 
Controlled investments unapproved share option schemes typically have a management option pool of 15% of the issued share capital. Options are
typically 1) granted at market value 2) have vesting and/or performance conditions and 3) lapse after a period of 10 years from the date of grant.
There are no legal or constructive obligations to repurchase or settle options in cash.
Market prices do not exist for such early stage controlled investments and, in the absence of market prices, fair value is estimated using a valuation
technique to value the instrument on the measurement date in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.
The share based payment charge for controlled investments was £44,992 (2007: £59,216).
22 Contingent liabilities
The Group had no contingent liabilities at 30 April 2008 (2007: £nil). 
23 Guarantees and other financial commitments
The Group has obligations under finance leases as shown in Note 19. The Group leases office accommodation on leases of generally less than one
year with monthly rental payments and has a number of retainers with professional advisors. 
The Group intends to continue to support its investments where appropriate, however, this is typically on a discretionary draw-down basis with no
formal legal commitment. 24 Related party transactions

* The Balance Sheet for 2007 has been restated as required by UITF 41, to take account of an increase in the cost of investment and equity for share options granted to
employees of subsidiary undertakings in prior years arising from the adoption of FRS 20 – Share Based Payments – see notes on C1, C2 and C4. C1 Accounting policies
C1.1 Accounting convention and compliance with accounting standards
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable
United Kingdom accounting standards. A summary of the more important accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the
year are set out below.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the holding Company’s Profit and Loss Account has not been included in these Financial
Statements. The profit for the financial year was £nil (2007: £nil).
As permitted by FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements, no Cash Flow Statement for the Company has been included on the grounds that the Group includes
the Company in its own published Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 – Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, not to prepare a financial
instruments note as the information is available in the published Financial Statements of the Group. 
Restatement
The Company is required to adopt UITF 41 – Scope of FRS 20 and has retrospectively applied this from 1 May 2006. The effect of this adoption is to
reflect the fair value of share options awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in the accounts of the Company. As a result the cost of
investment in subsidiaries is increased by the fair value of the share based awards since the adoption of FRS 20. The corresponding entry is reflected
in equity.
C1.2 Fixed Asset Investments
Fixed asset investments are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
C1.3 Share based payments
The Share option and Deferred Annual Bonus schemes allow Group employees to acquire shares of the Company, subject to certain criteria. 
In accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payments, the fair value of options granted and deferred shares awarded is recognised as an expense of
employment and the cost is borne by the appropriate subsidiary receiving the benefit of the employees’ services. The fair value is treated as a capital
contribution and added to the cost of the Company’s investments in its subsidiary undertakings and a corresponding credit is made to reserves. The
accounting treatment required by FRS 20 is consistent with that applied under IFRS 2 in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

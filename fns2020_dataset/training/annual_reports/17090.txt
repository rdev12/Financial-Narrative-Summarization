Chairman’s statement
Continued growth
The last 12 months have seen the 
opening of an exciting new chapter in 
the Whitbread story. 
The acquisition and successful 
integration of Premier Lodge to form 
Premier Travel Inn was accompanied 
by continued good growth in sales, 
like-for-like sales and by another steady 
improvement in return on capital 
employed (on an underlying basis). 
For the fourth year in succession we 
have achieved double-digit growth in 
adjusted earnings per share.
As a result, Whitbread is now in  
a position to make a signiﬁcant return  
of cash to shareholders by crystallising 
the value that has been built up over  
the past decade in our full-service  
hotel properties.
A period of transformation
The last ﬁve years have seen a 
transformation in the shape of 
Whitbread:
2000 –  sale of brewing and oﬀ-licence 
businesses;
2001 – demerger of pubs and bars;
2004 –  acquisition of Premier Lodge and 
creation of Premier Travel Inn;
2005 –  exit from Marriott  
full-service hotels.
While the disposal of more than  
£3.5 billion worth of assets has 
dominated the headlines, the real story 
has been about our organic growth, as 
Whitbread has set about building its 
budget hotels, restaurants and sports, 
health and ﬁtness clubs to become the 
UK’s leading hospitality company.
Sir John Banham 
Chairman PAGE 5
The last 12 months have seen the  
opening of an exciting new chapter  
in the Whitbread story. 
It is remarkable that the company 
has continued to deliver such steady 
performances during a period of change 
that included signiﬁcant global events 
aﬀecting our industry. Since 2000/1, 
Whitbread has delivered double-digit 
growth in adjusted earnings per share 
year-after-year and it has raised its 
return on capital employed.
Total shareholder returns have improved 
both in absolute terms and in relation to 
other large UK quoted companies.
Dividend
The Board’s conﬁdence in Whitbread’s 
organic growth prospects is reﬂected in 
the ﬁnal dividend payment of 18.35p per 
share, making a total dividend for the 
year of 25.25p per share, an increase of 
13.2%. The ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 
8 July to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 6 May 2005.
People
During the time that I have been at 
Whitbread I have been fortunate to work 
with many talented individuals. The 
quality of the people that we are able to 
attract at all levels of the organisation 
testiﬁes to its spirit and remains a key 
area of competitive strength.
The changes of the last ﬁve years 
have been made possible by the 
skill, enthusiasm and dedication of 
thousands of Whitbread people who 
provide millions of guests with the kind 
of welcome that encourages them to 
return time and again. On your behalf  
it is my privilege to thank them all.
It is notable that Angie Risley, our 
Human Resources Director, has joined 
the Board. Whitbread is one of only  
six FTSE 100 companies where the  
human resources function is represented 
directly at Board level.
The Board
At this year’s Annual General Meeting 
we shall say farewell to three directors. 
David Richardson, our Finance Director, 
has played a central role in transforming 
Whitbread. His successor, Christopher 
Rogers, has a hard act to follow. Both 
Prue Leith and David Williamson will 
be standing down as non-executive 
directors, after 17 years combined 
service. Both have made notable 
contributions to the company and  
we wish them every happiness. 
Finally, this is my last Whitbread annual 
report. My successor Anthony Habgood 
will ﬁnd that it is both a pleasure and 
a privilege to help guide and serve a 
company with such a distinguished past 
and such an exciting future.

Chief Executive’s review
Strategy, decisions and actions
We have an ambitious vision – to be the 
best hospitality company there is.
In pursuit of this vision we have created a 
strong platform to build upon in the three 
sectors of the hospitality market where 
we have leading positions – budget 
hotels, restaurants and sports, health  
and ﬁtness clubs.
I ﬁrmly believe that it’s our 40,000 
people that hold the key to our success. 
By building a One Whitbread, No Limits 
culture we will unleash their full potential.
We aim to create value for our 
shareholders through generating higher 
returns from our invested capital and 
through disciplined growth.
Over the course of the last year we have 
made signiﬁcant progress and have 
substantially completed the reshaping  
of Whitbread for the future. We have 
taken a number of decisive steps:
•  comprehensive business review 
undertaken;
•  created Premier Travel Inn following  
the £505 million acquisition of  
Premier Lodge;
•  consolidated our pub restaurants 
businesses under one management team;
•  decided to sell our Marriott hotels 
business and non-core assets, with  
an expected realisation of £1.3 billion;
•  announced a signiﬁcant return  
of cash to shareholders;
•  strengthened the senior  
management team;
•  started to build a One Whitbread,  
No Limits  culture.

Chief Executive PAGE 7
“ The best hospitality company there is”
The past twelve months have been 
a period of transformation at Whitbread. 
Business review
In June 2004 the Whitbread Board 
began a review to identify the actions 
required to achieve our ambition. 
We were able to do this from a position 
of strength with a solid track record 
of earnings growth; year-on-year 
improvements in return on capital 
employed; and ownership of good 
assets and strong brands.
The review involved:
• reappraisal of business plans;
•  canvassing of views from our people, 
our shareholders and our customers;
•  assessment of the competitive 
environment and outlook for 
market growth.
By October we were ready to share the 
outcomes of our review and set forth a 
new strategy for the company focused 
on four key objectives:
Strengthening the leading positions of 
our businesses in three sectors of the 
UK hospitality market:
• budget hotels;
• restaurants;
• sports, health and ﬁ tness clubs.
Generating return on capital employed 
ahead of the group’s cost 
of capital on a consistent basis:
•  every Whitbread business is
targeted to achieve and sustain 
an economic proﬁ t.
 Achieving sustainable earnings 
growth through:
•  new site investment in value 
generative businesses;
•  sharpened consumer focus to drive 
like-for-like sales;
•  better ways of working to lower costs;
•  international development on solid 
UK base.
Commitment to improving shareholder 
returns through:
•  dividends growing faster than 
earnings per share;
•  returning to shareholders at least 
half of the proceeds from identiﬁ ed 
asset sales, based upon current 
investment plans.
Creating Premier Travel Inn
In July, Whitbread acquired Premier Lodge 
from Spirit Group for £505 million, 
increasing our scale in the exciting 
and fast-growing budget hotels sector 
by nearly 50%.
Over the following 32 weeks we integrated 
Premier Lodge with our own Travel Inn 
business, combining under one brand 
more than 28,400 bedrooms across more 
than 450 sites, to create Premier T ravel Inn. 
Our aim was not simply to increase 
scale: by combining Travel Inn and 
Premier Lodge and marketing them 
to the UK consumer under one brand, 
we are able to realise signiﬁ cant cost 
and revenue synergies.
The transaction was an early signal of 
Whitbread’s new direction, consolidating 
our leading position in budget hotels, 
a sector where we have a track record 
of value creation.
STRATEGY, DECISIONS AND ACTIONS
The Whitbread Way
At Whitbread we are proud of 
who we are. We believe in four 
principles that guide our actions and 
behaviours. It’s the way we do things 
and it’s called the Whitbread Way.
•  People and teamwork
•  Caring for guests
• Passion for winning
• Continuous improvement
The Whitbread Way is part of our 
260 year heritage and is shared 
across our family of brands.
I am delighted that Anthony 
Habgood is to join Whitbread. 
Anthony (aged 58) is currently 
Chairman of Bunzl PLC and he will 
bring a wealth of experience to the 
company as our new Chairman 
when Sir John Banham retires 
in August.
I would like to thank Sir John for 
his enormous contribution to the 
company over the last six years 
which has seen substantial growth 
in total shareholder return.
Chairman’s succession PAGE 8 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5
Pub restaurants consolidation
Whitbread has one of the best pub 
restaurant estates in the UK; and in 
Brewers Fayre and Beefeater we have 
two established brands.
In January we brought together all of 
our pub restaurants as a single business,  
run by one management team under 
Phil Urban.
Phil and his team are focused on 
generating long-term growth and  
a signiﬁcant improvement in return on 
capital employed, from a business that 
has yet to reach its true potential.
Marriott exit and disposal  
of non-core assets
Following the business review, we took 
the decision to reduce our exposure  
to – and ultimately exit from – the  
full-service hotels sector where we are 
the UK operators of the Marriott brand. 
Having spent the past decade building 
up the business, in my previous role as 
Managing Director of Whitbread Hotel 
Company, the decision was not an easy 
one for me personally.
However, despite our out-performance  
of the sector, the fact is that we have  
not been able to generate high enough 
returns from this franchised business. 
With an expected realisation of at  
least £1 billion – and a substantial 
return of cash to shareholders – this is a 
strategically important step for Whitbread.
The ﬁrst disposals were announced 
in November 2004, with the sale 
agreement for £79 million of  
11 Courtyard by Marriott hotels.
Then in March 2005, we announced our 
intention to sell a further 46 Marriott 
hotels into a joint venture with Marriott 
International (transferring the operation 
of the hotels to Marriott). 
On 25 April 2005 we announced the 
conditional sale of our German  
steak-house business Maredo.
In addition, we have identiﬁed three 
other areas where we will make 
disposals to crystallise value for our 
shareholders:
•  Britannia Soft Drinks  – Whitbread 
holds a 23.75% stake in Britannia Soft 
Drinks Limited (BSD). The company 
intends to dispose of this holding via 
an initial public oﬀering of BSD. The 
shareholders of BSD have agreed that 
this can occur between 1 January 
2005 and 31 December 2008;
•  Chiswell Street – after more than  
250 years we will be disposing of our 
Chiswell Street site;
•  hotel properties – we intend to sell  
an additional seven hotel properties 
not forming part of the main 
Marriott disposal.
Signiﬁcant return of cash  
to shareholders
We expect to realise £1.3 billion through 
the sale of Marriott Hotels and other 
assets that are not core to our strategy. 
This restructuring, which is now 
substantially complete, will step up 
Whitbread’s return on capital employed. 
We will make a signiﬁcant return of cash 
to our shareholders and reduce both our 
debt and our pension fund deﬁcit.
In May this year we will pay a special 
dividend of 135p per share, returning  
a total of £400 million to shareholders.
Building One Whitbread and strengthening 
the ‘Whitbread Way’ culture will play a key 
role in achieving our vision.
We reached a key milestone in March 2005 
with the ﬁrst One Whitbread Convention.
The event brought together, for the ﬁrst 
time in Whitbread’s history, all of our 
1,600 outlet managers. The event was 
also attended by our key suppliers. PAGE 9

Building One Whitbread and

culture will play a key role in achieving 
our vision.
We reached a key milestone in March 
2005 when we brought together, for the 
ﬁ rst time in Whitbread’s history, all of

One Whitbread Convention.
WINcard
In 2005/6 we are introducing a standard 
business performance tool for every 
single Whitbread employee in every 
single outlet or ofﬁ ce throughout the 
company.
It’s called the ‘WINcard’ or ‘Whitbread 
in Numbers card’ and it will change the 
way that we do business.
WINcard introduces a set of performance 
criteria that are consistent across each 
individual component of the company. 
It takes a balanced scorecard approach 
to assess how each outlet or business 
unit serves our key stakeholder groups: 
our people; our guests; and our 
shareholders.
The criteria are based upon the key 
performance indicators for Whitbread:
• retention of our people;
• health and safety;
• brand standards;
• guest recommendations;
• like-for-like sales growth;
• proﬁ t growth.
The WINcard will be used at every unit 
by every brand. At group and brand level 
economic proﬁ t and outlet growth are 
also measured.
Better ways of working
As part of our business review we 
established a Better Ways of Working 
programme. The purpose of this is to 
identify areas where we can maximise 
synergies and by doing so take costs out 
of our operating overhead.
There are four key areas where we 
are focusing our eﬀ orts on realising 
these synergies – people, processes, 
procurement and property.
Driving efﬁ ciencies is critical at a time 
when, like many retailers, we are facing 
signiﬁ cant cost pressures in areas such as 
gas, electricity, business rates and labour.
Our people
My ﬁ rst year as your Chief Executive 
has been an exciting time of change. 
We have restructured Whitbread to 
create sustained value for shareholders. 
The 100% commitment and enthusiasm 
of all our people to the principles of 
the Whitbread Way and the No Limits 
culture is very impressive. I am very 
proud to work alongside them to make 
Whitbread the best hospitality company 
there is.
Changes to senior 
management team
To deliver our strategy, we need the right 
people in the right positions. Over the 
last 12 months we have made a number 
of key appointments to our senior 
management team:
•  Finance Director (eﬀ ective 1 May 2005) 
– Christopher Rogers has joined us 
from Woolworths Group where he 
held the position of Finance Director;
•  Managing Director, pub restaurants 
– Phil Urban joined Whitbread from 
Spirit Group, having previously spent 
ten years at Scottish and Newcastle 
Retail;
•  Group Development Director 
– Desmond Taljaard joined Whitbread 
from J Sainsbury where he was 
Property Director, a position he also 
held at Hilton Group;
•  Group Commercial Director 
– Paula Vennells is responsible for 
coordinating the group’s commercial 
activities including marketing and 
procurement. Previously she was 
Marketing Director for Whitbread 
Restaurants;
•  Director of Group Information 
Systems – Ben Wishart joined 
Whitbread from Tesco where 
he was an IT Director.
The WINcard is our business. It reﬂ ects 
our philosophy that if we take care of 
our people, they will take care of our 
guests, which in turn drives proﬁ ts 
and enables us to create value for our 
shareholders. It is unique to Whitbread 
and will clearly diﬀ erentiate us from 
the competition.  PAGE 10 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5

Growth in a year of transformation
In a year of transformation, Whitbread 
has made progress against the key 
strategic measures of earnings growth 
and return on capital employed.
For the fourth year in succession we 
have generated double-digit growth in 
adjusted earnings per share.
On an underlying basis (excluding the 
acquired Premier Lodge assets and 
exceptional items), group return on 
capital employed improved to 10.5% 
from 10.1%.
Both Premier Travel Inn and our 
high street restaurants had an 
outstanding year. Performance from 
pub restaurants has been mixed and 
a new management team has been 
appointed. David Lloyd Leisure has 
achieved sales and proﬁ t growth in 
a competitive market. 
In Marriott, where we have been unable 
to generate acceptable returns, we 
made the decision to crystallise value for 
shareholders through a complete exit.
Across the group we have increased 
turnover by 6.8% and strengthened 
group margin by 0.7% point to 15.5%, 
driving a 9.4% improvement in proﬁ t 
before exceptional items and tax.
Like-for-like sales were ahead by 2.6% and 
we have continued the organic growth 
of our businesses, with outlet numbers 
across the group increasing by 15%.
Investment in new sites, mainly for 
Premier Travel Inn, Brewers Fayre and 
David Lloyd Leisure, totalled £681 million, 
including the acquisition of Premier Lodge.
In 2005/6 our David Lloyd Leisure clubs 
will be introducing a range of new studio 
classes to help members get more out of 
their club. Nick Acock is a personal trainer 
at our Oxford club, which opened in 2003.
By placing a sharper focus on the 
value that we oﬀ er our guests and by 
leveraging the beneﬁ ts of scale we aim 
to enhance the competitive positions of 
each of our businesses, driving long-term 
growth and further improvements in 
return on capital employed.
Outlook
The underlying trends seen in the last 
quarter of 2004/5 have continued:
•  total group sales growth in the 
ﬁ rst seven weeks of the new ﬁ nancial 
year has remained strong, primarily 
due to the contribution from 
Premier Travel Inn;
•  growth in like-for-like sales has 
slowed, particularly in pub restaurants 
and David Lloyd Leisure.
Despite signs of a less conﬁ dent 
consumer, we anticipate ongoing 
Whitbread delivering increased sales 
in the year ahead.
A tightening environment is evident 
from the higher costs arising from 
national minimum wage, utility charges 
and the ﬁ ve-year rating revaluation. 
We are taking steps to limit the impact 
of these increases through operational 
eﬀ ectiveness and margin management 
and we shall keep capital expenditure 
under disciplined review. 
The Board believes that Whitbread is 
well placed for further organic growth, 
improvements in returns and dividends 
growing faster than earnings per share. 
This conﬁ dence is reﬂ ected in the Board’s 
recommendation of a 13.6% increase in 
the ﬁ nal dividend, bringing the total for 
the year to 25.25p. PAGE 12 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5

The performance of Premier Travel Inn 
has been particularly encouraging with 
sales increasing from £230 million to 
£323 million and operating proﬁ t up 
47% to £109 million.
Although this level of growth is due 
in part to the acquired Premier Lodge 
units (which contributed 32 weeks 
trading), like-for-like sales growth of 
6.4% and return on capital employed of 
15.7% in the former Travel Inn outlets, 
demonstrate the health of the business.
Operating proﬁ t in former Travel Inn 
pushed ahead by 17 .8%, driven by 
improvements in occupancy, room rate 
and operating margin. Occupancy 
moved up to 81.2% from 80.2% as London 
units experienced a stronger ﬁ rst half 
than in the previous year and achieved 
room rate grew by 4.2% to £43.25. 
Room yield increased by 5.6% to £35.14.
We have opened 817 new bedrooms 
in addition to the 9,498 from 
Premier Lodge. We plan to open 
1,800 new bedrooms in 2005/6. 
We have introduced Travel Inn’s 
transparent pricing policy into the 
former Premier Lodge units, eliminating 
discounts and commission payments. 
This has contributed to a 6.5% year-on-
year increase in room yield in these units 
since the acquisition.
The integration of Travel Inn and Premier 
Lodge to form Premier Travel Inn took 
just 32 weeks, creating the UK’s largest 
hotels business, with more than 28,400 
bedrooms in 452 locations across the UK.
Its completion – on time and within 
budget – creates a platform for growth 
and will enable Whitbread to generate 
cost and revenue synergies.
We have rebuilt our reservations system 
to accommodate the acquired and 
‘pipeline’ bedrooms. This should enable 
us to raise occupancy in the former 
Premier Lodge outlets towards the 
higher levels enjoyed by Travel Inn.
With a larger estate, we are better able 
to retain and recycle demand through 
‘cross-sell’ (where we oﬀ er guests the

bedroom if their ﬁ rst choice location is 
unavailable). Cross-selling generated 
£16.6 million of revenue over the 
course of the year, and we anticipate 
substantial growth in 2005/6.
By directing a higher proportion of 
reservations through the Internet, we 
are improving operational efﬁ ciency and 
making it simpler for guests to book. 
On average the Internet accounted for 
31% of all our room reservations in 2004/5. 
The former Premier Lodge outlets 
experienced particularly strong growth 
with web bookings, rising from 19% prior to
acquisition to more than 30% by year-end.
To strengthen awareness of the 
new brand and to generate demand 
across our estate we launched, 
in February, a national television 
advertising campaign and a newly 
created Premier Travel Inn website.
Pizza Hut promises 
that every pizza delivered 
to customers will be

After a difﬁcult start to the year,  
like-for-like sales improved in the third 
quarter. This level of improvement was 
not maintained in the ﬁnal quarter 
and for the year as a whole, margin, 
operating proﬁt and return on capital 
employed declined.
Our largest pub restaurant brand, 
Brewers Fayre had another good year. 
After a slow start, Beefeater improved 
in the second half but Brewsters has 
underperformed. 
In January we consolidated all our  
pub restaurants under one 
management team. By operating  
as one business we will be able to 
achieve beneﬁts of synergy and scale 
from our 600-strong estate.
Our new format for Beefeater is 
not simply about great grilled food. 
We have introduced a brighter 
service style which is winning a new 
generation of customers.
We aim to generate stronger sales 
growth by delivering better value to  
our customers, making our range of 
dishes more competitive and raising 
levels of service.
We will be integrating within  
Brewers Fayre the majority of our 
remaining 144 Brewsters branded 
outlets, which have been focused too 
heavily on young families. Conversion 
to Brewers Fayre’s more traditional 
pub restaurant format allows us to 
increase dining space and broaden their 
consumer appeal, whilst maintaining  
a family-friendly environment. 
We have converted a total of  
57 Beefeaters to our new format  
with 25 more to follow in 2005/6.  
We aim to generate performance uplift 
by extending our refreshed menu and 
service style across the entire Beefeater 
estate and by adapting our oﬀering to 
drive sales throughout the week.
We have added 31 outlets to our estate 
and we will continue to grow in 2005/6.
The execution of our plans will  
lead to continued disruption in the  
short-term, but we believe that we have 
taken the actions that will underpin 
sustained growth.
Restaurants: over the past year we have 
added more than 159 new outlets across 
our pub restaurant and high street 
restaurant businesses.

For the fourth year in succession, 
our high street restaurants have 
delivered growth in operating proﬁ t 
greater than 20%.
A strong rise in outlet numbers, mainly 
from Costa and Pizza Hut, generated 
good sales increases and contributed

Costa has added 66 new stores in 
the UK and has continued to enhance 
the quality of its estate by exiting 
under-performing outlets.
Over the course of 2005/6 Costa 
will accelerate its rate of growth, 
with an increasing proportion of 
new stores being opened under 
franchise agreements.
Through franchising, Costa is developing 
into an international retail business. Our

In a competitive market,  
David Lloyd Leisure continues to 
generate sales and proﬁt growth.
The business delivered like-for-like sales 
growth of 3.6%, while new and recently 
opened clubs have performed ahead  
of our expectations.
Return on capital employed for our 
mature clubs remains impressive at 
15.1%, while for the business as a  
whole it stands at 9.5%.
As competition has intensiﬁed and 
consumer conﬁdence weakened,  
we have seen increased attrition  
and slowing new member sales.  
This contributed to a decline in total  
UK membership, which ﬁnished the  
year down 2.3%. 
David Lloyd Leisure: return on capital 
employed in our mature clubs held steady 
at 15.1%, demonstrating the underlying 
strength of the business model.
David Lloyd Leisure is accelerating 
the progression to maturity in its 
new clubs – opening with more 
members from day one. 
Revenue per member improved while 
our membership retention dropped  
1% point to 72%.
Sales in the ﬁrst half of 2005/6 will 
reﬂect the lower opening member 
numbers, although we expect to rebuild 
membership as the year progresses.  
We will drive new member sales through 
better marketing and a sharper focus 
on the health and ﬁtness member. 
In addition we aim to strengthen 
membership retention through the 
introduction of new service skills training 
and a focus on brand standards.
Our new club in Worthing, West Sussex, 
has performed well, opening  
in November 2004 with record member 
numbers for a new club. 
In 2005/6 we will open two clubs  
in the UK, at Kingshill in Kent and at 
Southend-on-Sea in Essex.
Our overseas clubs have had a good  
year with membership rising to more 
than 40,000. We have added two clubs 
in the Netherlands to the ﬁve that we 
acquired from Cannons in 2003/4 and  
in November we opened our ﬁrst club  
in Belgium, at Brussels. 
Our Dublin club continues to perform 
well and in June we will open our  
ﬁrst club in Spain, at Barcelona.  
In its centenary year, the prestigious  
Real Club de Tenis del Turo will re-open 
under the David Lloyd Leisure banner.

With the full-service hotels market 
in gradual recovery, Marriott delivered 
like-for-like sales growth for the ﬁ rst 
year since 2000/1. However, with the 
Swallow hotels and Courtyard by 
Marriott disposals leading to a reduction 
in the size of the estate, operating proﬁ ts 
fell by 5.7%.
Underlying growth in proﬁ t, excluding 
contributions from disposed hotels, 
was ﬂ at. Occupancy in these hotels 
edged ahead by 1.8% points to 72.6% 
and achieved room rate improved by 
4% to £74.04, as Marriott recorded 
a 6.8% increase in room yield.
Marriott’s London hotels have been 
aﬀ ected by the weakness of the 
US dollar, which appears to be stiﬂ ing 
a full recovery of the North American 
business traveller market. 
An eﬀ ective leisure breaks marketing 
campaign run over December and 
January and a good performance in 
the conference market gave us a strong 
ﬁ nish to the year.
In March 2005 we announced our 
decision to exit the ownership and 
operation of our Marriott business. 
On 22 April a proposal to sell the 
majority of our full-service hotel assets 
into a joint venture with Marriott 
International received shareholder 
approval. Through this transaction 
we expect to realise at least £1 billion 
over the next two years. 
Britannia Soft Drinks
Britannia Soft Drinks (Britvic) enjoyed 
solid trading, despite less favourable 
summer weather. However, the 
business’s increased investment in 
existing and new brand extensions, 
IT and business infrastructure and 
increased pension costs led to a 18% 
decline in operating proﬁ t. Britannia 
Soft Drinks paid to Whitbread a cash 
dividend for the year of £11.9 million.
I look forward to updating you on 
our progress later this year in the 
announcement of our half-year results.

Finance Director’s review
Changing and reshaping
The group has undergone signiﬁ cant 
change since Alan Parker took over as 
Chief Executive in June 2004:
•  in July 2004 we acquired Premier 
Lodge for £505 million and a 
further 19 pub restaurant sites for 
£31.2 million. The lodges are now 
integrated in Premier Travel Inn and 
the pub restaurants in Brewers Fayre;
•  in March 2005 after the year-end, 
we announced the disposal of our 
franchised Marriott hotels business. 
Following the EGM on 22 April 
2005 we expect this transaction to 
complete on 5 May 2005;
•  with the appointment of 
Christopher Rogers as Finance 
Director on 1 May 2005 seven of 
Alan Parker’s direct reports will 
have changed.
The most immediate impact on the 
ﬁ nancial statements comes from the 
Premier Lodge acquisition and under 
each heading we have tried to identify 
the underlying eﬀ ect as well as the 
group total. The longer reaching impact 
will, of course, result from the changing 
management and the reshaping of the 
group following the Marriott disposal.
Year-end date
These accounts are drawn up to 
3 March 2005 and represent 52 weeks 
trading. This is ﬁ ve fewer days than last 
year but, consistent with our practice, 
comparisons are shown year-on-year.

FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
Accounting policies
Accounting policies adopted in preparing 
these accounts are consistent with the 
previous year.
Turnover
Group turnover grew by 7% year-on-year 
to £1,913 million. Of this, £80 million, 
representing year-on-year growth of 
4.5%, resulted from the acquisition of 
Premier Lodge. Underlying growth of 
2.5% was largely a function of like-for-
like sales growth, which averaged 2.6% 
across the brands. Acquisitions and 
disposals of individual sites broadly 
netted out.
Operating proﬁ t (before exceptionals)
Operating proﬁ t grew strongly by 11.9% 
year-on-year. Of this growth, £21 million, 
or 7 .2%, came from Premier Lodge.
The underlying growth of 5% reﬂ ects 
particularly strong growth from T ravel Inn 
(as was) and high street restaurants.
Proﬁ t margins increased from 14.8% 
to 15.5%.
Return on capital, based on year-end 
assets, reduced from 10.1% to 9.4%. 
However the proﬁ t and loss account 
contains only seven months’ trading 
for Premier Lodge although the assets 
are fully reﬂ ected in the balance sheet. 
Adjusting for this, return on capital grew 
from 10.1% to 10.5%.
Once again these improvements reﬂ ect 
the focus throughout the business on 
cost control and asset management.
Operating proﬁ t (after exceptionals)
Operating proﬁ t grew by 4.8%.
Tax
The charge of £81.6 million against 
proﬁ t before exceptionals represents 
a tax rate of 31% (2003/4: 32%). The 
factors aﬀ ecting the tax charge are 
explained in note 9 to the accounts but 
the principal reason for the reduction 
year-on-year is that previous year tax 
credits have been agreed and recognised 
in the accounts.
The exceptional tax credit of £9.1 million 
is the tax relief we expect to gain as a 
result of the exceptional charges.
Shareholder returns
Basic earnings per share (EPS) were 
59.56p while adjusted EPS were 64.08p, 
an increase of 10.1% year-on-year. 
Adjusted EPS exclude exceptional items 
and goodwill amortisation.
The total dividend for the year of 25.25p 
per share represents an increase of 
13.2%. In October the Board announced 
its intention to grow dividends faster 
than earnings per share. As a result the 
full year dividend is covered 2.4 times 
by proﬁ t before exceptionals. The ﬁ nal 
dividend of 18.35p per ordinary share 
(as at year-end) will be paid on 8 July 
2005 to all shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 6 May 2005. 
This will be the equivalent of 21.4p per 
New Ordinary Share following the share 
consolidation, approved at the EGM on 
22 April 2005.
The company’s share price opened the 
year at 740p and closed it at 889p. Net 
asset value per share increased over the 
year from 703p to 736p.
Exceptional items
Net exceptional costs before interest 
and tax amounted to £14.1 million. This 
amount is analysed in note 4 to the 
accounts. In essence there are four items.
We made a proﬁ t versus book value, on 
the disposal of 11 Courtyard by Marriott 
hotels and, in view of the transaction 
with Marriott announced on 14 March, 
have written down the remaining hotels.
We also considered it prudent to provide 
£10 million against four David Lloyd 
Leisure clubs that are not currently 
performing as well as we would like.
These writedowns are both non-cash items.
The £6.5 million one-oﬀ  costs in 
Premier Travel Inn represent the 
costs of integration.
The ﬁ nal item is the net result of 
the proﬁ ts and losses on individual 
restaurant property disposals during 
the year amounting to approximately 
£2 million proﬁ t.
Interest (before exceptionals)
The net interest charge rose from 
£52.2 million to £64.3 million; of this 
£17 .7 million relates to the borrowings 
the group took out to purchase and 
convert Premier Lodge and the 
19 adjacent pub restaurants.
Interest rates have risen year-on-year 
but the underlying cash generation of 
the business has enabled a reduction in 
the underlying interest charge.
Net interest was covered 5.1 times by 
operating proﬁ t but with Premier Lodge 
on a 12 month proforma basis the cover 
would fall to 4.5 times. PAGE 20 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5

Capital expenditure
£261 million was invested in property 
and plant compared with £230 million 
last year. This is in the range indicated 
12 months ago.
Of this amount £127 million (2003/4:
£96 million) related to the acquisition 
and development of new sites.
The current forecast is for capital 
expenditure in the range £250-275 
million for 2005/6. The majority of the 
expansionary capital will be directed to 
Premier Travel Inns, David Lloyd Leisure 
clubs and Brewers Fayres.
Cash ﬂ ow
Overall, the group had a net cash 
outﬂ ow, before use of liquid resources 
and ﬁ nancing, of £477 million after 
paying £554 million to acquire and 
develop Premier Lodge. Adjusting for 
acquisitions and disposals in both years 
the group had a net cash inﬂ ow of 
£12 million, after investing heavily in 
organic site growth, compared with 
£46 million last year.
Divisional free cash ﬂ ow (see table on 
page 21) rose from £268 million to 
£322 million.
Pensions
For the ﬁ nal time the charge in the proﬁ t 
and loss account is based on SSAP 24 
and the triennial valuation at 31 March 
2002 when the deﬁ cits on the funds 
amounted to £64 million.
Note 7 sets out in considerable detail the 
impact of moving to FRS17 on both the 
2003/4 and 2004/5 ﬁ nancial statements. 
The deﬁ cits in the pension funds on this 
basis have fallen to £242 million after 
allowing for deferred tax (£346 million 
gross) from the £256 million at the start 
of the year.
Financial position
Net debt at the year-end amounted 
to £1,264 million, a rise of £471 million 
during the year principally brought 
about by the acquisition cost of 
Premier Lodge. Balance sheet gearing 
was 57% at the year-end.
At the year-end committed facilities of 
£334 million were unused. Immediately 
following the year-end, and to facilitate 
the transaction with Marriott, the 
£275 million facility was cancelled and 
a new £200 million facility taken out.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the group has 
adequate resources to continue 
operating for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, the going concern 
basis continues to be adopted in 
preparing the accounts.
Financial risks and treasury policies
The main ﬁ nancial risks faced by the 
group relate to: the availability of funds 
to meet business needs; ﬂ uctuations in 
interest rates; and the risk of default by 
a counterparty in a ﬁ nancial transaction.
The Treasury Committee, which is 
chaired by the Finance Director, reviews 
and monitors the treasury function. The 
undertaking of ﬁ nancial transactions of 
a speculative nature is not permitted.
The group ﬁ nances its operations 
by a combination of internally 
generated cash ﬂ ow, bank borrowings 
and long-term debt market issues. 
The group seeks to achieve a spread 
in the maturity of its debts.
Interest rate swaps and interest rate 
caps are used to achieve the desired 
mix of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate debt. The 
group’s policy is to ﬁ x or cap a proportion 
of projected net interest costs over the 
next ﬁ ve years. This policy reduces the 
group’s exposure to the consequences 
of interest rate ﬂ uctuations.
Interest rate risk management
At the year-end, £423 million (33%) 
of group net debt was ﬁ xed for a 
weighted average of 6.6 years using 
ﬁ xed rate borrowings and interest rate 
swaps. The average rate of interest on 
this ﬁ xed rate sterling debt was 6.8%.
Based on the group’s net debt position 
at the year end, a 1% change in 
interest rates would aﬀ ect costs by 
approximately £8 million or around 
2.5% of the 2004/5 operating proﬁ t 
before exceptionals. PAGE 21
FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REVIEW
Foreign currency risk management
At the year end, foreign currency 
borrowings amounted to £84 million. 
These borrowings provide a partial 
hedge against overseas investments.
Transaction exposures resulting  
from purchases in foreign currencies  
are normally hedged by forward  
foreign currency transactions and 
currency options.
Britannia Soft Drinks
In March 2004, we announced that the 
existing shareholders in Britannia Soft 
Drinks Limited (BSD) had signed an 
agreement with PepsiCo, which creates 
an opportunity to undertake an initial 
public oﬀering (IPO) of BSD. In conjunction 
with the other shareholders we will 
determine the best time to realise this 
opportunity. Whitbread has a 23.75% 
shareholding in BSD.
Post Balance Sheet event
On 14 March 2005 we announced the 
intention to dispose of the whole of our 
interest in our Marriott hotels business, 
principally by way of a disposal of the 
hotel properties to a Joint Venture 
(jointly owned with Marriott) and the 
transfer of the hotel management 
to Marriott UK. The detail of this 
transaction was set out in a circular  
to shareholders dated 5 April 2005.  
The transaction was approved at the 
EGM on 22 April 2005.
Also approved at that meeting was a 
special dividend of 135p per share and 
a consolidation of shares on a 6 for 7 
basis. The special dividend will be paid 
on 20 May 2005 and the consolidation 
will become eﬀective from 16 May 2005.
On 25 April 2005 the group announced 
that it has signed a conditional 
agreement to dispose of its German 
restaurant business. The total cash 
proceeds, including a repatriation  
of capital prior to the sale, will be  
€35.6 million, slightly in excess of book 
value. This transaction is expected to 
complete in May 2005.

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Whitbread is required to adopt IFRS for ﬁnancial reporting from 2005 onwards. 
The group’s ﬁrst results reported under IFRS will be the interim results for 2005/6. 
Prior to this, we will publish a set of comparable ﬁgures on an IFRS basis.
We set out below the principal areas for 2004/5 that will be aﬀected by the  
adoption of IFRS compared with UK GAAP , based on IFRS expected to be in force  
at 2 March 2006. These standards are subject to review and endorsement by the  
EU and interpretative guidance by the IASB and are therefore subject to change.

Corporate responsibility
The Whitbread way
Emma Stones, the winner of the 
Environment category of Whitbread’s 
Young Achiever Awards in 2004. Emma 
played a central role on the committee 
which undertook the regeneration of 
her local park in Stockport, including 
the creation of a children’s play area. 
For details of Emma’s project see the 
corporate responsibility section of the 
company’s website. www.whitbread.co.uk PAGE 23
Whitbread has built a strong reputation 
as a good corporate citizen over many years 
and is committed to taking its corporate 
responsibilities seriously, not only because 
it makes sound business sense but because 
the company also believes it has a clear 
responsibility to do so.
On my appointment to the Whitbread 
Board as Human Resources Director in 
May 2004 I also became responsible for 
Whitbread’s Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) programmes.
During 2004/5 we undertook a major 
review of the way in which our CR 
commitments are managed. A dedicated 
team was established to provide a 
platform for better coordination of 
energies and resources across the group.
We believe that corporate responsibility 
is about:
Marketplace: being the customers’ ﬁ rst 
choice for hospitality and a favoured 
partner for suppliers; 
Environment: being committed to 
exploring new ways of reducing 
environmental impact;
Workplace: creating attractive and 
safe places to work and conditions that 
help the company become ‘Employer of 
Choice’;
Community: building strong and 
mutually beneﬁ cial partnerships with 
communities.
The activities in the four areas are 
underpinned by the principles of the 
Whitbread Way – the way that we do 
things at Whitbread – as outlined by 
Alan Parker .
To reﬂ ect the four key areas the CR team 
works with four business-based steering 
groups, each sponsored by a member of 
the Executive Council.
I am proud of Whitbread’s corporate 
responsibility record, and particularly 
of the progress that has been made

Food and drink safety
Whitbread operates an integrated 
‘ﬁ eld to fork’ strategy, underpinned by 
inspections and independent audits. 
In addition, as a signatory to the 
Portman Group’s Code of Practice,

Ensuring accessibility 
Whitbread has invested over 
£10 million in property development 
and improvements in recent years with 
the aim that the company’s properties 
continue to meet or exceed legislative 
requirements. Whitbread strives, 
wherever practical, to ensure that 
customers with disabilities are given 
the same level of service as any other 
customer. Recent improvements include 
extra height tables to allow wheelchair

audio induction loops to increase the 
eﬀ ectiveness of hearing aids for the hard 
of hearing. 
Responding to customers
Whitbread is committed to providing 
great customer service and invests 
extensively both in the appropriate training 
and development of its people and in 
monitoring and responding to customer 
feedback. Across the group, customer 
feedback questionnaires and helplines 
are in place. Research is conducted on a 
regular basis, which provides independent 
measures of the company’s success in 
delivering high standards.
Premier Travel Inn operates a 100% 
satisfaction guarantee. In 2004 the 
business won the Customer Service 
Strategy of the Year award at the 
National Business Awards. 
Partnership with suppliers
Whitbread’s approach is to work in 
close partnership with its suppliers to 
assist them in developing products and 
processes that continue to help both 
partners meet their various objectives 
and to ensure long-term relationships 
and continuity of supply. 
Whitbread is committed to an ethical 
way of operating and sets out clear 
standards of behaviour in its Code of 
Business Ethics. 
Working in conjunction with CaféDirect, 
the UK’s leading Fairtrade company, 
Costa oﬀ ers its customers a Fairtrade

guarantee the growers a better deal 
through a fair price and better working 
conditions.
Environment
Better management of the company’s 
environmental impact in recent 
years has reduced business costs and 
improved environmental performance. 
Whitbread’s aim is to continue the 
current approach of cost reduction-
led initiatives, with consequent 
environmental gains, and at the 
same time increase awareness of 
environmental issues in the business.
Infrastructure improvements
During 2004, Whitbread established a 
single, dedicated group-wide Energy and 
Waste Management team. The team is 
responsible for improved management, 
monitoring and reporting of Whitbread’s 
energy and water usage, along with 
waste and recycling practices.

environmental performance. 
usage were down across the group in 
2004/5, by 5.8% (4.5 million kwh) and 
1% (4.8 million kwh) respectively. This 
produced a reduction in CO
2 emissions 
of 10,600 tonnes. 
For the ﬁrst time, the group has 
been able to quantify overall water 
consumption. Through improved leak 
detection and repair, water saving 
measures and the introduction of 
new technologies we expect to report 
reductions going forward. During 
the year leak repair projects in pub 
restaurants reduced water consumption 
by 87 ,000 cubic metres.
The company has reduced CO
2 emissions 
by a further 750 tonnes through improved 
efﬁciencies in our owned and managed 
car ﬂeet. In addition, the latest trucks 
purchased are powered by a mixture of 
diesel and natural gas, which is Euro 4 
certiﬁed – the latest and most stringent 
European requirement for reducing 
exhaust emissions.
Recycling increased 
As a major provider of food and beverages, 
Whitbread both receives and makes 
deliveries throughout the UK which 
require careful packaging. As a result, the 
company’s greatest recycling opportunities 
are in glass bottles and cardboard where 
it has been making signiﬁcant progress 
in recent years. In 2004/5 Whitbread 
recycled 1,440 tonnes of cardboard,  
up by 116%, and 3,100 tonnes of glass, 
up by 34%. The company recognises 
there is more work to do in expanding 
this area. Recycling will be a continued 
focus in the year ahead.  
Workplace
At Whitbread, there is clear recognition 
of the need to recruit and retain high 
calibre people for the company to live up 
to its customer proposition of service and 
product excellence. A great deal has been 
done over many years both to create 
attractive, rewarding places to work and 
the conditions that will help Whitbread 
become the Employer of Choice. 
Whitbread employs more than 40,000 
people, mainly in the UK, and has a 
range of policies covering such issues as 
diversity, employee wellbeing and equal 
opportunities. The company targets and 
measures employee turnover, stability 
and retention rates in each brand. 
Employee involvement
Whitbread is committed to listening to 
and involving its employees and believes 
that open and regular two-way 
communication at all levels is an essential 
part of the management process. 
All employees are asked their opinions 
via a Views survey and speciﬁc plans are 
put in place to address feedback from 
these surveys. 
Employees also have opportunities  
to express their views and receive 
information about the company at 
regular meetings with management,  
through elected representatives at 
‘Business Improvement Groups’. 
Employee Share Scheme
Nearly 1,500 Whitbread employees 
were in a position to beneﬁt from the 
company’s employee share scheme in 
2004/5. Those who joined the scheme, 
which matured in February, received a 
collective reward of circa £2.6 million.
In November 2004, 3,506 employees 
were granted options over 1,149,817 
shares at 653p under the terms of the 
Savings-related Share Option Scheme. 
At 19 April 2005 nearly 5,500 employees 
held options over more than 3.6 million 
shares under that scheme.

Focus on training
At Whitbread, great emphasis is placed 
on improving the skills, expertise and 
performance of employees through  
a continuing programme of training 
and development. In 2004/5, the 
company’s new e-learning training 
programmes won two of the top awards 
at the Institute of IT Training Awards. 
The programmes have so far delivered 
web-based training at both brand and 
corporate level to more than 25,000 staﬀ.
During the year Whitbread expanded 
its award-winning Chef Modern 
Apprenticeship Programme to embrace 
additional career opportunities at outlet 
level, including waiters/waitresses, bar

Support to volunteering
Whitbread is keen to support and 
encourage volunteering as a means of 
both encouraging personal fulﬁlment 
and development, and in recognition of 
the important contribution volunteering 
can make to employee moral and 
motivation. The company’s Employee 
Volunteer of the Year awards, set up 
in 2003, publicly recognise and reward 
outstanding contributions. 
Payroll giving
Whitbread operates a matched funding 
and a payroll-giving scheme for its 
employees. Originally set up in 1997 , the 
payroll-giving scheme was re-launched 
in July 2004. Over 6,300 employees now 
participate with annual donations set to 
reach around £500,000 in 2005. 
Health and safety
Whitbread is committed to providing a 
safe and secure environment for both its 
customers and its employees. To support 
and demonstrate this commitment:
•  health and safety is one of the key 
measures on the company’s WINcard;
•  the Chief Executive is the director 
responsible for ensuring that  
health and safety issues are 
addressed;
•  brand managing directors are 
personally committed to providing  
a strategy for embedding  
health and safety throughout  
their business;
•   each brand has a health and safety 
management plan that is reviewed 
quarterly;
•  quarterly health and safety 
performance reports are presented  
to the Board for review.

The importance of health and safety to 
Whitbread is evidenced by its inclusion 
on the company’s WINcard. This means 
that health and safety is one of the key 
measures used to determine employees’ 
incentive payments.

Community
Whitbread has a long history of working 
with its community partners. The company’s 
community investment programme 
focuses on ‘helping young people 
achieve their potential’ by concentrating 
on a few carefully chosen projects that 
combine beneﬁt to the community with 
advantages to the business.

established a number of successful 
partnerships with young people’s 
charities and organisations. Major 
current programmes include:
Whitbread Young Achiever Awards,  
a joint venture with the Home Ofﬁce’s

Who is on the company’s 
Board of directors?
The Board currently consists of the 
Chairman, four executive directors and 
ﬁ ve independent non-executive directors, 
one of whom has been appointed Senior 
Independent Director. Proﬁ les of each 
director can be found on pages 34 to 35.
How did the company arrive at the 
conclusion that ﬁ ve of its directors 
are independent?
The Combined Code lists a number of 
circumstances which might call the 
independence of a director into question. 
No such circumstances exist for Rod 
Kent, Charles Gurassa, Lord Williamson 
or David Turner. However, Prue Leith has 
now served as a director of the company 
for more than nine years. Despite 
this the Board, having considered the 
Corporate governance
Managing responsibly
Simon Barratt
Company Secretary
nature of the contribution made by 
Prue, has determined that she remains 
independent. Prue will be stepping 
down at the 2005 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM).
What are the terms of appointment 
for independent non-executive 
directors?
Independent non-executive directors 
are initially appointed for a three-year  
term. Although in certain circumstances 
a longer term may be deemed 
appropriate, the Board has agreed a 
guideline that they should normally be 
expected to serve two three-year terms. 
Both Prue Leith and Lord Williamson 
have now served in excess of this 
guideline and will be stepping down 
at the 2005 AGM.
During the year the company’s letter of 
appointment for non-executive directors 
was reviewed and updated to take 
account of the new Combined Code. 
All new independent non-executive 
directors will sign the new letter on 
appointment.
How is the structure and 
membership of the Board 
determined?
Ultimately the company’s shareholders 
determine Board membership at the 
AGM. All new directors are required to 
stand for election at the AGM following 
their appointment and existing directors 
must stand for re-election at least every 
three years.
The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the structure 
and membership of the Board, making 
recommendations to the Board, which 
are subsequently considered and voted 
on by shareholders. PAGE 29
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Is there clarity between the roles of 
the Chairman and Chief Executive?
There is a clear division of responsibility 
between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive. This division is in writing 
as follows:
The Chairman is responsible for:
•  running the Board and setting its 
agenda including major decisions on 
strategy, ﬁ nancial transactions and 
key appointments; 
•  ensuring, through the Company 
Secretary, that the members of the 
Board receive accurate, timely and 
clear information and that there is 
a good ﬂ ow of information;
•  managing the Board to ensure 
that sufﬁ cient time is allowed 
for the discussion of complex 
or contentious issues;
•  ensuring that the directors 
continually update their knowledge 
and capabilities;
•  ensuring that the members of the 
Board develop an understanding of 
the views of the major investors;
•  the annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Board and its 
committees.
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
•  setting the strategic direction for 
the company;
•  overseeing the day-to-day 
management of the company;
•  the line management of senior 
executives, including the other 
executive directors of Whitbread PLC 
and the Company Secretary;
The Board is of the opinion that it is of 
an appropriate size for the requirements 
of the business, it has the appropriate 
balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience and that it has a good 
balance between executive and 
independent non-executive directors.
How does the Board operate and 
what are its key responsibilities?
•  The Board met 13 times last year. 
Before each Board meeting directors 
are given timely and appropriate 
information, including monthly 
ﬁ nancial and trading reports. The 
attendance records of individual 
directors can be found in the table 
on page 31;
•  all members of the Board take 
collective responsibility for the 
performance of the company and 
all decisions are taken objectively 
in the interests of the company;
•  a schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board includes the oversight 
of key aspects of strategy and 
management, ﬁ nancial reporting 
and controls, the management of 
shareholder communication, as well 
as the approval of policies and major 
transactions. The schedule can be 
seen in full on the company’s website: 
www.whitbread.co.uk;
•  the Board oversees and approves 
the company’s overall strategy and 
ensures that the necessary resources 
are in place in order to meet the 
company’s objectives;
•  the Board has responsibility for 
ensuring that the company’s 
obligations to its shareholders are met.
The company is proud of its commitment to 
high standards of corporate governance. For 
the ﬁ rst time Whitbread is required to make 
a statement on its compliance with the new 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance. In 
this report Company Secretary, Simon Barratt, 
explains the way in which the main and 
supporting principles of the Code are being 
applied on a day-to-day basis.
Angie Risley – 
the induction of a new director
Angie Risley was appointed to the 
Board on 1 May 2004. Angie had 
been with Whitbread since 1989 
so, unlike a director appointed from 
outside the company, there was no 
need to include any familiarisation 
with Whitbread in her induction. 
As the individual responsible for 
the induction of new directors, 
the Company Secretary discussed 
Angie’s requirements with her. 
As a result a tailored one-on-one 
session was arranged with 
Slaughter and May, the company’s 
legal advisers, to cover the duties 
and responsibilities of a PLC director. 
In addition, Angie has attended 
a training seminar on directors’ 
responsibilities organised by the 
Institute of Directors and a strategy 
and ﬁ nance course at Ashridge. PAGE 30 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5
•  the activities of the Leadership Group 
– a group of approximately 90 of the 
company’s most senior executives;
•  ensuring eﬀ ective communication 
with shareholders and employees.
How is the Board’s 
performance evaluated?
The performance of the Board, and 
individual directors’ contributions to the 
Board, are appraised annually by the 
Chairman. This year:
•  the Chairman asked each director to 
complete a formal questionnaire on 
the Board’s performance;
•  the Chairman met or spoke to each 
director on a one-to-one basis;
•  the results of the review were 
discussed by the Board and an 
appropriate action plan was agreed.
Last year the executive directors went 
through a formal evaluation process, 
undertaken by an external organisation.
The performance of the Board’s 
committees was reviewed during the 
year in line with their terms of reference.
The performance of the Chairman was 
evaluated during the year by Rod Kent, 
the Senior Independent Director, who 
discussed the Chairman’s performance 
with each of the directors. The results 
of the review were given directly to the 
Chairman by Rod Kent.
How does the company ensure 
that new directors are given 
the tools to do an eﬀ ective job?
The Company Secretary is responsible 
for ensuring that, on appointment, 
new directors are given a formal and 
individually tailored induction. In the 
case of newly appointed non-executive 
directors this would typically include a 
number of visits to the company’s 
brands to enable a thorough 
understanding of the businesses. New 
directors are available to meet major 
shareholders if requested.
Do the directors have access 
to independent advice?
All directors have access to independent 
professional advice at the company’s 
expense. In addition, directors have 
access to the Company Secretary.
Do the directors update 
their knowledge and skills 
on a regular basis?
The Board receives a quarterly investor 
relations report which includes share 
price performance, movements in 
institutional holdings and the response 
by institutions to the communications 
programme. In addition, a representative 
of one of the company’s brokers attends 
a number of Board meetings each year 
to update the Board on the latest issues.
During the year directors attended 
training courses and seminars, or 
received tailored training, on the 
following subjects:
•  International Financial Reporting 
Standards;
•  operating and ﬁ nancial review;
•  director’s duties and liabilities;
•  board and committee eﬀ ectiveness;
•  corporate governance;
•  executive remuneration;
•  whistle-blowing and the audit 
committee;
•  health and safety;
•  pensions.
How do the Board interact 
with the company’s shareholders?
The company recognises the importance 
of dialogue with both institutional and 
private shareholders. 
Institutional shareholders, fund 
managers and analysts are briefed at 
regular meetings and presentations. 
In 2004/5 over 100 meetings were 
held with institutional shareholders, 
either one-to-one or as part of a larger 
grouping, both in the UK and abroad. 
The Chief Executive, Finance Director, 
investor relations team and the brand 
managing directors all play an active 
part in these meetings. Non-executive 
directors are oﬀ ered the opportunity to 
attend the meetings and would attend 
if required by major shareholders. The 
Senior Independent Director attended 
meetings with a range of major 
shareholders to listen to their views. 
Recent topics of interest to investors 
have been the acquisition of Premier 
Lodge, the business review and the 
return of capital to shareholders. 
Annual and interim results presentations 
are webcast live so that all shareholders 
can receive the same information at 
the same time. The company’s website 
provides comprehensive information for 
private shareholders and receives over 
half a million hits a year. 
Private shareholders have the 
opportunity to put questions to the 
Board at the AGM, and at all other times 
by emailing or writing to the company. 
In addition, a meeting was held with 
members of the UK Shareholders’ 
Association during the year. PAGE 31

company. The Company Secretary can 
facilitate any such communication if 
requested. 
Where can I ﬁ nd details 
of the company’s compliance 
with the Combined Code 
in relation to remuneration?
Details of how Whitbread has applied 
the main and supporting principles of 
the new Combined Code with regard 
to remuneration can be found in the 
remuneration report on pages 38 to 
48. In addition, the table on page 32 
contains details of the membership, 
terms of reference and activities of the 
Remuneration Committee.
What board committees 
does the company have?
The table on page 32 contains 
information relating to the Audit 
Committee, the Nomination Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee.
In addition to these three committees 
the Board has delegated authority to 
the General Purposes Committee to deal 
with business of a routine nature and 
with other speciﬁ c matters delegated to 
it by the Board. The committee is made 
up of at least two directors designated 
by the Board and meets as required.
What is the company’s ﬁ nancial 
reporting policy?
The Board always strives to present 
a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the company’s position 
and prospects. This involves formal 
reports such as this, other price sensitive 
public reports, reports to regulators and 
any other information required by statute. 
Does the company maintain 
adequate systems of internal 
control?
The Board is responsible for the group’s 
systems of internal control and for 
reviewing their eﬀ ectiveness. These 
are systems designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives. They 
can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board has established an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the group’s signiﬁ cant risks. 
This process was in place throughout the 
2004/5 ﬁ nancial year and up to the date 
of this report. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords with 
the internal control guidance (Turnbull) 
for directors in the Combined Code.
Key elements of the company’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems include:
•  the formulation, evaluation and 
annual approval by the Board of 
business plans and budgets. Actual 
results are reported monthly against 
budget and the previous year’s 
ﬁ gures. Key risks are identiﬁ ed and 
action plans prepared accordingly;
The following groups also meet:
•  the Main Board Committee 
comprises the executive directors 
together with the Company 
Secretary, Simon Barratt, and meets 
twice a month in preparation for 
Board meetings;
•  the Executive Council meets 
monthly to review group / brand 
performances. It is attended by the 
executive directors, the managing 
directors of each brand and each of 
the head ofﬁ ce functional directors;
•  the Growth Committee comprises the 
Chief Executive, the Finance Director, 
the Group Development Director, 
the Company Secretary and brand 
managing directors as appropriate 
to identify and implement growth 
opportunities.
How does the company seek to 
ensure that its employees behave 
with honesty and integrity?
The company takes the view that 
corporate governance is not a matter for 
the Board or its committees alone and 
has developed a Code of Business Ethics, 
which is briefed annually to employees. 
This covers dealings with customers, 
suppliers and government ofﬁ cials; 
safeguarding the company’s assets; 
keeping accurate and reliable records; 
and avoiding conﬂ icts of interest. Its 
principal message is that all employees 
must observe a code of conduct based 
on honesty, integrity and fair dealing. 
In addition, the company has a formal 
whistle-blowing policy. Under the 
policy employees are able to speak to 
an independent organisation and any 
signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial or control issues 
would then be brought to the attention 
of the Chief Executive and Company 
Secretary and reported to the Audit 
Committee. PAGE 32 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5

Summary of key 
issues dealt with 
during the year
The committee’s main focus 
during the year was on:
•  group and brand internal 
controls;
•  approval of ﬁnancial 
statements for the full  
and half year;
•  review of the eﬀectiveness 
of the internal and external 
audit functions;
•  introduction of IFRS;  
•  auditors’ independence;
•  operational audit plans  
and outcome of reviews.
During the year the 
committee’s main area of 
activity was Board succession. 
This included the selection of:
•  Anthony Habgood as the  
new Chairman;
•  Christopher Rogers as the 
new Finance Director.
In proposing these 
appointments the committee, 
or sub-committee, produced 
job speciﬁcations, appointed 
advisers and carried out 
interviews. Following this 
process ﬁnal recommendations 
were made to the Board.
In addition, the committee 
has given consideration to 
the future appointment of 
independent non-executive 
directors.
During the year the committee 
dealt with:
•  the implications of the 
Pensions Act 2004;
•  the introduction of the 
Leadership Group Incentive 
Scheme;
•  remuneration packages for 
newly appointed members  
of the Executive Council;
•  remuneration of the  
executive directors.
The full terms of reference of all three committees can be found on the company’s website and are also available by requesting a copy in writing  
from the Company Secretary.  PAGE 33
•  the production by each business 
of an annual risks and controls 
matrix, covering major risks and 
plans to mitigate those risks. These 
matrices are considered by the Audit 
Committee;
•  a regular review by the Board of •  a regular review by the Board of •  a regular review
changes in the major risks facing 
the group and development of the 
appropriate action plans;
•  the Treasury Committee, which 
reviews treasury activities monthly. 
The committee is chaired by the 
Finance Director. Treasury activities 
are conducted in accordance with 
detailed procedures and mandates;
•  the consideration of risks and the 
appropriate action plans, when 
appraising and approving all 
major capital and revenue projects 
and change programmes. A post 
completion review of each major 
project is undertaken;
•  ﬁ nancial policies, controls and 
procedures manuals, which are 
regularly reviewed and updated;
•  the limits of authority, which are limits of authority, which are limits of authority
prescribed for employees. Whitbread’s 
organisational structure allows the 
appropriate segregation of tasks;
•  the Code of Business Ethics, which 
is communicated annually to 
employees and details of which can 
be found on page 31;
•  the operational audit function, 
which reports on the eﬀ ectiveness 
of operational and ﬁ nancial controls 
across the group;
•  the Audit Committee regularly reviews 
the major ﬁ ndings from both internal 
and external audit. Further details 
can be found in the table on page 32.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board has carried out a speciﬁ c 
assessment of the group’s systems of 
internal control for the purpose of this 
annual report. The Audit Committee has 
assisted the Board in discharging these 
responsibilities.
Do the members of the Audit 
Committee have recent and relevant 
ﬁ nancial experience?
The Board considers that the 
membership of the Audit Committee 
as a whole has sufﬁ cient recent 
and relevant ﬁ nancial experience to 
discharge its functions, but it has 
determined not to identify any single 
member as having such experience.
Has the company formally 
reviewed its corporate governance 
performance during the year?
The Company Secretary produced a 
review of the company’s corporate 
governance procedures, which was 
considered by the Board in December 
2004. The aim of the review was to 
consider whether the company was in 
compliance with the new Combined 
Code. The Board agreed that the 
company was in compliance with the 
Code at the date of the review. It is 
intended that the company will be in a 
position to report full compliance with 
the Combined Code for 2005/6.
Has the company complied 
throughout the year with the 
provisions of the Combined Code?
The company has complied throughout 
the year with the provisions set out in 
Section 1 of the Combined Code with 
the following exceptions: 
•  at the beginning of the ﬁ nancial year 
the executive directors’ contracts 
contained notice periods in excess of 
one year. All of the executive directors 
agreed to reduce the notice periods 
in their contracts to twelve months 
in May 2004. The company is now 
therefore in compliance with the 
Combined Code in this regard (B1.6);
•  for the period between 1 May 2004 
and 15 June 2004 the balance of 
the Board was such that more than 
half of the directors (excluding the 
Chairman) were not independent. 
This followed the appointment of 
Angie Risley as a director. However, 
David Thomas and Bill Shannon 
stepped down from the Board at the 
AGM in 2004. Since this time more 
than 50% of the Board (excluding the 
Chairman) has been independent 
(A3.2).

Throughout the year, the authorised

each. However at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting on 22 April 2005,

Supplier payment policy 
The group keeps to the payment terms 
which have been agreed with suppliers. 
Where payment terms have not been 
speciﬁcally agreed, it is the group’s 
policy to settle invoices close to the end 
of the month following the month of 
invoicing. The group’s ability to keep to 
these terms is dependent upon suppliers 
sending accurate and adequately 
detailed invoices to the correct address 
on a timely basis. The group had 37 days 
purchases outstanding at 3 March 2005, 
based on the trade creditors outstanding 
at that date and purchases made during 
the year.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed  
their willingness to continue in ofﬁce  
as auditors of the company and a 
resolution proposing their re-appointment 
will be put to shareholders at the AGM. 
After proper consideration, the Audit 
Committee is satisﬁed that the 
company’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , 
continue to be objective and independent 
of the company. In coming to this 
conclusion the Audit Committee gave 
full consideration to the non-audit work 
carried out by Ernst & Young LLP .
The Audit Committee has considered 
what work should not be carried out 
by the external auditors and have 
concluded that certain services including 
internal audit, acquisition due diligence 
and IT consulting services will not be 
carried out by Ernst & Young LLP .
Purchase of own shares
The company is authorised to purchase, 
in the market, the company’s own 
shares. Although no such purchases 
have been made during the year, 
approval to renew this authority for 
a further year will be sought from 
shareholders at the 2005 AGM.
Annual General Meeting 
The AGM will be held at 2.00pm on  
14 June 2005 at The Queen Elizabeth II 
Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, 
Westminster, London SW1P 3EE. The 
Notice of Meeting is enclosed with this 
report and is accompanied by a letter 
from the Chairman.
The directors are taking the opportunity 
to amend the Articles of Association of 
the company at this year’s AGM. The 
Articles were last amended in June 2001. 
The amendments reﬂect current 
legislation and practice. Full details of 
the main amendments are contained in 
the explanatory notes to the Notice of 
the AGM.

Directors’ report PAGE 38 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5
Remuneration report
Introduction
Whitbread’s continued success is 
dependent on the skills and enthusiasm 
of the people who work in our businesses. 
This report focuses on directors’ 
remuneration, but the principles 
which form the basis of the company’s 
remuneration policy apply to all the 
managers of Whitbread’s businesses.
In 2004 we introduced the Whitbread 
Leadership Group Incentive Scheme, 
which was successfully implemented 
during the year. This is described in more 
detail in this report. I am pleased to 
report that the scheme has been well 
received by its participants. 
In view of the proposed changes by 
the Treasury to pensions legislation 
we are reviewing the status of senior 
management pensions to ensure that 
there will be appropriate choices for 
our executives going forward at no 
additional cost to the company. 
By ensuring that our employees are 
fairly and appropriately incentivised 
and rewarded we believe that they will 
continue to deliver outstanding service 
to our customers and value to our 
shareholders.
The committee has appointed New 
Bridge Street Consultants LLP and 
Towers Perrin, who are independent 
remuneration consultants, to provide 
specialist advice. They provide no other 
types of service to the Whitbread group. 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , 
together with Slaughter and May, advise 
the company on the implementation of 
the committee’s policy decisions.
The committee receives internal advice 
from Sir John Banham, Chairman of 
Whitbread, and Angie Risley, Human 
Resources Director. The secretary to  
the committee is Simon Barratt.  
Where appropriate, the committee also  
receives input from the Chief Executive,  
Finance Director and Pensions Director.
This report of the Remuneration Committee, which has been approved by the Board, states  
Whitbread’s remuneration policy and details the remuneration of the directors for 2004/5.  
This remuneration report will be the subject of a shareholder resolution to be proposed at the AGM.
Charles Gurassa 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Part 3 of Schedule 7a of the Companies 
Act 1985 requires that certain parts of 
the remuneration report are audited. 
Throughout this report those sections that 
have been audited are marked clearly as

Remuneration Committee  
and its advisers
The committee recommends to the 
Board the speciﬁc remuneration 
packages for the Chairman, the 
executive directors and other members 
of the Executive Council. In addition 
it reviews the remuneration structure 
for all other senior executives. During 
2004/5 the committee met nine times;  
details of the directors’ attendance 
can be found on page 31. All of its 
recommendations to the Board  
were accepted.
The terms of reference of the committee

Performance graph
The graph on the right shows the 
percentage change in total shareholder 
return (TSR) (with dividends reinvested) 
in the holdings of the company’s shares 
against a hypothetical holding of shares 
in the FTSE Leisure and Hotels Sector 
Index over a ﬁve year period.
The FTSE Leisure and Hotels Sector Index 
has been chosen because it represents 
an appropriate market index in which 
the company is a constituent member.
Remuneration Policy
The company’s policy for directors’ 
remuneration for 2005/6 and subsequent 
ﬁnancial years is that the overall 
package will be sufﬁciently competitive 
to attract, retain and motivate 
high calibre executives. They will be 
expected to have the skills, expertise 
and enthusiasm to achieve the group’s 
objectives and to enhance shareholder 
value. Such remuneration packages 
will reﬂect their personal contribution 
and the company’s overall success. The 
committee recognises the importance 
of having a signiﬁcant proportion of 
an executive’s remuneration being 
linked to performance. Further, in order 
to promote retention and sustained 
corporate performance, the balance 
between short-term and long-term 
rewards is important.
The following comprised the 
components of the remuneration  
of executive directors:
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually 
against similar positions within UK 
leisure, hotel and retail companies of  
a similar market proﬁle and against a 
pan-sectoral group of companies with  
a similar capitalisation and turnover to 
the business for which the director is 
responsible. Before awarding any base 
salary increase to directors, careful 
consideration is given to trading 
circumstances across the whole group 
and to average salary increases for 
Whitbread employees as a whole.  
The policy is to pay appropriate market 
rates but the Remuneration Committee 
acknowledges that ﬂexibility is required 
in order to recruit and retain key executives.
Beneﬁts
Life assurance and private health  
cover are core beneﬁts provided to  
all executives. Non-core beneﬁts, for 
which cash alternatives are available,  
are family health cover and a fully 
expensed company car. Limited 
discounts on company products  
are also provided in line with those  
given to all Whitbread employees.
Pensions
During 2004/5 all of the executive 
directors were entitled to a pension 
from the Whitbread Group Pension 
Fund, which is a deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
scheme. A summary of this scheme is 
given on page 43 below the pension 
entitlements table.
The ﬁnal salary section of this pension 
scheme was closed to new entrants, 
including directors on 31 December 
2001. All new recruits after that date 
are oﬀered participation in the deﬁned 
contribution section of the scheme. 
For executive directors, the ﬁrst being 
Christopher Rogers, the company will 
contribute at the rate of 25% of the 
director’s base salary.
In response to the Treasury’s proposals to 
reform pension provision in April 2006, 
the Remuneration Committee is in the 
process of reviewing its policy on future 
pension provision. A full explanation 
of its conclusions will be given in next 
year’s report, but the principles that have 
been the foundation for this review are:
•  the company will not be meeting any 
increased tax burden of the executives 
arising as a result of these reforms;
•  no advance payments will be 
made to pension funds prior to the 
introduction of these reforms;
•  a limited number of choices will be 
oﬀered to executives on how they 
wish to provide for their retirement. 
These choices will be oﬀered to all 
executives;
•  any change in arrangements will be 
at worst cost-neutral for Whitbread;
•  where possible, Whitbread should 
mitigate its balance sheet risk on 
existing pension obligations and 
limit its exposure on any future 
commitments.

Whitbread Leadership Group 
Incentive Scheme
The Whitbread Leadership Group 
Incentive Scheme was implemented 
during 2004/5.
The policy objectives of this scheme are:
•  to provide a clear link between 
performance and reward, in order to 
motivate key executives;
•  to place a greater emphasis on equity 
rewards promoting alignment with 
shareholders’ interests;
•  to promote retention by deferring a 
signiﬁcant part of the rewards.
The Whitbread Leadership Group 
Incentive Scheme applies to 
approximately 90 executives. This 
reﬂects the Remuneration Committee’s 
desire to have a coherent and universal 
remuneration structure. Clearly, the 
levels of rewards are graduated to reﬂect 
levels of responsibility. 
Structure
Three types of awards can be made 
under the scheme following the end 
of the ﬁnancial year, all of which are 
performance related. These are:
•  a cash bonus that is immediately 
payable;
•  an award over Whitbread shares 
known as deferred equity, which will 
normally vest three years later provided 
that the executive remains employed 
by the Whitbread Group; 
•  an award over Whitbread shares 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP), which will under normal 
circumstances vest three years after 
the date of grant provided that the 
individual remains an employee and  
a TSR performance target (described 
in more detail below) is satisﬁed. 
Levels of award
The normal levels of cash bonus, 
deferred equity and LTIP awards payable 
under the Plan to executive directors at 
diﬀerent levels of performance are:
Below 
threshold
Nil

10% cash 
20% deferred equity

Stretch*
55% cash 
100% deferred equity 
125% LTIP award
*  the bonus amounts shown are the 
maximum amounts, even where the 
performance exceeds stretch.
The percentages in the table are 
expressed as a percentage of the base 
salaries. A straight-line will operate 
between the above levels  
of performance.
Threshold will be the minimum target  
at which rewards will be earned. 
Targeted level of performance will be 
consistent with budgeted performance, 
and stretch will be signiﬁcantly beyond 
budget.
In addition, a maximum of 20% of salary 
cash bonus will be payable for meeting 
personal objectives. In 2005/6 the 
objectives will be based on the WINcard 
(see page 9 for details) with the 
measures being like-for-like sales growth, 
proﬁt growth, brand standards, guest 
recommendations, employee retention 
and health and safety. These personal 
objectives apply to all management 
throughout the company, as well as the 
executive directors. The targets are set 
at the beginning of each ﬁnancial year 
and, for directors, reviewed and 
approved by the Remuneration 
Committee after the year-end.
Performance conditions
The performance condition for the 
annual cash and deferred equity payable 
under the Leadership Group Incentive 
Scheme is economic proﬁt. Economic 
proﬁt is operating proﬁt less a cost of 
capital charge.
Each year the Board sets a series  
of economic proﬁt targets for the group 
and for each brand within the group. 
For executive directors with group-wide 
responsibility, the economic proﬁt target 
will relate to the group as a whole. For 
directors with divisional responsibility,  
a minimum of 20% of their rewards  
will be based on a group economic proﬁt 
target and the balance on an economic 
proﬁt target relating to their division. 
The proﬁt targets are set according  
to the commercial strategy of the 
company at the start of the ﬁnancial 
year under review.
At the end of the ﬁnancial year, the 
economic proﬁt results are calculated 
and the Remuneration Committee 
assesses each director against the  
pre-determined targets. The value of the 
rewards is calculated and independently 
veriﬁed for the committee by New 
Bridge Street Consultants LLP . 
For 2004/5, the economic proﬁt results 
for the group and the brands compared 
to the performance levels were such that 
six brands were below threshold, two 
brands achieved stretch and the group 
was between threshold and on target.
For LTIP awards, the Remuneration 
Committee agreed to use a relative TSR 
to determine pay-out levels because it 
closely aligns the interests of executives 
to those of shareholders. PAGE 41
The comparator group comprises 
constituents of the FTSE All Share Leisure 
and Hotels Sector Index, which are 
regarded as the most appropriate given 
the business mix and strategy of the 
company. Performance will be measured 
over three ﬁnancial years following the 
ﬁnancial year for which the award is 
made. Averaging will take place over  
a three month period before the start 
and end of the performance period to 
reduce the impact of short-term share 
price ﬂuctuations.
The vesting schedule for any grants 
made after June 2004 is:
Position at 
which the 
company is 
ranked
Vesting schedule
Upper quartile 
and above
Full vesting
Between 
median and 
upper quartile
Pro rata on a 
straight-line 
between quarter 
and full vesting
Median Quarter vests
Below median None
For the LTIP awards that vested on  
1 March 2005, i.e. those awards granted 
in 2002, the performance condition 
was met in full. The comparator group 
comprised 20 comparators at the time 
of measurement and Whitbread was 
ranked fourth, which is in the upper 
quartile. This was the second year in a 
row that the company was ranked in 
the upper quartile and the LTIP awards 
vested in full.
Directors – service contracts
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is 
that all executive directors should have 
rolling contracts of employment with

Remuneration of Christopher Rogers, Finance Director designate
Christopher Rogers will succeed David Richardson on 1 May 2005 as Finance Director. He will be standing for election as a director at 
the 2005 AGM, and accordingly, we are voluntarily disclosing details of his remuneration so that shareholders can make an informed 
decision. Christopher will be entitled to a basic salary of £375,000 per annum, and an employer pension contribution to a tax-approved 
deﬁned contribution pension scheme of 25% of basic salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap (currently £105,600), together with 
a non-pensionable salary supplement (subject to tax and National Insurance) of 25% of basic salary in excess of that cap. In addition 
he will be entitled to the same beneﬁts as the other executive directors as described on page 39. It is intended that Christopher will 
receive a one-oﬀ grant of an option over 50,000 ordinary shares under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
Anthony Habgood, Chairman designate
Anthony Habgood will join the Board on 1 May 2005 and will take over as Chairman on 1 August 2005. He will be standing for election 
at the 2005 AGM and we are therefore making a voluntary disclosure of the terms of his appointment. Anthony will be entitled to an 
annual payment of £250,000.

* Transfer values represent a liability of the pension fund, not a sum paid or due to the individual.
In addition to the above beneﬁt, Alan Parker has an entitlement in respect of a transfer value received from a previous employer’s 
pension scheme. The accrued entitlement at 3 March 2005 was £78,472 per annum (£46,658 per annum at 4 March 2004) and the 
transfer value was £1,283,762 (£700,048 at 4 March 2004).
Bill Shannon and David Thomas both retired and commenced drawing their pensions during the year. As both directors commuted 
part of their pension for tax free cash sums in accordance with the scheme rules, their accrued beneﬁts fell during the year.
As explained above, all of the present executive directors are entitled to a deﬁned beneﬁt pension under the Whitbread Pension Fund. 
On retirement from service at the normal pension age of 60, directors will receive an annual pension of two-thirds of their last 12 months’ 
basic salary, subject to Inland Revenue approval limits.
As a result of Alan Parker’s earnings being restricted by the earnings cap, he is also a member of the Whitbread Group Unapproved 
Pension Scheme, an unfunded, unapproved pension scheme. His total pension from the Whitbread Group Pension Fund and the 
Whitbread Group Unapproved Pension Scheme combined on retirement at age 60 will be two-thirds of his last 12 months’ base salary. 
A director retiring early between the ages of 50 and 60 may, with the company’s consent, draw his or her accrued pension without any 
actuarial reduction.
In the event of death in service before normal pension age a lump sum beneﬁt of four times base salary is paid, together with a 
spouse’s pension. On death after retirement, the director’s spouse will receive a pension of 60% of the director’s pension. In addition,  
if death occurs within ﬁve years after retirement a lump sum equal to the unpaid balance of ﬁve years’ pension will be payable.
All pensions are increased annually in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5%.
Executive directors do not contribute to the above pension schemes.
None of the executive directors are accruing beneﬁts under any other company pension arrangements. No elements of executive 
directors’ pay packages are pensionable other than base salaries.
Neither the Chairman nor the non-executive directors are entitled to participate in any of these pension arrangements. 
As explained on pages 39 and 40, the Remuneration Committee is reviewing pension provision and a full report will be given in next 
year’s remuneration report on any changes made during 2005/6.

Share options (audited information)
It is not the Remuneration Committee’s policy to continue to make an annual grant of options under the Whitbread Executive Share 
Option Scheme. Options may be granted in exceptional circumstances, for example, on a senior recruitment or following an acquisition 
of a business.
The last general grant of options was made on 17 May 2004. The performance target for these options will require Whitbread to have 
an earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% in 2006/7 compared to that for 2003/4. To the extent that this performance condition 
is not met at this time, the options will lapse, i.e. there will be no opportunity to retest performance conditions. The committee 
considered that earnings per share was the appropriate ﬁnancial test for market value options because the option has an inherent 
share price growth target.
Options granted between 1996 and 2000 cannot be exercised unless either adjusted EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 2% per annum over 
any three consecutive years during the life of the option or TSR exceeds the average of the FTSE 100 Index over the same period. For 
options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions require the company’s adjusted earnings per share to 
exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the ten year performance period.
Executive directors may also participate in the company’s savings related share option scheme which is open to all employees on the 
same terms.
The exercise periods shown below are the normal exercise periods at the date of grant. Actual exercise periods are subject to change in 
accordance with the rules of the schemes when a director ceases to be employed by the company.
At 3 March 2005 (or date of resignation where applicable) the directors held the following share options under the executive share 
option schemes and the Savings-related Share Option Scheme. The earliest date on which any of the executive options could have 
been exercised was June 1998, with the latest being May 2014. Savings-related share options have a six-month exercise period.

The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to the director remaining an 
employee of Whitbread at that date. If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date by reason of 
redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health or disability the awards will be released in full. If the director ceases to be an employee 
of Whitbread for any other reason 50% of the shares will be awarded and the remainder will lapse.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘the Plan’) – Notes 
(1)
   Whitbread’s ranking against the comparator group for the 2002 LTIP award was fourth out of 20 comparators and generated a 100% vesting.
(2)
  The shares awarded under the 2002 LTIP vested on 1 March 2005, at which point the directors’ nil-cost options over the shares became exercisable, 
subject to the end of the closed period. These options may now be exercised at any time before 1 March 2012.
(3)
  The market price at vesting is the mid-market price on 1 March 2005 or 1 March 2004 in the case of the 2001 awards.
(4)
  The monetary value of the vested award is the value at the date of vesting. This may be diﬀerent from the value at the time the director chooses to 
exercise his nil-cost option. Details of the value of the award on exercise will be reported in the year of exercise.
(5)
  These awards vested in 2003/4. Bill Shannon had not exercised his nil-cost option at the date of his resignation from the Board and Stewart Miller’s  
nil-cost option had not been exercised at 3 March 2005.
(6)
  This includes an award which vested in a prior year but has not yet been exercised.
(7)
  This includes an award which vested in a prior year and had not been exercised at the time Bill Shannon stepped down from the Board.
(8)
  As at 15 June 2004.
The information below refers to any awards made up to the date of the 2004 AGM. Please refer to page 40 for details of the Plan after that date. 
Participation in the Plan is available to executive directors and a small number of other senior executives.
The Plan aligns the long-term interests of participants with those of the company and its shareholders and is designed to deliver superior performance 
from participants and to improve shareholder value.
The Plan rewards executives with shares rather than cash beneﬁts. Awards are based on three-year performance periods and were calculated by taking 
half of the executive’s salary at the start of the period and dividing it by the Whitbread share price averaged over the ﬁve business days preceding the start 
of the performance period. The measure of performance is TSR.
Awards made prior to the 2004 AGM vest in part if the company performs at median, increasing to full vesting for top quartile performance relative to the 
comparator group of companies. This means that at the 50th percentile, 50% of the award will be paid and at the 75th percentile, 100% of the award will 
be paid, with a straight line operating in between.
For the 2002 award the comparator group of companies consisted of: Allied Domecq, BAA, Boots, Cadbury Schweppes, Compass, Dixons, Gallaher,  
Hilton Group, Imperial Tobacco, J Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer, Rank, Reckitt Benckiser, Scottish & Newcastle, Tate & Lyle, Tesco, Uniq and WHSmith.  
Albert Fisher, Arcadia and Six Continents were originally part of this group but their shares are no longer traded. Since the date of its demerger a weighted 
average of Mitchells and Butlers and Intercontinental Hotels Group has been used in place of Six Continents. The comparator group for the 2003 and 2004 
awards were constituents of the FTSE Hotels and Leisure index as at 1 March 2003 and 1 March 2004 respectively.

The agregate gain made by directors on the exercise of options was £1,233,368 (2003/4: £185,828). 
(1)
  The gains on exercise shown above relate to exercises whilst directors were on the Board.  Since David Thomas and Bill Shannon stepped down from  
the Board on 15 June 2004, they made total gains of £751,670 and £698,391 respectively from the exercise of options.
(2)
  The price on exercise is either the actual price attained, where the shares were sold on exercise, or the mid-market price on the day of exercise  
where the shares were retained.
*  The director retained some or all of the shares on exercise, but had all of the shares been sold this is the gain that would have been made.
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT)
The company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP , executive share option schemes and Deferred Bonus 
Plan. The ESOT currently holds 1,695,289 shares; the executive directors each have a technical interest in these shares as potential 
beneﬁciaries of the trust. All dividends on shares in the ESOT are waived by the Trustee. During the period from 3 March 2005 to  
25 April 2005 no director has exercised an option to call for the transfer of shares from the ESOT.
Share price information
The mid-market price of Whitbread ordinary shares on 3 March 2005 was 889p (4 March 2004 – 740p). The highest and lowest price 
paid between these dates was 934p and 693p respectively.
Changes since 3 March 2005
There have been no changes in directors’ interests in ordinary shares since 3 March 2005.

Directors responsibility for the ﬁnancial statements / Audit report
Statement of directors’  
responsibilities
The following statement, which should 
be read in conjunction with the auditors’ 
statement of their responsibilities below, 
is made with a view to distinguishing 
for shareholders the respective 
responsibilities of the directors and  
of the auditors in relation to the  
ﬁnancial statements.
The directors are required by the 
Companies Act 1985 to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year which 
give a true and fair view of the state of 
aﬀairs of the company and the group as 
at the end of the ﬁnancial year and of the 
proﬁt or loss for the ﬁnancial year.
The directors consider that in preparing 
the ﬁnancial statements on pages 50 
to 78, the group has used appropriate 
accounting policies, consistently applied 
and supported by reasonable and prudent 
judgements and estimates, and that all 
applicable Accounting Standards have 
been followed.
The directors have responsibility for 
ensuring that the group keeps accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy the ﬁnancial position of the 
group and which enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁnancial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of 
the group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
Independent auditors’ report to the 
members of Whitbread PLC
We have audited the group’s ﬁnancial 
statements for the year ended 3 March 
2005 which comprise the accounting 
policies, group proﬁt and loss account, 
group statement of total recognised 
gains and losses, group note of historical 
cost proﬁts and losses, balance sheets, 
group cash ﬂow statement and the 
related notes 1 to 36. These ﬁnancial 
statements have been prepared on 
the basis of the accounting policies 
set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the directors’ 
remuneration report that is described as 
having been audited.
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Section 235 of the 
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of  
directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, including 
the ﬁnancial statements which are 
required to be prepared in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom law  
and accounting standards as set 
out in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in relation to the  
ﬁnancial statements. The directors 
are also responsible for preparing the 
directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial 
statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements, United Kingdom 
Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to 
whether the ﬁnancial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the 
ﬁnancial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the 
directors’ report is not consistent with the 
ﬁnancial statements, if the company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we 
have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or  
if information speciﬁed by law or 
the Listing Rules regarding directors’ 
remuneration and transactions with  
the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate 
governance statement reﬂects the 
company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined 
Code speciﬁed for our review by the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider  
whether the board’s statements  
on internal control cover all risks  
and controls, or form an opinion  
on the eﬀectiveness of the group’s  
corporate governance procedures  
or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in 
the Annual Report and consider whether 
it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. This other information 
comprises the Chairman’s statement, 
the Chief Executive’s review, the 
Finance Director’s review, the corporate 
governance statement, the unaudited 
part of the remuneration report and 
the directors’ report. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the 
ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with United Kingdom Auditing Standards 
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a 
test basis, of evidence relevant to the 
amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial 
statements and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant 
estimates and judgements made by the 
directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit 
so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with 
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements 
and the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or 
error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the 
ﬁnancial statements and the part of  
the directors’ remuneration report  
to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the ﬁnancial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of aﬀairs of 
the company and of the group as at 
3 March 2005 and of the proﬁt of the 
group for the year then ended; and
•  the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985.

25 April 2005 PAGE 50 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5
Accounting policies
A. Accounting convention
The accounts are prepared under the 
historical cost convention, as modiﬁed 
by the revaluation of property, 
and in accordance with applicable 
Accounting Standards.
B. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts 
incorporate the accounts of the 
company and all group undertakings, 
together with the group’s share of the 
net assets and results of joint ventures 
and associates. These are adjusted, 
where appropriate, to conform to 
group accounting policies. Apart from 
the acquisition of Whitbread Group 
PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000/1, 
which was accounted for using 
merger accounting, acquisitions are 
accounted for under the acquisition 
method and any goodwill arising 
is capitalised as an intangible ﬁxed 
asset. On disposal of a business, the 
proﬁt or loss on disposal is calculated 
after including any goodwill previously 
written oﬀ direct to reserves in 
respect of that business. The results of 
companies acquired or disposed of are 
included in the proﬁt and loss account 
from or up to the date that control 
passes respectively. As a consolidated 
proﬁt and loss account is published, 
a separate proﬁt and loss account of 
the parent company is omitted from 
the group accounts by virtue of the 
exemption granted by section 230 of 
the Companies Act 1985.
C. Intangible ﬁxed assets
Goodwill arising on acquisitions 
is capitalised. It is amortised, on a 
straight line basis, over its estimated 
useful economic life up to a maximum 
of 20 years. Goodwill written oﬀ 
against reserves in previous years  
has not been reinstated.
IT software is amortised, on a straight 
line basis over ﬁve years.
The carrying values of intangible ﬁxed 
assets are reviewed for impairment 
if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying value may 
not be recoverable.
D. Tangible ﬁxed assets
Prior to the adoption of FRS15 in the 
1999/2000 ﬁnancial year, properties 
were regularly revalued on a cyclical 
basis. Since the adoption of FRS15, 
the group policy has been not to 
revalue its properties. Consequently 
the transitional provisions of FRS15 
have been applied and, while previous 
valuations have been retained, they 
have not been updated. Details of  
the last revaluations are given in  
note 14. Other ﬁxed assets are stated 
at cost. Gross interest costs incurred 
on the ﬁnancing of major projects are 
capitalised until the time that they  
are available for use.
Depreciable ﬁxed assets are written 
oﬀ on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful lives, as follows: 
 Freehold land is not depreciated. 
  Freehold buildings are depreciated 
to their estimated residual values 
over periods up to 50 years.
  Leasehold properties are depreciated 
to their estimated residual values 
over the shortest of 50 years, their 
estimated useful lives and their 
remaining lease periods. 
  Administration and logistics 
furniture, ﬁxtures and equipment 
are depreciated over 3 to 30 years.
  Retail furniture, ﬁxtures and 
equipment are depreciated over  
4 to 25 years.
The carrying values of tangible ﬁxed 
assets are reviewed for impairment 
if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying value may 
not be recoverable. Any impairment 
in the value of ﬁxed assets below 
depreciated historical cost is charged 
to the proﬁt and loss account. Proﬁts 
and losses on disposal of ﬁxed assets 
reﬂect the diﬀerence between net 
selling price and net book value at the 
date of disposal. 
E. Stocks 
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. The cost of 
ﬁnished goods includes appropriate 
overheads. Cost is calculated on 
the basis of ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out and net 
realisable value is the estimated selling 
price less any costs of disposal.
F. Foreign exchange 
Assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange 
quoted at the balance sheet date. 
Trading results are translated into 
sterling at average rates of exchange 
for the year. Day-to-day transactions 
are recorded in sterling at the 
rates ruling on the date of those 
transactions. Currency gains and 
losses arising from the retranslation 
of the opening net assets of overseas 
operations, less those arising from 
related currency borrowings to the 
extent that they are matched, are 
recorded as a movement on reserves, 
net of tax. The diﬀerences which 
arise from translating the results 
of overseas businesses at average 
rates of exchange, and their assets 
and liabilities at closing rates, are 
also dealt with in reserves. All other 
currency gains and losses are dealt 
with in the proﬁt and loss account.
G. Financial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
are used by the group for the 
management of foreign currency  
and interest rate exposures. Amounts 
payable or receivable in respect of 
interest rate swap and interest rate 
cap agreements are recognised as 
adjustments to the interest expense 
over the period of the contracts. Gains 
or losses on foreign currency forward 
and option contracts are recognised 
in the proﬁt and loss account when 
the hedged transaction occurs. In the 
balance sheet, payments made to 
secure a hedge are included with the 
hedged item to which they relate.
Option premiums paid are recognised 
in the proﬁt and loss account over 
the life of the contract. Premiums and 
discounts arising on ﬁnancial liabilities 
are amortised over the remaining life 
of the instrument concerned.
H. Turnover
Turnover is the value of goods and 
services sold to third parties as part 
of the group’s trading activities, after 
deducting discounts and sales-based 
taxes. PAGE 51
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
I. Leases
Rental payments in respect of 
operating leases are charged against 
operating proﬁt on a straight line basis 
over the period of the lease. Lease 
incentives are charged to operating 
proﬁt on a straight line basis over the 
period to the review date on which the 
rent is ﬁrst expected to be adjusted to 
the prevailing market rate.
J. Pension funding
Pension costs are charged to the 
proﬁt and loss account over the 
average expected service life of 
current employees. Actuarial surpluses 
and deﬁcits are amortised over the 
expected remaining service lives 
of current employees, using the 
percentage of pensionable salaries 
method. Diﬀerences between the 
amount charged in the proﬁt and 
loss account and payments made to 
the schemes are treated as assets or 
liabilities in the balance  sheet.
K. Tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect 
of all timing diﬀerences that have 
originated but not been reversed by 
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
is not recognised when an asset is 
sold if it is more likely than not that 
the taxable gain will be rolled over. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that they are regarded as 
recoverable. Provisions for deferred tax 
are not discounted. Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated using the 
tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
L.   Own shares held by the ESOT
Own shares held by the ESOT are 
carried at cost and disclosed within 
shareholders’ funds.
M. Comparative amounts

The impairment of goodwill relates to eight properties within Marriott brands to which goodwill was allocated on the 
acquisition of Swallow Group PLC where the estimated value has fallen below the carrying value including the goodwill. 
The impairment of property relates to Marriott head ofﬁce assets and four David Lloyd Leisure clubs. The 2003/4 
impairment of goodwill and the impairment of property related to ﬁve properties within Marriott brands. The impairments 
for Marriott are calculated by reference to estimated net realisable value and for the David Lloyd Leisure clubs by reference  
to value in use, calculated using a discount rate of 11%, the group’s estimated weighted average cost of capital before 
tax. The net proﬁt of £22.9m on the disposal of ﬁxed assets, for the group excluding joint ventures and associates, relates 
primarily to the proﬁt on the disposal of the 11 Courtyard by Marriott hotels. The 2003/4 net loss of £10.8m relates 
primarily to book losses on the sales of pub restaurants and the Swallow hotels.

7 Pensions
Both the deﬁned beneﬁt (ﬁnal salary) section of the principal group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, 
and the deﬁned contribution scheme, were closed to new members on 31 December 2001. Both schemes are funded 
and contributions by both employees and group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds. 
Members of these schemes are contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. A replacement, contracted-in, 
deﬁned contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with eﬀect from  
1 April 2002. The total non-government pension cost for the group, including directors, is analysed below:

Unfunded scheme      0.5  0.4 
Overseas schemes      0.1  0.1 
      8.9  9.3 
The pension cost relating to the deﬁned beneﬁt section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance 
with actuarial advice from Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit credit valuation basis. As the scheme 
is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as 
a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement although the overall cost will decrease as the 
number of members decreases. 
The pension cost for the year has been based on the latest actuarial valuation which was carried out as at 31 March 2002. 
The assumptions were derived from market yields. Separate assumptions were made for the discount rate used to value 
liabilities and the return expected on the assets. The value of the assets was calculated as an average of the market values 
over the past three years.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 4.9% per annum above inﬂation, that the 
discount rate would be 3.4% per annum above inﬂation until retirement and 2.9% per annum above inﬂation thereafter, 
that the annual increase in pensionable salaries (including promotional increases) would be 2.0% above inﬂation and that 
the annual increase in pensions in payment would average 0.1% per annum below inﬂation. The regular cost is derived 
as the service cost (calculated using the real discount rates set out above) less an adjustment reﬂecting the excess of 
the expected return on the assets over interest on the liabilities. The average expected remaining service life of current 
employees is eight years. PAGE 61

Membership of the deﬁned beneﬁt section of the fund at 3 March 2005 was 3,840 (2004 – 4,598). 
The increase in the pension prepayment included in debtors (note 20) represents funding paid to Whitbread Group Pension 
Fund in excess of the pension cost.
The Board announced in April 2003 that the company had signed an agreement with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited. 
Under that agreement, the company has undertaken to fund the pension scheme for a period of up to 15 years and given 
undertakings to the trustees similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to a 
value of £300m. As a consequence of this agreement, payments are being made into the fund for each of the three years, 
starting in 2003/4, at a rate of £15m above the anticipated SSAP 24 charge.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 – Retirement Beneﬁts will change fundamentally the calculation and reporting of the 
cost of retirement beneﬁts. The disclosures below relate to the retirement beneﬁt plans in the UK.

10 Proﬁt earned for ordinary shareholders
The proﬁt and loss account of the parent company is omitted from the group accounts by virtue of the exemption
granted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The loss earned for ordinary shareholders and included in

The ﬁnal dividend proposed of 18.35 pence per ordinary share will be paid following the share consolidation approved by the 
Extraordinary General Meeting on 22 April 2005 at the equivalent rate of 21.4 pence per new ordinary share.
12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings for ordinary shareholders of £176.6m (2003/4 – £164.5m) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 296.5m (2003/4 – 295.1m).
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated as follows:

The adjusted earnings per share is presented so as to show more clearly the underlying performance of the group. Diluted 
earnings per share is the basic and adjusted basic earnings per share after allowing for the dilutive eﬀect of the conversion 
into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period. The number of shares used 
for the diluted and adjusted diluted calculation is 298.7m (2003/4 – 297.0m). PAGE 65

Up to and including 1998/9 it was the group policy to revalue its UK properties, other than leasehold properties with a 
remaining term of less than 20 years. In 1999/2000 the group adopted FRS15 (T angible Fixed Assets). The transitional 
provisions of FRS15 were applied and, whilst previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated. From 
1999/2000 it has been group policy not to revalue ﬁxed assets. Past revaluations were performed by external valuers. PAGE 66 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004/5

facility agreements with original lives of ﬁve years. Under the terms of the agreements, the participating banks are obliged, 
on demand, to reﬁnance any amounts falling due for repayment until expiry of the facility. Included within amounts 
repayable between one and two years is an amount of £500m which is repayable in less than one year. This advance is

An onerous contract provision in connection with businesses acquired of £13.1m (2003/4 – £11.4m) has been discounted 
using a rate of 13%. The discount eﬀect of the other onerous contracts is not material. Onerous contract provisions are 
expected to be used over periods of up to 30 years.
Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses. These provisions are expected to be used over 
periods of up to ﬁve years.

No provision has been made for tax on any gains which might arise in the event of properties being sold at their revalued 
amounts, as in the ordinary course of business the majority of properties would be retained indeﬁnitely. No provision has 
been made for any additional liability to UK or overseas tax on the distribution of unappropriated proﬁts or reserves of 
overseas subsidiaries, except to the extent that such distributions have been accrued as receivable.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on the sale of properties where gains have been rolled over into replacement 
assets. The total amount unprovided for is estimated at £97.1m (2004 – £95.1m).
Following the enactment of legislation, in the Finance Act 2002, to exempt from tax gains on disposals of substantial 
shareholdings no deferred tax is provided in respect of any gains which might arise in the event of investments being sold 
at their valuation amounts. PAGE 73

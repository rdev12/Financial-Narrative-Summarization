The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau 
Bridge is one of the most ambitious 
infrastructure projects in the Pearl 
River Delta. It will link three key 
cities, cutting transport costs and 
travelling times, and boosting 
economic development. HSBC has 
extended a HK$700m receivables 
finance facility to one of the 
companies building the bridge. 
Receivables finance is an area 
where HSBC has particular

Performance highlights  
for 2016
Strategy execution 
 – Following our sale of 
operations in Brazil,  
we completed a $2.5bn  
share buy-back. 
 – We further reduced our 
risk-weighted assets (‘RWAs’) 
as a result of our sale of 
operations in Brazil and  
other management actions.
 – Investment in costs to achieve 
of $4.0bn to date has 
generated annual run rate 
savings of $3.7bn.
 – We now expect to deliver 
annualised cost savings of 
around $6bn by the end of 
2017, around $1bn above the 
top end of our original target, 
while continuing to invest in 
regulatory programmes and 
compliance. We will invest  
an equivalent total of around 
$6bn over the same timeframe. 
 – We increased market share in 
a number of key markets and 
international product areas, 
including trade finance in 
Hong Kong and Singapore.
Financial performance
 – Reported profit before  
tax of $7.1bn was $11.8bn  
lower than in 2015, and  
was adversely impacted  
by significant items of $12.2bn. 
These included a $3.2bn write-
off of goodwill in our Global 
Private Banking (‘GPB’) 
business in Europe, costs to 
achieve of $3.1bn, adverse fair 
value movements of $1.8bn 
arising from changes in credit 
spreads on our own debt 
designated at fair value, and 
the impact of our sale of 
operations in Brazil.
 – Reported revenue of $48.0bn 
was down $11.8bn. Loan 
impairment charges and other 
credit risk provisions (‘LICs’) 
fell by $0.3bn and reported 
operating expenses rose  
by $40m.
 – Adjusted profit before tax  
of $19.3bn, down $0.2bn, 
reflected lower revenue  
and higher LICs, partly offset 
by a reduction in operating 
expenses. In 2016, we 
achieved positive adjusted 
jaws of 1.2%.
 – Adjusted revenue fell by  
$1.3bn or 2% despite 
improved performance in 
Commercial Banking (‘CMB’) 
and Global Banking and 
Markets (‘GB&M’). Retail 
Banking and Wealth 
Management (‘RBWM’)  
and GPB were impacted  
by challenging  
market conditions. 
 – Adjusted operating expenses 
fell by $1.2bn or 4%, reflecting 
our cost-saving initiatives and 
focus on cost management. 
We continued to invest in 
regulatory programmes  
and compliance.
Capital
 – Our capital position further 
strengthened during the year, 
with a common equity tier 1 
(‘CET1’) ratio at 31 December 
2016 of 13.6%, up from 11.9% 
at 31 December 2015, mainly 
due to RWA reduction 
initiatives and the change  
in the regulatory treatment  
of our holding in Bank of 
Communications Co.,  
Limited (‘BoCom’).

Strategic Report Group Chairman’s 
Statement
The Group has improved its productivity, embraced 
technological change and continues to reinforce its 
standards of business conduct. It has a strong capital 
position and is gaining market share in important areas.
The Group’s reported profit before tax amounted  
to $7.1bn, some 62% lower than the prior year.  
This decline principally reflected the impact of 
significant items, most of which had no impact  
on capital, even though they were material in 
accounting terms. On the adjusted basis used to 
measure management and business performance, 
profit before tax was $19.3bn, broadly in line with 
the $19.5bn achieved in the prior year. This 
outcome was largely driven by improved cost 
performance as prior year initiatives gained  
traction and substantially offset lower revenues, 
while loan impairment charges were marginally 
higher. Earnings per share of $0.07 compared  
with $0.65 in 2015. 
The Group’s core capital position improved 
materially. A change to the regulatory treatment  
of our associate in mainland China, continued 
run-off of legacy assets, planned reduction in 
certain segments of our trading books and 
inadequately remunerated assets, together with 
capital released from business disposals, notably 
our operations in Brazil, drove this improvement. 
This created the capacity to return $2.5bn of capital 
by way of a share buy-back, which was completed 
in December. We met our objective of maintaining 
the annual dividend in respect of the year at $0.51, 
as indicated at the interim stage. This was delivered 
through the declaration today of a fourth interim 
dividend of $0.21. Reflecting on the strength  
of the Group’s capital position, the Board also 
approved a further share buy-back of up to $1bn, 
which is expected to commence shortly.
Strategic actions are now bearing fruit
In reviewing performance in 2016, the Board  
noted with approval the traction now evidenced 
from management actions to reshape the Group 
and address the challenges brought about by  
the continuing low interest rate environment.
Greater focus on the trade and investment 
corridors where HSBC has strong market 
positioning generated solid market share gains  
and broader product penetration, particularly  
in servicing outbound China investment flows.  
This is recognised in the leading industry awards 
highlighted in Stuart Gulliver’s review.
2016 will be long remembered for its significant and 
largely unexpected economic and political events. 
These foreshadowed changes to the established 
geopolitical and economic relationships that have 
defined interactions within developed economies  
and between them and the rest of the world. The 
uncertainties created by such changes temporarily 
influenced investment activity and contributed  
to volatile financial market conditions. Against  
this background, HSBC’s performance in 2016  
was broadly satisfactory. Encouragingly, operating 
performance in the second half of the year was much 
stronger than expected and compared with the prior 
year, as businesses and financial markets responded 
more optimistically than predicted to these events. 
‘Greater focus on the trade and investment 
corridors where HSBC has strong market 
positioning generated solid market share gains 
and broader product penetration’

Strategic Report
Douglas Flint Group Chairman Significant investment in technology and process 
redesign is now not only delivering greater cost 
efficiency but also is poised to markedly enhance 
our ability to detect and prevent financial crime.  
In addition, 2017 will see the progressive launch  
of applications that will materially improve our 
customers’ digital experience, enhance their  
online security and bring greater personalisation  
of product offerings.
While there is still a long way to go, it was 
encouraging to see the significant improvement  
in performance across all business units in  
Mexico following the substantial repositioning  
of the Group’s operations there. This contributed  
to the Group’s success in replacing substantially  
all of the revenues given up through continuing 
run-off of legacy portfolios, risk mitigation in  
areas exposed to higher threat of financial crime 
and reduction in trading books.
Furthermore, HSBC is safer today from the threat 
of financial crime because of the investments  
we have been making in our Global Standards 
programme. The Board remains fully committed  
to our work in this area in 2017 and beyond.
Regulatory matters
It was extremely disappointing that the regulatory 
community was unable to achieve its targeted 
completion of the Basel III framework in January 
2017 on the consensual basis expected. It is now 
almost 10 years since the commencement of the 
global financial crisis and it is time to draw a line 
under further regulatory changes, particularly since 
there is no doubt that our industry is more strongly 
capitalised, better governed and more risk aware 
than it was a decade ago. Finalisation of the 
structure and calibration of the capital framework 
is crucial to give banks certainty over prospective 
capital allocations in support of lending and market 
activities. This is particularly important at this time 
when public policy is focusing on encouraging 
greater support for longer-dated assets, including 
infrastructure, and seeking to build out the capital 
markets of Europe and emerging markets. It is 
hugely important that regulators and policy makers 
now move as quickly as possible to finalise the 
capital framework in line with their stated 
commitment to deliver that framework without  
a significant, broad-based increase in capital 
requirements. Equally important is the avoidance  
of fragmentation in the global regulatory 
architecture as the new US administration 
reconsiders its participation in international 
regulatory forums. The best outcome would be 
early global agreement on unresolved issues, 
followed by an extended period of regulatory 
stability to allow familiarity and experience to be 
gained from what has been put in place. 
We made further progress in 2016 on completing 
the resolution planning required of us as a global 
systemically important bank (‘G-SIB’). This involved 
removing or mitigating residual constraints on the 
clarity of the Group’s core college of regulators’ 
approach to winding down the Group, should  
this ever be necessary. While clearly we do  
not envisage such circumstances as other  
than extremely remote, completion of a  
comprehensive resolution framework is a 
necessary pillar supporting HSBC’s ability to 
continue to operate as one of the world’s G-SIBs. 
Indeed, our strategy is built around maintaining  
the scale and the reach of our international 
network, which in 2016 again demonstrated its 
resilience and competitive advantages.
Tangible benefits accrue to our shareholders  
from the detailed work done with our regulators  
to demonstrate the strength of our capital position 
and the effectiveness of our resolution planning. 
Beyond supporting the maintenance of our 
dividend, in 2016 management’s efforts created 
the capacity to return capital to shareholders  
by way of a share buy-back and demonstrated 
justification for a reduction in the additional  
capital buffer applied to HSBC as a G-SIB.
UK referendum on EU membership
Not a great deal has changed since we reported  
at the interim stage, given that the UK has still to 
trigger its formal exit notice and so no negotiations 
have taken place. We welcomed, however, the 
additional clarity given to the Government’s 
position in the recent speech by the Prime Minister. 
The scale of the challenge of negotiating across the 
entire economic landscape, as well as addressing 
the legislative and other public policy adjustments 
that will be required, has become clearer. We 
believe there is now, as a consequence, a widely 
shared recognition that an implementation phase 
between the current position and the one that  
is ultimately negotiated will be necessary; we 
strongly endorse this view. 
Since the referendum we have focused on  
advising clients on the implications of leaving  
the EU for their businesses. We have also been 
responding to UK Government outreach seeking 
guidance on which elements of the current 
EU-based legal and regulatory arrangements  
it should focus on to preserve the essential role 
that financial markets based in the UK play in 
supporting European trade and investment activity.
For our own part, we have broadly all the licences 
and infrastructure needed to continue to support 
our clients once the UK leaves the EU. This largely 
derives from our position in France where we  
are the sixth largest bank with a full range of 
capabilities. Current contingency planning suggests 
we may need to relocate some 1,000 roles from 
London to Paris progressively over the next two 
years, depending on how negotiations develop.

Group Chairman’s Statement Board changes
We welcomed Jackson Tai to the Board on  
12 September last year. Jack brings a rare 
combination of hands-on banking expertise,  
top level governance experience and a deep 
knowledge of Asia and China. These attributes 
were accumulated in a 25-year career at  
J.P. Morgan & Co., both in the US and in Asia,  
and subsequently in senior roles at DBS, the 
leading Singapore-based regional banking group, 
where Jack latterly led its regional expansion as 
Vice Chairman and CEO. Jack was appointed a 
member of the Financial System Vulnerabilities 
Committee and the Group Risk Committee.
At the forthcoming AGM we shall bid farewell to 
our two longest-serving independent directors, 
namely, our Senior Independent Director, Rachel 
Lomax, and Sam Laidlaw. Rachel during her tenure 
has served on the Audit, Risk and Nomination 
Committees, and took responsibility as the first 
Chair of the Conduct & Values Committee to 
establish its terms of reference and its agenda. 
Sam served on, and latterly chaired, both the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
Together, Rachel and Sam have also been leading 
the process to manage my own succession. Their 
combined knowledge of regulatory and public 
policy, business leadership, corporate governance 
and consumer issues has been invaluable to the 
Board. On behalf of all shareholders, I want to 
thank them for their dedication and commitment.
Chairman succession
In the Circular inviting shareholders to the 2016 
AGM, I indicated that the process to find my own 
successor had been initiated with the intention of 
having this concluded during 2017. This process 
remains on track and an announcement will be 
made in due course.
Outlook
We have recently upgraded our forecasts for global 
economic growth reflecting the likelihood of a shift 
in US fiscal policy and a broader based cyclical 
recovery. As in recent years, incremental growth is 
expected to be driven by emerging economies in 
which HSBC is well represented. Risks to this 
central scenario, however, remain high. In 
particular, we highlight the threat of populism 
impacting policy choices in upcoming European 
elections, possible protectionist measures from the 
new US administration impacting global trade, 
uncertainties facing the UK and the EU as they 
enter Brexit negotiations, and the impact of a 
stronger dollar on emerging economies with  
high debt levels.
Douglas Flint 
Group Chairman 
21 February 2017
Countering these factors are signs of a cyclical 
upturn. Global purchasing manager indices are  
at their strongest for some time, the US economy 
looks robust and growth in China has held up  
well, defying the concerns reflected in the market 
retrenchment seen in the first quarter of 2016. 
Additionally, commodity prices have risen, 
reflecting optimism regarding growth in 
infrastructure investment as well as agreement 
reached to cut oil supply. These factors also imply 
reflation across the major economies and rising 
interest rates, which would benefit HSBC’s 
conservative balance sheet structure.
However, it is fair to reflect that the upgrades to 
economic growth we are now forecasting are 
largely the partial reversal of downgrades made 
last year when uncertainty was elevated as a result 
of the unexpected political events. Forecast global 
growth remains slightly lower than its long-term 
trend with risks largely to the downside.
We enter 2017 with the restructuring of the Group 
essentially completed, and with a strong capital 
position and a conservative balance sheet. We are 
gaining market share in areas of importance to 
HSBC as others scale back and our offerings 
become more competitive. Much of the heavy 
investment in reshaping the Group to improve 
productivity, embrace technological change and 
reinforce global standards of business conduct  
has been made. 
As ever, we owe a huge amount to our 235,000 
colleagues who have delivered this change at the 
same time as working tirelessly to meet customers’ 
expectations of them. On behalf of the Board,  
I want to thank them all for their dedication  
and commitment.

border mergers and acquisitions. HSBC was 
recognised as the ‘World’s Best Investment Bank’ 
and ‘World’s Best Bank for Corporates’ at the 
Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2016.
Commercial Banking performed well, particularly 
in the UK and Hong Kong, growing adjusted 
revenue in spite of a slow-down in global trade. 
Gains in Global Liquidity and Cash Management, 
and Credit and Lending, exceeded the reduction  
in trade finance revenue. Global Trade and 
Receivables Finance continued to capture market 
share in major markets including Hong Kong and 
Singapore, maintaining our position as the world’s 
number one trade finance bank. 
Retail Banking and Wealth Management 
performance was mixed. Overall adjusted revenue 
was down, due largely to the impact of reduced 
client activity in Hong Kong on our Wealth 
Management businesses. At the same time, strong 
mortgage balance growth in the UK, Hong Kong 
and mainland China, and higher current account 
and savings balances in the UK and Hong Kong, 
helped increase revenue in Retail Banking. These 
increased balances should support revenue growth 
in 2017 and beyond. 
We have considered it appropriate to write off  
the remaining goodwill in the European private 
banking business. This goodwill relates principally 
to the original purchase of Safra Republic Holdings 
in 1999. The restructuring of Global Private 
Banking is now largely complete, and although 
Global Private Banking is now much smaller  
than it was three years ago, it is deliberately 
positioned for sustainable growth with a focus  
on serving the personal wealth management 
needs of the leadership and owners of the  
Group’s corporate clients.
Our cost-reduction programmes continue to  
bring down our adjusted operating expenses.  
The traction that these programmes have gained in 
the last 18 months has enabled us to increase the 
amount of costs that we are able to remove from 
the business. We now expect to deliver annualised 
cost savings of around $6bn by the end of 2017, 
and will invest an equivalent total of around $6bn 
over the same time-frame in order to achieve this.
Stuart Gulliver Group Chief Executive
We made good progress in 2016. The 
implementation of our strategic actions is well 
advanced and our global universal business model 
performed well in challenging conditions. Our 
reported profit before tax reflected a number of 
large significant items, including a write-off of all  
the remaining goodwill in Global Private Banking in 
Europe, an accounting loss on the sale of our Brazil 
business, and investments to achieve our cost-
saving target. Our adjusted profits were broadly 
unchanged year on year following solid 
performances by our global businesses. These 
enabled us to capture market share in strategic 
product areas and build a platform for future 
growth. We delivered positive adjusted jaws in 2016.
Performance
Global Banking and Markets recovered from a 
sector-wide slow start to generate higher adjusted 
revenue than for 2015. Our Markets businesses 
performed well in challenging conditions, 
particularly in Fixed Income products. Our 
transaction banking businesses also grew revenue, 
especially Global Liquidity and Cash Management. 
We made market share gains in Fixed Income in 
Europe, and achieved our best ever league table 
rankings in global debt capital markets and cross-

Strategic Report Delivering value for shareholders
In December, we completed the $2.5bn equity 
buy-back that we commenced at the half-year.  
We are also now in a position to retire more of 
the capital that previously supported the Brazil 
business. Having received the appropriate 
regulatory clearances, we will therefore execute  
a further share buy-back of up to $1bn in the first 
half of 2017. This will bring the total value of shares 
repurchased since last August to $3.5bn.
We will continue to contemplate further share 
buy-backs as circumstances permit, and  
we remain confident of sustaining the annual 
dividend at the current level for the foreseeable 
future through the long-term earnings capacity  
of the business.
A business fit for the future
While our strategic actions are improving our 
network, we are also anticipating and adapting  
to the social, economic and technological trends 
that are changing our operating environment and 
our customers’ needs and expectations.
The adoption of rapidly evolving digital 
technologies by our customers is arguably the 
most transformative force for the financial services 
industry. Through our global network, we are able 
to identify and respond to digital trends across  
70 countries and territories, applying the 
technologies that provide the greatest benefit to 
our customers. We are investing $2.1bn in digital 
transformation in Retail Banking and Wealth 
Management, Commercial Banking, and Global 
Banking and Markets between 2015 and the  
end of 2020, and we have already launched 
innovative ways to make banking faster, easier  
and safer. HSBC is now the biggest financial 
services user of biometrics globally, and we 
continue to roll out voice recognition and 
fingerprint technology across our network. In 2016, 
we enhanced our internet and mobile banking 
platforms in several of our key markets, including 
the UK and Hong Kong, and launched innovation 
labs around the world dedicated to the application 
of artificial intelligence, data management and 
improvements in cybersecurity. These labs, 
together with our fintech partnerships, will help  
us use technology to deliver better banking for  
our customers.
These savings should more than compensate for 
additional investment in regulatory programmes 
and compliance. 
We continue to make strong progress in 
implementing our strategic actions to improve 
returns and gain maximum value from our 
international network. We are on course to 
complete the majority of these actions by the  
end of 2017 (see pages 12 to 13), in line with our 
targets. Our targeted reduction of risk-weighted 
assets is 97% complete, and the success of our 
cost saving programmes means that we now 
expect to exceed our cost reduction target. 
The turnaround of our Mexico business  
continues to accelerate. Improved lending and 
deposit balances, interest rate rises and better 
collaboration between businesses helped generate 
significantly higher profits compared with 2015. 
We also made significant market share gains, 
particularly in consumer lending. 
We have continued to enhance our business  
in Asia-Pacific, launching our first exclusively 
HSBC-branded credit card in mainland China, 
growing assets under management and insurance 
new business premiums, and increasing loans  
in the Pearl River Delta. We also extended our 
leadership of the offshore renminbi bond market 
and achieved our best ranking for China outbound 
mergers and acquisitions since 2003.
We are better protected from financial crime 
because of the investment we have made in  
our Global Standards programme. Our Monitor  
has raised certain concerns, but we have 
continued to progress and our commitment 
remains unwavering. By the end of this year, we 
are on track to have our anti-money laundering  
and sanctions policy framework in place and to 
have introduced major compliance IT systems 
across the Group. Beyond 2017, we will continue  
to work to fine tune those systems and to ensure 
that our improvements are fully integrated into  
our day-to-day risk management practices.
Our strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.6% 
reinforces our ability to support the dividend,  
invest in the business and manage the continuing 
uncertain regulatory environment.

Strategic Report | Group Chief Executive’s Review If digital technology is mankind’s greatest 
opportunity, preventing climate change is its 
greatest challenge. The Paris Agreement of 
December 2015 reflected a new consensus on  
the need to strengthen the global response to 
climate change. Major injections of capital are  
now required to finance new technologies, 
infrastructure and the transition of traditional 
industries from high to low carbon, and to cover 
the costs of climate adaptation. As the principal 
intermediaries between entrepreneurs, businesses 
and investors, banks have a responsibility to help 
direct this flow of capital. We are already working 
with our clients and with investors to help them 
allocate capital and direct finance towards lower-
carbon, carbon-resilient activities, and in 2016  
we established a Sustainable Financing Unit to 
coordinate this work across business lines. 
Headquartered in London, but with resources  
in New York and Hong Kong, this new unit will 
support colleagues tasked with creating and 
delivering innovative climate products, and help 
them uncover new sources of sustainable finance. 
We are also seeking to influence client practices 
and to build the data, the tools and the 
transparency necessary to embed understanding 
of climate risk into the way that markets function. 
In 2016, HSBC Global Research expanded its 
coverage of environment, social and corporate 
governance factors to give our clients the 
information they need to inform their investment 
decisions. This builds on the work of the world-
leading HSBC Climate Change Centre for 
Excellence, which in 2017 celebrates 10 years  
of delivering market-leading information on climate 
policy to clients across the globe. Work is also 
underway to expand the Group’s disclosure of 
non-financial data to meet the needs of 
shareholders and other stakeholders.
We are investing to adapt to the changing face  
of trade. As the world’s largest trade finance bank 
with more than 150 years’ experience at both ends 
‘The changes we have made since 2011 have 
equipped HSBC to improve returns and gain 
maximum value from our international network’
of the world’s busiest trade routes, we are perfectly 
placed to help modernise and digitise long-
standing trade finance methods, many of which 
would still be recognisable to HSBC’s founders.  
We are already working with a broad coalition  
of partners around the world to make the promise  
of blockchain technology a reality with regards  
to trade finance. HSBC has already helped develop  
a blockchain prototype for a letter of credit that 
confirms the possibility of sharing information 
between all parties on a private distributed  
ledger. In early 2017, we signed a memorandum  
of understanding with six other banks to make 
domestic and cross-border commerce easier  
for European SMEs using blockchain technology. 
We are also seeking to create ways of financing  
the growing services trade, which we estimate  
will account for a quarter of global trade by 2030.  
At a time when international politics threaten to 
increase rather than decrease the cost of trade,  
we will continue to invest both time and resources 
to find ways of making trade finance cheaper, 
faster, simpler and more secure for our customers. 
Looking forward
We anticipate new challenges in 2017 from 
geopolitical developments, heightened trade 
barriers and regulatory uncertainty. However, the 
changes we have made since 2011 have equipped 
HSBC to manage the complexity of today’s global 
business environment. HSBC is a strong and 
resilient business with a global universal business 
model geared to find growth opportunities in a 
low-growth world. If globalisation continues to 
retreat, as seems likely, we are in a strong position 
to capitalise on the regional opportunities that this 
will present, particularly in Asia and Europe. Most 
importantly, the strength of our network gives us 
an unrivalled ability to help our clients navigate  
that same complexity and overcome their own 
challenges, whether exploring new markets or 
making the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Strategic Report
Group Chief Executive’s Review Our strategy
We have developed a long-term strategy  
that reflects our purpose and enables us to  
capture value from our international network. 
Two-part long-term strategy
Develop our  
international network 
To facilitate international trade and capital flows and 
serve our clients, with potential to help them grow 
from small enterprises into large multinationals.
Value of the network and our strategy
Access to global  
growth opportunities
Our unparalleled network  
covers countries accounting for 
more than 90% of global GDP,  
trade and capital flows. We have  
a leading presence in large and 
fast-growing economies.
Our priority markets cover both 
sides of 11 of the world’s 15 largest 
trade corridors for goods and 
services forecast for 2030, and 
represent at least one side of the 
other four corridors. Six of the 15 
corridors are within Asia and five 
connect countries between two 
geographical regions.
Strong capital and funding base
CET1 ratio of 13.6%, supported by 
increased shareholders’ equity to 
meet new regulatory requirements 
since the end of 2010.
Four interconnected, global 
businesses share balance sheets 
and liquidity in addition to strong 
commercial links.
Stable shareholder returns
Industry leading dividend – 
approximately $55bn declared from 
2011 to 2016, as well as circa 
$2.5bn of share repurchases.
Lower risk profile and volatility  
from our diversified, universal 
banking model
Our 10-year profit before tax 
volatility of 0.9x compares 
favourably with our peers.
Transaction banking product 
revenue of $14.7bn on an adjusted 
basis leads the industry. More than 
45% of our client revenue comes 
from businesses and individuals 
with an international presence.
Business synergies of $10.5bn, 
equivalent to 22% of reported 
revenue reflect products and 
services provided across our  
global businesses.
Invest in wealth and  
retail businesses with local scale
To make the most of global social mobility, wealth 
creation and long-term demographic changes  
in our priority markets. 
Strategic Report
10 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Our strategy positions us  
to capitalise on several  
long-term trends.
Increasing connectivity and 
global flows of trade, finance 
and data are key drivers of 
GDP growth. 
Economic weight is shifting  
to Asian and Middle Eastern 
economies, which are 
expected to grow GDP 
threefold by 2050. 
The middle class is expected  
to grow from one-third to 
two-thirds of the world’s 
population by 2030, while the 
number of people over age 60 
is expected to more than 
double by 2050.

Our strategy
Strategic Report Strategic actions
We are well on our way towards achieving the  
actions outlined in our June 2015 Investor Update.
Capturing value from our international network
In June 2015, we outlined a series  
of strategic actions to make the most 
of our competitive advantages and 
respond to a changing environment.
These actions are focused on 
improving efficiency in how we use 
our resources, and on investing for 
growth in line with our strategy. Each 
action has targets defined to the end 
of 2017. The table opposite contains a 
summary of our progress in 2016 with 
additional details provided below.
Resizing and simplifying  
our business
We have made significant progress in 
resizing and simplifying our business. 
In 2016, management actions reduced 
RWAs in GB&M and legacy credit by 
$46bn and we completed asset sales 
totalling $10.1bn from our US 
consumer and mortgage lending 
(‘CML ’) run-off portfolio.
As part of our initiative to optimise  
our network, we completed the sale 
of HSBC Bank Brazil on 1 July 2016. 
We will continue to serve the 
international and cross-border  
needs of our large corporate clients  
in Brazil through HSBC Brasil S.A. – 
Banco de Investimento.
In the NAFTA region, we grew 
adjusted revenue in Mexico by 18% 
compared with 2015, supported by 
market share gains in RBWM across 
key lending products and a doubling 
of personal loans issued. In the US, 
we grew adjusted revenue in GB&M 
and RBWM compared with 2015  
and continued to support our clients 
internationally. Revenues from 
international subsidiaries of our  
US clients increased by 11% 
compared with 2015.
We have made good progress in our 
cost-saving programme and are on 
track to exceed our exit rate target  
set for the end of 2017. We expect  
to achieve total cost savings of $6.0bn 
through one-off investments (‘costs  
to achieve’) of $6.0bn. The additional 
savings will fund increased costs  
related to regulatory programmes  
and compliance. In 2016, operating 
expenses fell by 4% on an adjusted 
basis compared with 2015, facilitated  
by increased efficiency in our processes. 
For example, we launched a new 
customer-facing digital portal to 
standardise and accelerate the 
onboarding process in 26 markets 
covering more than 70% of CMB 
corporate clients, and we decreased the 
number of manual payments by 80%.
Redeploying capital to grow  
our business
At the heart of our business is our 
international network. We are focusing 
efforts to grow our businesses by 
looking at customers’ needs across 
products, geographies and supply 
chains. In 2016, revenue from 
transaction banking products was up 
2% despite difficult macroeconomic 
conditions. We grew revenues in our 
Global Liquidity and Cash Management 
(GLCM) business. In 2016, we were 
named ‘Best Bank for Corporates’ by 
Euromoney and ‘Best Supply-Chain 
Finance Bank Global’ by the Trade  
Finance Awards.
We continue to invest for growth in 
Asia. In December, we launched our 
own HSBC-branded credit cards in 
mainland China with a full range of 
digital features. We increased the 
number of new RBWM clients in China’s 
Pearl River Delta by 51% compared  
with 2015, and grew our mortgage  
loan books by more than 51%. We grew 
revenues from international subsidiaries 
of our ASEAN-region commercial 
banking clients, and in Singapore  
our innovation lab is developing 
cloud-based treasury services for 
businesses and exploring blockchain 
technology to support documentary 
trade transactions. 
We remain recognised as the leading 
bank for international renminbi (‘RMB’) 
products and services. We were the first 
bank to facilitate overseas institutional 
investment into the China interbank bond 
market since access was expanded in 
early 2016. We were also the first to be 
appointed custodian bank in the two 
newly active RMB qualified foreign 
institutional investor (‘RQFII’) markets  
of the US and Thailand this year.
Finally, we continue to strengthen  
our efforts to protect customers  
and the wider financial system from 
financial crime. In 2016, this included 
further upgrades to our systems, as  
well as additional training for our 
employees. Further detail can be found 
under the Financial Crime Risk section 
of www.hsbc.com/financial-crime-risk.

This table shows our reported results for

Reported profit before tax 
Reported profit before tax of $7.1bn  
was $11.8bn or 62% lower than in  
2015. This was primarily due to net 
adverse movements relating to 
significant items and the unfavourable 
effects of foreign currency translation, 
which are described in more detail on 
page 30. Excluding significant items  
and currency translation, profit before 
tax fell by $0.2bn. 
Reported revenue
Reported revenue of $48.0bn was 
$11.8bn or 20% lower than in 2015,  
in part due to a net unfavourable 
movement in significant items of  
$7.6bn, which included:
 –adverse fair value movements of  
$1.8bn arising from changes in credit 
spreads on our own debt designated  
at fair value, compared with favourable 
movements of $1.0bn in 2015; 
 –a $3.6bn reduction in revenue resulting 
from our sale of operations in Brazil to 
Banco Bradesco S.A., which includes  
a $1.7bn accounting loss recognised  
on the sale; and
 –the non-recurrence of a $1.4bn gain on 
the sale of part of our shareholding in 
Industrial Bank Co. Limited (‘Industrial 
Bank’) in 2015; partly offset by
 –a $0.6bn gain on the disposal of our 
membership interest in Visa Europe  
in the second quarter of 2016 and  
a $0.1bn gain on disposal of our 
membership interest in Visa US  
in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In addition, foreign currency translation 
differences between the periods had  
an adverse effect of $3.0bn. 
These factors contributed to a fall  
in reported revenue in all our global 
businesses and Corporate Centre. 
Excluding significant items and the 
adverse effects of foreign currency 
translation differences between the 
periods, revenue fell by $1.3bn or 2%.
Reported LICs
Reported LICs of $3.4bn were  
$0.3bn lower than in 2015 as reductions 
in RBWM and CMB more than offset  
an increase in GB&M. The reduction 
included favourable effects of foreign 
currency translation differences 
between the periods of $0.2bn, and  
the impact of LICs incurred in the 
disposed Brazil operations of $0.7bn 
compared with $0.9bn in 2015.
Reported operating expenses
Reported operating expenses of 
$39.8bn were $40m or 0.1% higher  
than in 2015. This includes favourable 
effects of currency translation 
differences of $2.1bn between  
the periods, and an increase in 
significant items of $3.3bn, including:
 –a $3.2bn write-off of goodwill in  
our GPB business in Europe; and

Financial overview
Strategic Report Adjusted LICs 
Adjusted LICs of $2.7bn were $48m 
higher than in 2015, reflecting increases 
in GB&M resulting from a small number 
of individually assessed LICs within the 
oil and gas, and metals and mining 
sectors, notably in the first half of 2016 
in the US. LICs also increased in RBWM, 
particularly in Mexico. These increases 
were largely offset by a reduction in 
LICs in CMB. 
Adjusted operating expenses  
Adjusted operating expenses of $30.6bn 
were $1.2bn or 4% lower than in 2015. 
This primarily reflected cost savings  
of $2.2bn realised in 2016, with run-rate 
savings of around $3.7bn since the 
commencement of our cost-saving 
programme. The fall in operating 
expenses also included a reduction of 
$0.5bn in the UK bank levy. These 
reductions were partly offset by the 
impact of inflation and our continued 
investment in regulatory programmes 
and compliance.
Run-the-bank costs of $26.9bn were 
$0.3bn lower, and change-the-bank 
costs of $2.7bn were $0.4bn lower,  
both compared with 2015. Within these, 
our total expenditure on regulatory 
programmes and compliance, 
comprising both run-the-bank  
and change-the-bank elements, was 
$3.0bn, up $0.4bn or 14% compared 
with 2015. This reflected the ongoing 
implementation of our Global Standards 
programme to enhance our financial 
crime risk controls and capabilities,  
and to meet our external commitments.
In the fourth quarter of 2016,  
our adjusted operating expenses 
increased compared with the third 
quarter reflecting a small number  
of specific items. This included the 
write-off of software.
The number of employees expressed  
in full-time equivalent staff (‘FTEs’)  
at 31 December 2016 was 235,175, a 
decrease of 20,028 from 31 December 
2015. This included a 19,145 reduction 
following our disposal of operations in 
Brazil. Excluding Brazil, the decrease in 
FTEs was 883, as a reduction of 17,855 
FTEs realised across global businesses 
and global functions was partly offset  
by investment in our Global Standards 
Programme of 5,694 FTEs, costs to 
achieve FTEs of 8,073 and investment 
for growth. 
 For further details on the categorisation  
of run-the-bank and change-the-bank costs,  
see page 38.
Adjusted income from 
associates and joint ventures  
Adjusted income from associates and 
joint ventures of $2.4bn fell by $0.1bn 
compared with 2015.
Adjusted revenue  
Adjusted revenue of $50.2bn was 
$1.3bn or 2% lower. The reduction 
reflected the following:
 –In RBWM, lower revenue (down  
$0.3bn) was mainly a result of a fall  
in income in our Wealth Management 
business. The reduction resulted from 
lower investment distribution income 
compared with a strong performance 
in 2015, notably in the first half of the 
year, and adverse market impacts in 
Insurance Manufacturing. By contrast, 
revenue grew in savings and deposits, 
as we grew balances in Hong Kong, 
the UK and Mexico, and from wider 
spreads in Hong Kong and  
Latin America.
 –In GPB, lower revenue (down $0.2bn) 
reflected reduced brokerage and 
trading activity due to the continued 
repositioning of the business, together 
with adverse market sentiment and 
unfavourable market conditions.
 –In Corporate Centre, revenue fell  
(down $1.2bn), partly due to the  
US CML portfolio (down $0.5bn)  
as a result of continued run-off  
and portfolio sales. Revenue also  
fell in Central Treasury as a result of 
higher adverse fair value movements  
relating to the economic hedging  
of our long-term debt ($0.2bn)  
and higher interest expense on  
our debt ($0.2bn).
These were partly offset: 
 –In GB&M, revenue increased (up  
$0.4bn) despite adverse movements  
in credit and funding valuation 
adjustments of $0.3bn. In Rates and 
Credit, higher revenue reflected growth 
in market share in Europe.  
We also increased revenue in Global 
Liquidity and Cash Management 
(‘GLCM’) from balance growth and 
wider spreads. By contrast lower

Strategic Report | Financial overview
Adjusted performance continued Balance sheet strength
Total reported assets were $2.4tn, 1% lower than at  
31 December 2015 on a reported basis, and 5% higher  
on a constant currency basis. We have maintained the 
strength of our balance sheet, as targeted asset growth  
was partly offset by reductions in our legacy portfolios and 
the completion of our sale of operations in Brazil to Banco 
Bradesco S.A. We also issued more than $30bn of senior  
debt during the year from HSBC Holdings plc (‘HSBC 
Holdings’) to build up the Group’s total loss absorbing 
capacity in line with anticipated regulatory requirements.
Return on equity
Our medium-term target is to achieve a return on equity 
(‘RoE’) of more than 10%. In 2016, we achieved an RoE of 
0.8% compared with 7.2% in 2015. In 2016, significant items, 
which included a write-off of goodwill in GPB in Europe, costs 
to achieve and adverse fair value movements arising from 
changes in credit spread on our own debt designated at fair 
value, had a significant effect on our reported RoE. Together 
with the UK bank levy, significant items reduced the return 
achieved by 6.9 percentage points.
Adjusted jaws 
Jaws measures the difference between the rates of change 
for revenue and costs. Positive jaws occurs when the figure 
for the annual percentage change in revenue is higher than,  
or less negative than, the corresponding rate for costs. 
We calculate adjusted jaws using adjusted revenue and costs. 
Our target is to maintain positive adjusted jaws.
In 2016, adjusted revenue fell by 2.5%, whereas our adjusted 
operating expenses reduced by 3.7%. Adjusted jaws was 
therefore positive 1.2%.
Dividends
In the current uncertain environment, we plan to sustain the 
annual dividend in respect of the year at its current level for 
the foreseeable future. Growing our dividend in the future will 
depend on the overall profitability of the Group, delivering 
further release of less efficiently deployed capital and meeting 
regulatory capital requirements in a timely manner. Actions to 
address these points were core elements of our Investor 
Update in June 2015.
Distributable reserves
The distributable reserves of HSBC Holdings at 31 December 
2016 were $42bn, and at 31 December 2015 were $47bn. The 
reduction was driven by our share buy-back ($2.5bn) and the 
effects of dividends paid ($11bn), which more than offset 
profits of $7bn. 
Capital strength
We manage our capital in an effort to ensure we exceed 
current regulatory requirements and are well placed to meet 
those expected in the future. We monitor our position using 
capital ratios. These measure capital relative to a regulatory 
assessment of risks taken. We quantify how these risks relate 
to our businesses using RWAs.
Our CET1 ratio at 31 December 2016 was 13.6%, up from 
11.9% at 31 December 2015. 
 Details of these risks are included on page 127.

Strategic Report Global businesses
We manage our products and services globally 
through our global businesses.
Retail Banking and Wealth Management (‘RBWM’)
Commercial Banking (‘CMB’)
RBWM serves close to 36 million customers 
worldwide through four main business 
areas: Retail Banking, Wealth Management, 
Asset Management and Insurance.
RBWM provides services to individuals 
under the HSBC Premier and Advance 
propositions aimed at mass affluent and 
emerging affluent customers who value 
international connectivity and benefit from 
our global reach and scale. For customers 
who have simpler everyday banking needs, 
RBWM offers a full range of banking 
products and services reflecting local 
requirements.
Higher Retail Banking revenue,  
but challenging market conditions  
in Wealth Management
 – Adjusted profit before tax of $5.3bn was 
$0.4bn or 6% lower compared with 2015. 
This was driven by lower revenue  
in our Wealth Management business, 
together with higher LICs. By contrast, 
lower operating expenses reflected our 
continued focus on cost management.
 – Adjusted revenue of $18.9bn was  
$0.3bn or 2% lower, as growth in Retail 
CMB serves approximately two million 
customers in 54 countries and territories. 
Our customers range from small enterprises 
focused primarily on their domestic markets 
through to corporates operating globally.
It supports our customers with tailored 
financial products and services to allow 
them to operate efficiently and to grow. 
Services provided include working capital, 
term loans, payment services and 
international trade facilitation, among other 
services, as well as expertise in mergers 
and acquisitions, and access  
to financial markets.
Revenue growth in a challenging 
market
 – Adjusted profit before tax of $6.1bn  
was 12% higher than in 2015 primarily 
because of lower LICs, and revenue 
growth despite challenges in global trade. 
 – Adjusted revenue rose by $0.1bn or 1%. 
This included growth of $0.2bn in GLCM 
Banking revenue was more than offset by  
a fall in Wealth Management. The reduction 
in Wealth Management (down 0.5bn) was 
driven by decreased investment distribution 
revenue as a result of lower mutual fund  
and retail securities turnover due to weaker 
market sentiment. This compared with  
a strong performance in the first half of 
2015. In addition, insurance manufacturing 
revenue fell, reflecting adverse market 
impacts ($345m), although this was partly 
offset by the value of new business. 
However, in Retail Banking revenue rose 
$0.2bn or 1%, as revenue increased in 
current accounts and savings (up $0.4bn) 
from growth in balances, notably in  
Hong Kong and the UK. We also benefited 
from wider deposit spreads in Hong Kong 
and Mexico. By contrast, revenue in 
personal lending fell (down $0.2bn), despite 
growth in balances of $9bn or 3%, notably  
in Hong Kong, the UK and Mexico, driven  
by spread compression (mainly in the UK).
 – LICs increased by $0.1bn, notably in  
Mexico, reflecting growth in unsecured 
lending balances.
 – Operating expenses were 1% lower as 
inflation and investments were more than 
driven by increased balances and wider 
spreads in Hong Kong. Revenue in Credit 
and Lending also increased (up $0.1bn), 
reflecting continued loan growth in  
the UK. This was partly offset by lower 
revenue in Global Trade and Receivables 
Finance (‘GTRF’). 
 – LICs reduced by $0.4bn as 2016 included 
lower levels of individually assessed LICs, as 
well as a net release of collective allowances 
primarily relating to charges made in the 
fourth quarter of 2015, notably in the oil  
and gas sector.
 – Operating expenses reduced compared with 
2015 as the effect of inflation was more than 
offset by ongoing cost discipline and the 
impact of our transformation initiatives. This 
helped us achieve positive jaws of 2.1%.
 – Management initiatives drove a further 
reduction in RWAs of $23bn in 2016, leading 
to a cumulative reduction of $46bn since  
our Investor Update in 2015, $18bn above 
our target.
offset by transformation and other 
cost-saving initiatives.
Key events:
 –Our retail banking revenue rose by 1%,  
with increases in current account and 
savings partly offset by falls in credit card 
and mortgage revenue, reflecting spread 
compression, mainly in the UK.
 –In the UK, growth in mortgage balances 
was facilitated by our expansion into the 
mortgage intermediary market, with 12 
brokers added in 2016, which accounted  
for 7% of our new mortgage originations  
during 2016.
Key events:
 –Despite the fall in global trade, we gained 
market share in key markets, including trade 
finance in Hong Kong and Singapore, and 
Receivables Finance in the UK.
 –HSBC was named ‘2016 Best Trade Bank  
in the World’ by Trade and Forfaiting Review, 
and won the ‘Best Global Cash Manager  
for Non-Financial Institutions’ at the

Lower revenue reflecting repositioning 
and adverse market conditions
 – Adjusted profit before tax of $0.3bn fell  
by $0.1bn as revenue decreased, partly  
offset by a reduction in costs.
During 2016, we established the Corporate 
Centre, to better reflect the way we manage 
our businesses. Corporate Centre comprises 
Central Treasury, including Balance Sheet 
Management (‘BSM’), our legacy businesses, 
interests in associates and joint ventures, 
central stewardship costs that support our 
businesses and the UK bank levy. 
Lower revenue due to continued disposal 
of legacy portfolios and Central Treasury, 
partly offset by a reduction in costs
 –Adjusted profit before tax of $2.0bn was 
$0.5bn or 19% lower, driven by a fall in 
revenue and lower income from associates, 
partly offset by lower operating expenses, 
notably a reduced charge relating to the  
UK bank levy.
 –Revenue fell by $1.2bn, partly driven  
by reductions in our US CML portfolio  
 – Adjusted revenue of $1.8bn fell by $0.2bn  
or 11%, as brokerage and trading activity  
in both Europe and Asia decreased. This 
reflected the continued impact of client 
repositioning, in addition to adverse market 
sentiment and unfavourable market 
conditions throughout the year.
 –Operating expenses decreased by $0.1bn, 
primarily as a result of reduced FTEs and 
cost-saving initiatives.
Key events:
 – There was negative net new money of $17bn, 
reflecting the repositioning of the business. 
However, we attracted positive net new 
money in key markets targeted for growth, 
notably in the UK, Channel Islands  
and Hong Kong.
($0.5bn) as a result of lower average lending 
balances and portfolio sales. Revenue  
also fell in Central Treasury as a result  
of higher adverse fair value movements 
relating to the economic hedging of  
our long-term debt ($0.2bn) and higher 
interest expense ($0.2bn).
 –LICs were broadly unchanged as increased 
charges in the US CML portfolio were 
broadly offset by higher releases of credit 
risk provisions in the legacy credit portfolio.
 –Operating expenses were $0.8bn lower, 
partly reflecting the benefits of 
transformational savings in our technology, 
operations and other functions, and a lower 
UK bank levy charge (down $0.5bn).
 –Income from associates was $0.1bn  
lower, primarily in Saudi Arabia.
Key events:
 – Completed asset sales of $10bn from  
our US CML run-off portfolio. As at  
31 December 2016, gross lending  
balances in this portfolio were $5.7bn.
 – We recognised a $3.2bn write-off relating  
to the goodwill of the business in Europe, 
which is not reflected in the adjusted 
performance. For additional information, 
refer to Note 20 on page 238.

It supports major government, corporate  
and institutional clients worldwide. Our 
product specialists continue to deliver a 
comprehensive range of transaction banking, 
financing, advisory, capital markets and risk 
management services. 
Markets revenue up despite challenging 
market conditions
 –Adjusted profit before tax of $5.6bn was 
$63m higher than in 2015, as revenue 
increased and operating expenses 
decreased, reflecting transformational cost 
savings, partly offset by an increase in LICs.
 –Adjusted revenue of $14.9bn rose $353m  
or 2%, despite adverse movements in 
Credit and Funding valuation adjustments 
compared with favourable movements in 
2015 (net effect, down $297m), primarily 
relating to movements on our own credit 
spreads on structured liabilities. Excluding 
these, revenue rose $650m or 5%, mainly  
in Rates and Credit, as we gained market 
share in Europe. In GLCM, revenue 
increased as we grew average balances  
and benefited from wider spreads. By 
contrast, revenue fell in Equities, reflecting 
lower trading volumes in Europe and Asia. 
 –LICs increased (up $0.4bn), predominantly 
driven by a small number of individually 
assessed exposures within the oil and gas, 
and metals and mining sectors, notably  
in the first half of 2016 in the US.
 –Operating expenses fell by $93m, reflecting 
reduced performance-related pay, 
disciplined cost management, efficiency 
improvements including technology 
delivery rationalisation, and FTE reductions. 
These reductions more than offset the 
investments we made in the business.
Key events:
 –Through 2016, we continued to focus  
on delivery of our RWA reductions, and 
achieved a reduction of $8bn, which 
included $39bn through management 
initiatives, partly offset by business growth.

Reported loss before tax included 
significant items of $8.4bn
 – Reported loss before tax was $6.8bn.  
This compared with a reported profit  
before tax of $688m in 2015, with the fall 
driven by a net adverse movement in 
significant items, including and the write-off 
of goodwill relating to our GPB business, 
adverse fair value movements arising from 
changes in credit spreads on our own debt 
designated at fair value compared with 
favourable movements in 2015, and higher 
costs to achieve. 
 – On an adjusted basis, profit before tax of 
$1.6bn fell by $0.5bn or 26%, as revenue 
decreased by $0.9bn (5%), partly offset by 
lower costs (down by $369m or 2%), which 
included a reduction of $0.5bn related to the 
UK bank levy, and a reduction in LICs of 
$37m (8%). 
 – Reported revenue fell by $5.0bn, primarily  
as a result of adverse movements of $1.8bn 
arising from changes in credit spread on  
our own debt, compared with favourable 
movements of $0.8bn in 2015, and the 
adverse effects of currency translation 
differences ($1.6bn). Adjusted revenue fell 
by $945m or 5%, reflecting a reduction  
in RBWM of $465m (7%), notably in life 
insurance manufacturing in France as  
a result of adverse market updates, and  
in GPB reflecting the repositioning of the 
business. In Corporate Centre, lower 
adjusted revenue (down $0.8bn), partly 
reflected higher adverse fair value 
movements of $0.2bn relating to the 
economic hedging of our long-term debt, 
and higher interest expense of $0.2bn. 
These reductions were partly offset by 
growth in revenue in GB&M ($0.2bn), 
notably in Rates, GLCM and Global Banking, 
and in CMB ($0.2bn), in Credit and Lending.
 – Reported costs rose by $2.6bn, primarily 
reflecting a write-off of goodwill relating  
to our GPB business of $3.2bn and an 
increase of $1.5bn in costs to achieve, partly 
offset by the favourable effects of currency 
translation of $1.3bn. Adjusted costs fell by 
$0.4bn (2%). Excluding the reduction in the 
UK bank levy ($0.5bn), costs rose by 1% 
driven by higher charges from our global 
service and technology centres due to 
increased transformation activities relating to 
IT transformation and process improvement.
Asia
HSBC’s history is founded on financing trade 
with Asia, and the continent remains central 
to our strategy. We aim to grow our business 
in China’s Pearl River Delta and the ASEAN 
region, and we continue to strengthen our 
leadership position in the internationalisation 
of China’s renminbi currency.
Lower revenue, notably in Wealth 
Management, offset by cost 
management initiatives 
 – Reported profit before tax was $13.8bn, 
$2.0bn lower than for 2015, notably due  
to the non-recurrence of a gain of $1.4bn  
on the disposal of part of our shareholding  
in Industrial Bank.
 – On an adjusted basis, profit before tax  
was broadly unchanged, as a decrease in 
revenue was offset by a reduction in costs.
 – Reported revenue fell by $2.0bn, driven  
by the non-recurrence of the gain on 
Industrial Bank, as noted above, and the 
adverse effects of currency translation 
differences of $0.3bn. Adjusted revenue 
decreased by $253m (1%). Lower adjusted 
revenue in RBWM resulted from investment 
distribution income falling, reflecting weaker 
market sentiment compared with a strong 
performance in the first half of 2015. This 
was partly offset by wider deposit spreads 
and deposit balance growth. In GB&M, 
adjusted revenue also declined, mainly in 
Equities and Foreign Exchange, partly offset 
by increases in Rates. By contrast, revenue 
in Corporate Centre increased, notably as 
income from Balance Sheet Management, 
within Central Treasury, rose.
 – Reported costs decreased by $104m,  
as an increase in costs to achieve of  
$354m was partly offset by the favourable 
effects of currency translation differences  
of $177m. Adjusted costs decreased by 
$227m (2%), notably as a result of cost 
management initiatives, which more than 
offset the effects of inflation and our 
investment growing our business in China’s 
Pearl River Delta and the ASEAN region.

 – On an adjusted basis, profit before tax 
increased by $178m (13%), primarily 
reflecting a reduction in costs of $142m,  
and a decrease in LICs of $135m, partly 
offset by lower share of profit in associates 
and joint ventures. 
 – Reported revenue fell by $210m,  
primarily due to the adverse effects of 
currency translation differences ($182m). 
Adjusted revenue decreased marginally, 
mainly reflecting reductions in RBWM in 
Turkey as we restructured our business 
there, and in CMB in the UAE, mainly within 
GTRF, in part reflecting customer exits. This 
was partly offset by GB&M with growth in 
GLCM, which benefited from interest rate 
rises across the region, in Global Banking 
mainly driven by infrastructure and real 
estate fee income in the UAE and Egypt, 
and Securities Services due to higher 
balances and spreads.
 – Reported LICs fell by $154m with adjusted 
LICs decreasing by $135m, mainly in CMB  
in the UAE due to lower charges and the 
release of provisions taken in 2015, notably 
relating to exposures in the oil and gas sector.
 – Costs were $137m lower on a reported 
basis, and $142m (9%) lower on an adjusted 
basis, mainly in the UAE and Turkey due  
to cost-saving initiatives, which more  
than offset our continued investment  
in compliance.
 – Share of profit in associates and joint 
ventures fell by $70m (14%), mainly  
due to higher impairment charges in  
Saudi British Bank and lower revenue  
in HSBC Saudi Arabia reflecting lower  
asset management and investment banking 
revenues. This was partly offset by revenue 
growth in Saudi British Bank and well-
managed costs in both associates.
North America
The US is a key partner in global trade, and 
the US dollar remains the primary currency 
for global trade and payments. We support 
our North American customers within the 
NAFTA region and around the world, helping 
them grow their businesses.
Continued run-off of the US CML 
portfolio led to a fall in revenue,  
partly offset by cost reductions  
across all businesses
 –Reported profit before tax was $185m,  
and fell by $429m from 2015, partly 
reflecting the net adverse effects of 
significant items, notably higher costs to 
achieve of $298m.
 – Adjusted profit before tax fell by $208m 
(14%) from the continued reduction in  
our US CML run-off portfolio.
 –Reported revenue fell $592m, and included 
the adverse effects of significant items 
($57m) and currency translation of $59m. 
Movements in significant items were 
primarily driven by minimal fair value 
movements arising from changes in credit 
spread on our own debt in 2016, compared 
with favourable movements of $219m  
in 2015, although these movements were 
partly offset by a gain of $116m recorded  
on our sale of Visa US shares in 2016 and 
lower losses on disposal in our CML run-off 
portfolio of $77m. Adjusted revenue was 
$475m lower, primarily from a decrease  
in income in the US CML run-off portfolio  
in Corporate Centre. By contrast, adjusted 
revenue in GB&M increased by 6%, notably 
as a result of increased income in Rates  
and Credit driven by higher client flows  
and collateralised financing activity.
 –LICs increased by $188m on a reported 
basis and $191m on an adjusted basis, 
primarily as a result of a small number of 
individually assessed charges in the mining 
sector in GB&M, as well as higher charges 
in the US CML run-off portfolio. In CMB, 
there were net collectively assessed 
releases in 2016, compared with charges  
in 2015, relating to exposures in the oil  
and gas sector.
 –Reported costs fell by $353m, although this 
included a rise of $298m in costs to achieve 
in significant items, partly offset by a 
reduction in fines, penalties and charges  
in relation to legal matters of $128m. 
Adjusted costs fell by $460m, reflecting 
lower staff costs across all businesses. 
Latin America
We are focusing on growing our business  
in Mexico, where we are among the top five 
banks by assets and our branch network  
has a market share of more than 10%. On  
1 July 2016, we completed our sale of 
operations in Brazil, but we will continue  
to provide access to the region for large 
multinational companies.
Continued progress in strategic 
initiatives with a strong business 
performance
 – Reported loss before tax was $1.6bn.  
This compared with a profit of $310m  
in 2015, with the loss driven by a number  
of significant items, primarily the accounting 
loss on our sale of Brazil operations which 
totalled $1.7bn.
 – On an adjusted basis, profit before tax rose 
by $0.4bn due to higher revenue, partly 
offset by higher LICs and costs.
 – Reported revenue fell by $3.9bn, partly 
driven by the accounting loss on our sale  
of Brazil operations ($1.7bn). The reported 
results also include the revenue earned  
in our Brazil business of $1.5bn in 2016, 
compared with $3.3bn in 2015, and the 
adverse effects of currency translation 
differences of $0.9m. However, adjusted 
revenue was $0.7bn (29%) higher than  
for 2015. We increased revenue in RBWM  
in Mexico with lending growth and an 
increase in market share across core retail 
portfolios, and in Argentina, reflecting wider 
spreads and growth in deposits, together 
with higher income from insurance. 
Revenue also increased in GB&M, partly 
due to increased client activity, and in CMB 
from lending and deposit balance growth. 
 – Reported LICs fell by $266m, primarily 
driven by a reduction in Brazil ($184m)  
and favourable effects of currency 
translation ($120m). By contrast, adjusted 
LICs rose by $38m due to higher LICs 
in RBWM in Mexico of $124m reflecting 
growth in unsecured lending and a rise in 
delinquency rates, partly offset by lower 
LICs in CMB and GB&M.
 – Reported costs fell by $1.7bn, and included 
$1.1bn of costs relating to Brazil in 2016, 
compared with $2.5bn in 2015. These also 
included the favourable effects of currency 
translation differences ($0.6bn). Excluding 
these factors, adjusted costs increased by 
$0.3bn (or 16%), although this was below 
the average rate of inflation in the region  
as we continued to control our costs.

UAE, we automated pricing for foreign 
exchange to provide clients with 
consistent and competitive rates for 
cross-currency payments. We also 
enhanced our investment advice 
processes and introduced tools  
and guidelines to make all our  
customer communication clear  
and easy to understand.
These and related initiatives are guided 
by our Conduct Framework, which 
focuses on delivering fair customer

integrity through our behaviours. The 
Conduct Framework guides activities to 
strengthen our business, and increases 
our understanding and awareness of 
how the decisions we make affect 
customers and other stakeholders.
 Additional detail on the Conduct Framework is 
available online at www.hsbc.com/conduct. For 
further details on regulatory compliance risk and 
on conduct-related costs included in significant 
items, see pages 81 and 62, respectively.
We serve more than 37 million

Strategic Report
22 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Increasing quality of service
We rely on customer feedback to  
help determine where we can make 
improvements. In RBWM, we conducted 
more than 1.6 million customer surveys in 
2016 across multiple points of customer 
interaction, including live online chat.  
We also improved the speed and quality 
of complaint resolution with more than 
two-thirds of retail customer complaints 
resolved on first contact, an improvement 
of 9% compared with 2015.
Customer feedback helps us to identify 
and address root causes of complaints. 
For example, we increased capacity in 
our call centres in response to concerns 
about long waiting times in the UK.  
We also addressed the most common 
complaints related to fees and charges 
through increased staff training and 
customer communication. As a result, 
complaints of this type reduced 
significantly in a number of our markets, 
including a 35% reduction in Hong Kong 
and a 27% reduction in France.
Innovation and technology
Our customers increasingly use digital 
channels to interact, including mobile 
banking. We are investing in innovation 
and technology to serve customers 
better and enhance security around 
financial transactions and customer 
data. In 2016, we introduced voice 
biometric identification technology  
for retail customers globally. HSBC  
is one of the first large-scale global  
users of this technology.
In the UK, we also launched a mobile 
application for commercial banking 
customers that allows them to digitally 
verify their identity. Since its launch, 
nearly 80% of the customers able to  
use this digital channel have chosen  
to do so. We have also adjusted our 
branch network to reflect changing 
customer needs and concluded our retail 
branch review in the UK, with a further 
reduction of 117 branches in 2016.
In Hong Kong, we launched a research 
and development lab in partnership with 
the government to promote technology 
development for the financial sector. 
Areas of focus include biometrics,  
data analytics, cybersecurity and 
internet finance. Separately, we are 
developing a mobile application to help 
Our values define who we are  
as an organisation and make  
us distinctive. 
Open
We are open to different ideas  
and cultures, and value  
diverse perspectives. 
Connected
We are connected to our 
customers, communities, regulators 
and each other, caring about 
individuals and their progress. 
Dependable
We are dependable, standing firm 
for what is right and delivering  
on commitments.
Our values
retail customers manage all of their 
finances more effectively through  
a single interface.
Sustainable finance
We recognise that reducing global 
carbon dioxide emissions is a critical 
challenge for society. We seek to be  
a leader in managing climate change  
risk while developing opportunities  
with our customers. We continue to 
facilitate investment in areas such as 
infrastructure and renewable energy that 
help lower carbon dioxide emissions. 
In 2016, for example, we helped issue 
the largest-ever renewable energy bond 
in Canada to support a solar power 
farm. In the UK, we provided financing 
and asset management expertise to 
support deployment of energy smart 
meters throughout the country. In 
December, we established a team 
dedicated to sustainable finance within 
the business in order to engage clients 
more effectively in assessing and 
responding to potential impacts from 
climate change.

How we do business
Strategic Report Valuing diversity
Building a more diverse and inclusive 
workforce is critical to developing a 
sustainable and successful business. 
Our approach aims to increase and 
leverage diversity of thought to improve 
workforce agility, enhance our risk 
management capability, drive innovation 
and grow markets. 
Our diversity and inclusion ambitions 
focus on attracting, developing and 
retaining talent that reflects our 
customers and the communities where 
we do business, and deploying that 
talent effectively to anticipate and 
address expectations. Our seven global 
employee networks support this 
strategy and focus on gender, age, 
ethnicity, LGBT+, faith, working parents 
and carers, and ability. We have 
continued our focus on improving 
gender balance within senior leadership.
Supporting our employees
We believe that if someone is worth 
talking to, they are worth listening to. 
Exchange meetings are our way of 
doing that: meetings with no agendas 
and where managers are participants 
rather than leaders. These meetings 
bring people together to listen to each 
other, and allow people to express 
themselves without interruption or 
rebuttal. Our employee surveys indicate 
that Exchange participants respond 
positively by 11% more than others 
when asked if there is honest,  
two-way communication.
Similarly, our At Our Best programme 
reinforces the habits required for a 
strong culture, including asking for 
feedback, being mindful of one’s own 
emotions and deploying tools for 
making better decisions. In 2016, nearly 
100,000 employees attended an At Our 
Best training course, and a further 
18,000 managers attended similar 
training centred on managing teams. 
The programme is supported through  
a behaviour recognition scheme and  
the launch of Our Charter, a framework 
for good decision-making.
To further strengthen our culture and 
promote positive behaviours, we have 
developed culture change plans that are 
regularly discussed in global and local 
management forums. The plans 
emphasise enabling a speak-up culture, 
principles-based judgement and other 
behaviours that are key to supporting  
the Group’s strategic objectives such as 
managing financial crime risk. In 2016, 
our employees completed more than 
eight million courses in person or through 
online learning in order to build skills and 
reinforce behaviours more broadly.
We have a wellbeing programme that 
provides benefits and services to support 
employees’ wellness. For example, we 
offer free, confidential counselling to 
address personal issues at home or 
work. We also allow employees who 
have been at HSBC for five years or more 
to apply to take a sabbatical. Above  
all, we aim to provide a working 
environment where colleagues can talk 
openly about wellbeing issues, including 
anxiety and stress. Such measures are 
particularly valuable amid the demands 
of multiple change programmes and 
financial crime remediation initiatives.
Whistleblowing
We operate a global whistleblowing 
platform, HSBC Confidential, which 
allows staff to report matters of concern 
confidentially. During 2016, employees 
have raised more than 1,100 cases. 
Common themes among the cases 
raised included concerns regarding staff 
behaviour and recruitment practices, 
allegations of fraud perpetrated by staff, 
and weaknesses in incentive 
arrangements and information security.

Strategic Report | How we do business Our approach to tax 
We apply the spirit and the letter of the 
law in all territories where we operate. 
We have adopted the UK Code of 
Practice for the Taxation of Banks. As a 
consequence, we pay our fair share of 
tax in the countries in which we operate. 
We continue to strengthen our 
processes to help ensure our banking 
services are not associated with any 
arrangements known or suspected to 
facilitate tax evasion. HSBC continues  
to apply global initiatives to improve  
tax transparency such as: 
 –the US Foreign Account Tax 
Compliance Act (‘FATCA’);
 –the OECD Standard for Automatic 
Exchange of Financial Account 
Information (also known as the 
Common Reporting Standard);
 –the Capital Requirements Directive IV 
(‘CRD IV’) Country by Country 
Reporting; and
 –the OECD Base Erosion and Profit 
Shifting (‘BEPS’) initiative.
We do not expect BEPS or similar 
initiatives adopted by national 
governments to adversely impact 
HSBC’s results. Further financial  
and tax information for the countries  
in which we operate will be published  
in 2017 in a CRD IV Country by Country 
report at www.hsbc.com/tax.
Our Global Sustainability function works 
with our global businesses, global 
functions and our regions to manage 
environmental and social issues that 
affect the Group and on which we can 
have an impact. Key issues are reviewed 
below and further details are available 
online at www.hsbc.com/sustainability. 
Sustainability performance data for 2016 
will be available in spring 2017. 
Climate change
We have committed to supporting the 
global shift to a low-carbon economy. 
Our award-winning Global Research 
team published 60 reports on 
sustainability topics in 2016. These 
included the implications of the Paris 
Agreement on climate change. 
In light of the Paris Agreement, we 
reviewed our mining and metals policy, 
and included restrictions on lending to 
new thermal coal mines, in addition to 
our existing policies on coal-fired power 
plants and deforestation. We also added 
more specific guidance on human  
rights impacts that could arise in the 
mining sector. 
 For more information about our sustainability 
risk policies see page 84. 
We completed a number of GB&M and 
CMB client transactions that help lower 
carbon dioxide emissions in areas 
including infrastructure and renewable 
energy. In 2016, HSBC was the third-
ranked bookrunner for green, social  
and sustainability bonds that exceeded 
$250m excluding self-led transactions 
by Dealogic. We also published a report 
on our own green bond, issued in 2015.
We scored the highest grade in a global 
index run by CDP, a not-for-profit 
organisation that rates companies and 
governments on how they are tackling 
the climate change challenge. We also 
published an HSBC Statement on 
Climate Change, providing a summary 
of our approach and initiatives.
We are reducing the amount of energy 
we consume, and increasing the 
proportion from renewable sources.  
By the end of 2016, more than 17% of 
our electricity was from wind or solar 
farms, compared with 9% in 2015. We 
signed additional agreements in 2016  
to increase the percentage of the 
electricity we use from new wind  
and solar sources. In total, we have 
agreements in place to meet 23% of  
our global electricity needs from these 
sources by 2018.
 We report our carbon dioxide emissions  
on page 62.
Sustainable investment
Our Global Research team has expanded 
its environmental, social and governance 
research offering, hiring analysts to 
specifically cover social and governance 
drivers, and to cover the fast-growing 
green bond market. 
Our Global Asset Management  
business published a new climate 
change policy to encourage the 
transition to a low-carbon economy  
and increase the climate resilience  
of clients’ investments.
Human rights
We have issued our first statement  
as required by the UK’s Modern  
Slavery Act, which can be found  
at www.hsbc.com.
We updated our supplier code of 
conduct to take account of revised 
legislation on modern slavery and 
human rights. More than 240 of our 
largest suppliers have already accepted 
this code.
Community investment
In 2016, we contributed $137m to 
charitable programmes, and our 
employees volunteered 255,000  
hours in community activities during  
the working day.
Our flagship environmental partnership, 
the HSBC Water Programme, exceeded 
its five-year targets at the end of 2016. 
Building on this success, we are 
extending the programme for a further 
three years. 
In 2016, we renewed our commitments 
to our two flagship global education 
programmes, the HSBC Youth 
Opportunities Programme and Junior 
Achievement More than Money, for 
another three years. These programmes 
help young people access education 
and realise their potential.

Strategic Report
How we do business Risk overview
We actively manage risk to protect  
and enable the business.
Managing risk
HSBC has maintained a conservative 
and consistent approach to risk 
throughout its history, helping  
to ensure we protect customers’ 
funds, lend responsibly and support 
economies. By carefully aligning our 
risk appetite to our strategy, we aim to 
deliver long-term shareholder returns.
All employees are responsible for the 
management of risk, with the ultimate 
accountability residing with the Board. 
We have a strong risk culture, which 
is embedded through clear and 
consistent communication and 
appropriate training for all employees. 
A comprehensive risk management 
framework is applied throughout the 
Group, with effective governance  
and corresponding risk management 
tools. This framework is underpinned 
by our risk culture and reinforced  
by the HSBC Values and our Global 
Standards programme.
Our Global Risk function oversees  
the framework, and is led by the 
Group Chief Risk Officer, an executive 
Director. It is independent from the 
global businesses, including our sales 
and trading functions, to provide 
challenge, appropriate oversight,  
and balance in risk/reward decisions.
HSBC’s risk appetite defines its 
desired forward-looking risk profile, 
and informs the strategic and financial 
planning process.
Our top and emerging risks framework 
helps enable us to identify current and 
forward-looking risks so that we may 
take action to either prevent them 
materialising or limit their effect.
Top risks are those that may have a 
material impact on the financial results, 
reputation or business model of the 
Group in the year ahead. Emerging 
risks are those that have large 
unknown components and may form 
beyond a one-year horizon. If these 
risks were to occur, they could have  
a material effect on HSBC.
During 2016, we made two changes  
to our top and emerging risks to reflect 
our assessment of their effect on HSBC. 
Firstly, ‘IT systems infrastructure and 
resilience’ was added as a new risk  
due to the need to ensure core banking 
systems remain robust as digital and 
mobile banking services continue to 
evolve. Secondly, ‘Dispute risk’ was 
removed as the key drivers of this 
thematic issue have already materialised 
and are therefore reported through other 
reporting channels. In addition, three 
thematic risks were renamed to better 
reflect the challenges facing HSBC.  
We use the new names in the table  
that follows.
It is articulated in our Risk Appetite 
Statement, which is approved by  
the Board. Key elements include: 
 –risks that we accept as part of doing 
business, such as credit risk and 
market risk;
 –risks that we incur as part of doing 
business, such as operational risk, 
which are actively managed to remain 
below an acceptable tolerance; and 
 –risks for which we have zero tolerance, 
such as knowingly engaging in 
activities where foreseeable 
reputational risk has not  
been considered.
We operate a comprehensive stress 
testing programme to help ensure the 
strength and resilience of HSBC, taking 
part in regulators’ as well as our own 
internal stress tests. In 2016, we 
participated in the annual stress test  
by the Bank of England, our lead 
regulator, and again exceeded its 
requirements comfortably. This reflected 
our conservative risk appetite, and  
our diversified geographical and 
business mix. It also reflected our 
ongoing strategic actions, including  
the sale of our operations in Brazil, RWA 
reductions in GB&M and continued 
sales from our US CML run-off portfolio. 
Our internal stress test scenarios include 
potential macroeconomic, geopolitical 
and operational risk events, and events 
that are applicable to HSBC. The results 
help management understand material 
risks and consider potential mitigants.
 Our risk management framework and risks 
associated with our banking and insurance 
manufacturing operations are described on pages 
68 and 82 respectively.

We are actively monitoring our wholesale credit and trading portfolios to identify areas of  
stress following the UK electorate’s vote to leave the European Union. We have also undertaken 
stress tests on our businesses and portfolios to assess potential impacts under a range of 
possible exit scenarios.
Geopolitical risk We have increased physical security at our premises where the risk of terrorism is heightened 
and have enhanced our major incident response capabilities.
Turning of the credit cycle A number of sectors remain under enhanced monitoring with risk appetite and new lending 
significantly curtailed, including our oil and gas and commodities lending portfolios.
Cyber threat and 
unauthorised access  
to systems
We have brought all cybersecurity initiatives together under one programme in order to 
strengthen our resilience and defence capabilities. We have revised our cybersecurity risk 
appetite to reflect our evolving defence approach.
Regulatory and technological 
developments with adverse 
impact on business model 
and profitability
We are actively engaged with regulators and policy makers to help ensure that new regulatory 
requirements are considered fully and can be implemented in an effective manner. We have 
established a specialist digital solutions team to lead our response to new technologies.
Regulatory focus on  
conduct of business

Third-party risk management To help enable a consistent risk assessment of the third-party services that the Group utilises, we 
are implementing a framework to provide a holistic view of third-party risks, which assesses third 
parties against key criteria, combined with associated control monitoring, testing and assurance 
throughout the third-party lifecycle.
Enhanced model risk 
management expectations
We have implemented a new global policy on model risk management and updated the model 
governance framework to address key internal and regulatory requirements. Additional resources 
have also been recruited to support the independent model review function.
Data management We continued to enhance our data governance, quality and architecture to help enable consistent 
data aggregation, reporting and management.

Risk overview
Strategic Report Instilling the right behaviours, and 
driving and encouraging actions that  
are aligned to organisational values  
and expectations, are essential. We 
therefore have a number of programmes 
to reinforce our values.
Embedding our values in our remuneration framework
Remuneration
Our remuneration policy supports the achievement 
of our strategic objectives by balancing reward for 
short- and long-term sustainable performance.
Remuneration principles
The remuneration strategy for our 
employees is based on a series of  
key principles. What we do
 –Focus on total compensation  
with a strong link between pay  
and performance 
 –Judge not only what is achieved,  
but also how it is achieved, in line  
with the HSBC Values
 –Operate a thorough performance 
management and HSBC Values 
assessment process
 –Recognise and reward our employees 
for outstanding positive behaviour
 –Design our policy to align 
compensation with long-term 
stakeholder interests
 –Apply consequence management  
to strengthen the alignment between 
risk and reward
What we don’t do
 –Reward inappropriate or excessive  
risk taking or short-term performance 
at the expense of long-term  
company sustainability
 –Use only a formulaic approach to 
determine bonuses for our executives
 –Award discretionary bonuses to 
employees rated unacceptable against 
the HSBC Values and behaviours
 – Allow our employees to hedge against 
their unvested or retained awards
 –Offer employment contracts with a 
notice period of more than 12 months
 –Have pre-arranged individual  
severance agreements
Pay Outcomes
Positive 
adjustments
 – Individuals who exhibit exceptional conduct and behaviours  
are awarded positive variable pay adjustments during the year.
Global 
consequence 
management 
policy
 – Ensures clear messaging to employees on the impact of any  
inappropriate conduct as part of reward communications, with  
consistency in approach and actions taken depending on the  
severity of the misconduct.
Global 
recognition 
programme
 – Our global recognition programme is now available in more than  
50 countries.
 – In 2016, approximately 600,000 recognitions were made with a total  
value of $8.1m.
Performance 
management
 – Employees set objectives, which connect business, team and individual 
goals and are guided by expected behaviours aligned to our core values. 
 – All employees receive a behaviour rating based on their adherence  
to HSBC Values to ensure performance is judged not only on what is  
achieved, but also on how it is achieved.
 – Employees and managers are encouraged to hold frequent conversations 
throughout the year, exploring alternative ways to stay connected outside 
the regular performance management cycle using a mix of informal and 
formal check-ins on a range of topics, including performance,  
development and wellbeing.

  Executive Directors received Group Performance Share Plan (‘GPSP’) awards for 2015. For 2016, executive Directors will receive a long-term incentive (‘LTI’) 
award, with a performance period ending in 2019, which will be included in the single figure table for the financial year ending on 31 December 2019. If target 
performance is achieved for this award, LTI payout would be 50% of grant value. In this case, the 2016 total single figure for year-on-year comparison would  
be (in £000) £7,670 for Stuart Gulliver, £4,069 for Iain Mackay and £4,052 for Marc Moses.
Remuneration for our executive Directors 
How we set our variable pay pool
When deciding on the variable pay pool, the Remuneration Committee 
considers a number of factors, which are set out in the following table:
Our variable pay pool for 2016
Our variable pay pool is $3,035m, a decrease  
of 12.3% compared with 2015.
Performance and 
risk appetite 
statement
 – Our variable pay pool takes into account our performance 
in the context of our risk appetite.
Countercyclical 
funding 
methodology
 – To dampen effects of economic cycles, the variable pay 
pool’s size has a floor and a ceiling, and we also limit the 
payout ratio as performance increases to prevent the risk  
of inappropriate behaviour.
Distribution of 
profits
 – Our funding methodology ensures that the distribution of 
post-tax profit between capital, shareholders and variable 
pay is appropriate, and that the majority of post-tax profit  
is allocated to capital and shareholders.
Commerciality 
and affordability
 – We face challenges arising from being headquartered in 
the UK, which has more stringent reward practices. We 
take into account these challenges in determining the size 
of the variable pay pool to ensure we can continue to 
attract and retain talent in key markets.
Our remuneration policy for executive Directors was approved at our 
2016 Annual General Meeting and implemented for the first time in 2016. 
Full details of our remuneration policy can be found online in our 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Supplement 2016.
The table below shows the amount our  
executive Directors earned in 2016.

The management commentary included in the Strategic Report, 
the Report of the Directors: ‘Financial Review’, together with 
the ‘Employees’ and ‘Corporate sustainability’ sections of 
‘Corporate Governance’ and the ‘Directors’ Remuneration 
Report’ is presented in compliance with the IFRSs Practice 
Statement ‘Management Commentary’ issued by the IASB.
Use of non-GAAP financial measures
Our reported results are prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as detailed in the Financial Statements starting on page 183. 
In measuring our performance, the financial measures that we 
use include those derived from our reported results in order to 
eliminate factors that distort period-on-period comparisons. 
These are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures that we use throughout the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 are described below. Non-
GAAP financial measures are described and reconciled to the 
closest reported financial measure when used.
The global business segmental results on pages 45 to 60 
are presented on an adjusted basis in accordance with IFRS 8 
‘Operating Segments’ as detailed in ‘Basis of preparation’ on 
page 44.
Adjusted performance
Adjusted performance is computed by adjusting reported 
results for the year-on-year effects of foreign currency 
translation differences and significant items, which distort year-
on-year comparisons.
We use ‘significant items’ to describe collectively the group 
of individual adjustments excluded from reported results 
when arriving at adjusted performance. These items, which 
are detailed below, are ones that management and investors 
would ordinarily identify and consider separately when 
assessing performance to understand better the underlying 
trends in the business.
These items include the operating results for our Brazil 
operations sold to Banco Bradesco S.A. on 1 July 2016, as 
well as the loss recognised on disposal.
We consider adjusted performance provides useful information 
for investors by aligning internal and external reporting, 
identifying and quantifying items management believes to 
be significant and providing insight into how management 
assesses year-on-year performance.
Foreign currency translation differences 
Foreign currency translation differences reflect the movements 
of the US dollar against most major currencies during 2016. 
We exclude our reporting currency translation differences when 
deriving constant currency data because using these data 
allows us to assess balance sheet and income statement 
performance on a like-for-like basis to understand better 
the underlying trends in the business. 
Foreign currency translation differences
Foreign currency translation differences for 2016 are computed by 
retranslating into US dollars for non-US dollar branches, subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates:
• the income statements for 2015 and 2014 at the average rates of 
exchange for 2016; and
• the balance sheets at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 at 
the prevailing rates of exchange on 31 December 2016.
No adjustment has been made to the exchange rates used to translate 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities into the functional 
currencies of any HSBC branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures or 
associates. When reference is made to foreign currency translation 
differences in tables or commentaries, comparative data reported in the 
functional currencies of HSBC’s operations have been translated at the 
appropriate exchange rates applied in the current period on the basis 
described above.
Significant items
The tables on pages 54 to 60 detail the effects of significant 
items on each of our global business segments and 
geographical regions in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Critical accounting estimates
and judgements
The results of HSBC reflect the choice of accounting policies, 
assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of 
HSBC’s consolidated financial statements. The significant 
accounting policies, including the policies which include 
critical accounting estimates and judgements, are described 
in Note 1.2 on the Financial Statements. The accounting policies 
listed below are highlighted as they involve a high degree of 
uncertainty and have a material impact on the financial 
statements:
• Impairment of loans and advances: For collective 
impairment allowances, estimation methods include the 
use of historical information supplemented by significant 
management judgement about whether current economic 
and credit conditions are such that actual incurred losses 
are likely to be greater or less than experienced in the past. 
For individually assessed loans, judgements are made about 
the financial condition of individual borrowers, which can 
involve a wide range of factors relating to their business and 
the value of any security. The exercise of judgement requires 
the use of assumptions that are highly subjective and 
sensitive, in particular to changes in economic and credit 
conditions across a large number of geographical areas. 
See Note 1.2(d) on page 198.
• Deferred tax assets: The most significant judgements relate 
to those made in respect of expected future profitability. 
See Note 1.2(h) on page 202.
• Valuation of financial instruments: In determining the fair 
value of financial instruments a variety of valuation 
techniques are used, some of which feature significant 
unobservable inputs and are subject to substantial 
uncertainty. See Note 1.2(c) on page 197.
• Impairment of interests in associates: Impairment testing 
involves significant judgement in determining the value in 
use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash 
flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the 
investment, based on a number of management 
assumptions. See Note 1.2(a) on page 196. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 31
• Goodwill impairment: A high degree of uncertainty is 
involved in estimating the future cash flows of the cash 
generating units (‘CGUs’) and the rates used to discount 
these cash flows. See Note 1.2(a) on page 196.
• Provisions: A high degree of judgement may be required 
due to the high degree of uncertainty associated with 
determining whether a present obligation exists, and 
estimating the probability and amount of any outflows 
that may arise. See Note 1.2(i) on page 202.
Given the inherent uncertainties and the high level of 
subjectivity involved in the recognition or measurement of 
the items above, it is possible that the outcomes in the next 
financial year could differ from the expectations on which 
management’s estimates are based, resulting in the recognition 
and measurement of materially different amounts from those 
estimated by management in these Financial Statements.

Net interest income of $29.8bn decreased by $2.7bn or 8% 
compared with 2015. This was partly the impact of the disposal 
of our operations in Brazil on 1 July 2016, which reduced net 
interest income by ($1.2bn), and adverse effects of currency 
translation differences. These decreases were partly offset by 
growth in net interest income in Asia, notably in Hong Kong, 
and in Mexico, partly offset by a decrease in the UK and the US.
Net interest margin in 2016 of 1.73% was 15 basis points (‘bps’) 
lower than 2015. This reflected the effects of the disposal and 
currency translation noted above, which had an adverse effect 
of 8bps. The remainder of the decrease was primarily as a result 
of lower yields on customer lending, which had an adverse 
effect of 9bps on our net interest margin, partly reflecting the 
continuing run-off of our US CML portfolio. In addition, we 
recorded an increase in the cost of debt, partly offset by a lower 
cost of funds on customer accounts, notably in Hong Kong.
Interest income
Interest income decreased by $4.8bn compared with 2015, 
notably driven by our sale of Brazil operations ($3.1bn) and 
currency translation. Excluding these factors, total interest 
income increased marginally.
Interest income on loans and advances to customers decreased 
by $3.8bn, driven by a reduction of $1.9bn relating to our 
operations in Brazil, and the adverse effects of currency 
translation. Excluding these factors, interest income on 
customer lending was broadly unchanged. The effects of 
growth in balances in Europe and Mexico, together with central 
bank rate rises in Mexico and Argentina, were broadly offset by 
the run-off of our US CML portfolio and the effect of lower 
average balances in Asia.
Income growth in Mexico was driven by growth in average 
balances, reflecting gains in market share and higher yields, 
notably on term lending due to central bank rate increases. 
Income increased in Europe as the effect of growth in average 
balances, primarily an increase in term lending volumes, more 
than offset the effect of lower yields on both term lending and 
mortgages, reflecting competitive pricing in the market 
and lower interest rates in the eurozone. By contrast, interest 
income decreased in Asia, as a result of lower average balances 
in term lending, despite increased mortgage balances, notably 
in Hong Kong. Yields in Asia also decreased marginally as a 
result of central bank rate cuts in China during 2015, although 
these were partly offset by rate rises in Hong Kong.
Interest income on short-term funds and financial investments 
decreased by $1.0bn in 2016, including a decrease of $0.7bn 
relating to Brazil. Excluding the effect of currency translation 
and Brazil, interest income on short-term funds and financial 
investments increased by $0.2bn. The movement predominantly 
reflected increases in available-for-sale debt securities in Asia, 
reflecting growth in our surplus liquidity. In North America 
income increased, driven by higher balances primarily due to 
net purchase of US Treasury securities, and a higher yield, 
following the US rate rise at the end of 2015.
Interest income on reverse repurchase agreements – non-
trading was $0.1bn lower, including a decrease relating to Brazil 
($0.4bn). Excluding currency translation and Brazil, income 
increased primarily in North America, reflecting higher balances 
and improved market rates.
Interest expense
Reported interest expense decreased by $2.1bn, driven by the 
reductions relating to Brazil ($1.8bn) and currency translation. 
Excluding these factors, interest expense rose by $0.4bn, as 
increases in the cost of debt and repurchase agreements were 
partly offset by decreases in interest expense on customer 
accounts.
Interest expense on customer accounts decreased by $1.9bn, 
including amounts relating to Brazil ($0.8bn) and currency 
translation. Excluding these factors, interest expense on 
customer accounts decreased by $0.5bn, driven by Asia and 
Europe, partly offset by Mexico, Argentina and North America. 
In Asia, the effect of an increase in balances was more than 
offset by a lower cost of funds, partly a change in portfolio mix 
towards lower-cost accounts in Hong Kong, which more than 
offset the effect of central bank rate rises. In addition to these 
factors, the central bank rate cuts in a number of markets, 
including mainland China, Australia and India, further lowered 
our cost of funds. In Europe, interest expense decreased as a 
result of a reduction in the cost of funds, partly due to a 
negative rate environment, although the average balances 
increased, notably in the UK. These decreases were partly offset 
by higher interest expense on customer accounts in the US, 
Mexico and Argentina, reflecting promotional deposit offerings 
and the central bank rate rises.
Interest expense on debt securities in issue and own debt 
designated at fair value decreased by $0.5bn, including the 
impact of Brazil ($0.8bn). Excluding currency translation and the 
effect of Brazil, interest expense increased by $0.4bn. This was 
driven by an increase in the cost of funds and an increase in 
average balances, as redemptions across the Group were more 
than offset by issuances of senior debt from HSBC Holdings plc 
(‘HSBC Holdings’). The increase in the cost of debt designated 
at fair value was as a result of longer maturities and the 
structural subordination of our new issuances from HSBC 
Holdings.
Interest expense increased on repurchase agreements by 
$0.3bn, notably in North America, reflecting higher balances 
and market rates.

Net fee income fell by $1.9bn compared with 2015, partly as a 
result of the adverse effects of currency translation of $0.6bn, 
primarily in the UK, Argentina and Mexico, which notably 
affected account services, cards and fee expense. The sale of 
our operations in Brazil to Banco Bradesco S.A. reduced net 
fee income by a further $0.3bn. In addition, the decrease was 
driven by RBWM in Hong Kong, reflecting risk-averse retail 
investor sentiment in Asia.
Fee income from broking and unit trusts decreased by $525m, 
largely due to a strong performance in Hong Kong in the first 
half of 2015. The decrease was mainly in RBWM in Hong Kong, 
from lower securities broking income resulting from a reduction 
in stock market turnover.
In addition, fee income from cards decreased by $311m, 
primarily reflecting lower interchange fees in the UK, following 
regulatory change in late 2015.
Fee income from funds under management decreased by 
$0.5bn, partly driven by a reclassification between fee income 
from funds under management and fee expense in Germany 
($0.2bn). In addition, fee income from funds under management 
decreased in RBWM’s Global Asset Management business, 
driven by a change in the product mix towards lower margin 
fixed income products, as well as in GPB in Switzerland. 
The reduction in fee income from funds under management 
was partly offset by a fall in fee expense of $419m, primarily 
reflecting lower brokerage fees, and the reclassification noted 
above.

Net trading income of $9.5bn was $0.7bn higher than in 2015, 
despite the net adverse effects of $1.3bn of significant items 
and currency translation summarised in the table above. The 
increase (excluding the movements tabulated above) was driven 
by:
• favourable movements on assets held as economic hedges 
of foreign currency debt designated at fair value of $1.7bn in 
2016 compared to minimal movements in 2015. These 
movements were offset by adverse movements in foreign 
currency debt designated at fair value in ‘Net income/
(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair 
value’; and
• increases in GB&M ($0.2bn), notably in Rates and in Credit, 
as we gained market share in Europe, partly offset by a 
decrease in Equities, reflecting lower trading volumes 
in Europe and Asia. In addition, we recorded adverse 
movements of $70m in credit and funding valuation 
adjustments compared with favourable movements of 
$227m in the prior year, primarily relating to movements in 
our own credit spread on structured liabilities.

We recorded a net expense from financial instruments 
designated at fair value of $2.7bn in 2016, compared with net 
income of $1.5bn in 2015. In 2016, there were unfavourable 
movements of $1.8bn in the fair value of our own long-term 
debt reflecting changes in credit spread, compared with 
favourable movements of $1.0bn in 2015.
The decrease was also as a result of ‘Other changes in fair 
value’ on our long-term debt and related derivatives, which 
reflected:
• higher adverse movements of $1.7bn in 2016 compared 
with minimal movements in 2015 on foreign currency debt 
designated at fair value and issued as part of our overall 
funding strategy (offset by assets held as economic hedges 
in ‘Net trading income’); and
• higher adverse movements of $0.2bn relating to the 
economic hedging of interest and exchange rate risk on 
our long-term debt.
By contrast, net income from financial assets held to meet 
liabilities under insurance and investment contracts of $1.5bn 
was $0.9bn higher than in 2015. This was primarily driven by 
improved equity market performance in Asia and Europe in 
2016, partly offset by the disposal of our operations in Brazil 
in July 2016.
Net income arising from financial assets held to meet liabilities 
under insurance and investment contracts results in a 
corresponding movement in liabilities to customers, reflecting 
the extent to which they participate in the investment 
performance of the associated asset portfolio. These offsetting 
movements are recorded in ‘Net income/(expense) arising from 
liabilities to customers under investment contracts’ and ‘Net 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Financial summary
36 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities 
to policyholders’.
In 2016, the majority of the variance arose in unit-linked 
contracts where the policyholder bears the investment risk, and 
was therefore offset by movements in liabilities to customers.

Other operating income decreased by $2.0bn from 2015. This 
was as a result of the loss on the sale of our operations in Brazil 
of $1.7bn and the effects of the other significant items recorded 
in the table above. In addition, we recorded lower revaluation 
gains on investment properties.
These decreases were partly offset by higher favourable 
movements of $0.1bn in present value of in-force (‘PVIF’) long-
term insurance business, which was primarily driven by an 
increase in the value of new business written in Hong Kong, 
partly offset by a reduction in France and the impact of the 
disposal of our operations in Brazil.
In 2016, we recognised $513m of income in ‘Assumption 
changes and experience variances’, which was broadly 
unchanged from the $504m recognised in 2015. For further

movements of $0.2bn.
This increase was primarily due to improved returns on financial 
assets supporting unit-linked contracts, where the policyholder 
bears the investment risk, reflecting improved equity market 
performance in Hong Kong compared to 2015. In addition, 
movements in liabilities to policyholders were higher due to 
increased premium income, and interest rate-driven changes 
to liability valuations in Hong Kong.
These increases were partly offset by decreased premiums 
and reducing investment returns in France.

designated at fair value that are held to support these insurance 
contract liabilities are reported in ‘Net income/(expense) from

Loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions 
(‘LICs’) of $3.4bn were $0.3bn lower than in 2015. This was 
partly as a result of favourable currency translation differences 
of $0.2bn, notably in Mexico and the UK. In addition, our sale 
of operations in Brazil resulted in a $0.2bn reduction.
Collectively assessed LICs of $1.5bn were down $568m 
compared with 2015. This reduction included the net favourable 
effect of $230m as a result of our sale of operations in Brazil 
and favourable currency translation of $95m. The remaining 
variance reflected the following:
• In CMB (down $226m), a net release of collectively assessed 
LICs compared with a net charge in 2015. The net release of 
allowances in 2016 was primarily on exposures related to 
the oil and gas sector, notably in the US and Canada, the 
UAE and Asia. This reflected a more positive outlook for this 
sector. By contrast, in 2015 we increased our collective 
allowances on exposures related to the oil and gas sector. 
The reduction in collectively assessed LICs was partly offset 
by an increase in the UK, primarily reflecting new 
allowances against exposures in the oil and gas sector.
• In GB&M, a net release of collectively assessed LICs, notably 
in the UK and US, compared with a net charge in 2015.
This was partly offset:
• In RBWM, where collectively assessed LICs rose by $75m. 
The increase was mainly in Mexico reflecting our strategic 
focus on growing unsecured lending, as well as an increase 
in delinquency rates. By contrast, collectively assessed LICs 
decreased in a small number of markets in the Middle East 
and North Africa and Asia.
• In Corporate Centre, LICs increased in our US CML run-off 
portfolio by $67m.
Individually assessed LICs of $1.8bn increased by $326m 
compared with 2015. Higher charges in GB&M were partly 
offset by a reduction in CMB and favourable currency 
translation of $79m. This primarily reflected the following:
• In GB&M (up $0.6bn), the increase was primarily in the 
US related to a significant specific charge against a mining-
related corporate exposure, as well as charges relating to 
exposures in the oil and gas sector. Additionally, in Hong 
Kong, individually assessed LICs in 2016 largely related to a 
single corporate exposure. This compared with a net release 
of LICs in 2015.
This was partly offset:
• In CMB, lower individually assessed LICs (down $261m), 
included favourable currency translation of $70m and a 
net favourable effect of $45m attributable to our sale of 
operations in Brazil. The decrease also reflected lower 
individually assessed LICs in Indonesia, where charges in 
2015 related to a small number of exposures across multiple 
sectors. Lower charges in both the UK and the UAE also 
contributed to the reduction. These decreases were partly 
offset by higher LICs in Hong Kong, related to various 
sectors, including manufacturing, and in Canada due to a 
rise in the number of exposures in the oil and gas sector 
migrating to default. Notably, the increase in individually 
assessed LICs in Canada was more than offset by the 
movement in collective allowances related to the oil and 
gas sector, discussed above.
In 2016, we recorded higher net releases of impairment 
allowances against available for sale debt securities. These 
were primarily related to asset-backed securities (‘ABSs’) in 
our Legacy Credit business in Corporate Centre.
Operating expenses
In addition to detailing operating expense items by category, as set out in the table below, we also categorise adjusted expenses as follows:
• ‘Run-the-bank’ costs comprise business-as-usual running costs that 
keep operations functioning at the required quality and standard year 
on year, maintain IT infrastructure and support revenue growth. Run-
the-bank costs are split between front office and back office, reflecting 
the way the Group is organised into four global businesses (‘front 
office’) supported by global functions (‘back office’).
• ‘Change-the-bank’ costs comprise expenses relating to the 
implementation of mandatory regulatory changes and other 
investment costs incurred relating to projects to change business-
activity to enhance future operating capabilities.
• ‘Costs to achieve’ comprise those specific costs relating to the 
achievement of the strategic actions set out in the Investor Update in 
June 2015. They comprise costs incurred between 1 July 2015 and 
31 December 2017, and do not include ongoing initiatives such as 
Global Standards. Any costs arising within this category have been 
incurred as part of a significant transformation programme. Costs 
to achieve are included within significant items and incorporate 
restructuring costs that were identified as a separate significant 
item prior to 1 July 2015.

Reported operating expenses of $39.8bn were $40m higher 
than in 2015. This reflected an increase in significant items of 
$3.3bn which included:
• a $3.2bn write-off of the goodwill in our GPB business in 
Europe (please see Note 20 for further details);
• costs to achieve of $3.1bn, compared with $0.9bn in 2015; 
partly offset by
• the operating expenses incurred in our Brazil business of 
$1.1bn in 2016, compared with $2.5bn in 2015; and
• a reduction of $1.0bn in settlements and provisions in 
connection with legal matters.
The increase in significant items was partly offset by the 
favourable effects of currency translation of $2.1bn.

Excluding the significant items and currency translation

lower than in 2015. This primarily reflected cost savings of 
$2.2bn achieved in 2016 and a reduction in the UK bank levy 
of $0.5bn. This was partly offset by the impact of inflation 
and continued investment in regulatory programmes and 
compliance.
Run-the-bank costs of $26.9bn were $0.3bn lower than in 2015 
and change-the-bank costs of $2.7bn were $0.4bn lower than in 
2015. 
Our total investment in regulatory programmes and compliance, 
comprising both and change-the-bank elements, 
was $3.0bn, up $0.4bn or 14% from 2015. This reflected the 
ongoing implementation of our Global Standards programme to 
enhance our financial crime risk controls and capabilities, and to 
meet our external commitments.

40 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
We have maintained our transformational efforts and continue 
to realise the benefit of our cost-saving programme.
• Within RBWM, savings of $0.4bn reflected the impact of 
our branch optimisation programme enabled by our digital 
initiatives.
• Within Operations and Technology, savings of $1.2bn 
reflected migrations to lower cost locations, the 
simplification of our IT structure and the implementation 
of target operating models.
• Within our back office functions, savings of $0.4bn were 
realised as a result of the re-engineering and simplification 
of processes and the implementation of global operating 
models.
Taking the 2016 savings into account, our run rate savings are 
now $3.7bn since the start of our initiatives.
The number of employees expressed in FTEs at 31 December 
2016 was 235,175, a decrease of 20,028 since 31 December 
2015. This included a 19,145 reduction following our disposal 
of operations in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, the decrease in FTE 
was 883 as a reduction of 17,855 FTEs realised across global 
businesses and global functions was partly offset by investment 
in our Global Standards Programme of 5,694 FTEs, costs to 
achieve FTEs of 8,073 and investment for growth.

Our share of profit in associates and joint ventures was $2.4bn, 
a decrease of $0.2bn or 8%, which included the adverse effects 
of currency translation of $0.1bn, notably affecting our share of 
profit in BoCom.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, our share of profit 
in associates and joint ventures fell by $0.1bn or 4%, relating 
to higher impairment charges in the Saudi British Bank and 
lower revenue in HSBC Saudi Arabia, reflecting lower asset 
management and investment banking revenue. This was partly 
offset by revenue growth in Saudi British Bank and well-
managed costs in both associates.
Our share of profit in BoCom for the year was $1.9bn. At 
31 December 2016, we performed an impairment review 
of our investment in BoCom and concluded that it was not 
impaired, based on our value in use calculation (see Note 20 on 
the Financial Statements for further details).
In future periods, the value in use may increase or decrease 
depending on the effect of changes to model inputs. It is 
expected that the carrying amount will increase in 2017 due 
to retained profits earned by BoCom. At the point where the 
carrying amount exceeds the value in use, HSBC would 
continue to recognise its share of BoCom’s profit or loss, 
but the carrying amount would be reduced to equal the value 
in use, with a corresponding reduction in income, unless 
the market value has increased to a level above the carrying 
amount.

These included the non-deductible goodwill impairment and the 
non-deductible loss on our disposal of operations in Brazil. The 
2016 tax charge includes tax losses not recognised, prior year 
adjustments and the impact of the 8% bank corporation tax 
surcharge applicable in the UK from 1 January 2016. Further

Movement in 2016
Total reported assets of $2.4tn were 1% lower than at 
31 December 2015 on a reported basis, and 5% higher on 
a constant currency basis.
We have maintained the strength of our balance sheet, as 
targeted asset growth was partly offset by reductions in our 
legacy portfolios and the completion of our sale of operations in 
Brazil to Banco Bradesco S.A. We also issued more than $30bn 
of senior debt during the year from HSBC Holdings to build up 
the Group’s total loss-absorbing capacity in line with anticipated 
regulatory requirements.
Our ratio of customer advances to customer accounts was 68%. 
Loans and advances to customers fell on a reported basis by 
$63bn and customer accounts fell on a reported basis by $17bn. 
These changes included:
• adverse currency translation movements of $62bn on loans 
and advances to customers and $81bn on customer 
accounts;
• a $9bn reduction in corporate overdraft and current account 
balances relating to a small number of clients in our Global 
Liquidity and Cash Management business in the UK that 
settled their overdraft and deposit balances on a net basis; 
and
• an $11bn transfer to ‘Assets held for sale’ of US first lien 
mortgage balances in Corporate Centre.
Excluding these movements, customer lending increased by 
$19bn, as a result of strong fourth-quarter growth in Asia and 
increases in Europe throughout the year.
Assets 
Cash and balances at central banks increased by $29bn or 
29%, primarily from higher euro denominated balances in 
continental Europe, and in the US.
Trading assets increased by $10bn, mainly in Hong Kong and 
the US. This included higher balances in settlement accounts 
and an increase in debt and equity securities.
Reverse repurchase agreements – non-trading increased by 
$15bn, primarily in the US, as we managed our surplus 
liquidity to maximise returns.
Assets held for sale reduced by $40bn, of which $42bn related 
to our disposal of operations in Brazil.
Loans and advances to customers decreased by $63bn on a 
reported basis, primarily in Europe (down $48bn) and North 
America (down $17bn), partly offset by Asia (up $9bn). This 
included:
• adverse currency translation movements of $62bn;
• a $9bn reduction in corporate overdraft balances in Europe, 
with a corresponding fall in corporate customer accounts; 
and
• an $11bn transfer to ‘Assets held for sale’ of US first lien 
mortgage balances in Corporate Centre, reflecting our 
strategic focus on reducing our legacy portfolios. (We sold 
most of these loans during 2016).
Excluding these factors, customer lending balances increased 
by $19bn or 2%. We grew balances in Asia by $13bn, notably 
in Hong Kong in both GB&M ($8bn) and CMB ($4bn) in term 
lending, although trade lending remained broadly unchanged. 
We also grew RBWM balances ($4bn), particularly in 
mortgages in Hong Kong. We recorded particularly strong 
growth in the fourth quarter ($20bn) in the region. In addition, 
we increased balances in Europe by $15bn as a result of 
higher term lending in CMB and mortgages in RBWM, both 
mainly in the UK. By contrast, US GB&M balances fell, 
reflecting our active management of overall client returns. 
Liabilities
Customer accounts at 31 December 2016 were $17bn lower 
than at 31 December 2015 and included:
• adverse currency translation movements of $81bn; and
• a $9bn reduction in corporate current account balances, 
in line with a fall in corporate overdraft positions.
Excluding these factors, customer accounts grew by $73bn, 
primarily in RBWM and in GLCM in Hong Kong and the UK, 
with the latter driven by targeted customer mandate acquisition.
Trading liabilities increased by $12bn, mainly in the US, 
reflecting an increase in settlement accounts and net short 
positions from increased trading activity at the end of 2016, 
compared with the same period in 2015.
Financial liabilities designated at fair value increased by $20bn, 
reflecting new issuances of senior debt by HSBC Holdings.
Debt securities in issue fell by $23bn, mainly in HSBC Bank plc., 
following reductions in commercial paper issuances. These have 
been replaced by intra-group funding from HSBC Holdings from 
total loss-absorbing capacity resources. In the US, balances also 
fell, reflecting a lower funding requirement as we continued to 
run off legacy portfolios.
Liabilities of disposal groups held for sale decreased by $34bn, 
reflecting the completion of our sale of operations in Brazil.
Equity
Total shareholders’ equity fell by $13.1bn or 7%. The effects of 
profits generated in the year were more than offset by dividends 
paid and an increase in accumulated foreign exchange losses, 
reflecting the significant appreciation of the US dollar against 
the British pound and the euro. The net increase in treasury 
shares, principally reflecting our share buy-back initiative, also 
reduced shareholders’ equity by $2.5bn.
Risk-weighted assets
Risk-weighted assets (‘RWAs’) were $857.2bn at 31 December 
2016, a decrease of $245.8bn compared with 31 December 
2015. After foreign currency translation differences, RWAs 
reduced by $207.7bn in 2016. This reflected targeted RWA-
reduction initiatives of $143.2bn and the change of regulatory 
treatment of our investment in BoCom reducing RWAs by 
$120.9bn. This was partly offset by book size increases of 
$38.7bn.
The RWA initiatives included:
• exposure reductions, process improvements and refined 
calculations, which reduced RWAs by $69.8bn, 55% of 
which were in GB&M;
• the disposal of our activities in Brazil, which reduced RWAs 
by $41.8bn; and HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 43
• an accelerated sell-down of our consumer mortgage 
portfolio in the US and our Legacy Credit book, together 
contributing $31.6bn to the reduction
The book size increase of $38.7bn primarily came from higher 
term lending to corporate customers in CMB and higher general 
lending to customers in GB&M, both mainly in Europe and Asia.

Change in reportable segments
(Audited)
The Group Chief Executive as supported by the GMB is 
considered to be the CODM for the purposes of identifying the 
Group’s reportable segments.
They review operating activity on a number of bases, including 
by global business and geographical region. While in 2015 we 
considered the reportable segments to be the geographical 
regions, over time the focus of internal management reporting 
provided to the GMB and CODM has moved towards global 
business. The shift in internal reporting was further augmented 
in 2016 to include financial information and metrics on the 
consumption of, and returns on, capital by global business to 
support the GMB assessment of business performance and the 
allocation of capital resources. As a result global business is 
now the most prominent view used by management to allocate 
resources and assess performance, and is considered to be the 
Group’s reportable segment.
In addition, we made the following realignments within our 
internal reporting to the GMB and CODM:
• Creation of a Corporate Centre: Certain functions were 
combined to create a Corporate Centre. These include 
Balance Sheet Management, legacy businesses and 
interests in associates and joint ventures. The Corporate 
Centre also includes the results of our financing operations, 
central support costs with associated recoveries and the UK 
bank levy, previously reported within Other.
• Reallocation of Head Office costs: We have reviewed central 
costs previously reported in Other and reallocated them to 
 the global businesses where appropriate. Residual costs are 
reported within the Corporate Centre.
• Customer realignment: We conducted a number of internal 
reviews aligning customer requirements to those global 
businesses best suited to service their respective needs, 
resulting in the transfer of a portfolio of customers from 
CMB to GB&M and the transfer of certain policyholders in 
Asia from CMB to RBWM during the year.
Comparative data have been represented accordingly.
In addition, geographical comparative data for Europe and 
Middle East and North Africa have been re-presented to reflect 
the management oversight provided by our Middle East and 
North Africa region following the management services 
agreement entered between HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Bank 
Middle East Limited in 2016 in respect of HSBC Bank A.S. 
(Turkey).
Basis of preparation
Following the changes in internal reporting to the CODM, analysis by 
global business is considered more prominent than the geographical 
region view in the way the CODM assesses performance and allocates 
resources. The global businesses are therefore considered our 
reportable segments under IFRS 8.
Global business results are assessed by the CODM on the basis of 
adjusted performance that removes the effects of significant items and 
currency translation from reported results. We therefore present these 
results on an adjusted basis as required by IFRSs. The 2015 and 2014 
adjusted performance comparative information is presented on a 
constant currency basis as described on page 45.
As required by IFRS 8, reconciliations of the total adjusted global 
business results of the Group reported results are presented on page 
46. Supplementary reconciliations from reported to adjusted results by 
global business are presented on pages 47 to 51 for information 
purposes.
Our operations are closely integrated and, accordingly, the presentation 
of data includes internal allocations of certain items of income and 
expense. These allocations include the costs of certain support services 
and global functions to the extent that they can be meaningfully 
attributed to operational business lines and geographical regions. While 
such allocations have been made on a systematic and consistent basis, 
they necessarily involve a degree of subjectivity. Costs which are not 
allocated to global businesses are included in the Corporate Centre.
Where relevant, income and expense amounts presented include the 
results of inter-segment funding along with inter-company and inter-
business line transactions. All such transactions are undertaken on 
arm’s length terms. The intra-Group elimination items for the global 
businesses are presented in the Corporate Centre. 
The expense of the UK bank levy is included in the Europe geographical 
region as HSBC regards the levy as a cost of being headquartered in 
the UK. For the purposes of the presentation by global business, the 
cost of the levy is included in the Corporate Centre.
The results of geographical regions are presented on a reported basis.
A description of the global businesses is provided in the Strategic Report, 
pages 3, 18 and 19. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 45

products for RBWM, CMB, GB&M and Corporate Centre. 
These reflect the basis on which revenue performance of the 
businesses is assessed and managed.
For GPB, the key measure of business performance is client 
assets, which is presented below.
Adjusted return on risk-weighted assets (‘RoRWA’) is used to 
measure performance of RBWM, CMB, GB&M and GPB and 
is presented below.
Further information on the global businesses can be found in 
the Strategic Report on pages 18 to 19.
A reconciliation of changes in the global businesses is available 
in the re-segmentation data pack which can be found online at 
www.hsbc.com/investor-relations.

Insurance manufacturing for RBWM excluded other global businesses which contributed net operating income of $167m (2015: $171m) and profit before tax of $117m (2015: 
$108m) to overall insurance manufacturing. In 2016 insurance manufacturing net operating income for RBWM included $1,404m within Wealth Management (2015: $1,553m) and 
$127m within other products (2015: $156m). 
In total insurance manufacturing generated $2,634m of annualised new business premiums (2015: $2,349m) of which $2,519m (2015: $2,230m) related to RBWM. 
Distribution of insurance products by HSBC channels contributed $1,048m of net fee income (2015: $994m) of which RBWM channels earned $922m (2015: $896m). Of this total 
income, $615m was in respect of HSBC manufactured products (2015: $568m) and a corresponding fee expense is therefore recognised within the Insurance manufacturing.

Funds under management (‘FuM’) represents assets managed, 
either actively or passively, on behalf of our customers. At 
31 December 2016, FuM amounted to $831bn, a decrease of 
7% as a result of adverse foreign exchange movements and 
disposals, which included our sale of operations in Brazil, partly 
offset by favourable market performance.
Global Asset Management FuM decreased by 2% to $410bn 
compared with 31 December 2015. Excluding currency 
translation, FuM increased by 3% primarily as a result of 
positive market performance, with net new money from our 
retail and institutional customers in Asia into fixed income 
products being offset by outflows from our customers in Europe 
and the Americas.
GPB FuM decreased by 15% to $222bn compared with 
31 December 2015. Excluding currency translation, FuM 
decreased by 13%, reflecting the ongoing repositioning of 
our client base. This was partly offset by positive net new 
money in areas targeted for growth, notably in the UK, the 
Channel Islands and Hong Kong.
Other FuM, of which the main element is a corporate trust 
business in Asia, decreased by 7% to $197bn.
Assets held in custody
44
 and under administration
Custody is the safekeeping and servicing of securities and other 
financial assets on behalf of clients. At 31 December 2016, we 
held assets as custodian of $6.3tn, 1% higher than the $6.2tn 
held at 31 December 2015. The increase was driven by 
favourable foreign exchange movements in Asia, together with 
the onboarding of new clients in Europe and Asia. This was 
partly offset by adverse foreign exchange movements in the UK.
Our Assets Under Administration business, which includes the 
provision of bond and loan administration services and the 
valuation of portfolios of securities and other financial assets 
on behalf of clients, complements the Custody business. At 
31 December 2016, the value of assets held under 
administration by the Group amounted to $2.9tn. This was 7% 
lower than the $3.1tn held at 31 December 2015. The decrease 
primarily reflected net asset outflows in the Corporate Trust and 
Loan Agency business in North America, together with adverse 
foreign exchange movements in the UK.
Taxes paid by region and country
The following tables reflect a geographical view of HSBC’s 
operations.
Taxes paid by HSBC relate to HSBC’s own tax liabilities 
including tax on profits earned, employer taxes, bank levy and 
other duties/levies such as stamp duty. Numbers are reported 
on a cash flow basis.

The table above provides a summary of conduct-related costs 
incurred and included within significant items (see pages 33 
and 39).
The HSBC approach to conduct is designed to ensure that 
through our actions and behaviours we deliver fair outcomes for 
our customers and do not disrupt the orderly and transparent 
operation of financial markets. The Board places a strong 
emphasis on conduct, requiring adherence to high behavioural 
standards and adhering to the HSBC Values. Board oversight 
of conduct matters is provided by the Conduct & Values 
Committee, which oversees the embedding of HSBC Values and 
our required global conduct outcomes, and the Remuneration 
Committee, which considers conduct and compliance-related 
matters relevant to remuneration. These committees’ reports 
may be found on pages 143 to 145.
The management of business conduct and the steps taken to 
raise standards are described on page 81. ‘Regulatory focus on 
conduct of business and financial crime’ is one of the Group’s 
top and emerging risks and is discussed on page 66.
Provisions relating to significant items raised for conduct costs 
in 2016 resulted from the ongoing consequences of a small 
number of historical events.
Operating expenses included significant items related to 
conduct matters in respect of legal proceedings and regulatory 
matters of $1.0bn and customer remediation costs in respect 
of the mis-selling of payment protection insurance of $0.5bn. 
These are discussed in Note 27 and Note 35 of the Financial 
Statements.
Carbon dioxide emissions
To report carbon emissions, we use the revised edition of the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard guideline for disclosure that incorporates 
the Scope 2 market-based methodology.
We report carbon dioxide emissions resulting from energy use 
in our buildings and employees’ business travel.
For 29 countries where we operated in 2016, which accounted 
for approximately 92% of our full-time employees (‘FTEs’), we 
collect data on energy use and business travel. For the other 
countries where we have financial control and a small presence, 
we estimate emissions by scaling up from 92% to 100% of 
FTEs.
We then apply emission uplift rates to reflect uncertainty 
concerning the quality and coverage of emission measurement 
and estimation. The rates are 4% for electricity, 10% for other 
energy and 6% for business travel. This is consistent both with 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Good Practice 
Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories and our internal analysis of data coverage and 
quality.
Figures for 2016 and the previous year are in the following 
tables.

Our greenhouse gas reporting year runs from October to 
September. For the year from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 
2016, carbon dioxide emissions from our global operations were 
617,000 tonnes. Independent assurance of our carbon dioxide 
emissions will be available in the first half of 2017 on our 
website. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 63

information
Consolidated income statement/
Group performance by income and expense item
1 Dividends recorded in the financial statements are dividends per ordinary share
declared in a year and are not dividends in respect of, or for, that year.
2 Dividends per ordinary share expressed as a percentage of basic earnings per
share.
3 Return on risk-weighted assets (‘RoRWA’) is calculated using pre-tax return
and reported average RWAs.
4 Net interest income includes the cost of internally funding trading assets, while
the related external revenues are reported in ‘Trading income’. In our global
business results, the cost of funding trading assets is included with Global
Banking and Market’s net trading income as interest expense.
5 Gross interest yield is the average annualised interest rate earned on average
interest-earning assets (‘AIEA’).
6 Net interest spread is the difference between the average annualised interest
rate earned on AIEA, net of amortised premiums and loan fees, and the
average annualised interest rate paid on average interest-bearing funds.
7 Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as an annualised
percentage of AIEA.
8 Interest income on trading assets is reported as ‘Net trading income’ in the
consolidated income statement.
9 Interest income on financial assets designated at fair value is reported as ‘Net
income/(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair value’ in the
consolidated income statement.
10 Including interest-bearing bank deposits only.
11 Interest expense on financial liabilities designated at fair value is reported as
‘Net income on financial instruments designated at fair value’ in the
consolidated income statement, other than interest on own debt, which is
reported in ‘Interest expense’.
12 Including interest-bearing customer accounts only.
13 Trading income also includes movements on non-qualifying hedges. These
hedges are derivatives entered into as part of a documented interest rate
management strategy for which hedge accounting was not, nor could be,
applied. They are principally cross-currency and interest rate swaps used to
economically hedge fixed rate debt issued by HSBC Holdings and floating rate
debt issued by HSBC Finance. The size and direction of the changes in the fair
value of non-qualifying hedges that are recognised in the income statement
can be volatile from year-to-year, but do not alter the cash flows expected as
part of the documented interest rate management strategy for both the
instruments and the underlying economically hedged assets and liabilities if the
derivative is held to maturity.
14 Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities to
policyholders arise from both life and non-life insurance business. For non-life
business, amounts reported represent the cost of claims paid during the year
and the estimated cost of incurred claims. For life business, the main element
of claims is the liability to policyholders created on the initial underwriting of
the policy and any subsequent movement in the liability that arises, primarily
from the attribution of investment performance to savings-related policies.
Consequently, claims rise in line with increases in sales of savings-related
business and with investment market growth.
Consolidated balance sheet
15 Net of impairment allowances.
16 On 1 January 2014, CRD IV came into force and the calculation of capital
resources and RWAs for 2014 to 2016 are calculated and presented on this
basis. 2012 and 2013 comparatives are on a Basel 2.5 basis.
17 Capital resources are regulatory capital, the calculation of which is set out on
page 127.
18 Including perpetual preferred securities, details of which can be found in Note
28 on the Financial Statements.
19 The definition of net asset value per ordinary share is total shareholders’ equity,
less non-cumulative preference shares and capital securities, divided by the
number of ordinary shares in issue excluding shares the company has
purchased and are held in treasury.
20 In the first half of 2015 our operations in Brazil were classified as held for sale.
As a result, balance sheet accounts were classified as ‘Assets held for sale’ and
‘Liabilities of disposal groups held for sale’. There was no separate income
statement classification. The sale completed on 1 July 2016.
Global businesses and geographical regions
21 Net interest income includes the cost of internally funding trading assets, while 
the related revenues are reported in net trading income. In our global business 
results, the total cost of funding trading assets is included within Corporate 
Centre net trading income as an interest expense. In the statutory presentation, 
internal interest income and expense are eliminated. 
22 Net operating income before loan impairment charges and other credit risk 
provisions, also referred to as revenue.
23 Excludes items where there are substantial offsets in the income statement for
the same year.
24 ‘Own credit spread’ includes the fair value movements on our long-term debt 
attributable to credit spread where the net result of such movements will be 
zero upon maturity of the debt. This does not include fair value changes due to 
own credit risk in respect of trading liabilities or derivative liabilities.
25 ‘Investment distribution’ includes Investments, which comprises mutual funds
(HSBC manufactured and third party), structured products and securities
trading, and Wealth Insurance distribution, consisting of HSBC manufactured
and third-party life, pension and investment insurance products.
26 ‘Other personal lending’ includes personal non-residential closed-end loans
and personal overdrafts.
27 ‘Other’ mainly includes the distribution and manufacturing (where applicable)
of retail and credit protection insurance.
28 In 2016, credit and funding valuation adjustments included an adverse fair
value movement of $110m on the widening of own credit spreads on
structured liabilities (2015: favourable fair value movement of $179m; 2014:
favourable fair value movement of $12m).
29 ‘Other’ in GB&M includes net interest earned on free capital held in the global
business not assigned to products, allocated funding costs and gains resulting
from business disposals. Within the management view of total operating
income, notional tax credits are allocated to the businesses to reflect the
economic benefit generated by certain activities which is not reflected within
operating income; for example, notional credits on income earned from tax-
exempt investments where the economic benefit of the activity is reflected in
tax expense. In order to reflect the total operating income on an IFRS basis, the
offset to these tax credits are included within ‘Other’.
30 ‘Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other’ includes revenue
from Foreign Exchange, insurance manufacturing and distribution, interest rate
management and GCF products.
31 ‘Client assets’ are translated at the rates of exchange applicable for their 
respective period-ends, with the effects of currency translation reported 
separately. The main components of client assets were funds under 
management ($222bn at 31 December 2016) which were not reported on the 
Group’s balance sheet, and customer deposits ($76bn at 31 December 2016), 
of which $70bn was reported on the Group’s balance sheet and $6bn were off-
balance sheet deposits.
32 Amounts are non-additive across geographical regions due to inter-company 
transactions within the Group.
33 Risk-weighted assets are non-additive across geographical regions due to 
market risk diversification effects within the Group.
34 Other income in this context comprises where applicable net income/expense
from other financial instruments designated at fair value, gains less losses from
financial investments, dividend income, net insurance premium income and
other operating income less net insurance claims and benefits paid and
movement in liabilities to policyholders.
35 2015 and 2014 figures are restated for the changes explained on page 44.
36 For the purposes of the analysis of reported results by country table, HSBC 
Holdings profit/(loss) is presented excluding the effect of the early adoption of 
the requirements of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ relating to the presentation 
of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value’, which was 
early adopted in the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings but not in 
the consolidated financial statements of HSBC.
37 Adjusted RWAs are calculated using reported RWAs adjusted for the effects of
currency translation differences and significant items.
38 Adjusted RoRWA is calculated using adjusted profit before tax and adjusted
average risk-weighted assets.
39 Includes Head Office costs attributable to Global Business operations.
40 Client assets related to our Middle East clients are booked across to various 
other regions, primarily in Europe.
41 Excludes intra-Group dividend income.
42 Central Treasury includes revenue relating to BSM of $3,060m (2015:
$2,885m; 2014:$2,794m ), interest expense of $948m (2015: $710m; 2014:
$484m) and adverse valuation differences on issued long-term debt and
associated swaps of $278m (2015: loss of $64m; 2014: gain of $33m).
Revenue relating to BSM includes other internal allocations, including notional
tax credits to reflect the economic benefit generated by certain activities which
is not reflected within operating income, for example notional credits on
income earned from tax-exempt investments where the economic benefit of
the activity is reflected in tax expense. In order to reflect the total operating
income on an IFRS basis, the offset to these tax credits are included in other
Central Treasury.
43 Other miscellaneous items in Corporate Centre includes internal allocations
relating to Legacy Credit.
Other information
44 Funds under management and assets held in custody are not reported on the 
Group’s balance sheet, except where it is deemed that we are acting as 
principal rather than agent in our role as investment manager, and these assets 
are consolidated as Structured entities (see Note 19 on the Financial 
Statements).
45 Taxes paid by HSBC relate to HSBC’s own tax liabilities, including tax on profits 
earned, employer taxes, bank levy and other duties/levies such as stamp duty. 
Numbers are reported on a cash flow basis.
46 In the Annual Report and Accounts 2015, we applied our own internal
methodology which did not contain the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 2
quality criteria verification and the residual mix factors which are
recommended in the Scope 2 market-based methodology.

Our conservative risk appetite
Throughout its history, HSBC has maintained a conservative risk 
profile. This is central to our business and strategy.
The following principles guide the Group’s overarching risk 
appetite and determine how its businesses and risks are 
managed.
Financial position
• Strong capital position, defined by regulatory and internal 
capital ratios.
• Liquidity and funding management for each operating entity, 
on a stand-alone basis.
Operating model
• Returns generated in line with risk taken.
• Sustainable and diversified earnings mix, delivering 
consistent returns for shareholders.
Business practice
• Zero tolerance for knowingly engaging in any business, 
activity or association where foreseeable reputational risk 
or damage has not been considered and/or mitigated.
• No appetite for deliberately or knowingly causing detriment 
to consumers arising from our products and services or 
incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory 
requirements.
• No appetite for inappropriate market conduct by a member 
of staff or by any Group business.
Top and emerging risks
Our approach to identifying and monitoring top and emerging 
risks is described on page 70. During 2016, we made a number 
of changes to our top and emerging risks to reflect our 
assessment of the issues facing HSBC and their effect on the 
Group, which are described on page 27.
Our current top and emerging risks are as follows.
Externally driven
Economic outlook and capital flows
Global economic growth remained muted in 2016, with 
headwinds adversely affecting both developed and emerging 
markets.
The UK electorate’s vote to leave the European Union (‘EU’) 
caused significant market volatility in its immediate aftermath, 
and since then sterling has depreciated against major 
currencies. Uncertainty regarding the terms of the UK’s exit 
agreement, its future relationship with the EU and its trading 
relationship with the rest of the world may lead to economic 
uncertainty and market volatility, which could affect both the 
Group and its customers.
Following robust policy action during the course of 2016, 
market concerns have eased over the extent of the slowdown 
of the mainland Chinese economy, and the potential for further 
renminbi depreciation. However, a prolonged or severe 
slowdown cannot be ruled out, which would have wider 
ramifications for regional and global economic growth, and 
global trade and capital flows, as a consequence.
While oil and gas prices have partly recovered from the lows of 
2015, global supply and demand imbalances continue to place 
considerable financial strain on some producers and exporters. 
A continuation of low oil prices, particularly in conjunction with 
a low inflation environment and/or low or negative interest 
rates, would adversely affect global growth prospects and, as 
a consequence, our results.
Mitigating actions
• We actively assess the impact of economic developments 
in key markets on specific customers, customer segments 
or portfolios and take appropriate mitigating action – that 
may include revising risk appetite or limits – as 
circumstances evolve.
• We use internal stress testing and scenario analysis, as 
well as regulatory stress test programmes, to evaluate 
the potential impact of macroeconomic shocks on our 
businesses and portfolios. Analysis undertaken on our oil 
and gas lending portfolios are described on page 68, and 
our wider approach to stress testing is described on 
page 70.
• We have carried out detailed reviews of our wholesale credit 
portfolios, particularly across those sectors most affected by 
the UK referendum result. We have also run a number of 
stress tests on our wholesale and trading portfolios to 
examine potential impacts under a range of possible exit 
scenarios and develop a suite of possible mitigating actions.
Geopolitical risk
Our operations and portfolios are exposed to risks arising from 
political instability, civil unrest and military conflict in many 
parts of the world. These may include physical risk to our staff 
and/or physical damage to our assets, disruption to our 
operations and a curtailment in global trade flows.
The outcome of the US election has added to concerns about a 
rise in protectionism. This has been accentuated in many parts 
of the world by rapid technological change and income 
inequality. Any amplification of this trend could cause a 
curtailment in global trade, and thus impact HSBC’s traditional 
lines of business. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 65
European states are experiencing heightened political tension, 
reflecting concerns over migration, fears of terrorism, increased 
tension with Russia, and uncertainty about the future 
relationship between the UK and the EU. Elections in France, 
Germany, the Netherlands and possibly Italy in 2017 are adding 
to the uncertainty.
In the Middle East, the terrorist group Daesh has come under 
increasing pressure as an international coalition recaptured 
territory across Syria and Iraq. Despite this, Daesh has proved 
capable of carrying out terrorist attacks both in neighbouring 
countries and further afield.
In Asia, ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea 
and a region-wide build-up in military capability have strained 
diplomatic relations, and are testing the resolve of the US to 
defend freedom of navigation.
Mitigating actions
• We continually monitor the geopolitical outlook, in particular 
in countries where we have material exposures and/or a 
physical presence. We established a new dedicated forum 
to monitor and advise senior management on global 
developments, including analysis on how the Group’s 
strategy could be affected by geopolitical events.
• We have taken steps to increase the physical security of our 
premises and have enhanced our major incident response 
capabilities, particularly in those geographical areas deemed 
to be at a higher risk from terrorism and military conflicts.
• Our internal credit risk ratings of sovereign counterparties 
take geopolitical factors into account and drive our appetite 
for conducting business in those countries. Where 
necessary, we adjust our country limits and exposures to 
reflect our risk appetite and mitigate risks as appropriate.
• We incorporate geopolitical scenarios, such as conflicts in 
countries where we have a significant presence or political 
developments that could disrupt our operations, into our 
internal stress tests to assess their potential effect on our 
portfolios and businesses.
Turning of the credit cycle
Although the credit environment has stabilised in the latter part 
of the year, due in part to further monetary loosening, there is a 
risk that the credit cycle could turn sharply in 2017 if economic 
and/or geopolitical shocks unfold. 
Stress could appear across a wide array of credit segments, 
particularly given the substantial amounts of external 
refinancing due in emerging markets in 2017 and 2018. 
Sentiment towards mainland China could also deteriorate amid 
concerns over its increasing debt burden, or political events in 
the US, UK and EU could deliver negative economic outcomes. 
Impairment allowances could increase if the credit quality of 
our customers is affected by less favourable global economic 
conditions in some markets. Should oil prices remain low or fall, 
our oil and gas portfolios would come under further pressure.
Mitigating actions
• We closely monitor economic developments in key markets 
and sectors, taking portfolio actions where necessary, 
including enhanced monitoring, amending our risk appetite 
and/or reducing limits and exposures.
• We stress test portfolios of particular concern to identify 
sensitivity to loss under a range of scenarios, with 
management actions being taken to manage risk appetite 
where necessary.
• Reviews of key portfolios are undertaken regularly to ensure 
that individual customer or portfolio risks are understood 
and that the level of facilities offered and our ability to 
manage these through any downturn are appropriate.
Cyber threat and unauthorised access to systems 
HSBC and other public and private organisations continue to be 
the targets of increasing and more sophisticated cyber attacks 
that may disrupt customer services.
Mitigating actions
• We continue to strengthen and significantly invest in our 
ability to prevent, detect and respond to the ever-increasing 
and sophisticated threat of cyber attacks. Specifically, we 
continue to enhance our capabilities to protect against 
increasingly sophisticated malware, denial of service attacks 
and data leakage prevention, as well as enhancing our 
security event detection and incident response processes. 
• Cyber risk is a priority area for the Board and is regularly 
reported at Board level to ensure appropriate visibility, 
governance and executive support for our ongoing 
cybersecurity programme.
• We participate in intelligence sharing with both law 
enforcement and industry schemes to help improve our 
understanding of, and ability to respond to, the evolving 
threats faced by us and our peers within our industry.
Regulatory and technological developments with adverse 
impact on business model and profitability
Financial service providers continue to face stringent regulatory 
and supervisory requirements, particularly in the areas of capital 
and liquidity management, conduct of business, financial crime, 
operational structures, the use of models and the integrity of 
financial services delivery. The competitive landscape in which 
the Group operates may be significantly altered by future 
regulatory changes and government intervention, which 
could be introduced with different, potentially conflicting 
requirements and to differing timetables by different regulatory 
regimes. Regulatory changes may affect the activities of the 
Group as a whole, or of some or all of its principal subsidiaries.
While the rise of financial technology (‘fintech’) presents a 
number of opportunities that we are actively engaging in, there 
is also a risk that it could disrupt financial institutions’ 
traditional business model.
Mitigating actions
• We are engaged closely with governments and regulators 
in the countries in which we operate to help ensure that 
new requirements are considered properly by regulatory 
authorities and the financial sector and can be implemented 
effectively.
• We have strengthened governance and resourcing around 
regulatory change management. Significant regulatory 
programmes, such as the implementation of International 
Financial Reporting Standard 9, are overseen by the Group 
Change Committee (see ‘Execution risk’ on page 67).
• We are actively pursuing opportunities in the fintech space, 
and have established HSBC Digital Solutions, a specialist 
team to design, build and run digital services. We have also 
established a technology advisory board to help ensure we 
are fully aware of, and respond to, industry developments as 
they arise.
Regulatory focus on conduct of business and 
financial crime
Financial institutions remain under considerable scrutiny 
regarding conduct of business, particularly in relation to fair 
outcomes for customers and orderly and transparent operations 
in financial markets, as well as financial crime. Regulators, 
prosecutors, the media and the public all have heightened 
expectations as to the behaviour and conduct of financial 
institutions, and any shortcomings or failure to demonstrate 
adequate controls are in place to mitigate such risks could 
result in regulatory sanctions or fines. This could also lead to 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
66 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
an increase in civil litigation arising from or relating to issues 
which are subject to regulatory investigation, sanction or fine.
Mitigating actions
• We have created a new function, Financial Crime Risk, 
which brings together all areas of financial crime risk 
management at HSBC. For further details, see ‘Financial 
crime risk management’ on page 81.
• We have also continued to enhance our management of 
conduct in areas including the treatment of potentially 
vulnerable customers, market surveillance, employee 
training and performance management (see ‘Regulatory 
compliance risk management’ on page 81).
US deferred prosecution agreement and related 
agreements and consent orders
HSBC is subject to a five-year deferred prosecution agreement 
(‘US DPA’) with the US DoJ and related agreements and 
consent orders with the FRB, the OCC and the FCA. Under the 
agreements entered into with the DoJ and the FCA in 2012, an 
independent compliance monitor (the ‘Monitor’) was appointed 
in July 2013 for an expected five-year period to produce annual 
assessments of the effectiveness of the Group’s anti-money 
laundering (‘AML’) and sanctions compliance programme. 
The design and execution of the AML and sanctions 
remediation plans to address the findings of the US DPA and 
the Monitor are complex and require major investments in 
people, systems and other infrastructure. This complexity 
creates significant execution risk that could affect our ability to 
effectively identify and manage financial crime risk and remedy 
AML and sanctions compliance deficiencies in a timely manner. 
This, in turn, could impact our ability to satisfy the Monitor or 
comply with the terms of the US DPA and related agreements 
and consent orders, and may require us to take additional 
remedial measures in the future. These risks could be further 
heightened if the Monitor’s reports were to become public.
In February 2017, the Monitor delivered his third annual follow-
up review report as required by the US DPA. In his report, which 
is discussed on page 82, the Monitor concluded that, in 2016, 
HSBC continued to make progress in enhancing its financial 
crime compliance controls, including improvements to our 
global AML policies and procedures. However, the Monitor also 
expressed significant concerns about the pace of that progress, 
instances of potential financial crime that the DoJ and HSBC 
are reviewing further and on-going systems and control 
deficiencies that in his view raised questions as to whether 
HSBC is adhering to all its obligations under the US DPA. The 
Monitor also found that there remain substantial challenges 
for HSBC to meet its goal of developing a reasonably effective 
and sustainable AML and sanctions compliance programme. 
In addition, the Monitor did not certify as to HSBC’s 
implementation of and adherence to remedial measures 
specified in the US DPA.
Potential consequences of breaching the US DPA could include 
the imposition of additional terms and conditions on HSBC, an 
extension of the agreement, including its monitorship, or the 
criminal prosecution of HSBC that could, in turn, entail further 
financial penalties and collateral consequences. 
Moreover, HSBC Bank USA, as the primary US dollar 
correspondent bank for the Group, is subject to heightened 
financial crime risk arising from business conducted on behalf 
of clients as well as its non-US HSBC affiliates. If HSBC Bank 
USA fails to conduct adequate due diligence on clients, 
including its affiliates, or otherwise inappropriately processes 
US dollar payments on behalf of non-US HSBC affiliates, it 
could be in breach of applicable US AML and sanctions laws 
and regulations, become subject to legal or regulatory 
enforcement actions by OFAC or other US agencies and be 
required to pay substantial fines or penalties. In addition, any 
such breaches of US legislation could constitute a breach of the 
US DPA.
Under the terms of the US DPA, upon notice and an opportunity 
to be heard, the DoJ has sole discretion to determine whether 
HSBC has breached the US DPA. 
Mitigating actions
• We continued to make progress during 2016 toward putting 
in place an effective and sustainable AML and sanctions 
compliance programme, including through the creation of 
a new Financial Crime Risk function and improvements in 
technology and systems to manage financial crime risk.
• We are working to implement the agreed recommendations 
flowing from the Monitor’s previous reviews, and to 
implement the agreed recommendations from the 2016 
review.
Internally driven
IT systems infrastructure and resilience
HSBC continues to invest in the reliability and resilience of our 
IT Systems, to help ensure that disruption to customer services 
resulting in reputational and regulatory damage does not occur.
Mitigating actions
• We are part-way through a multi-year investment 
programme that is transforming how technology is 
developed, delivered and maintained, with a particular focus 
on providing high-quality, stable and secure services. As 
part of this, we are simplifying our service provision and 
replacing older IT infrastructure and applications. These 
investments are designed to improve IT systems resilience.
• During 2016, we continued to upgrade our IT Systems, 
improve disruption free change, and materially reduce the 
number of incidents relating to our critical business services. 
These enhancements led to a material improvement in 
service availability during the year and helped reduce impact 
to our customers and colleagues by 45% (when compared 
with the same period in 2015).
Impact of organisational change and regulatory 
demands on employees
The cumulative workload arising from our regulatory reform and 
remediation programmes, together with those related to the 
delivery of our strategy, continues to place increasingly complex 
and conflicting demands on a workforce that operates in an 
employment market where expertise in key markets is often in 
short supply and mobile. The scale of organisational change, 
including the establishment of the ring-fenced bank in the UK, 
has increased pressure on employees and requires us to ensure 
that key skills and experience are retained. Furthermore, the 
outcome of the UK referendum on EU membership has led to 
some uncertainties regarding movement of labour.
Mitigating actions
• We have enhanced our wellbeing programme to support 
our employees, particularly those affected by the Group’s 
considerable change agenda.
• Risks related to organisational change are subject to close 
management oversight. A range of actions are being 
developed to address the risks associated with the Group’s 
major change initiatives, including recruitment and extensive 
relocation support to existing employees in the UK ring-
fenced bank. 
• We continue to increase the level of specialist resource in 
key areas, and to engage with our regulators as they finalise 
new regulations. We use a broad array of talent-sourcing 
channels, succession planning for key management roles, 
and heightened promotion of opportunities internally, with 
particular attention in our more challenging markets. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 67
Execution risk
Execution risk remained heightened during 2016 as we 
continued to work towards delivering the strategic actions 
announced at the Investor Update in June 2015 (see page 12). 
These, along with the regulatory reform agenda and our 
commitments under the US DPA, require the management 
of significant projects that are resource intensive and time 
sensitive. Risks arising from the volume, magnitude and 
complexity of the projects underway to meet these demands 
may include regulatory censure, reputational damage or 
financial losses.
Mitigating actions
• We have strengthened our prioritisation and governance 
processes for significant projects. The Group Change 
Committee (‘GCC’), chaired by the Group Chief Operating 
Officer, oversees the most significant programmes and 
provides regular updates to the Risk Management Meeting 
of the GMB.
• The GCC monitors the concentration of deliverables to 
ensure that potential resource constraints over the medium 
term are understood and addressed.
Third-party risk management
We utilise third parties for the provision of a range of goods and 
services, in common with other financial services providers. 
Global regulators have increased their scrutiny of these 
arrangements and expect firms to be able to demonstrate 
adequate control over the selection, governance and oversight 
of their third parties, including affiliates. Any deficiency in our 
management of third-party risk could affect our ability to meet 
strategic, regulatory or client expectations. This may, in turn, 
lead to a range of consequences, including regulatory censure 
or reputational damage.
Mitigating actions
• We are part-way through a multi-year strategic programme 
to enhance our third-party risk management capability. This 
is designed to enable the consistent risk assessment of any 
third-party service against key criteria, along with associated 
control monitoring, testing and assurance throughout the 
third-party life cycle.
• A new Group policy and supporting framework was 
published in December 2016. The supporting delivery model 
and technology will be developed and will start to deploy in 
the second half of 2017.
Enhanced model risk management expectations 
We use models for a range of purposes in managing our 
business, including regulatory capital calculations, stress 
testing, credit approvals, financial crime and fraud risk 
management, and financial reporting. Regulatory requirements 
for models are rapidly increasing and often fast-moving. The 
scale and scope of model development expected by regulators 
pose significant execution challenges, especially where the 
breadth and scope are beyond what has previously been 
expected of the Group.
Regulatory scrutiny and supervisory concerns over banks’ use 
of models is considerable, particularly the internal models and 
assumptions used by banks in the calculation of regulatory 
capital. If regulatory approval for key capital models is not 
achieved in a timely manner, we could be required to hold 
additional capital.
Mitigating actions
• We have strengthened our model risk governance 
framework by establishing additional global model oversight 
committees and implementing policies and standards in 
accordance with key regulatory requirements.
• We have strengthened our governance over the 
development, usage and validation of models including 
the creation of centralised global analytical functions with 
necessary subject matter expertise.
• We have hired additional subject matter experts within our 
Independent Model Review sub-function and empowered 
the team to ensure appropriate challenge and feedback are 
given to models prior to and as part of their ongoing use.
• We have strengthened the model risk policy and introduced 
a Group-wide single model inventory system detailing key 
metrics on all models, and an assessment of their relative 
importance to the organisation.
Data management
The Group currently uses a large number of systems and 
applications to support business processes and operations. 
Multiple data sources, including customer data sources, 
introduce the need for reconciliation to reduce the risk of error. 
Strong data governance and enhanced data quality are required 
to meet our regulatory obligations relating to risk data 
aggregation and risk reporting as set out by the Basel 
Committee and our obligations under the US DPA, as well as to 
service our customers more effectively and improve our product 
offering.
Mitigating actions
• The Chief Information Officer continues to drive the 
Group’s efforts to enhance data governance, quality and 
architecture. These services underpin key programmes and 
initiatives, such as our Global Standards programme.
• We are significantly reducing the number of systems and 
applications that support key business processes, which will 
streamline the number of data sources across the Group, 
particularly data used in our customer and transaction 
screening processes.
• We continue to make progress on key initiatives and 
projects to implement our data strategy and work towards 
meeting our Basel Committee data obligations.
Areas of special interest
During 2016, we considered a number of particular areas 
because of the effect they may have on the Group. While these 
areas have been identified as part of our top and emerging 
risks, further details of the actions taken during the year are 
provided below.
Process of UK withdrawal from the European 
Union
The period of uncertainty and market volatility that followed the 
UK’s decision to leave the EU is likely to continue until the UK’s 
future relationship with the EU and the rest of the world is 
clearer. Given the time-frame and the complex negotiations 
involved, and assuming Article 50 is invoked by the end of 
March 2017, a clearer picture is not expected to emerge for 
some time. HSBC is working with clients as they adapt to this 
new environment and plan for what might follow. 
Meeting our customers’ needs following the UK’s departure 
from the EU will likely require adjustments to our cross-border 
banking model. However, with Article 50 not yet invoked and 
formal negotiations not yet initiated, it is too early to determine 
precisely what will be required or what the likely effects on 
HSBC might be. Despite this uncertainty, use of HSBC’s existing 
subsidiaries in France, Germany, Malta and Poland should help 
us more quickly and seamlessly adapt our banking model to this 
new landscape. Such changes could, among other things, 
increase our operating costs and require us to relocate staff 
and businesses outside the UK to other jurisdictions.
Through this period of uncertainty, our priorities are to continue 
to support our clients, take appropriate actions to mitigate risks 
and maintain stability, and deliver on our strategy. We are 
actively monitoring our portfolio to identify areas of stress, with 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
68 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
vulnerable sectors subject to management review to determine 
if any adjustment to our risk policy or appetite is required. As 
the UK's negotiating priorities and likelihood of achieving them 
become clearer, we will continue to monitor developments and 
take actions required to meet these priorities.
Oil and gas prices
Oil prices improved throughout 2016 and in early 2017, 
particularly after Opec agreed to cut supply levels. The improved 
oil prices resulted in a decline in new loan impairments in the 
second half of the year. The medium- to long-term outlook 
remains uncertain as technological change impacts the supply 
side through cheaper methods of extraction and the demand 
side through the development of renewable energy sources. At 
31 December 2016, HSBC’s overall portfolio directly exposed 
to oil and gas sector had drawn risk exposure of $28bn (2015: 
$29bn). The portfolio has the following credit quality 
distribution: ‘strong’ and ‘good’ 53% (2015: 56%), ‘satisfactory’ 
28% (2015: 35%), ‘sub-standard’ 15% (2015: 7%) and ‘impaired’ 
4% (2015: 2%), with the majority of the exposures located in 
North America, Asia and Europe. Loan impairment charges in 
2016 were approximately $0.3bn. The sector remains under 
enhanced monitoring with risk appetite and new lending 
significantly curtailed.
Risk management
This section describes the enterprise-wide risk management 
framework, and the significant policies and practices employed 
by HSBC in managing its material risks.
Our risk management framework
We use an enterprise-wide risk management framework across 
the organisation and across all risk types. It is underpinned by 
our risk culture and is reinforced by the HSBC Values and our 
Global Standards programme.
The framework fosters continuous monitoring of the risk 
environment, and an integrated evaluation of risks and their 
interactions. It also ensures a consistent approach to 
monitoring, managing and mitigating the risks we accept 
and incur in our activities.
The following diagram and descriptions summarise key aspects 
of the framework, including governance and structure, our risk 
management tools and our risk culture, which together help 
align employee behaviour with our risk appetite.
Key components of our risk management framework

Systems and tools
Our risk culture
Risk culture refers to HSBC’s norms, attitudes and behaviours 
related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management.
HSBC has long recognised the importance of a strong risk 
culture, the fostering of which is a key responsibility of senior 
executives. Our risk culture is reinforced by HSBC Values and 
our Global Standards programme. It is instrumental in aligning 
the behaviours of individuals with our attitude to assuming and 
managing risk, which helps to ensure that our risk profile 
remains in line with our risk appetite.
We use clear and consistent employee communication on risk 
to convey strategic messages and set the tone from senior 
management. We also deploy mandatory training on risk and 
compliance topics to embed skills and understanding in order to 
strengthen our risk culture and reinforce the attitude to risk in 
the behaviour expected of employees, as described in our risk 
policies. Mandatory training materials are updated regularly,  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 69
describing technical, cultural and ethical aspects of the various 
risks assumed by the Group and how they should be managed 
effectively. We operate a global whistleblowing platform, HSBC 
Confidential, allowing staff to report matters of concern 
confidentially. We also maintain an external email address for 
concerns about accounting and internal financial controls or 
auditing matters (accountingdisclosures@hsbc.com). The Group 
has a strict policy prohibiting retaliation against those who raise 
concerns by this route. All allegations of retaliation reported are 
escalated to senior management. For details on the governance 
of our whistleblowing policy, see pages 140 and 144.
Our risk culture is also reinforced by our approach to 
remuneration. Individual awards, including those for senior 
executives, are based on compliance with HSBC Values and 
the achievement of financial and non-financial objectives, 
which are aligned to our risk appetite and global strategy.
For further information on remuneration, see the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 153.
Governance and structure
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the effective 
management of risk and approves HSBC’s risk appetite. It is 
advised on risk-related matters by the Group Risk Committee 
(‘GRC’), the Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee 
(‘FSVC’), and the Conduct & Values Committee (‘CVC’) 
(see page 82).
Executive accountability for the monitoring, assessment 
and management of risk resides with the Group Chief Risk 
Officer. He is supported by the Risk Management Meeting 
of the Group Management Board (‘RMM’).
In the second half of 2016, we established a Financial Crime 
Risk (‘FCR’) function and appointed a Group Head of FCR, who 
reports to the Group Chief Executive and chairs the Global 
Standards Steering Meeting. The FCR function is dedicated to 
implementing the most effective global standards to combat 
financial crime, as described under ‘Financial crime risk 
management’ on page 81.
Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is delegated 
to senior managers with individual accountability for decision 
making. These managers are supported by global functions 
as described under ‘Three lines of defence’ below.
We use a defined executive risk governance structure to help 
ensure appropriate oversight and accountability of risk, which 
facilitates the reporting and escalation to the RMM. This 
structure is summarised below.

Our responsibilities
All employees are responsible for identifying and managing 
risk within the scope of their role as part of the three lines of 
defence model. 
Three lines of defence
We use an activity-based three lines of defence model to 
delineate management accountabilities and responsibilities 
for risk management and the control environment. This 
creates a robust control environment to manage risks.
The model underpins our approach to risk management by 
clarifying responsibility, encouraging collaboration, and 
enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. 
The three lines of defence are summarised below:
• The first line of defence owns the risks and is responsible 
for identifying, recording, reporting and managing them, 
and ensuring that the right controls and assessments are 
in place to mitigate them.
• The second line of defence sets the policy and guidelines 
for managing specific risk areas, provides advice and 
guidance in relation to the risk, and challenges the first 
line of defence on effective risk management.
• The third line of defence is our Internal Audit function, 
which provides independent and objective assurance of 
the adequacy of the design and operational effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management framework and control 
governance process.
Global Risk function
We have a Global Risk function, headed by the Group Chief Risk 
Officer, which is responsible for the Group’s risk management 
framework. This responsibility includes establishing global 
policy, monitoring risk profiles, and forward-looking risk 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
70 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
identification and management. Global Risk is made up of sub-
functions covering all risks to our operations. Global Risk forms 
part of the second line of defence. It is independent from the 
global businesses, including sales and trading functions, to 
provide challenge, appropriate oversight, and balance in risk/
return decisions.
Enterprise-wide risk management tools
The Group uses a range of tools to identify, monitor and 
manage risk. The key enterprise-wide risk tools are summarised 
below.
Risk appetite
The Group’s risk appetite defines its desired forward-looking 
risk profile, and informs the strategic and financial planning 
process. Furthermore, it is integrated with other key risk 
management tools, such as stress testing and our top and 
emerging risk reports, to help ensure consistency in risk 
management practices.
The Group sets out the aggregated level and risk types it 
accepts in order to achieve its business objectives in a risk 
appetite statement (‘RAS’). This is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis, and formally approved by the Board every six months 
on the recommendation of the GRC. 
The Group’s actual performance is reported monthly against 
the approved RAS to the RMM, enabling senior management 
to monitor the risk profile and guide business activity to balance 
risk and return. This reporting allows risks to be promptly 
identified and mitigated, and informs risk-adjusted 
remuneration to drive a strong risk culture.
Global businesses, regions and strategically important countries 
are required to have their own RASs, which are monitored to 
ensure they remain aligned with the Group’s. All RASs and 
business activities are guided and underpinned by qualitative 
principles (see page 143). Additionally, quantitative metrics are 
defined along with appetite and tolerance thresholds for key risk 
areas.
Risk map
The Group risk map provides a point-in-time view of the risk 
profiles of countries, regions and global businesses across all 
risk categories. It assesses the potential for these risks to have a 
material impact on the Group’s financial results, reputation and 
the sustainability of its business. Risk stewards assign ‘current’ 
and ‘projected’ risk ratings, supported by commentary. Risks 
that have an ‘amber’ or ‘red’ risk rating require monitoring and 
mitigating action plans to be either in place or initiated to 
manage the risk down to acceptable levels. 
Descriptions of our material banking and insurance risks are set out 
on page 71. 
Top and emerging risks
We use a top and emerging risks process to provide a forward-
looking view of issues with the potential to threaten the 
execution of our strategy or operations over the medium to 
long term.
We proactively assess the internal and external risk 
environment, as well as review the themes identified across our 
regions and global businesses, for any risks that may require 
global escalation, updating our top and emerging risks as 
necessary.
We define a ‘top risk’ as a thematic issue that may form and 
crystallise in between six months and one year, and that has 
the potential to materially affect the Group’s financial results, 
reputation or business model. It may arise across any 
combination of risk types, regions or global businesses. The 
impact may be well understood by senior management and 
some mitigating actions may already be in place. Stress tests 
of varying granularity may also have been carried out to assess 
the impact.
An ‘emerging risk’ is a thematic issue with large unknown 
components that may form and crystallise beyond a one-year 
time horizon. If it were to materialise, it could have a material 
effect on the Group’s long-term strategy, profitability and/or 
reputation. Existing mitigation plans are likely to be minimal, 
reflecting the uncertain nature of these risks at this stage. 
Some high-level analysis and/or stress testing may have 
been carried out to assess the potential impact.
Our current top and emerging risks are discussed on page 64.
Stress testing
HSBC operates a comprehensive stress testing programme that 
supports our risk management and capital planning. It includes 
execution of stress tests mandated by our regulators. Our stress 
testing is supported by dedicated teams and infrastructure, and 
is overseen at the most senior levels of the Group.
Our stress testing programme demonstrates our capital strength 
and enhances our resilience against external shocks. It also 
helps us understand and mitigate risks, and informs our 
decisions about capital levels. As well as taking part in 
regulators’ stress tests, we conduct our own internal stress 
tests. 
Many of our regulators – especially the Bank of England (‘BoE’), 
the Federal Reserve and the HKMA – utilise stress testing as an 
essential prudential regulatory tool and the Group has focused 
significant governance attention and resourcing to meet their 
requirements. We place particular emphasis on the global 
enterprise-wide stress test run on the Group by the BoE, our 
lead regulator.
In 2016, the results for HSBC as published by the BoE showed 
that our capital ratios after taking account of CRD IV restrictions 
and strategic management actions exceeded the BoE’s 
requirements. The results for HSBC included an assumed 
dividend payment in the first year of the severe stress projection 
period.
This outcome reflected our conservative risk appetite, and 
diversified geographical and business mix. It also reflected our 
ongoing strategic actions, including the sale of operations in 
Brazil, RWA reductions in GB&M and continued sales from our 
US CML run-off portfolio. These actions have materially reduced 
our RWAs, strengthened our capital position and made us even 
more robust under stress.
Bank of England stress test results for 2016
The BoE’s stress test in 2016 specified a global downturn with 
severe effects in the UK, US, Hong Kong and China, which 
accounted for approximately two-thirds of HSBC’s RWAs at the 
end of 2015. The assumed GDP growth rates are detailed in the 
following table. We estimated that the impact on global GDP in 
this scenario was about as severe as the global financial crisis 
of 2007 to 2009, but with a much greater focus on emerging 
markets. This made it particularly severe for HSBC, given its 
priority markets in these areas.

Data is presented in terms of the minimum CET1 ratio reached net of strategic 
management actions as per the results published by the PRA.
Internal stress tests are used intensively in our enterprise-wide 
risk management and capital management frameworks. Risks 
to our capital plan are assessed through a range of scenarios 
which explore risks that management needs to consider under 
stress. They include potential adverse macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and operational risk events, and potential events 
that are specific to HSBC. The selection of scenarios reflects 
our risk appetite relating to metrics such as profitability, 
capital or liquidity. Stress testing analysis helps management 
understand the nature and extent of any vulnerability. Using this 
information, management decides whether risks can or should 
be mitigated through management actions or, if they were to 
crystallise, should be absorbed through capital. This in turn 
informs decisions about preferred capital levels.
We conduct reverse stress tests each year at Group and, where 
required, subsidiary entity level in order to understand which 
potential extreme conditions would make our business model 
non-viable. Reverse stress testing identifies potential stresses 
and vulnerabilities we might face, and helps inform early 
warning triggers, management actions and contingency 
plans designed to mitigate risks.
In addition to the Group-wide stress testing scenarios, each 
major HSBC subsidiary conducts regular macroeconomic 
and event-driven scenario analyses specific to its region. They 
also participate as required in the regulatory stress testing 
programmes of the jurisdictions in which they operate, such 
as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Dodd-
Frank Act Stress Test programmes in the US, and the stress 
tests of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Global functions 
and businesses also perform bespoke stress testing to inform 
their assessment of risks in potential scenarios.
The Group stress testing programme is overseen by the GRC 
and results are reported, where appropriate, to the RMM 
and GRC.
Our material banking and insurance risks
The material risk types associated with our banking and 
insurance manufacturing operations are described in the 
following tables:
Description of risks – banking operations
Risks Arising from Measurement, monitoring and management of risk
Credit risk (see page 73)
Credit risk is the risk of
financial loss if a customer or
counterparty fails to meet an
obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises
principally from direct
lending, trade finance and
leasing business, but also
from certain other
products such as
guarantees and
derivatives.
Credit risk is:
• measured as the amount which could be lost if a customer or counterparty fails to 
make repayments; 
• monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits 
approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities; and
• managed through a robust risk control framework which outlines clear 
and consistent policies, principles and guidance for risk managers.
Liquidity and funding risk (see page 75)
Liquidity risk is the risk that 
we do not have sufficient 
financial resources to meet 
our obligations as they fall
due or that we can only do
so at an excessive cost. 
Funding risk is the risk that 
funding considered to be 
sustainable, and therefore 
used to fund assets, is not 
sustainable over time.
Liquidity risk arises from 
mismatches in the timing 
of cash flows. 
Funding risk arises when 
illiquid asset positions 
cannot be funded at the 
expected terms and when 
required.
Liquidity and funding risk is:
• measured using a range of metrics including liquidity coverage ratio and net stable 
funding ratio;
• monitored against the Group’s liquidity and funding risk framework; and
• managed on a stand-alone basis with no reliance on any Group entity (unless pre-
committed) or central bank unless this represents routine established business-as-
usual market practice.
Market risk (see page 77)
Market risk is the risk that
movements in market factors,
such as foreign exchange
rates, interest rates, credit
spreads, equity prices and
commodity prices, will reduce
our income or the value of our
portfolios.
Exposure to market risk is 
separated into two 
portfolios:
• trading portfolios; and
• non-trading portfolios. 
Market risk exposures 
arising from our insurance 
operations are discussed 
on page 123.
Market risk is:
• measured in terms of value at risk (‘VaR’), which measures the potential losses on 
risk positions over a specified time horizon for a given level of confidence, and 
assessed using stress testing;
• monitored using VaR, stress testing and other measures including the sensitivity of 
net interest income and the sensitivity of structural foreign exchange; and
• managed using risk limits approved by the RMM and the risk management meeting 
in various global businesses. 
Operational risk (see page 80)
Operational risk is the risk to
achieving our strategy or
objectives as a result of
inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and
systems or from external
events.
Operational risk arises 
from day-to-day operations 
or external events, and is 
relevant to every aspect of 
our business.
Regulatory compliance risk 
and financial crime 
compliance risk are 
discussed below. 
Operational risk is:
• measured using the risk and control assessment process, which assesses the level 
of risk and effectiveness of controls;
• monitored using key indicators and other internal control activities; and
• managed primarily by global business and functional managers that identify and 
assess risks, implement controls to manage them and monitor the effectiveness of 
these controls using the operational risk management framework.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
72 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Description of risks – banking operations
Risks Arising from Measurement, monitoring and management of risk
Regulatory compliance risk (see page 81)
Regulatory compliance risk is
the risk that we fail to observe
the letter and spirit of all
relevant laws, codes, rules,
regulations and standards of
good market practice, and
incur fines and penalties and
suffer damage to our business
as a consequence.
Regulatory compliance risk
is part of operational risk,
and arises from the risks
associated with breaching
our duty to clients and
other counter-parties,
inappropriate market
conduct and breaching
other regulatory
requirements.
Regulatory compliance risk is:
• measured by reference to identified metrics, incident assessments, regulatory 
feedback and the judgement and assessment of our Regulatory Compliance teams;
• monitored against our regulatory compliance risk assessments and metrics, the 
results of the monitoring and control activities of the second line of defence 
functions, and the results of internal and external audits and regulatory inspections; 
and 
• managed by establishing and communicating appropriate policies and procedures, 
training employees in them, and monitoring activity to help ensure their observance. 
Proactive risk control and/or remediation work is undertaken where required.
Financial crime risk (see page 81)
Financial crime risk is the
risk that we knowingly or
unknowingly help parties
to commit or to further
potentially illegal activity
through HSBC.
Financial crime risk is part
of operational risk and
arises from day-to-day
banking operations.
Financial crime risk is:
• measured by reference to identified metrics, incident assessments, regulatory 
feedback and the judgement and assessment of our Financial Crime Risk teams;
• monitored against our financial crime compliance risk appetite statement and 
metrics, the results of the monitoring and control activities of the second line of 
defence functions, and the results of internal and external audits and regulatory 
inspections; and 
• managed by establishing and communicating appropriate policies and procedures, 
training employees in them, and monitoring activity to help ensure their observance. 
Proactive risk control and/or remediation work is undertaken where required.
Other material risks
Reputational risk (see page 83)
Reputational risk is the risk of
failure to meet stakeholder
expectations as a result of any
event, behaviour, action or
inaction, either by HSBC itself,
our employees or those with
whom we are associated, that
might cause stakeholders to
form a negative view of the
Group.
Primary reputational risks
arise directly from an
action or inaction by
HSBC, its employees or
associated parties that are
not the consequence of
another type of risk.
Secondary reputational
risks are those arising
indirectly and are a result
of a failure to control any
other risks.
Reputational risk is:
• measured by reference to our reputation as indicated by our dealings with all 
relevant stakeholders, including media, regulators, customers and employees;
• monitored through a reputational risk management framework that is integrated 
into the Group’s broader risk management framework; and 
• managed by every member of staff, and covered by a number of policies and 
guidelines. There is a clear structure of committees and individuals charged with 
mitigating reputational risk.
Pension risk (see page 84)
Pension risk is the risk of
increased costs to HSBC from
the post-employment benefit
plans that HSBC has
established for its employees.
Pension risk arises from
investments delivering an
inadequate return, adverse
changes in interest rates
or inflation, or members
living longer than
expected. Pension risk
also includes operational
and reputational risk of
sponsoring pension plans.
Pension risk is:
• measured in terms of the scheme’s ability to generate sufficient funds to meet the 
cost of their accrued benefits;
• monitored through the specific risk appetite that has been developed at both Group 
and regional levels; and
• managed locally through the appropriate pension risk governance structure and 
globally through the Global Pensions Oversight Committee and ultimately the RMM.
Sustainability risk (see page 84)
Sustainability risk is the
risk that financial services

Sustainability risk arises
from the provision of
financial services to
companies or projects
which indirectly result
in unacceptable impacts
on people or on the
environment.
Sustainability risk is:
• measured by assessing the potential sustainability effect of a customer’s activities 
and assigning a Sustainability Risk Rating to all high risk transactions;
• monitored quarterly by the RMM and monthly by the Group’s Sustainability Risk 
function; and
• managed using sustainability risk policies covering project finance lending and 
sector-based sustainability policies for sectors and themes with potentially large 
environmental or social impacts.
Our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries are regulated 
separately from our banking operations. Risks in our insurance 
entities are managed using methodologies and processes that 
are subject to Group oversight. Our insurance operations are 
also subject to some of the same risks as our banking 
operations, which are covered by the Group’s risk
management processes. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 73
Description of risks – insurance manufacturing operations
Risks Arising from Measurement, monitoring and management of risk
Financial risk (see page 123)
Our ability to effectively match
liabilities arising under
insurance contracts with the
asset portfolios that back
them is contingent on the
management of financial risks
and the extent to which these
are borne by policyholders.
Exposure to financial risk 
arises from: 
• market risk affecting the fair 
values of financial assets or 
their future cash flows;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk of entities 
not being able to 
make payments to 
policyholders as they 
fall due.
Financial risk is:
• measured (i) for credit risk, in terms of economic capital and the amount that 
could be lost if a counterparty fails to make repayments; (ii) for market risk, in 
terms of economic capital, internal metrics and fluctuations in key financial 
variables; and (iii) for liquidity risk, in terms of internal metrics including stressed 
operational cash flow projections;
• monitored through a framework of approved limits and delegated authorities; 
and
• managed through a robust risk control framework which outlines clear and 
consistent policies, principles and guidance. This includes using product design, 
asset liability matching and bonus rates. 
Insurance risk (see page 125)
Insurance risk is the risk that,
over time, the cost of the
contract, including claims and
benefits, may exceed the total
amount of premiums and
investment income received.
The cost of claims and benefits
can be influenced by many
factors, including mortality and
morbidity experience, as well
as lapse and surrender rates.
Insurance risk is:
• measured in terms of life insurance liabilities and economic capital allocated to 
insurance underwriting risk;
• monitored through a framework of approved limits and delegated authorities; 
and
• managed through a robust risk control framework which outlines clear and 
consistent policies, principles and guidance. This includes using product design, 
underwriting, reinsurance and claims-handling procedures.
Credit risk management
Details of changes in our credit risk profile in 2016 can be found on 
page 85, in ‘Key developments and risk profile in 2016’.
There were no material changes to the policies and practices 
for the management of credit risk in 2016.
Credit risk sub-function
(Audited)
Credit approval authorities are delegated by the Board to the 
Group Chief Executive together with the authority to sub-
delegate them. The Credit Risk sub-function in Global Risk is 
responsible for the key policies and processes for managing 
credit risk, which include formulating Group credit policies and 
risk rating frameworks, guiding the Group’s appetite for credit 
risk exposures, undertaking independent reviews and objective 
assessment of credit risk, and monitoring performance and 
management of portfolios.
The principal objectives of our credit risk management are:
• to maintain across HSBC a strong culture of responsible 
lending, and robust risk policies and control frameworks; 
• to both partner and challenge our businesses in defining, 
implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite 
under actual and scenario conditions; and
• to ensure there is independent, expert scrutiny of credit 
risks, their costs and their mitigation.
Concentration of exposure
(Audited)
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of 
counterparties or exposures have comparable economic 
characteristics, or such counterparties are engaged in similar 
activities or operate in the same geographical areas or industry 
sectors so that their collective ability to meet contractual 
obligations is uniformly affected by changes in economic, 
political or other conditions. We use a number of controls 
and measures to minimise undue concentration of exposure 
in our portfolios across industries, countries and global 
businesses. These include portfolio and counterparty limits, 
approval and review controls, and stress testing.
Credit quality of financial instruments
(Audited)
Our risk rating system facilitates the internal ratings-based 
approach under the Basel framework adopted by the Group to 
support calculation of our minimum credit regulatory capital 
requirement.
The customer risk rating (‘CRR’) 10-grade scale summarises a 
more granular underlying 23-grade scale of obligor probability 
of default (‘PD’). All corporate customers are rated using the 10- 
or 23-grade scale, depending on the degree of sophistication of 
the Basel II approach adopted for the exposure.
Each CRR band is associated with an external rating grade by 
reference to long-run default rates for that grade, represented 
by the average of issuer-weighted historical default rates. This 
mapping between internal and external ratings is indicative and 
may vary over time.
The expected loss (‘EL’) 10-grade scale for retail business 
summarises a more granular underlying EL scale for this 
customer segment. This combines obligor and facility/product 
risk factors in a composite measure.
For the five credit quality classifications defined, each 
encompasses a range of granular internal credit rating grades 
assigned to wholesale and retail lending businesses, and the 
external ratings attributed by external agencies to debt 
securities.
For debt securities and certain other financial instruments, 
external ratings have been aligned to the five quality 
classifications based upon the mapping of related CRR to 
external credit rating. The mapping is reviewed on a regular 
basis and the most recent review resulted in sovereign BBB+ 
and BBB exposures previously mapped to Credit Quality band 
‘Good’ being mapped to Credit Quality Band ‘Strong’. Sovereign 
BB+ and BB exposures previously mapped to Credit Quality 
band ‘Satisfactory’ being mapped to Credit Quality Band ‘Good’. 
This represents a change in disclosure mapping unrelated to 
changes in counterparty creditworthiness. Had this mapping 
been applied in 2015, sovereign exposures would be changed 
as follows: ‘Satisfactory’ $1.4bn decrease, ‘Good’ $4.3bn 
decrease and $5.7bn ‘Strong’ increase.

Quality classification definitions
• ‘Strong’ exposures demonstrate a strong capacity to meet financial commitments, with negligible or low probability of default and/or low levels of 
expected loss.
• ‘Good’ exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate a good capacity to meet financial commitments, with low default risk.
• ‘Satisfactory’ exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate an average to fair capacity to meet financial commitments, with moderate 
default risk.
• ‘Sub-standard’ exposures require varying degrees of special attention and default risk is of greater concern.
• ‘Impaired’ exposures have been assessed as impaired, as described on page 90. These also include retail accounts classified as EL1 to EL8 that are 
delinquent by more than 90 days, unless individually they have been assessed as not impaired; and renegotiated loans that have met the 
requirements to be disclosed as impaired and have not yet met the criteria to be returned to the unimpaired portfolio (see below).
Renegotiated loans and forbearance
(Audited)
Where a loan is modified due to significant concerns about the 
borrower’s ability to meet contractual payments when due, a 
range of forbearance strategies is employed in order to improve 
the management of customer relationships, maximise collection 
opportunities and, if possible, avoid default, foreclosure or 
repossession.
Identifying renegotiated loans
Loans are identified as renegotiated loans when we modify the 
contractual payment terms due to significant credit distress of 
the borrower. ‘Forbearance’ describes concessions made on the 
contractual terms of a loan in response to an obligor’s financial 
difficulties. We classify and report loans on which concessions 
have been granted under conditions of credit distress as 
‘renegotiated loans’ when their contractual payment terms have 
been modified because we have significant concerns about the 
borrowers’ ability to meet contractual payments when due. 
When considering modification terms, the borrower’s continued 
ability to repay is assessed and where they are unrelated to 
payment arrangements, whilst potential indicators of 
impairment, these loans are not considered as renegotiated 
loans. In HSBC Finance, loan modification and re-age policies, 
renegotiated real estate loans are not eligible for a subsequent 
renegotiation for six or 12 months depending upon the action, 
with a maximum of five renegotiations permitted within a five-
year period. Loans that have been identified as renegotiated 
retain this designation until maturity or derecognition. A loan 
that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement 
is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially 
different terms or if the terms of an existing agreement are 
modified such that the renegotiated loan is substantially a 
different financial instrument. Any new loans that arise 
following derecognition events will continue to be disclosed 
as renegotiated loans.
Credit quality of renegotiated loans
On execution of the renegotiation, the loan will also be 
classified as impaired if it is not already so classified. In 
wholesale lending, all of the facilities with a customer, including 
loans which have not been modified, are considered impaired 
following the provision of a renegotiated loan. In our US CML 
run-off portfolio in HSBC Finance, loans which are in the early 
stages of delinquency (less than 60 days delinquent) and 
typically have the equivalent of two payments deferred for the 
first time are not considered impaired, as the contractual 
payment deferrals are deemed to be insignificant compared 
with payments due on the loan as a whole.
Those loans that are considered impaired retain the impaired 
classification for a minimum of one year. Renegotiated loans 
will continue to be disclosed as impaired until there is sufficient 
evidence to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of 
non-payment of future cash flows (the evidence typically 
comprises a history of payment performance against the 
original or revised terms), and there are no other indicators of 
impairment. In our US CML run-off portfolio in HSBC Finance, 
all modified loans with terms of more than two years are 
considered to be permanently impaired.
Renegotiated loans and recognition of impairment 
allowances
(Audited)
For retail lending, renegotiated loans are segregated from other 
parts of the loan portfolio for collective impairment assessment 
to reflect the higher rates of losses often encountered in these 
segments.
For wholesale lending, renegotiated loans are typically assessed 
individually. Credit risk ratings are intrinsic to the impairment 
assessment. The individual impairment assessment takes into 
account the higher risk of the non-payment of future cash flows 
inherent in renegotiated loans.
Impairment assessment
(Audited)
For details of our impairment policies on loans and advances 
and financial investments, see Note 1 to the Financial 
Statements.
Write-off of loans and advances
(Audited)
For details of our policy on the write-off of loans and advances, 
see Note 1 to the Financial Statements. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 75
In HSBC Finance, the carrying amounts of residential mortgages 
and second lien loans in excess of net realisable value are 
written off at or before the time foreclosure is completed or 
settlement is reached with the borrower. If there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery, and foreclosure is pursued, 
the loan is normally written off no later than the end of the 
month in which the loan becomes 180 days contractually past 
due.
Unsecured personal facilities, including credit cards, are 
generally written off at between 150 and 210 days past due. 
The standard period runs until the end of the month in which 
the account becomes 180 days contractually delinquent. Write-
off periods may be extended, generally to no more than 360 
days past due but, in very exceptional circumstances, to longer 
in a few countries where local regulation or legislation constrain 
earlier write-off, or where the realisation of collateral for secured 
real estate lending takes this time.
For secured personal facilities, final write-off should generally 
occur within 60 months of the default at the latest. 
In the event of bankruptcy or analogous proceedings, write-off 
may occur earlier than the periods stated above. Collection 
procedures may continue after write-off.
Impairment methodologies for available-for-sale asset-
backed securities (‘ABSs’)
(Audited)
To identify objective evidence of impairment for available-for-
sale ABSs, an industry standard valuation model is normally 
applied which uses data with reference to the underlying asset 
pools and models their projected future cash flows. The 
estimated future cash flows of the securities are assessed at the 
specific financial asset level to determine whether any of them 
are unlikely to be recovered as a result of loss events occurring 
on or before the reporting date.
The principal assumptions and inputs to the models are typically 
the delinquency status of the underlying loans, the probability of 
delinquent loans progressing to default, the prepayment profiles 
of the underlying assets and the loss severity in the event of 
default. However, the models utilise other variables relevant 
to specific classes of collateral to forecast future defaults and 
recovery rates. Management uses externally available data 
and applies judgement when determining the appropriate 
assumptions in respect of these factors. We use a modelling 
approach which incorporates historically observed progression 
rates to default to determine if the decline in aggregate 
projected cash flows from the underlying collateral will lead to a 
shortfall in contractual cash flows. In such cases, the security is 
considered to be impaired.
In respect of collateralised debt obligations (‘CDOs’), expected 
future cash flows for the underlying collateral are assessed to 
determine whether there is likely to be a shortfall in the 
contractual cash flows of the CDO.
When a security benefits from a contract provided by a 
monoline insurer that insures payments of principal and 
interest, the expected recovery on the contract is assessed in 
determining the total expected credit support available to the 
ABS.
Liquidity and funding risk management
Details of changes in our liquidity and funding risk profile in 2016 can 
be found on page 85, in ‘Key developments and risk profile in 2016’.
Liquidity and funding risk management framework 
HSBC has an internal liquidity and funding risk management 
framework (‘LFRF’) which aims to allow it to withstand very 
severe liquidity stresses. It is designed to be adaptable to 
changing business models, markets and regulations.
The management of liquidity and funding is primarily 
undertaken locally (by country) in our operating entities in 
compliance with the Group’s LFRF, and with practices and 
limits set by the GMB through the RMM and approved by the 
Board. Our general policy is that each defined operating entity 
should be self-sufficient in funding its own activities. Where 
transactions exist between operating entities, they are reflected 
symmetrically in both entities.
As part of our asset, liability and capital management (‘ALCM’) 
structure, we have established asset and liability committees 
(‘ALCO’) at Group level, in the regions and in operating entities. 
The terms of reference of all ALCOs include the monitoring and 
control of liquidity and funding.
The primary responsibility for managing liquidity and funding 
within the Group’s framework and risk appetite resides with the 
local operating entities’ ALCOs, Holdings ALCO and the RMM. 
The remaining smaller operating entities are overseen by 
regional ALCOs, with appropriate escalation of significant 
issues to Holdings ALCO and the RMM.
Operating entities are predominantly defined on a country 
basis to reflect our local management of liquidity and funding. 
Typically, an operating entity will be defined as a single legal 
entity. However, to take account of the situation where 
operations in a country are booked across multiple subsidiaries 
or branches:
• an operating entity may be defined as a wider sub-
consolidated group of legal entities if they are incorporated 
in the same country, liquidity and funding are freely fungible 
between the entities and permitted by local regulation, and 
the definition reflects how liquidity and funding are 
managed locally; or
• an operating entity may be defined more narrowly as a 
principal office (branch) of a wider legal entity operating in 
multiple countries, reflecting the local country management 
of liquidity and funding.
The RMM reviews and agrees annually the list of entities it 
directly oversees and the composition of these entities.
Key developments in 2016
On 1 January 2016, the Group implemented a new LFRF. It uses 
the liquidity coverage ratio (‘LCR’) and net stable funding ratio 
(‘NSFR’) regulatory framework as a foundation, but adds extra 
metrics, limits and overlays to address firm-specific risks:
The LFRF is delivered using the following key aspects:
• stand-alone management of liquidity and funding by 
operating entity;
• operating entity classification by inherent liquidity risk (‘ILR’) 
categorisation;
• minimum LCR requirement depending on ILR categorisation; 
• minimum NSFR requirement depending on ILR 
categorisation;
• legal entity depositor concentration limit;
• three-month and 12-month cumulative rolling term 
contractual maturity limits covering deposits from banks, 
deposits from non-bank financial institutions and securities 
issued;
• annual individual liquidity adequacy assessment by principal 
operating entity;
• minimum LCR requirement by currency;
• intra-day liquidity; and
• forward-looking funding assessments.
The new internal LFRF and the risk tolerance limits were 
approved by the Board on the basis of recommendations made 
by the Group Risk Committee.
Our annual individual liquidity adequacy assessment process 
aims to:
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
76 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
• identify risks that are not reflected in the LFRF, and, where 
required, to assess additional limits required locally; and 
• validate the risk tolerance at the operating entity level by 
demonstrating that reverse stress testing scenarios are 
acceptably remote and ensuring vulnerabilities have been 
assessed through the use of severe stress scenarios.
Management of liquidity and funding risk
Liquidity coverage ratio
The HSBC application of the LCR metric involves the following 
two key assumptions about the definition of operational 
deposits and the ability to transfer liquidity from non-EU 
legal entities:
• we define operational deposits as transactional (current) 
accounts arising from the provision of custody services 
by HSBC Security Services or Global Liquidity and Cash 
Management, where the operational component is assessed 
to be the lower of the current balance and the separate 
notional values of debits and credits across the account 
in the previous calculation period; and
• we assume no transferability of liquidity from non-EU 
entities other than to the extent currently permitted.
Net stable funding ratio
HSBC uses the NSFR as a basis for establishing stable funding 
around the Group.
Liquid assets of HSBC’s principal operating entities
Liquid assets are held and managed on a stand-alone operating 
entity basis. Most are held directly by each operating entity’s 
Balance Sheet Management (‘BSM’) department, primarily for 
the purpose of managing liquidity risk in line with the LFRF.
The liquid asset buffer may also include securities in held-to-
maturity portfolios. To qualify as part of the liquid asset buffer, 
held-to-maturity portfolios must have a deep and liquid repo 
market in the underlying security.
Liquid assets also include any unencumbered liquid assets held 
outside BSM departments for any other purpose. The LFRF 
gives ultimate control of all unencumbered assets and sources 
of liquidity to BSM.
Sources of funding
Customer deposits in the form of current accounts and savings 
deposits payable on demand or at short notice form the 
significant part of our stable funding, and we place considerable 
importance on maintaining their stability. For deposits, stability 
depends upon maintaining depositor confidence in our capital 
strength and liquidity, and on competitive and transparent 
pricing.
We also access wholesale funding markets by issuing senior 
secured and unsecured debt securities (publicly and privately) 
and borrowing from the secured repo markets against high-
quality collateral, in order to obtain funding for non-banking 
subsidiaries that do not accept deposits, to align asset and 
liability maturities and currencies, and to maintain a presence 
in local wholesale markets.
Ordinary share capital and retained reserves, non-core capital 
instruments and total loss-absorbing capacity (‘TLAC’) eligible 
debt securities are also a source of stable funding.
Analysis of on-balance sheet encumbered and 
unencumbered assets and off-balance sheet collateral
An asset is defined as encumbered if it has been pledged as 
collateral against an existing liability and, as a result, is no 
longer available to the Group to secure funding, satisfy collateral 
needs or be sold to reduce the funding requirement. An asset 
is therefore categorised as unencumbered if it has not been 
pledged against an existing liability. Unencumbered assets are 
further segmented into four separate sub-categories: ‘Readily 
realisable assets’, ‘Other realisable assets’, ‘Reverse repo/stock 
borrowing receivables and derivative assets’ and ‘Cannot be 
pledged as collateral’.
Liquidity behaviouralisation
All stable deposits are assumed under the Group’s frameworks 
to have a liquidity behaviouralised life beyond one year and to 
represent a homogeneous source of stable funding. The 
behaviouralisation of assets is far more granular and seeks to 
differentiate the period for which we must assume that we will 
need stable funding for the asset.
Funds transfer pricing
Our funds transfer pricing policies give rise to a two-stage funds 
transfer pricing approach, reflecting the fact that we separately 
manage interest rate risk and liquidity and funding risk under 
different assumptions. They have been developed to be 
consistent with our risk management frameworks. Each 
operating entity is required to apply the Group’s transfer pricing 
policy framework to determine for each material currency the 
most appropriate interest rate risk transfer pricing curve, a 
liquidity premium curve (which is the spread over the interest 
rate risk transfer pricing curve) and a liquidity recharge 
assessment (which is the spread under or over the interest 
rate risk transfer pricing curve).
Repos and stock lending
GB&M provides collateralised security financing services to 
its clients, providing them with cash financing or specific 
securities. When cash is provided to clients against collateral 
in the form of securities, the cash provided is recognised on the 
balance sheet as a reverse repo. When securities are provided 
to clients against cash collateral, the cash received is 
recognised on the balance sheet as a repo or, if the securities 
are equity securities, as stock lending.
Each operating entity manages its collateral through a central 
collateral pool, in line with the LFRF. When specific securities 
need to be delivered and the entity does not have them 
currently available within the central collateral pool, the 
securities are borrowed on a collateralised basis. When 
securities are borrowed against cash collateral, the cash 
provided is recognised on the balance sheet as a reverse repo 
or, if the securities are equity securities, as stock borrowing.
Operating entities may also borrow cash against collateral in the 
form of securities, using the securities available in the central 
collateral pool. Repos and stock lending can be used in this way 
to fund the cash requirement arising from securities owned 
outright by Markets to facilitate client business, and the net 
cash requirement arising from financing client securities 
activity.
Reverse repos, stock borrowing, repos and stock lending are 
reported net when the IFRS offsetting criteria are met. In 
some cases, transactions to borrow or lend securities are 
collateralised using securities. These transactions are off-
balance sheet.
Any security accepted as collateral for a reverse repo or stock 
borrowing transaction must be of very high quality and its value 
subject to an appropriate haircut. Securities borrowed under 
reverse repo or stock borrowing transactions can only be 
recognised as part of the liquidity asset buffer for the duration 
of the transactions and only if the security received is eligible 
under the liquid asset policy within the LFRF.
Credit controls are in place to ensure that the fair value of any 
collateral received remains appropriate to collateralise the cash 
or fair value of securities given.
HSBC Holdings
HSBC Holdings’ primary sources of cash are dividends received 
from subsidiaries, interest on and repayment of intra-group 
loans and securities, and interest earned on its own liquid 
funds. HSBC Holdings also raises ancillary funds in the debt 
capital markets through subordinated and senior debt  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 77
issuances. Cash is primarily used for the provision of capital and 
subordinated funding to subsidiaries, interest payments to debt 
holders and dividend payments to shareholders.
HSBC Holdings is also subject to contingent liquidity risk by 
virtue of credit-related commitments and guarantees and similar 
contracts issued. Such commitments and guarantees are only 
issued after due consideration of HSBC Holdings’ ability to 
finance the commitments and guarantees and the likelihood 
of the need arising.
HSBC Holdings actively manages the cash flows from its 
subsidiaries to optimise the amount of cash held at the holding 
company level. During 2016, consistent with the Group’s capital 
plan, the Group’s subsidiaries did not experience any significant 
restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and 
advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged 
with regard to planned dividends or payments. However, the 
ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to 
HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, their 
respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, 
exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and 
operating performance.
None of the subsidiaries that are excluded from our regulatory 
consolidation has capital resources below its minimum 
regulatory requirement.

The nature of the hedging and risk mitigation strategies 
performed across the Group corresponds to the market risk 
management instruments available within each operating 
jurisdiction. These strategies range from the use of traditional 
market instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to more 
sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of 
risk factors arising at the portfolio level.
Market risk governance
(Audited)
Market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved 
by the RMM for HSBC Holdings. These limits are allocated 
across business lines and to the Group’s legal entities.
General 
measures
HSBC Holdings Board
GB&M manages market risk, where the majority of HSBC’s total value at risk (excluding insurance) and 
almost all trading VaR resides, using risk limits approved by the RMM. VaR limits are set for portfolios, 
products and risk types, with market liquidity being a primary factor in determining the level of limits set. 
Global Risk is responsible for setting market risk management policies and measurement techniques.
Each major operating entity has an independent market risk management and control sub-function which 
is responsible for measuring market risk exposures, monitoring and reporting these exposures against the 
prescribed limits on a daily basis. The market risk limits are governed according to the framework illustrated 
to the left.
Each operating entity is required to assess the market risks arising on each product in its business and to 
transfer them to either its local GB&M unit for management, or to separate books managed under the 
supervision of the local ALCO.
Model risk is governed through Model Oversight Committees (‘MOCs’) at the regional and global Wholesale 
Credit and Market Risk levels. They have direct oversight and approval responsibility for all traded risk 
models used for risk measurement and management and stress testing. We are committed to the ongoing 
development of our in-house risk models.
The Markets MOC reports into the Group MOC, which oversees all model risk types at Group level. The 
Group MOC informs the RMM about material issues at least two times a year. The RMM is the Group’s 
‘Designated Committee’ according to regulatory rules and has delegated day-to-day governance of all 
traded risk models to the Markets MOC. 
Global Risk enforces trading in permissible instruments approved for each site, new product approval 
procedures, restricting trading in the more complex derivative products only to offices with appropriate 
levels of product expertise and robust control systems.

Market risk measures
Monitoring and limiting market risk exposures
Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures 
while maintaining a market profile consistent with our risk 
appetite. 
We use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk 
exposures including sensitivity analysis, value at risk and 
stress testing.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market 
factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios, 
including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity 
prices, such as the effect of a one basis point change in yield. 
We use sensitivity measures to monitor the market risk 
positions within each risk type. Sensitivity limits are set 
for portfolios, products and risk types, with the depth of the 
market being a principal factor in determining the level.
Value at risk
(Audited)
Value at risk (‘VaR’) is a technique for estimating potential 
losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market 
rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given 
level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk 
management and calculated for all trading positions regardless 
of how we capitalise them. Where there is not an approved 
internal model, we use the appropriate local rules to capitalise 
exposures. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading 
portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. Where we do not 
calculate VaR explicitly, we use alternative tools as summarised 
in the ‘Stress testing’ section below.
Our models are predominantly based on historical simulation 
which incorporate the following features:
• historical market rates and prices are calculated with 
reference to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, 
interest rates, equity prices and the associated volatilities; 
• potential market movements utilised for VaR are calculated 
with reference to data from the past two years; and
• VaR measures are calculated to a 99% confidence level and 
use a one-day holding period. 
The models also incorporate the effect of option features on the 
underlying exposures. The nature of the VaR models means that 
an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase 
in VaR without any changes in the underlying positions. 
VaR model limitations
Although a valuable guide to risk, VaR should always be viewed 
in the context of its limitations. For example:
• use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events 
may not encompass all potential events, particularly extreme 
ones;
• the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can 
be liquidated or the risks offset during that period, which 
may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times 
of severe illiquidity, when the holding period may be 
insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully;
• the use of a 99% confidence level does not take into 
account losses that might occur beyond this level of 
confidence; and
• VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at 
the close of business and therefore does not necessarily 
reflect intra-day exposures.
Risk not in VaR framework
The risks not in VaR (‘RNIV’) framework aims to capture and 
capitalise material market risks that are not adequately covered 
in the VaR model, such as the LIBOR tenor basis. 
Risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and either 
incorporated directly in the VaR models, where possible, or 
quantified through the VaR-based RNIV approach or a stress 
test approach within the RNIV framework. The outcome of the 
VaR-based RNIV is included in the VaR calculation and back-
testing; a stressed VaR RNIV is also computed for the risk 
factors considered in the VaR-based RNIV approach.
Stress-type RNIVs include a gap risk exposure measure to 
capture risk on non-recourse margin loans and a de-peg risk 
measure to capture risk to pegged and heavily-managed 
currencies.
Stress testing
Stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated 
into our market risk management framework to evaluate the 
potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme, although 
plausible, events or movements in a set of financial variables. 
In such scenarios, losses can be much greater than those 
predicted by VaR modelling.
Stress testing is implemented at legal entity, regional and 
overall Group levels. A set of scenarios is used consistently 
across all regions within the Group. Scenarios are tailored to 
capture the relevant potential events or market movements 
at each level. The risk appetite around potential stress losses 
for the Group is set and monitored against referral limits.
Market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise 
that there is a fixed loss. The stress testing process identifies 
which scenarios lead to this loss. The rationale behind the 
reverse stress test is to understand scenarios that are beyond 
normal business settings and could have contagion and 
systemic implications.
Stressed VaR and stress testing, together with reverse stress 
testing and the management of gap risk, provide management 
with insights regarding the ‘tail risk’ beyond VaR, for which 
HSBC’s appetite is limited.
Trading portfolios
Back-testing
We routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-
testing them against both actual and hypothetical profit and 
loss against the corresponding VaR numbers. Hypothetical 
profit and loss excludes non-modelled items such as fees, 
commissions and revenues of intra-day transactions. 
We would expect, on average, to see two or three profits and 
two or three losses in excess of VaR at the 99% confidence level 
over a one-year period. The actual number of profits or losses in 
excess of VaR over this period can therefore be used to gauge 
how well the models are performing. 
We back-test our Group VaR at various levels that reflect a full 
legal entity scope of HSBC, including entities that do not have 
local permission to use VaR for regulatory purposes.
Structural foreign exchange exposures
Structural foreign exchange exposures represent net 
investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, the 
functional currencies of which are currencies other than the 
US dollar. An entity’s functional currency is that of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates.
Exchange differences on structural exposures are recognised 
in ‘Other comprehensive income’. We use the US dollar as our 
presentation currency in our consolidated financial statements 
because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major 
currency bloc in which we transact and fund our business. Our 
consolidated balance sheet is, therefore, affected by exchange 
differences between the US dollar and all the non-US dollar 
functional currencies of underlying subsidiaries.
We hedge structural foreign exchange exposures only in limited 
circumstances. Our structural foreign exchange exposures are 
managed with the primary objective of ensuring, where  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 79
practical, that our consolidated capital ratios and the capital 
ratios of individual banking subsidiaries are largely protected 
from the effect of changes in exchange rates. 
Interest rate risk in the banking book
The Asset, Liability and Capital Management (‘ALCM’) function 
is responsible for measuring and controlling interest rate risk 
in the banking book under the supervision of the RMM.
The component of the interest rate risk in the banking book 
outside Balance Sheet Management (‘BSM’) or Global Markets 
that can be economically neutralised by fixed-rate government 
bonds or interest rate derivatives is transfer priced to and 
managed by BSM. The banking book interest rate risk 
transferred to BSM is reflected in the Group’s non-traded 
VaR measure.
BSM is overseen by the Market Risk and Product Control 
functions in exactly the same way as Global Markets.
The price at which interest rate risk is transferred to BSM is 
determined by the entity’s prevailing interest rate risk transfer 
pricing curve defined by operating entities Asset and Liability 
Management Committee (‘ALCO’), in accordance with the 
Group’s funds transfer pricing policies. The transfer price seeks 
to reflect the price at which BSM could neutralise the risk in the 
market at the point of transfer.
The banking book interest rate risk within HSBC Holdings is 
not transferred to BSM and is managed as an ALCO book.
Interest rate risk behaviouralisation
In assessing the banking book interest rate risk outside BSM 
and Global Markets, interest rate repricing behaviouralisation 
techniques are used where the interest repricing profile is 
uncertain due to customer/bank optionality or where non-
interest bearing balances are withdrawable.
The maximum tenor to which any individual tranche of a non-
interest bearing withdrawable/repayable customer balance or 
equity can be behaviouralised is 10 years. The maximum 
weighted average behaviouralised tenor for any portfolio is five 
years. Interest-bearing managed/administered rate balances 
are behaviouralised to tenors less than one year, typically one 
month or three months.
The maximum percentage of any portfolio that can be 
behaviouralised is 90% with the residual treated as contractual, 
meaning overnight.
Unlike liquidity risk, which is assessed on the basis of a very 
severe stress scenario, banking book interest rate risk is 
assessed and managed according to business-as-usual 
conditions. In many cases, the contractual profile of banking 
book assets/liabilities arising from assets/liabilities created 
outside Markets or BSM does not reflect the behaviour 
observed.
Where there is no certainty with regard to interest rate repricing 
profile, behaviouralisation is used to assess the market interest 
rate risk of banking book assets/liabilities and this assessed 
market risk is transferred to BSM, in accordance with the rules 
governing the transfer of interest rate risk from the global 
businesses to BSM.
Behaviouralisation is applied in three key areas:
• the assessed repricing frequency of managed rate balances;
• the assessed duration of non-interest bearing balances, 
typically capital and current accounts; and
• the base case expected prepayment behaviour or pipeline 
take-up rate for fixed-rate balances with embedded 
optionality.
Interest rate behaviouralisation policies have to be formulated in 
line with the Group’s behaviouralisation policies and approved 
at least annually by local ALCOs.
The extent to which balances can be behaviouralised is driven 
by:
• the amount of the current balance that can be assessed as 
constant under business-as-usual conditions; and
• for managed rate balances, the historical market interest 
rate repricing behaviour observed; or
• for non-interest bearing balances, the duration for which 
the balance is expected to remain under business-as-usual 
conditions. This assessment is often driven by the re-
investment tenors available to BSM to neutralise the risk 
through the use of fixed-rate government bonds or interest 
rate derivatives, and for derivatives the availability of cash 
flow hedging capacity.
Measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book
Interest rate risk in the banking book is measured and 
controlled using three metrics:
• non-traded VaR;
• net interest income sensitivity; and
• economic value of equity.
Non-traded VaR excludes the non-traded interest rate risk not 
transferred to BSM and the non-traded interest rate risk of 
HSBC Holdings.
Net interest income (‘NII’) sensitivity captures the expected 
impact of changes in interest rates on base case projected net 
interest income.
Economic value of equity (‘EVE’) captures the expected impact 
of changes in interest rates on base case economic value. It 
captures all non-traded items irrespective of the profit and loss 
accounting treatment. 
Balance Sheet Management 
Effective governance across BSM is supported by the dual 
reporting lines it has to the Chief Executive Officer of GB&M 
and to the Group Treasurer. In each operating entity, BSM is 
responsible for managing liquidity and funding under the 
supervision of the local ALCO (which usually meets on a 
monthly basis). It also manages the banking book interest rate 
positions transferred to it within a Markets limit structure. 
In executing the management of the liquidity risk on behalf of 
ALCO, and managing the banking book interest rate positions 
transferred to it, BSM invests in highly rated liquid assets in line 
with the Group’s liquid asset policy. The majority of the liquidity 
is invested in central bank deposits and government, 
supranational and agency securities, with most of the remainder 
held in short-term interbank and central bank loans.
Withdrawable central bank deposits are accounted for as cash 
balances. Interbank loans, statutory central bank reserves and 
loans to central banks are accounted for as loans and advances 
to banks. BSM’s holdings of securities are accounted for as 
available-for-sale or, to a lesser extent, held-to-maturity assets. 
Statutory central bank reserves are not recognised as liquid 
assets. The statutory reserves that would be released in line 
with the Group’s stressed customer deposit outflow 
assumptions are reflected as stressed inflows.
BSM is permitted to use derivatives as part of its mandate to 
manage interest rate risk. Derivative activity is predominantly 
through the use of vanilla interest rate swaps which are part 
of cash flow hedging and fair value hedging relationships. 
Credit risk in BSM is predominantly limited to short-term bank 
exposure created by interbank lending, exposure to central 
banks and high-quality sovereigns, supranationals or agencies 
which constitute the majority of BSM’s liquidity portfolio. BSM 
does not manage the structural credit risk of any Group entity 
balance sheet. 
BSM is permitted to enter into single name and index credit 
derivatives activity, but it does so to manage credit risk on the 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
80 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
exposure specific to its securities portfolio in limited 
circumstances only. The risk limits are extremely limited and 
closely monitored. At 31 December 2016, BSM had no open 
credit derivative index risk.
VaR is calculated on positions held in BSM and is calculated 
by applying the same methodology used for the Markets 
business and utilised as a tool for market risk control purposes.
The vast majority of BSM’s VaR arises from banking book 
portfolios and is classified as non-traded VaR.
BSM is predominantly involved in managing liquidity in 
accordance with the LFRF, managing the daily cash position 
and managing the non-traded interest rate risk transferred to 
it, within non-traded market risk limits.
Net interest income sensitivity
A principal part of our management of non-traded interest rate 
risk is to monitor the sensitivity of expected net interest income 
under varying interest rate scenarios (simulation modelling), 
where all other economic variables are held constant. This 
monitoring is undertaken at an entity level by local ALCOs.
Entities apply a combination of scenarios and assumptions 
relevant to their local businesses, and standard scenarios which 
are required throughout HSBC. The latter are consolidated to 
illustrate the combined pro forma effect on our consolidated 
net interest income.
Projected net interest income sensitivity figures represent the 
effect of the pro forma movements in projected yield curves 
based on a static balance sheet size and structure assumption, 
other than instances where the size of the balances or repricing 
is deemed interest rate sensitive (non-interest bearing current 
account migration and fixed rate loan early prepayment) and 
where non-traded VaR is assumed to contractually run off. This 
effect, however, does not incorporate actions which would 
probably be taken by BSM or in the business units to mitigate 
the effect of interest rate risk. In reality, BSM proactively seeks 
to change the interest rate risk profile to optimise net revenues. 
The net interest income sensitivity calculations assume that 
interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the 
‘up-shock’ scenario. Rates are not assumed to become negative 
in the ‘down-shock’ scenario unless the central bank rate is 
already negative and then not assumed to go further negative, 
which may, in certain currencies, effectively result in non-
parallel shock. In addition, the net interest income sensitivity 
calculations take account of the effect on net interest income of 
anticipated differences in changes between interbank interest 
rates and interest rates over which the entity has discretion in 
terms of the timing and extent of rate changes.
Economic value of equity
An economic value of equity (‘EVE value’) represents the 
present value of future banking book cash flows that could 
be distributed to equity providers under a managed run-off 
scenario, which represents the current book value of equity 
plus the present value of future net interest income under a 
managed run-off scenario. The present value of net interest 
income under a managed run-off and under any interest rate 
scenario can therefore be assessed by deducting the book 
value of equity from the EVE value calculated. 
An EVE sensitivity is the extent to which the EVE value will 
change due to a pre-specified movement in interest rates, 
where all other economic variables are held constant. The EVE 
sensitivity represents the sensitivity of discounted net interest 
income plus the sensitivity of the net present value of any 
transactions used to hedge the interest income earned on 
equity. If the EVE sensitivity is adjusted to remove the sensitivity 
in net present value of any transactions used to hedge the 
interest income earned on equity, the resulting adjusted EVE 
sensitivity represents the extent to which, under a managed 
run-off scenario, discounted net interest income is sensitive to 
a pre-specified movement in interest rates.
When assessing the sensitivity of economic value of equity to 
interest rate movements, the timing of principal cash flows can 
vary but the amount remains constant.
Operating entities are required to monitor EVE sensitivity 
as a percentage of total capital resources and adjusted EVE 
sensitivity as a percentage of the present value of future net 
interest income (base case EVE minus book value of equity) 
under a managed run-off assumption. 
EVE can also be used for assessing the economic capital 
required to support interest rate risk in the banking book 
(‘IRRBB’): 
• Where EVE under any scenario is higher than the current 
balance sheet carrying value of equity, the banking book 
income stream is positive (i.e. profit) and therefore capital 
accretive under that scenario and no economic capital for 
IRRBB is required.
• Where EVE of any scenario is lower than the current balance 
sheet carrying value of equity, the banking book income 
stream is negative (i.e. loss) and therefore capital deductive 
under that scenario and economic capital for IRRBB should 
be held against this loss.
Where banking book assets/liabilities are fair valued through 
profit and loss or where the fair value changes impact capital 
resources (i.e. available for sale), economic capital for this 
interest rate sensitivity is additionally assessed using a stressed 
VaR approach.
HSBC Holdings
As a financial services holding company, HSBC Holdings has 
limited market risk activity. Its activities predominantly involve 
maintaining sufficient capital resources to support the Group’s 
diverse activities; allocating these capital resources across 
our businesses; earning dividend and interest income on its 
investments in our businesses; providing dividend payments 
to its equity shareholders and interest payments to providers 
of debt capital; and maintaining a supply of short-term capital 
resources for deployment under extraordinary circumstances. 
It does not take proprietary trading positions.
The main market risks to which HSBC Holdings is exposed 
are banking book interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. 
Exposure to these risks arises from short-term cash balances, 
funding positions held, loans to subsidiaries, investments in 
long-term financial assets and financial liabilities including debt 
capital issued. The objective of HSBC Holdings’ market risk 
management strategy is to reduce exposure to these risks 
and minimise volatility in capital resources, cash flows and 
distributable reserves. Market risk for HSBC Holdings is 
monitored by Holdings ALCO in accordance with its risk 
appetite statement.
HSBC Holdings uses interest rate swaps and cross-currency 
interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk and foreign 
currency risk arising from its long-term debt issues.
Operational risk management
Details of our operational risk profile in 2016 can be found on page 121, in 
‘Operational risk exposures in 2016’.
Responsibility for minimising operational risk lies with all 
HSBC’s employees. Specifically, all staff are required to manage 
the operational risks of the business and operational activities 
for which they are responsible.
Overview
The objective of our operational risk management is to manage 
and control operational risk in a cost-effective manner within 
targeted levels of operational risk consistent with our risk 
appetite, as defined by the GMB. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 81
Key developments in 2016
HSBC’s operational risk management framework (‘ORMF’) is 
our overarching approach for managing operational risk, the 
purpose of which is to:
• identify and manage our non-financial operational risks in an 
effective manner;
• remain within the Group’s operational risk appetite, which 
helps the organisation understand the level of risk it is 
willing to accept; and
• drive forward-looking risk awareness and assist 
management focus during 2016.
Activity to strengthen our risk culture and better embed the use 
of the ORMF was further implemented in 2016, in particular the 
use of the activity-based three lines of defence model, which 
sets out roles and responsibilities for managing operational risks 
on a daily basis.
Further information on the three lines of defence model can be found in 
the ‘Our risk management framework’ section on page 68.
Governance and structure
The ORMF defines minimum standards and processes, and the 
governance structure for the management of operational risk 
and internal control in our geographical regions, global 
businesses and global functions. The ORMF has been codified 
in a high-level standards manual, supplemented with detailed 
policies, which describes our approach to identifying, assessing, 
monitoring and controlling operational risk and gives guidance 
on mitigating action to be taken when weaknesses are 
identified.
Operational risk is organised as a specific risk discipline within 
Global Risk, and a formal governance structure provides 
oversight over its management. The Global Operational Risk 
sub-function supports the Group Chief Risk Officer and the 
Global Operational Risk Committee. It is responsible for leading 
the embedding of the ORMF and assurance of adherence to 
associated policies and processes across the first and second 
lines. It is also responsible for preparation of operational risk 
reporting at Group level, including reports for consideration 
by the RMM and the Group Risk Committee. The Global 
Operational Risk Committee meets at least quarterly to discuss 
key risk issues and review the effective implementation of the 
ORMF.
Key risk management processes
Business managers throughout the Group are responsible 
for maintaining an acceptable level of internal control 
commensurate with the scale and nature of operations, and 
for identifying and assessing risks, designing controls and 
monitoring the effectiveness of these controls. The ORMF helps 
managers to fulfil these responsibilities by defining a standard 
risk assessment methodology and providing a tool for the 
systematic reporting of operational loss data.
A centralised database is used to record the results of the 
operational risk management process. Operational risk and 
control self-assessments are inputted and maintained by 
business units. Business and functional management and 
business risk and control managers monitor the progress of 
documented action plans to address shortcomings. To help 
ensure that operational risk losses are consistently reported and 
monitored at Group level, all Group companies are required to 
report individual losses when the net loss is expected to exceed 
$10,000, and to aggregate all other operational risk losses under 
$10,000. Losses are entered into the Group operational risk 
database and reported to the RMM on a monthly basis.
Regulatory compliance risk management
Overview
The Regulatory Compliance sub-function (‘RC’) provides 
independent, objective oversight and challenge and promotes 
a compliance-orientated culture, supporting the business in 
delivering fair outcomes for customers, maintaining the integrity 
of financial markets and achieving HSBC’s strategic objectives.
Key developments in 2016
In the second half of 2016, we restructured part of our Global 
Risk function. The Financial Crime Compliance sub-function 
became part of our new Financial Crime Risk function, which 
reports directly to the Group Chief Executive (see ‘Financial 
crime risk management’ below). The RC sub-function remains 
part of Global Risk, and continues to oversee management of 
regulatory compliance risk.
Governance and structure
The Global Head of RC reports to the Group Chief Risk Officer. 
To align with our global business structure and help ensure 
coverage of local regulatory requirements, RC is structured as 
a global function with regional and country RC teams, which 
support and advise each global business and global function.
Key risk management processes
We regularly review our policies and procedures. Global policies 
and procedures require the prompt identification and escalation 
of any actual or potential regulatory breach to RC. Reportable 
events are escalated to the RMM and the Group Risk 
Committee, as appropriate. Matters relating to the Group’s 
regulatory conduct of business are reported to the Conduct 
& Values Committee.
Conduct of business
In 2016, we continued to take steps to raise our standards 
relating to conduct, which included:
• designing further global mandatory conduct training for 
delivery to all employees in 2017;
• incorporating the assessment of expected values and 
behaviours as key determinants in recruitment, performance 
appraisal and remuneration processes;
• improving our Group-wide market surveillance capability;
• introducing policies and procedures to strengthen support 
for potentially vulnerable customers;
• enhancing the quality and depth of conduct management 
information and how it is used across the Group;
• implementing an assessment process to check the 
effectiveness of our conduct initiatives across the Group; 
and
• assessing conduct standards and practices within our key 
third-party suppliers and distributors.
The Board maintained oversight of conduct matters through the 
Conduct & Values Committee.
Further information on our conduct is provided in the Strategic Report on 
page 22 and www.hsbc.com. For conduct-related costs relating to 
significant items, see page 62.
Financial crime risk management
Overview
In the second half of 2016, we established a Financial Crime 
Risk (‘FCR’) function and appointed a Group Head of FCR, who 
reports to the Group Chief Executive and chairs the Global 
Standards Steering Meeting. FCR is a global function that 
brings together all areas of financial crime risk management at 
HSBC and is dedicated to implementing the most effective 
global standards to combat financial crime. The function has 
been set up to enable us to build on our achievements in 
managing financial crime risk effectively across the bank and 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
82 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
to continue to strengthen financial crime detection, and anti-
money laundering (‘AML’), sanctions and anti-bribery and 
corruption compliance.
Key developments in 2016
The FCR function encompasses FCR Assurance, Financial 
Crime Compliance, Financial Crime Threat Mitigation, the 
Global Standards programme, the Monitor Liaison Office, FCR 
Strategy Implementation, FCR Chief of Staff and FCR COO.
The structure has been designed around the following key 
principles:
• FCR sets policy and standards, provides subject matter 
expertise and guidance, drives execution at country level 
via regions, and maintains line of business subject matter 
expertise in support of the global businesses.
• Country-level execution accountability is driven by a 
common set of global principles with material variations 
managed by exception.
• Sub-functions within FCR are leveraged across the global 
function, ensuring consistency and utilising expertise and 
resourcing.
Key risk management processes
We continue to embed policies and procedures, introduce new 
technology solutions and support the cultural change needed 
to effectively manage financial crime risk. A key enhancement 
during 2016 was the deployment of our global customer due 
diligence system to 35 markets for RBWM, 52 for CMB, 36 for 
GB&M and two for GPB. This, along with the enhanced financial 
crime risk training that we have taken more than 3,500 senior 
leaders through globally, will help ensure our people have the 
guidance and tools that they need.
The Group Head of FCR attends the Financial System 
Vulnerabilities Committee (‘FSVC’), which reports to the Board 
on matters relating to financial crime and financial system 
abuse and provides a forward-looking perspective on financial 
crime risk, as well as cyber and information security. In 2016, 
the FSVC assumed responsibility from the CVC for oversight 
of controls relating to anti-bribery and corruption.
Throughout the year the Committee received regular reports 
from country chief executives on the actions being taken by 
management to address local financial crime risk issues and 
vulnerabilities, and also received reports on specific issues.
The Monitor
Under the agreements entered into with the DoJ and the FCA 
in 2012, including the five-year US DPA, the Monitor was 
appointed in July 2013 for an expected five-year period to 
produce annual assessments of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
AML and sanctions compliance programme.
In February 2017, the Monitor delivered his third annual follow-
up review report based on various thematic and country reviews 
he had conducted over the course of 2016. In his report, the 
Monitor concluded that, in 2016, HSBC continued to make 
progress in enhancing its financial crime compliance controls, 
including improvements to its Global AML policies and 
procedures. However, the Monitor also expressed significant 
concerns about the pace of that progress, instances of potential 
financial crime that the DoJ and HSBC are reviewing further 
and on-going systems and control deficiencies that in his 
view raised questions as to whether HSBC is adhering to 
its obligations under the US DPA - a matter that would be 
determined by the DoJ in its sole discretion. The Monitor 
also found that there remain substantial challenges for HSBC 
to meet its goal of developing a reasonably effective and 
sustainable AML and sanctions compliance programme. 
In addition, the Monitor did not certify as to HSBC’s 
implementation of and adherence to remedial measures 
specified in the US DPA. The ‘US deferred prosecution 
agreement and related agreements and consent orders’ 
are discussed in ‘Top and emerging risks’ on page 64.
Throughout 2016, the FSVC received regular reports on HSBC’s 
relationship with the Monitor and its compliance with the US 
DPA. The FSVC received regular updates on the preliminary 
findings arising from the Monitor’s third annual review, and 
has received the Monitor’s third annual review report.
Insurance manufacturing operations risk 
management
Details of changes in our insurance manufacturing operations 
risk profile in 2016 can be found on page 121, in ‘Insurance 
manufacturing operations risk profile’.
There were no material changes to our policies and practices for 
the management of risks arising in our insurance manufacturing 
operations in 2016.
Governance
(Audited)
Insurance risks are managed to a defined risk appetite, which 
is aligned to the Group risk appetite and risk management 
framework, including the Group three lines of defence model. 
For details of the Group’s governance framework, see page 68. 
The Group Insurance Risk Management Meeting oversees the 
control framework globally and is accountable to the RBWM 
Risk Management Meeting on risk matters relating to the 
insurance business.
The monitoring of the risks within the insurance operations is 
carried out by insurance risk teams. Specific risk functions, 
including Wholesale Credit & Market Risk, Operational Risk, 
Information Security Risk and Financial Crime Risk, support 
Insurance Risk teams in their respective areas of expertise.
Stress and scenario testing
(Audited)
Stress testing forms a key part of the risk management 
framework for the insurance business. We participate in local 
and Group-wide regulatory stress tests, including the Bank of 
England stress test of the banking system, the Hong Kong 
Monetary Authority stress test, the European Insurance and 
Occupational Pensions Authority stress test, and individual 
country insurance regulatory stress tests.
These have highlighted that a key risk scenario for the insurance 
business is a prolonged low interest rate environment. In order 
to mitigate the impact of this scenario, the insurance operations 
have a range of strategies that could be employed including the 
hedging of investment risk, repricing current products to reflect 
lower interest rates, improving risk diversification, moving 
towards less capital intensive products, and developing 
investment strategies to optimise the expected returns against 
the cost of economic capital.
Management and mitigation of key risk types
Market risk
(Audited) 
All our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries have market risk 
mandates which specify the investment instruments in which 
they are permitted to invest and the maximum quantum of 
market risk which they may retain. They manage market risk by 
using, among others, some or all of the techniques listed below, 
depending on the nature of the contracts written:
• For products with discretionary participating features 
(‘DPF’), adjusting bonus rates to manage the liabilities to 
policyholders. The effect is that a significant portion of the 
market risk is borne by the policyholder.
• Asset and liability matching where asset portfolios are 
structured to support projected liability cash flows. The 
group manages its assets using an approach that considers 
asset quality, diversification, cash flow matching, liquidity,  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 83
volatility and target investment return. It is not always 
possible to match asset and liability durations due to 
uncertainty over the receipt of all future premiums and the 
timing of claims; and also because the forecast payment 
dates of liabilities may exceed the duration of the longest 
dated investments available. We use models to assess the 
effect of a range of future scenarios on the values of 
financial assets and associated liabilities, and ALCOs employ 
the outcomes in determining how to best structure asset 
holdings to support liabilities.
• Using derivatives to protect against adverse market 
movements or better match liability cash flows.
• For new products with investment guarantees, considering 
the cost when determining the level of premiums or the 
price structure.
• Periodically reviewing products identified as higher risk, 
which contain investment guarantees and embedded 
optionality features linked to savings and investment 
products.
• Designing new products to mitigate market risk, such as 
changing the investment return sharing portion between 
policyholders and the shareholder.
• Exiting, to the extent possible, investment portfolios whose 
risk is considered unacceptable.
• Repricing premiums charged to policyholders.
Credit risk
(Audited)
Our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries are responsible for 
the credit risk, quality and performance of their investment 
portfolios. Our assessment of the creditworthiness of issuers 
and counterparties is based primarily upon internationally 
recognised credit ratings and other publicly available 
information.
Investment credit exposures are monitored against limits by our 
local insurance manufacturing subsidiaries, and are aggregated 
and reported to the Group Insurance Credit Risk and Group 
Credit Risk functions. Stress testing is performed by Group 
Insurance on the investment credit exposures using credit 
spread sensitivities and default probabilities.
We use a number of tools to manage and monitor credit risk. 
These include a credit report which contains a watch-list of 
investments with current credit concerns. The report is 
circulated monthly to senior management in Group Insurance 
and the individual country chief risk officers to identify 
investments which may be at risk of future impairment.
Liquidity risk
(Audited)
Risk is managed by cash flow matching and maintaining 
sufficient cash resources, investing in high credit-quality 
investments with deep and liquid markets, monitoring 
investment concentrations and restricting them where 
appropriate, and establishing committed contingency 
borrowing facilities.
Insurance manufacturing subsidiaries are required to complete 
quarterly liquidity risk reports for the Group Insurance Risk 
function and an annual review of the liquidity risks to which 
they are exposed.
Insurance risk
HSBC Insurance primarily uses the following techniques to 
manage and mitigate insurance risk:
• product design, pricing and overall proposition management 
(for example, management of lapses by introducing 
surrender charges);
• underwriting policy;
• claims management processes; and
• reinsurance which cedes risks above our acceptable 
thresholds to an external reinsurer thereby limiting 
our exposure.
Reputational risk management
There were no material changes to our policies and practices for 
the management of reputational risk in 2016.
Overview
Reputational risk relates to stakeholders’ perceptions, whether 
fact-based or otherwise. Stakeholders’ expectations change 
constantly, and so reputational risk is dynamic and varies 
between geographical regions, groups and individuals. We have 
an unwavering commitment to operating at the high standards 
we set for ourselves in every jurisdiction. Any lapse in standards 
of integrity, compliance, customer service or operating 
efficiency represents a potential reputational risk.
Governance and structure
The development of policies, management and mitigation 
of reputational risk are coordinated through the Group 
Reputational Risk Policy Committee, which is chaired by 
the Group Chairman. In parallel, the Global Risk Resolution 
Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is the highest 
decision-making forum in the Group for matters arising from 
clients or transactions that either present a serious potential 
reputational risk to the Group, or merit a Group-led decision 
to ensure a consistent risk management approach across our 
regions and global businesses. Both committees keep the 
RMM apprised of areas and activities presenting significant 
reputational risk and, where appropriate, make 
recommendations to the RMM to mitigate such risks. 
Significant issues posing reputational risk are also reported 
to the Board and the Conduct & Values Committee, where 
appropriate.
Key risk management processes
The External Affairs function maintains policies and gives policy 
advice for the issues that might affect HSBC’s reputation and 
standing with customers, employees, opinion formers and the 
public. It oversees the identification, management and control 
of reputational risk for all HSBC Group entities in the areas of 
media relations and engagement with non-governmental 
organisations and other external stakeholders.
Our Reputational Risk and Client Selection (‘RRCS’) team, which 
is jointly managed by the Global Head of Financial Crime 
Compliance and the Global Head of Regulatory Compliance, 
oversees the identification, management and control of all 
other significant reputational risks across HSBC Group. It is 
responsible for setting policies to guide the Group’s reputational 
risk management, devising strategies to protect against 
reputational risk, and advising the global businesses and global 
functions to help them identify, assess and mitigate such risks, 
where possible. It is led by a headquarters-based team. This is 
supported by teams in each business line and region, which 
help ensure that issues are directed to the appropriate forums, 
that decisions are made and implemented effectively, and 
that management information is generated to aid senior 
management in the businesses and regions in understanding 
where reputational risk exists. Each global business has 
established a governance process that empowers the RRCS’s 
committees to address reputational risk issues at the right level, 
escalating decisions where appropriate. The global functions 
manage and escalate reputational risks within established 
operational risk frameworks.
Our policies set out our risk appetite and operational procedures 
for all areas of reputational risk, including financial crime 
prevention, regulatory compliance, conduct-related concerns, 
environmental impacts, human rights matters and employee 
relations.
We have taken, and are taking, measures to address the 
requirements of the US DPA and enhance our AML, sanctions 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
84 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
and other regulatory compliance frameworks. These measures 
should also enhance our reputational risk management in the 
future. For further details on our financial crime risk, see 
‘Financial crime risk management’ on page 81.

Sustainability risk management
Overview
Assessing the environmental and social impacts of providing 
finance to our customers is integral to our overall risk 
management processes.
Key developments in 2016
In 2016, we issued a revised mining and metals policy. It 
replaced the one introduced in 2007, and responds to 
increasing concerns regarding climate change by addressing 
thermal coal mining, and provides more details on how we deal 
with human rights issues in the sector.
We also created a new training module for relevant relationship 
managers globally on our sustainability risk policies and their 
responsibilities, to ensure consistent implementation. 
Furthermore, we continued to improve the way sustainability 
risk is recorded in our information management system.
Governance and structure
The Global Risk function, with input from the Global Corporate 
Sustainability function, is mandated to manage sustainability 
risk globally, working through local offices as appropriate. 
Sustainability risk managers have regional or national 
responsibilities for advising on and managing environmental 
and social risks.
Key risk management processes
The Global Risk function’s responsibilities in relation to 
sustainability risk include:
• Formulating sustainability risk policies. This includes work 
in several key areas: overseeing our sustainability risk 
standards; overseeing our application of the Equator 
Principles, which provide a framework for banks to assess 
and manage the social and environmental impact of large 
projects they provide finance to; overseeing our application 
of our sustainability policies, covering agricultural 
commodities, chemicals, defence, energy, forestry, 
freshwater infrastructure, mining and metals, UNESCO 
World Heritage Sites and the Ramsar Convention on 
Wetlands; undertaking independent reviews of transactions 
where sustainability risks are assessed to be high; and 
supporting our operating companies to assess similar risks 
of a lesser magnitude.
• Building and implementing systems-based processes to 
ensure consistent application of policies, reduce the costs 
of sustainability risk reviews, and capture management 
information to measure and report on the effect of our 
lending and investment activities on sustainable 
development.
• Providing training and capacity building within our operating 
companies to ensure sustainability risks are identified and 
mitigated consistently to appropriate standards.
Pension risk management
There were no material changes to our policies and practices 
for the management of pension risk in 2016.
Governance and structure
A global pension risk framework and accompanying global 
policies on the management of risks related to defined benefit 
and defined contribution plans is in place. Pension risk is 
managed by a network of local and regional pension risk 
forums. The Global Pensions Oversight Committee is 
responsible for the governance and oversight of all pension 
plans sponsored by HSBC around the world.
Key risk management processes
Our global pensions strategy is to move from defined benefit 
to defined contribution plans, where local law allows and it is 
considered competitive to do so.
In defined contribution pension plans, the contributions that 
HSBC is required to make are known, while the ultimate 
pension benefit will vary, typically with investment returns 
achieved by investment choices made by the employee. While 
the market risk to HSBC of defined contribution plans is low, 
the Group is still exposed to operational and reputational risk.
In defined benefit pension plans, the level of pension benefit is 
known. Therefore, the level of contributions required by HSBC 
will vary due to a number of risks, including:
• investments delivering a return below that required to 
provide the projected plan benefits;
• the prevailing economic environment leading to corporate 
failures, thus triggering write-downs in asset values (both 
equity and debt);
• a change in either interest rates or inflation expectations, 
causing an increase in the value of plan liabilities; and
• plan members living longer than expected (known as 
longevity risk).
Pension risk is assessed using an economic capital model 
that takes into account potential variations in these factors. 
The impact of these variations on both pension assets and 
pension liabilities is assessed using a one-in-200-year stress 
test. Scenario analysis and other stress tests are also used to 
support pension risk management.
To fund the benefits associated with defined benefit plans, 
sponsoring Group companies, and in some instances 
employees, make regular contributions in accordance with 
advice from actuaries and in consultation with the plan’s 
trustees where relevant. These contributions are normally set 
to ensure that there are sufficient funds to meet the cost of 
the accruing benefits for the future service of active members. 
However, higher contributions are required when plan assets 
are considered insufficient to cover the existing pension 
liabilities. Contribution rates are typically revised annually 
or once every three years, depending on the plan.
The defined benefit plans invest contributions in a range of 
investments designed to limit the risk of assets failing to meet 
a plan’s liabilities. Any changes in expected returns from the 
investments may also change future contribution requirements. 
In pursuit of these long-term objectives, an overall target 
allocation of the defined benefit plan assets between asset 
classes is established. In addition, each permitted asset class 
has its own benchmarks, such as stock-market or property 
valuation indices. The benchmarks are reviewed at least once 
every three years and more frequently if required by local 
legislation or circumstances. The process generally involves 
an extensive asset and liability review. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 85
Key developments and risk profile in 2016
Key developments in 2016
In 2016, HSBC undertook a number of initiatives to enhance 
its approach to the management of risk. These included:
• Implementing a new internal liquidity and funding risk 
management framework which uses the liquidity coverage 
ratio and net stable funding ratio regulatory framework as a 
foundation, as described on page 75 of the ‘Liquidity and 
funding risk management’ section.
• Undertaking activities to strengthen our risk culture and 
further embed the use of the operational risk management 
framework, as described on page 81 of the ‘Operational risk 
management’ section.
• Implementing a number of initiatives to raise our standards 
in relation to the conduct of our business, as described on 
page 81 of the ‘Regulatory compliance risk management’ 
section.
• Restructuring part of our Global Risk function. The Financial 
Crime Compliance sub-function became part of our new 
Financial Crime Risk (‘FCR’) function. The Regulatory 
Compliance sub-function remains part of Global Risk, and 
continues to oversee management of regulatory compliance 
risk.
• Establishing an FCR function and appointing a Group Head 
of FCR, who chairs the Global Standards Steering Meeting 
and reports to the Group Chief Executive, to oversee all 
areas of financial crime risk management at HSBC. The FCR 
function is dedicated to implementing the most effective 
global standards to combat financial crime, as described on 
page 81 of the ‘Financial crime risk management’ section.
• Issuing a revised mining and metals policy and creating a 
new training module for relevant relationship managers 
globally on our sustainability risk policies and their 
responsibilities, to ensure consistent implementation, 
as described on page 84 in the ‘Sustainability risk 
management’ section.
There were no material changes to our policies and practices 
for the management of credit risk, market risk, insurance 
manufacturing operations risk, reputational risk and 
sustainability risk in 2016.

Credit risk in 2016
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or 
counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. It 
arises principally from direct lending, trade finance and leasing 
business, but also from other products, such as guarantees and 
credit derivatives and from holding assets in the form of debt 
securities.
A summary of our current policies and practices regarding the 
management of credit risk is set out on pages 73 to 75.
The effect of commodity price movements in the oil and gas 
sectors is provided in ‘Areas of special interest’ on page 67.
Gross loans and advances declined by $67bn, mainly due to 
foreign exchange effects reducing balances by $68bn.
Loan impairment charges and other credit provisions for the 
year were $3.4bn.
In wholesale lending, balances declined by $33bn mainly due 
to foreign exchange movements of $41bn. Excluding foreign 
exchange movements, lending balances decreased in North 
America, and in Middle East and North Africa but were more 
than offset by increases in Asia and Latin America. Europe 
lending balances were broadly unchanged.
In personal lending, balances decreased by $34bn, mainly due 
to foreign exchange movements of $26bn and $13bn in North 
America largely due to continued repayments and loan sales 
in the US CML run-off portfolio. Excluding foreign exchange 
movements and the US CML run-off portfolio, lending balances 
increased in Europe, Asia and Latin America and were offset by 
a decrease in Middle East and North Africa.
Information on constant currency movements is provided on page 30.

Credit exposure
Maximum exposure to credit risk
(Audited)
The table that follows provides information on balance sheet 
items, offsets, and loan and other credit-related commitments. 
Commentary on balance sheet movements is provided on 
page 42. 
The offset on derivatives remains in line with the movements 
in maximum exposure amounts.
The offset on corporate and commercial loans to customers 
decreased by $17bn. This reduction was mainly related to 
corporate overdraft balances where a small number of clients 
benefited from the use of net interest arrangements across 
overdrafts and deposits. As a result, net risk exposures are 
usually stable, while gross balances can be volatile. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 87
‘Maximum exposure to credit risk’ table 
The following table presents our maximum exposure before taking 
account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements (unless 
such enhancements meet accounting offsetting requirements). The 
table excludes financial instruments whose carrying amount best 
represents the net exposure to credit risk; and it excludes equity 
securities as they are not subject to credit risk. For the financial assets 
recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk 
equals their carrying amount; for financial guarantees and similar 
contracts granted, it is the maximum amount that we would have 
to pay if the guarantees were called upon. For loan commitments and 
other credit-related commitments, it is generally the full amount of the 
committed facilities. 
The offset in the table relates to amounts where there is a legally 
enforceable right of offset in the event of counterparty default and 
where, as a result, there is a net exposure for credit risk purposes. 
However, as there is no intention to settle these balances on a net basis 
under normal circumstances, they do not qualify for net presentation 
for accounting purposes. No offset has been applied to off-balance 
sheet collateral. In the case of derivatives the offset column also 
includes collateral received in cash and other financial assets.
Other credit risk mitigants
While not disclosed as an offset in the following ‘Maximum 
exposure to credit risk’ table, other arrangements are in place 
which reduce our maximum exposure to credit risk. These 
include a charge over collateral on borrowers’ specific assets 
such as residential properties, collateral held in the form of 
financial instruments that are not held on balance sheet and 
short positions in securities. In addition, for financial assets 
held as part of linked insurance/investment contracts the risk 
is predominantly borne by the policyholder. See Note 30 and 
pages 198 and 201 of the Financial Statements for further 
details of collateral in respect of certain loans and advances 
and derivatives.

Concentration of exposure
The geographical diversification of our lending portfolio, and 
our broad range of global businesses and products, ensured 
that we did not overly depend on a few markets to generate 
growth in 2016.

Credit quality of financial instruments
(Audited)
We assess the credit quality of all financial instruments that are 
subject to credit risk. Additional credit quality information in 
respect of our consolidated holdings of ABSs is provided on 
page 105.
For the purpose of the following disclosure, loans past due 
up to 90 days and not otherwise classified as impaired are 
separately classified as past due but not impaired, irrespective 
of their credit quality grade. Trading assets, financial assets 
designated at fair value and financial investments exclude 
equity securities as they are not subject to credit risk. The 
changes to the mapping of sovereign external ratings to credit 
quality bands, described on page 73, mainly impacts the credit 
quality of financial investments in 2016 with an increase in the 
‘Strong’ rating band and a decrease in the ‘Good’ and 
‘Satisfactory’ rating bands.

Past due but not impaired gross financial instruments
(Audited)
Past due but not impaired gross financial instruments are those 
loans where, although customers have failed to make payments
in accordance with the contractual terms of their facilities, they 
have not met the impaired loan criteria described on page 90.
In North America, past due but not impaired balances 
decreased, mainly due to the continued repayments and loan 
sales in the US CML run-off portfolio.

Impaired loans
(Audited)
Impaired loans and advances are those that meet any of the 
following criteria:
• Wholesale loans and advances classified as customer risk 
rating (‘CRR’) 9 or CRR 10: these grades are assigned when 
HSBC considers that the customer is either unlikely to pay 
their credit obligations in full without recourse to security, 
or is more than 90 days past due on any material credit 
obligation to HSBC.
• Retail loans and advances classified as expected loss (‘EL’) 
9 or EL 10: these grades are typically assigned to retail loans 
and advances more than 90 days past due unless they have 
been individually assessed as not impaired.
• Renegotiated loans and advances: loans where we 
have changed the contractual cash flows due to credit 
distress of the obligor. Renegotiated loans remain classified 
as impaired until there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate 
a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment of future 
cash flows.
In personal lending, the continued repayments and loan sales in 
the US CML run-off portfolio reduced impaired loan balances by 
a further $4.2bn.

Renegotiated loans and forbearance
The most significant portfolio of renegotiated loans was in 
North America, substantially all of which were retail loans held 
by HSBC Finance Corporation (‘HSBC Finance’). The ongoing 
repayments and loan sales in the US CML run-off portfolio 
reduced renegotiated loans by $8.7bn during 2016.
The following tables show the gross carrying amounts of 
the Group’s holdings of renegotiated loans and advances 
to customers by industry sector, geography, credit quality 
classification and arrangement type.

A range of forbearance strategies are employed in order to 
improve the management of customer relationships, maximise 
collection opportunities and, if possible, avoid default, 
foreclosure or repossession.
The tables below show renegotiated loans by arrangement type 
as a percentage of the total value of arrangements offered. 
In personal lending, renegotiated loans have been allocated 
to the single most dominant arrangement type.

Wholesale lending
Total wholesale lending balances declined by $33bn including 
foreign exchange movements of $41bn, of which $31bn related 
to the UK. In North America, lending decreased by $6.1bn, 
mainly in the US as paydowns and maturities exceeded new 
loan originations. This reflected our efforts to improve returns 
with more disciplined lending.
In Middle East and North Africa, overall lending fell by $5.8bn, 
including $3.4bn of foreign exchange movements. Other 
causes of the decline were mainly in Turkey, where some 
portfolios are being reduced, and in the UAE, where we sold 
loans and exited certain customer relationships. These 
decreases were partly offset by loan growth mainly in Egypt 
and Oman.
In Asia, lending balances increased by $13bn. This reflected 
strong credit growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 across a 
range of industries, and principally in Hong Kong, partly offset 
by foreign exchange decreases of $3.8bn. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 95

Commercial real estate
Our commercial real estate lending disclosures focus on the 
regions containing the majority of our balances for loans and 
advances. Europe, Asia and North America accounted for 97% 
of our total commercial real estate lending at 31 December 
2016 (31 December 2015: 97%).

Commercial real estate lending includes the financing of 
corporate, institutional and high net worth customers who are 
investing primarily in income-producing assets and, to a lesser 
extent, in their construction and development. The portfolio is 
globally diversified with larger concentrations in Hong Kong, 
the UK, the US and Canada.
Our global exposure is centred largely on cities with economic, 
political or cultural significance. In many less-developed 
markets, industry is moving from the development and 
rapid construction of recent years to an increasing focus on 
investment stock consistent with more developed markets.
In more developed markets, our exposure mainly comprises the 
financing of investment assets, the redevelopment of existing 
stock and the augmentation of both commercial and residential 
markets to support economic and population growth. In less-
developed commercial real estate markets, our exposures 
comprise lending for development assets on relatively short 
tenors with a particular focus on supporting larger, better 
capitalised developers involved in residential construction or 
assets supporting economic expansion.
Commercial real estate lending was $3.8bn lower, largely 
because of a fall in the value of sterling contributing to a foreign 
exchange movement of $4.0bn. Total lending balances in 
Europe declined by $4.7bn, including foreign exchange 
movements of $3.5bn, partly offset by increases in lending 
in Asia and North America. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 97
Refinance risk in commercial real estate
Commercial real estate lending tends to require the repayment 
of a significant proportion of the principal at maturity. Typically, 
a customer will arrange repayment through the acquisition of a 
new loan to settle the existing debt. Refinance risk is the risk 
that a customer, being unable to repay the debt on maturity, 
fails to refinance it at commercial rates. We monitor our 
commercial real estate portfolio closely, assessing indicators 
for signs of potential issues with refinancing.

Collateral on loans and advances
Collateral held is analysed separately for commercial real estate 
and for other corporate, commercial and financial (non-bank) 
lending. The following tables include sheet loan 
commitments, primarily undrawn credit lines.
The collateral measured in the following tables consists of 
fixed first charges on real estate, and charges over cash and 
marketable financial instruments. The values in the tables 
represent the expected market value on an open market basis; 
no adjustment has been made to the collateral for any expected 
costs of recovery. Marketable securities are measured at their 
fair value.
Other types of collateral such as unsupported guarantees and 
floating charges over the assets of a customer’s business are 
not measured in the tables below. While such mitigants have 
value, often providing rights in insolvency, their assignable value 
is not sufficiently certain and they are therefore assigned no 
value for disclosure purposes.
For impaired loans, the collateral values cannot be directly 
compared with impairment allowances recognised. The loan-
to-value (‘LTV’) figures use open market values with no 
adjustments. Impairment allowances are calculated on a 
different basis, by considering other cash flows and adjusting 
collateral values for costs of realising collateral as explained 
further on page 179.
Commercial real estate loans and advances
The value of commercial real estate collateral is determined 
by using a combination of external and internal valuations 
and physical inspections. For CRR 1-7, local valuation policies 
determine the frequency of review on the basis of local market 
conditions because of the complexity of valuing collateral 
for commercial real estate. For CRR 8 and 9-10, almost all 
collateral would have been revalued within the last three years.
In Hong Kong, market practice is typically for lending to major 
property companies to be either secured by guarantees or 
unsecured. In Europe, facilities of a working capital nature are 
generally not secured by a first fixed charge, and are therefore 
disclosed as not collateralised.

Other corporate, commercial and financial (non-bank) loans are 
analysed separately in the table below, which focuses on the 
regions containing the majority of our loans and advances 
balances. For financing activities in other corporate and 
commercial lending, collateral value is not strongly correlated 
to principal repayment performance. 
Collateral values are generally refreshed when an obligor’s 
general credit performance deteriorates and we have to assess 
the likely performance of secondary sources of repayment 
should it prove necessary to rely on them.
Accordingly, the table below reports values only for customers 
with CRR 8 to 10, recognising that these loans and advances 
generally have valuations that are comparatively recent.

During the year, a number of counterparties were downgraded 
to CRR 8, mainly in the US’ energy, commodities and Latin 
American portfolios. In the UK, a single large counterparty 
balance was settled which partly reduced the CRR 9 balance. 
Other credit risk exposures
In addition to collateralised lending, other credit enhancements 
are employed and methods used to mitigate credit risk arising 
from financial assets. These are summarised below:
• Some securities issued by governments, banks and other 
financial institutions benefit from additional credit 
enhancement provided by government guarantees 
that cover the assets.
• Debt securities issued by banks and financial institutions 
include ABSs and similar instruments which are supported 
by underlying pools of financial assets. Credit risk 
associated with ABSs is reduced through the purchase 
of credit default swap (‘CDS’) protection.
Disclosure of the Group’s holdings of ABSs and associated CDS protection 
is provided on page 105.
• Trading loans and advances mainly consist of cash collateral 
posted to satisfy margin requirements. There is limited credit 
risk on cash collateral posted since in the event of default of 
the counterparty these would be set-off against the related 
liability. Reverse repos and stock borrowing are by their 
nature collateralised.
Collateral accepted as security that the Group is permitted to sell or 
repledge under these arrangements is described on page 231 of the 
Financial Statements.
• The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk includes 
financial guarantees and similar contracts granted, as well 
as loan and other credit-related commitments. Depending 
on the terms of the arrangement, we may use additional 
credit mitigation if a guarantee is called upon or a loan 
commitment is drawn and subsequently defaults.
For further information on these arrangements, see Note 33 on the 
Financial Statements.
Derivatives
HSBC participates in transactions exposing us to counterparty 
credit risk. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of financial loss if 
the counterparty to a transaction defaults before satisfactorily 
settling it. It arises principally from over-the-counter (‘OTC’) 
derivatives and securities financing transactions and is 
calculated in both the trading and non-trading books. 
Transactions vary in value by reference to a market factor 
such as an interest rate, exchange rate or asset price.
The counterparty risk from derivative transactions is taken into 
account when reporting the fair value of derivative positions. 
The adjustment to the fair value is known as the credit value 
adjustment (‘CVA’).
For an analysis of CVAs, see Note 11 on the Financial Statements.
The table below reflects by risk type the fair values and gross 
notional contract amounts of derivatives cleared through an 
exchange, central counterparty and non-central counterparty.

The purposes for which HSBC uses derivatives are described in Note 16 on 
the Financial Statements.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (‘ISDA’) 
Master Agreement is our preferred agreement for documenting 
derivatives activity. It is common, and our preferred practice, 
for the parties to execute a Credit Support Annex (‘CSA’) in 
conjunction with the ISDA Master Agreement. Under a CSA, 
collateral is passed between the parties to mitigate the 
counterparty risk inherent in outstanding positions. The 
majority of our CSAs are with financial institutional clients.
We manage the counterparty exposure on our OTC derivative 
contracts by using collateral agreements with counterparties 
and netting agreements. Currently, we do not actively manage 
our general OTC derivative counterparty exposure in the credit 
markets, although we may manage individual exposures in 
certain circumstances.
We place strict policy restrictions on collateral types and as a 
consequence the types of collateral received and pledged are, 
by value, highly liquid and of a strong quality, being 
predominantly cash.
Where a collateral type is required to be approved outside the 
collateral policy, approval is required from a committee of senior 
representatives from Markets, Legal and Risk.
See page 251 and Note 30 on the Financial Statements for details 
regarding legally enforceable right of offset in the event of counterparty 
default and collateral received in respect of derivatives.
Personal lending
On a reported basis, total personal lending reduced by $34bn, 
mainly due to foreign exchange movements of $26bn and the 
ongoing repayments and loan sales of our US CML run-off 
portfolio in North America of $13bn.
Loan impairment allowances reduced by $0.9bn, largely due 
to the reduction in our US CML run-off portfolio.
Loan impairment charges for personal lending, remained flat 
at $1.7bn for 2016. For further analysis of loan impairment 
charges and other credit risk provisions by global business, 
see page 38.
While the tables are presented on a reported basis, the 
commentary that follows is on a constant currency basis and 
excludes the effect of the ongoing run-off and loan sales in the 
US CML run-off portfolio.
Overall, personal lending increased by $5.6bn compared with 
31 December 2015. The growth was in mortgage balances 
which increased by $7.5bn across the Group. UK mortgage 
balances increased by $4.2bn as we grew our UK mortgage 
market share through increased sales across various channels 
including the expanded use of broker relationships. Mortgages 
in Hong Kong and China grew by $4.5bn as a result of 
successful marketing campaigns and business growth 
initiatives. This growth was offset by a $1.4bn reduction in 
Singapore, following a decision to continue to constrain the 
size of our mortgage portfolio.
The quality of both our Hong Kong and UK mortgage books 
remained high, with negligible defaults and impairment 
allowances. The average LTV ratio on new mortgage lending in 
Hong Kong was 47% compared with an estimated 29% for the 
overall mortgage portfolio. The LTV ratio on new lending in the 
UK was 59% compared with the average of 40% for the total 
mortgage portfolio.
Group credit policy prescribes the range of acceptable 
residential property LTV thresholds, with the maximum upper 
limit for new loans set at between 75% and 95%. Specific LTV 
thresholds and debt-to-income ratios are managed at regional 
and country levels. They must comply with the Group’s policies, 
strategy and risk appetite, but vary to reflect the local factors: 
economic and housing market conditions, regulations, portfolio 
performance, pricing and product features.
Other personal lending balances declined by $1.9bn, mainly due 
to reductions resulting from the continued repositioning of the 
Global Private Bank. This was offset by growth in RBWM, in 
other personal lending products including $0.7bn in the UK and 
$0.5bn in Mexico. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 101

Residential mortgages, including second lien mortgages, 
decreased by $14bn to $6bn at 31 December 2016. In addition 
to the continued loan sales in the US CML run-off portfolio, we 
transferred a further $12bn to ‘Assets held for sale’ during 2016, 
of which $1.6bn remained at the year end due to be sold in 
February 2017. The average gain on sale of foreclosed 
properties that arose after we took title to the property was 2%.
There was a decrease in impairment allowances from $1.0 bn 
at 31 December 2015 to $0.2bn at the end of 2016, reflecting 
reduced levels of delinquency, and lower levels of both new 
impaired loans and loan balances outstanding as a result of 
continued liquidation of the portfolio.
Across the first and second lien residential mortgages in our 
US CML run-off portfolio, two months and over delinquent 
balances halved to $1.0bn during 2016.
Renegotiated real estate secured accounts in HSBC Finance 
reduced by $8.7bn or 82% and represented 67% at 
31 December 2016 (2015: 91%) of our total renegotiated 
loans in North America, of which $1.3bn were classified as 
impaired (2015: $5.1bn). During 2016, the aggregate number 
of renegotiated loans in HSBC Finance reduced due to the 
portfolio repayments and further loan sales in the US CML 
portfolio.
Collateral and other credit enhancements held
(Audited)
The following table shows the values of the fixed charges we 
hold over specific assets where we have previously enforced, 
and are able to enforce, collateral in satisfying a debt because 
the borrower has failed to meet contractual obligations, and 
where the collateral is cash or can be realised by sale in an 
established market.
The collateral valuation excludes any adjustments for obtaining 
and selling the collateral and, in particular, loans shown as not 
collateralised or partially collateralised may also benefit from 
other forms of credit mitigants. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 103

(Audited)
Risk in HSBC Holdings is overseen by the HSBC Holdings Asset 
and Liability Management Committee (‘Holdings ALCO’). 
The major risks faced by HSBC Holdings are credit risk, liquidity 
risk and market risk (in the form of interest rate risk and foreign 
exchange risk), of which the most significant is credit risk.
Credit risk in HSBC Holdings primarily arises from transactions 
with Group subsidiaries and from guarantees issued in support 
of obligations assumed by certain Group operations in the 
normal conduct of their business. It principally represents 
claims on Group subsidiaries in Europe and North America.
In HSBC Holdings, all financial instruments carrying amount 
represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. Derivatives 
have an offset balance of $1.8bn at 31 December 2016
(2015: $2.5bn).
The credit quality of loans and advances and financial 
investments, both of which consist of intra-Group lending, 
is assessed as ‘strong’ or ‘good’, with 100% of the exposure 
being neither past due nor impaired (2015: 100%).
Securitisation exposures and other structured products
The following table summarises the carrying amount of our ABS 
exposure by categories of collateral and includes assets held in 
the GB&M legacy credit portfolio with a carrying value of $11bn 
(2015: $15bn).
At 31 December 2016, the available-for-sale reserve in respect 
of ABSs was a deficit of $749m (2015: deficit of $1,021m). For 
2016, the impairment write-back in respect of ABSs was
$121m (2015: write-back of $85m).

Liquidity and funding risk in 2016
A summary of our current policies and practices regarding the 
management of liquidity and funding risk is set out on page 106.
The liquidity position of the Group remained strong in 2016. 
The amount of our unencumbered liquid assets was $560bn. 
We recognised $447bn of these liquid assets for the purposes 
of the Group consolidated LCR, which was 136%.
Management of liquidity and funding risk
Liquidity coverage ratio
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (‘LCR’) aims to ensure that a bank 
has sufficient unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (‘HQLA’) 
to meet its liquidity needs in a 30-calendar-day liquidity stress 
scenario. HQLA consist of cash or assets that can be converted 
into cash at little or no loss of value in markets. We reported a 
Group European Commission (‘EC’) LCR at 31 December 2016 
of 136% (31 December 2015: 116%) to the PRA.
We assume no transferability of liquidity from non-EU entities 
other than to the extent currently permitted. This results in 
$113bn of HQLA being excluded from the Group’s LCR.
The ratio of total consolidated HQLA to the EC LCR denominator 
at 31 December 2016 was 171% (31 December 2015: 142%), 
reflecting the additional $113bn (31 December 2015: $94bn) 
of HQLAs excluded from the Group LCR.
At 31 December 2016, all the Group’s principal operating 
entities were within the LCR risk tolerance level established by 
the Board and applicable under the Group’s internal liquidity 
and funding risk management framework (‘LFRF’).
The liquidity position of the Group can also be represented by 
the stand-alone ratios of each of our principal operating entities. 
The Board and RMM decide the criteria for categorising an 
operating entity as a principal entity. The main criterion is a 
material balance sheet size. The following table displays the 
individual LCR levels for our principal operating entities on 
an EC LCR basis. The ratios for operating entities in non-EU 
jurisdictions can vary from local LCR measures due to 
differences in the way non-EU regulators have implemented 
the Basel III recommendations.

Net stable funding ratio
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (‘NSFR’) requires institutions to 
maintain sufficient stable funding relative to required stable 
funding, and reflects a bank’s long-term funding profile (funding 
with a term of more than a year). It is designed to complement 
the LCR.
At 31 December 2016, the Group’s principal operating entities 
were within the NSFR risk tolerance level established by the 
Board and applicable under the LFRF.
The table below displays the NSFR levels for the principal 
HSBC operating entities.
Our NSFR levels were not disclosed at the last year-end, so 
there are no comparatives.

Depositor concentration and term funding maturity 
concentration 
The LCR and NSFR metrics assume a stressed outflow based 
on a portfolio of depositors within each deposit segment. The 
validity of these assumptions is challenged if the portfolio of 
depositors is not large enough to avoid depositor concentration. 
Operating entities are exposed to term re-financing 
concentration risk if the current maturity profile results in future 
maturities being overly concentrated in any defined period.
At 31 December 2016, all principal operating entities were 
within the risk tolerance levels set for depositor concentration 
and term funding maturity concentration. These risk tolerances 
were established by the Board and are applicable under the 
LFRF.
Liquid assets of HSBC’s principal operating entities
The table below shows the unweighted liquidity value of assets 
categorised as liquid, which is used for the purposes of 
calculating the LCR metric.
This reflects the stock of unencumbered liquid assets at the 
reporting date, using the regulatory definition of liquid assets. 
The amount recognised by entity at the Group level is different 
from the amount recognised at a solo entity level, reflecting 
where liquidity cannot be freely transferred up to Group. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 107

Sources of funding
(Audited)
Our primary sources of funding are customer current accounts 
and customer savings deposits payable on demand or at short 
notice. We issue wholesale securities (secured and unsecured) 
to supplement our customer deposits and change the currency 
mix, maturity profile or location of our liabilities.
The following ‘Funding sources and uses’ table provides a 
consolidated view of how our balance sheet is funded, and 
should be read in light of the LFRF, which requires operating 
entities to manage liquidity and funding risk on a stand-alone 
basis.
The table analyses our consolidated balance sheet according to 
the assets that primarily arise from operating activities and the 
sources of funding primarily supporting these activities. Assets 
and liabilities that do not arise from operating activities are 
presented as a net balancing source or deployment of funds.
In 2016, the level of customer accounts continued to exceed the 
level of loans and advances to customers. The positive funding 
gap was predominantly deployed in liquid assets (cash and 
balances with central banks and financial investments) as 
required by the LFRF.
Loans and advances to banks continued to exceed deposits by 
banks, meaning the Group remained a net unsecured lender to 
the banking sector.
For a summary of sources and utilisation of repos and stock lending, see 
the Risk Management section on page 68.

Analysis of on-balance sheet encumbered and 
unencumbered assets and off-balance sheet collateral
On-balance sheet encumbered and unencumbered assets
The table on page 110, ‘Analysis of on-balance sheet 
encumbered and unencumbered assets’, summarises the total 
on-balance sheet assets capable of supporting future funding 
and collateral needs, and shows the extent to which they are 
currently pledged for this purpose. This disclosure aims to 
facilitate an understanding of available and unrestricted assets 
that could be used to support potential future funding and 
collateral needs.
During 2016 cash collateral given and reported within loans and 
advances to banks and customers, reflecting initial and variable 
cash margins, was reclassified from ‘unencumbered assets’ to 
‘encumbered assets’ to align with our Pillar 3 disclosure. 
Furthermore a portfolio of mortgages, classified as 
‘unencumbered assets’ in 2015 was reclassified to ‘Assets 
positioned at central banks’ (i.e. pre-positioned plus 
encumbered) in 2016. Comparative data have been restated. 
Under ‘Off-balance sheet collateral’ below we discuss the off-
balance sheet collateral received and re-pledged, and the level 
of available unencumbered off-balance sheet collateral.
For a summary of our policy on collateral management and definition of 
encumbrance, see the Risk Management section on page 68.
Off-balance sheet collateral
The fair value of assets accepted as collateral that we are 
permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was 
$269bn at 31 December 2016 (2015: $228bn). The fair value of 
any such collateral actually sold or re-pledged was $157bn 
(2015: $150bn). We are obliged to return equivalent securities. 
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual 
and customary to standard reverse repo, stock borrowing and 
derivative transactions.
The fair value of collateral received and re-pledged in relation to 
reverse repos, stock borrowing and derivatives is reported on a 
gross basis. The related balance sheet receivables and payables 
are reported on a net basis where required under IFRS offset 
criteria. As a consequence of reverse repo, stock borrowing and 
derivative transactions where the collateral received could be 
sold or re-pledged but had not been, we held $112bn 
(2015: $78bn) of unencumbered collateral available to 
support potential future funding and collateral needs at 
31 December 2016.
Under the terms of our current collateral obligations under  
derivative contracts (which are ISDA compliant CSA contracts 
and contracts entered into for pension obligations), and based 
on an estimate of the positions at 31 December 2016, we 
calculate that we could be required to post additional collateral 
of up to $0.3bn (2015: $0.4bn) in the event of a one-notch 
downgrade in third-party agencies’ credit rating of HSBC’s debt.
This would increase to $0.8 bn (2015: $0.7bn) in the event of a 
two-notch downgrade. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 109
Encumbered and unencumbered assets
Definitions of the categories included in the table ‘Analysis of on-balance sheet encumbered and unencumbered assets’:
• ‘Assets encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks as a result of covered bonds’ are any assets on our 
balance sheet pledged against our covered bonds issuance with a counterparty which is not central bank and as a result the assets are unavailable 
to the bank to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements.
• ‘Assets encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks as a result of securitisation’ are any assets on our 
balance sheet pledged against securitisations with a counterparty which is not central bank including asset-backed commercial paper, 
collateralised debt obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities, or structured investment vehicles paper and as a result the assets are 
unavailable to the bank to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements.
• ‘Assets encumbered as a result of transactions with counterparties other than central banks – Other’ are assets on our balance sheet (other than 
covered bonds and securitisation above) which have been pledged with a counterparty which is not central bank as a collateral against an existing 
liability, and as a result are assets which are unavailable to the bank to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs or be sold to reduce potential future 
funding requirements. Examples include assets pledged for sale and repurchase and stock lending transactions and certain property assets.
• ‘Assets positioned at central banks (i.e. pre-positioned plus encumbered)’ are any assets that are eligible for emergency central bank liquidity/
funding or under central bank pre-existing arrangements for funding without further due diligence work required. Any transferable customer loan 
that is central bank eligible such as pre-positioned central bank UK mortgages and US mortgages accepted by the Federal Reserve Bank and assets 
on our balance sheet which have been pledged with central bank as collateral against an existing liability, and as a result are assets which are 
unavailable to the bank to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements.
• ‘Unencumbered – readily available assets’ are assets considered by the bank to be readily available in the normal course of business to secure 
funding, meet collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, and are not subject to any restrictions on their use for 
these purposes.
• ‘Unencumbered – other assets capable of being encumbered’ are assets where there are no restrictions on their use to secure funding, meet 
collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, but they are not readily realisable in the normal course of business in 
their current form.
• ‘Unencumbered – reverse repo/stock borrowing receivables and derivative assets’ are assets related specifically to reverse repo, stock borrowing 
and derivative transactions. They are shown separately as these on-balance sheet assets cannot be pledged but often give rise to the receipt of 
non-cash assets which are not recognised on the balance sheet, and can additionally be used to raise secured funding, meet additional collateral 
requirements or be sold.
• ‘Unencumbered – cannot be encumbered’ are assets that have not been pledged and which we have assessed could not be pledged and therefore 
could not be used to secure funding, meet collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements. An example is assets held 
by the Group’s insurance subsidiaries that back liabilities to policyholders and support the solvency of these entities. 
Historically, the Group has not recognised any contingent liquidity value for assets other than those assets defined under the LFRF as being liquid
assets, and any other negotiable instruments that under stress are assumed to be realisable after three months, even though they may currently be
realisable. This approach has generally been driven by our appetite not to place any reliance on central banks. In a few cases, we have recognised the
contingent value of discrete pools of assets, but the amounts involved are insignificant. As a result, we have reported the majority of our loans and
advances to customers and banks in the category ‘Other realisable assets’ as management would need to perform additional actions in order to make
the assets transferable and readily realisable.

Contractual maturity of financial liabilities
The balances in the table below do not agree directly with those 
in our consolidated balance sheet as the table incorporates, on 
an undiscounted basis, all cash flows relating to principal and 
future coupon payments (except for trading liabilities and 
derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives). Undiscounted 
cash flows payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities 
are classified according to their contractual maturities. Trading 
liabilities and derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are 
included in the ‘On demand’ time bucket and not by contractual 
maturity.
A maturity analysis of repos and debt securities in issue 
included in trading liabilities is presented in Note 29 on the 
Financial Statements.
In addition, loans and other credit-related commitments, 
financial guarantees and similar contracts are generally not 
recognised on our balance sheet. The undiscounted cash flows 
potentially payable under financial guarantees and similar 
contracts are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can 
be called.

HSBC Holdings
Liquidity risk in HSBC Holdings is overseen by Holdings ALCO. 
This risk arises because of HSBC Holdings’ obligation to make 
payments to debt holders as they fall due. The liquidity risk 
related to these cash flows is managed by matching external 
debt obligations with internal loan cash flows and by 
maintaining an appropriate liquidity buffer that is monitored 
by Holdings ALCO.
The balances in the table below are not directly comparable 
with those on the balance sheet of HSBC Holdings as the table 
incorporates, on an undiscounted basis, all cash flows relating 
to principal and future coupon payments (except for derivatives 
not treated as hedging derivatives). Undiscounted cash flows 
payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities are classified 
according to their contractual maturities. Derivatives not treated 
as hedging derivatives are included in the ‘On demand’ time 
bucket.
In addition, loan commitments and financial guarantees and

Market risk in 2016
Market risk is the risk that movements in market factors, such 
as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity 
prices and commodity prices, will reduce our income or the 
value of our portfolios. Exposure to market risk is separated 
into two portfolios:
• trading portfolios; and
• non-trading portfolios.
Market risk exposures arising from our insurance manufacturing 
operations are discussed on page 82.
A summary of our current policies and practices regarding the 
management of market risk is set out on page 77.
Global markets were influenced by the increase in US interest 
rates in line with market expectation. Bond yields continued to 
rise and global stock markets continued to be supported by 
expectations of fiscal expansion in the US in the wake of the 
new US presidential elections. The US monetary tightening 
contrasts with the ECB extending its quantitative easing 
programme, highlighting the divergence in monetary policies 
during the year.
In China, the prospect of a slowdown in the economy in the first 
half of 2016, and uncertainty around the trade relationship with 
the US, following the elections, led to further depreciation of 
the renminbi. Chinese policymakers will attempt to keep this 
process gradual in order to avoid disruptive capital outflows.
In the UK, following the decision to leave the EU, concerns 
persist about the upcoming exit negotiations and the ultimate 
nature of the EU-UK relationship.
Capital flows to the emerging markets remained weak, with 
some central banks increasing local interest rates to reduce 
reserve outflows.
Trading value at risk (‘VaR’) spiked in quarter one, due to higher 
market volatility impacting the foreign exchange and credit 
spread asset classes. For the remainder of the year, exposures 
in all asset classes were managed down. Non-trading VaR 
increased during the year as higher interest rates, especially 
in US dollars, caused the duration of non-trading assets to 
increase.
Trading portfolios
Value at risk of the trading portfolios
Trading VaR predominantly resides within Global Markets. It 
was relatively stable at 31 December 2016 compared with 
31 December 2015. During the year, the trading VaR 
composition changed in that interest rate trading VaR increased 
but was offset by decreases in both credit spread and equity 
trading VaR components.
The daily levels of total trading VaR over the last year are set 
out in the graph below.

Back-testing
In 2016, the Group experienced two back-testing exceptions 
against hypothetical profit and loss: a loss exception in 
February, driven by Libor against overnight index spread 
widening on long positions; and a profit exception in June, 
driven by significant devaluations in sterling and the euro 
against the US dollar resulting from the UK’s referendum on 
EU membership.
There was no evidence of model errors or control failures.
The back-testing result excludes exceptions due to changes in 
fair value adjustments.
Non-trading portfolios
Value at risk of the non-trading portfolios
Non-trading VaR of the Group includes contributions from all 
global businesses. There is no commodity risk in the non-
trading portfolios. The increase in non-trading VaR during 2016 
was due primarily to the lengthening of the duration in the non-
trading book from higher interest rates, especially US rates.
The increase in non-trading interest rate was offset by a 
decrease in the credit spread VaR component and an increase 
in portfolio diversification effects.
Non-trading VaR includes the interest rate risk in the banking 
book transferred to and managed by Balance Sheet 
Management (‘BSM’) and the non-trading financial instruments 
held by BSM. The management of interest rate risk in the 
banking book and the role of BSM are described further in 
Interest rate risk in the banking book section below.
Non-trading VaR excludes the insurance operations which are 
discussed further on page 121 and the interest rate risk in the 
banking book arising from HSBC Holdings.
The daily levels of total non-trading VaR over the last year are

The table above sets out the maximum possible loss on 
shareholders’ equity from available-for-sale equity securities. 
The fair value of equity securities classified as available for sale 
reduced from $5.9bn to $4.7bn. The decrease in private equity 
holdings was largely due to fund distributions and the 
reclassification of the investment in certain funds as an 
associate investment. The decrease in business facilitation 
equities was largely due to the sale of the Visa investment.
Market risk balance sheet linkages
Below are the balance sheet lines in the Group’s consolidated 
position that are subject to market risk.
Trading assets and liabilities
The Group’s trading assets and liabilities are in almost all cases 
originated by GB&M. These assets and liabilities are treated as 
traded risk for the purposes of market risk management, other 
than a limited number of exceptions, primarily in Global Banking 
where the short-term acquisition and disposal of the assets are 
linked to other non-trading related activities such as loan 
origination.
Derivative assets and liabilities
We undertake derivative activity for three primary purposes: 
to create risk management solutions for clients, to manage the 
portfolio risks arising from client business, and to manage and 
hedge our own risks. Most of our derivative exposures arise 
from sales and trading activities within GB&M, and are treated 
as traded risk for market risk management purposes.
The assets and liabilities included in trading VaR give rise to a 
large proportion of the income included in net trading income. 
As set out on page 184, HSBC’s net trading income in 2016 was 
$9,452m (2015: $8,723m). Adjustments to trading income such 
as valuation adjustments do not feed the trading VaR model.
For information on the accounting policies applied to financial instruments 
at fair value, see Note 13 on the Financial Statements.
Structural foreign exchange exposures
For our policies and procedures for managing structural foreign exchange 
exposures, see page 78 of the Risk management section.
HSBC’s structural foreign exchange exposures are represented 
by the net asset value of its foreign exchange equity and 
subordinated debt investments in subsidiaries, branches, 
joint ventures and associates with non-US dollar functional 
currencies. Gains or losses on structural foreign exchange 
exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Net interest income sensitivity
The following table sets out the assessed impact on our 
base case projected net interest income (‘NII’) for 2016 
(excluding insurance) of a series of four quarterly parallel shocks 
of 25 basis points to the current market-implied path of interest 
rates worldwide at the beginning of each quarter from 
1 January 2017.
The sensitivities shown represent our assessment as to the 
change in expected base case net interest income under the 
two rate scenarios, assuming that all other non-interest rate 
risk variables remain constant, and there are no management 
actions. In deriving our base case net interest income 
projections, the repricing rates of assets and liabilities used 
are derived from current yield curves, thereby reflecting current 
market expectations of the future path of interest rates. The 
scenarios therefore represent interest rate shocks to the current 
market implied path of rates.
The NII sensitivities shown are indicative and based on 
simplified scenarios, including the assumption that the balance 
sheet size and structure remains static, other than instances 
where the size of the balances or repricing is deemed interest 
rate sensitive (non-interest bearing current account migration 
and fixed rate loan early prepayment) and where non-traded 
VaR is assumed to contractually run off. The limitations of this 
analysis are discussed within the ‘Risk management’ section on 
page 68.
Assuming no management response, a sequence of such rises 
(‘up-shock’) would increase expected net interest income for 
2016 by $1,709m (2015: $1,251m), while a sequence of such 
falls (‘down-shock’) would decrease planned net interest 
income by $2,406m (2015: $2,258m).
The NII sensitivity of the Group can be split into three key 
components: the structural sensitivity arising from the four 
global businesses excluding BSM and Markets, the sensitivity 
of the funding of the trading book (Markets) and the sensitivity 
of BSM.
The structural sensitivity is positive in a rising rate environment 
and negative in a falling rate environment. The sensitivity of 
the funding of the trading book is negative in a rising rate 
environment and positive in a falling rate environment, and 
in terms of the impact on profit the change in NII would be 
expected to be offset by a similar change in net trading income. 
The sensitivity of BSM will depend on its position. Typically, 
assuming no management response, the sensitivity of BSM is 
negative in a rising rate environment and positive in a falling 
rate environment.
The NII sensitivity figures also incorporate the effect of any 
interest rate behaviouralisation applied and the effect of any 
assumed repricing across products under the specific interest 
rate scenario. They do not incorporate the effect of any 
management decision to change the HSBC balance sheet 
composition.
The NII sensitivity in BSM arises from a combination of 
the techniques that BSM use to mitigate the transferred interest 
rate risk and the methods they use to optimise net revenues in 
line with their defined risk mandate. The figures in the table 
below do not incorporate the effect of any management 
decisions within BSM, but in reality it is likely that there would 
be some short-term adjustment in BSM positioning to offset 
the NII effects of the specific interest rate scenario where 
necessary.
The NII sensitivity arising from the funding of the trading book 
is comprised of the expense of funding trading assets, while the 
revenue from these trading assets is reported in net trading 
income. This leads to an asymmetry in the NII sensitivity figures 
which is cancelled out in our global business results, where we 
include both net interest income and net trading income. It is 
likely, therefore, that the overall effect on profit before tax of the 
funding of the trading book will be much less pronounced than 
the figures in the following table.

a shift in yield curves of:

–25 basis points at the beginning of each quarter (691) (74) (645) (290) (528) (30) (2,258)
For footnote, see page 126.
We expect NII to rise in the rising rate scenario and fall in the 
falling rate scenario. This is due to a structural mismatch 
between our assets and liabilities (on balance we would expect 
our assets to reprice more quickly, and to a greater extent, than 
our liabilities).
Economic value of equity
The table below sets out the assessed impact on our base case 
economic value of equity (‘EVE’) of an immediate parallel 
upward shock of 200 basis points (‘bps’) (up 200bps) and an 
immediate parallel downward shock of 200 basis points (down 
200bps) to the market-implied path of interest rates worldwide 
on 1 January 2017.
The economic value of equity remains higher than the book 
value of equity under base case, up 200bps and down 200bps 
scenarios.

Sensitivity of capital and reserves
Under CRD IV, available-for-sale (‘AFS’) reserves are included as 
part of CET1 capital. We measure the potential downside risk to 
the CET1 ratio due to interest rate and credit spread risk in the 
AFS portfolio by the portfolio’s stressed VaR, using a 99% 
confidence level and an assumed holding period of one quarter. 
At December 2016, the stressed VaR of the portfolio was
$3.2bn.
We monitor the sensitivity of reported cash flow hedging 
reserves to interest rate movements on a monthly basis by 
assessing the expected reduction in valuation of cash flow 
hedges due to parallel movements of plus or minus 100bps in 
all yield curves. These particular exposures form only a part of 
our overall interest rate exposure.
The following table describes the sensitivity of our cash flow 
hedge reported reserves to the stipulated movements in yield 
curves and the maximum and minimum month-end figures 
during the year. The sensitivities are indicative and based on 
simplified scenarios.

For our BSM governance framework, see page 79 of ‘Risk management’.
Third-party assets in BSM increased by 9% during 2016. 
Deposits with central banks increased by $28bn, predominantly 
in North America and Europe, due to deployment of increased 
commercial surplus, partly offset by decrease in the UK due to 
foreign exchange movements as sterling depreciated against 
the US dollar.
Financial investments increased by $17bn due to increases in 
Europe and Asia, as commercial surplus was deployed into 
government bonds.

Defined benefit pension schemes
Market risk arises within our defined benefit pension schemes 
to the extent that the obligations of the schemes are not fully 
matched by assets with determinable cash flows.
For details of our defined benefit schemes, including asset allocation, see 
Note 5 on the Financial Statements, and for pension risk management 
see page 84.
Additional market risk measures applicable only to the 
parent company
The principal tools used in the management of market risk are 
VaR for foreign exchange rate risk and the projected sensitivity 
of HSBC Holdings’ net interest income to future changes in 
yield curves and interest rate gap repricing tables for interest 
rate risk.
Foreign exchange risk
Total foreign exchange VaR arising within HSBC Holdings 
in 2016 was as follows:

At 31 Dec 32.1 45.6
Average 44.4 42.3
Minimum 32.1 32.9
Maximum 58.2 47.1
The foreign exchange risk largely arises from loans to 
subsidiaries of a capital nature that are not denominated in the 
functional currency of either the provider or the recipient and 
which are accounted for as financial assets. Changes in the 
carrying amount of these loans due to foreign exchange rate 
differences are taken directly to HSBC Holdings’ income  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 119
statement. These loans, and most of the associated foreign 
exchange exposures, are eliminated on consolidation.
Sensitivity of net interest income 
HSBC Holdings monitors NII sensitivity over a five-year time 
horizon reflecting the longer-term perspective on interest rate 
risk management appropriate to a financial services holding 
company. These sensitivities assume that any issuance where 
HSBC Holdings has an option to reimburse at a future call date 
is called at this date. The table below sets out the effect on 
HSBC Holdings’ future NII over a five-year time horizon of 
incremental 25 basis point parallel falls or rises in all yield 
curves worldwide at the beginning of each quarter during the 
12 months from 1 January 2016.
Assuming no management actions, a sequence of such rises 
would increase planned NII for the next five years by $746m 
(2015: increase of $247m), while a sequence of such falls would 
decrease planned NII by $723m (2015: decrease of $266m).

The interest rate sensitivities tabulated above are indicative 
and based on simplified scenarios. The figures represent 
hypothetical movements in NII based on our projected yield 
curve scenarios, HSBC Holdings’ current interest rate risk profile 
and assumed changes to that profile during the next five years. 
Changes to assumptions concerning the risk profile over the 
next five years can have a significant impact on the NII 
sensitivity for that period. However, the figures do not take 
into account the effect of actions that could be taken to mitigate 
this interest rate risk.

Operational risk profile
Operational risk is the risk to achieving our strategy or 
objectives as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes, 
people and systems or from external events. It arises from day-
to-day operations or external events, and is relevant to every 
aspect of our business.
Responsibility for minimising operational risk lies with HSBC’s 
staff. All staff are required to manage the operational risks of 
the business and operational activities for which they are 
responsible.
A summary of our current policies and practices regarding the 
management of operational risk is set out on page 80.
Operational risk exposures in 2016
HSBC continued to strengthen those controls that manage our 
most material risks in 2016. Among other measures, we:
• further embedded Global Standards into the operational 
risk management framework to ensure that we know our 
customers, ask the right questions and escalate concerns 
to prevent financial crime;
• implemented a number of initiatives to raise our standards 
in relation to the conduct of our business, as described on 
page 81 of the ‘Regulatory compliance risk management’ 
section;
• increased monitoring and enhanced detective controls 
to manage those fraud risks which arise from new 
technologies and new ways of banking;
• strengthened internal security controls to prevent cyber-
attacks;
• improved controls and security to protect customers when 
using digital channels; and
• enhanced third-party risk management capability to enable 
the consistent risk assessment of any third-party service.
Further information on the nature of these risks is provided in 
‘Top and emerging risks’ on page 64.
Operational risk losses in 2016
Operational risk losses in 2016 are lower than in 2015, reflecting 
a reduction in losses incurred relating to large legacy conduct-
related events. Conduct-related costs included in significant 
items are outlined on page 62. The profile of operational risk 
losses below shows the distribution of losses for 2015 and 2016 
against event types.

Insurance manufacturing operations risk in 2016
The majority of the risk in our insurance business derives from 
manufacturing activities and can be categorised as financial risk 
or insurance risk. Financial risks include market risk, credit risk 
and liquidity risk. Insurance risk is the risk, other than financial 
risk, of loss transferred from the holder of the insurance 
contract to the issuer (HSBC).
A summary of our current policies and practices regarding the 
management of insurance risk is set out on page 82.
HSBC’s bancassurance model
We operate an integrated bancassurance model that provides 
insurance products principally for customers with whom we 
have a banking relationship.
The insurance contracts we sell relate to the underlying needs 
of our banking customers, which we can identify from our 
point-of-sale contacts and customer knowledge. The majority 
of sales are of savings and investment products and term and 
credit life contracts.
By focusing largely on personal and SME lines of business, we 
are able to optimise volumes and diversify individual insurance 
risks. We choose to manufacture these insurance products in 
HSBC subsidiaries based on an assessment of operational scale 
and risk appetite. Manufacturing insurance allows us to retain 
the risks and rewards associated with writing insurance 
contracts by keeping part of the underwriting profit and 
investment income within the Group.
We have life insurance manufacturing subsidiaries in nine 
countries (Argentina, mainland China, France, Hong Kong, 
Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Singapore and the UK). We also have 
life insurance manufacturing associates in Saudi Arabia and 
India.
Where we do not have the risk appetite or operational scale 
to be an effective insurance manufacturer, we engage with a 
handful of leading external insurance companies in order to 
provide insurance products to our customers through our 
banking network and direct channels. These arrangements 
are generally structured with our exclusive strategic partners 
and earn the Group a combination of commissions, fees and a 
share of profits. We distribute insurance products in all of our 
geographical regions. 
Insurance products are sold through all global businesses, but 
predominantly by RBWM and CMB through our branches and 
direct channels worldwide.
The sale of our Brazilian insurance operations completed on 
1 July 2016. These operations were reported as part of the 
disposal group held for sale at 31 December 2015.
Measurement
(Audited)
The risk profile of our insurance manufacturing businesses is 
measured using an economic capital approach. Assets and 
liabilities are measured on a market value basis, and a capital 
requirement is defined to ensure that there is a less than one in 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
122 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
200 chance of insolvency over a one-year time horizon, given 
the risks that the businesses are exposed to. The methodology 
for the economic capital calculation is largely aligned to the 
pan-European Solvency II insurance capital regulations, which 
were applicable from January 2016. The economic capital 
coverage ratio (economic net asset value divided by the 
economic capital requirement) is a key risk appetite measure.
The business has a current appetite to remain above 140% 
with a tolerance of 110%. In addition to economic capital, the 
regulatory solvency ratio is also a metric used to manage risk 
appetite on an entity basis.
The tables below show the composition of assets and liabilities 
by contract type and by geographical region.

Key risk types
The key risk for the insurance operation is market risk, followed 
by insurance risk. Credit and liquidity risk, while significant for 
the bank, are minor for our insurance operations.
Market risk
(Audited)
Description and exposure
Market risk is the risk of changes in market factors affecting 
HSBC’s capital or profit. Market factors include interest rates, 
equity and growth assets, spread risk and foreign exchange 
rates. 
Our exposure varies depending on the type of contract issued. 
Our most significant life insurance products are contracts with 
discretionary participating features (‘DPF’) issued in France and 
Hong Kong. These products typically include some form of 
capital guarantee or guaranteed return on the sums invested 
by the policyholders, to which discretionary bonuses are added 
if allowed by the overall performance of the funds. These funds 
are primarily invested in bonds, with a proportion allocated to 
other asset classes to provide customers with the potential for 
enhanced returns.
DPF products expose HSBC to the risk of variation in asset 
returns, which will impact our participation in the investment 
performance. In addition, in some scenarios the asset returns 
can become insufficient to cover the policyholders’ financial 
guarantees, in which case the shortfall has to be met by HSBC. 
Reserves are held against the cost of such guarantees, 
calculated by stochastic modelling.
Where local rules require, these reserves are held as part 
of liabilities under insurance contracts. Any remainder is 
accounted for as a deduction from the present value of in-force 
(‘PVIF’) long-term insurance business on the relevant product. 
The table below shows the total reserve held for the cost of 
guarantees, the range of investment returns on assets 
supporting these products and the implied investment return 
that would enable the business to meet the guarantees.
The cost of guarantees decreased to $625m (2015: $748m) 
primarily due to changes to the profit-sharing mechanism on 
DPF contracts with guarantees in Hong Kong, which primarily 
reduced the cost of guarantees on portfolios reported in the 
2.1% to 4.0% category. In addition, there was a movement in 
cost of guarantees from the 2.1% to 4.0% category, to the 0.1% 
to 2.0% category due to reducing average guarantees on certain 
portfolios. The real annual return guarantees reported in 2015 
relate to insurance operations in Brazil, which were sold on 
1 July 2016.
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Risk
124 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
For unit-linked contracts, market risk is substantially borne 
by the policyholder, but some market risk exposure typically 
remains, as fees earned are related to the market value of the 
linked assets.

Sensitivities
Changes in financial market factors, from the economic 
assumptions in place at the start of the year, had a negative 
impact on reported profit before tax of $386m (2015: $13m 
negative). The following table illustrates the effects of selected 
interest rate, equity price and foreign exchange rate scenarios 
on our profit for the year and the total equity of our insurance 
manufacturing subsidiaries.
Where appropriate, the effects of the sensitivity tests on profit 
after tax and equity incorporate the impact of the stress on the 
PVIF. The relationship between the profit and total equity and 
the risk factors is non-linear, therefore the results disclosed 
should not be extrapolated to measure sensitivities to different 
levels of stress. For the same reason, the impact of the stress is 
not symmetrical on the upside and downside. The sensitivities 
are stated before allowance for management actions which may 
mitigate the effect of changes in the market environment. The 
sensitivities presented allow for adverse changes in policyholder 
behaviour that may arise in response to changes in market 
rates.
Interest rate movements have a greater impact on total equity 
as changes in market value of available-for-sale bonds are not 
recognised in profit after tax.
Changes in sensitivity compared to 2015 were primarily driven 
by the impact of decreasing yields in France on the projected 
cost of options and guarantees and by the adoption of a more 
market-aligned PVIF methodology in Singapore.

Credit risk
(Audited)
Description and exposure
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or 
counterparty fails to meet their obligation under a contract. It 
arises in two main areas for our insurance manufacturers:
• risk of default by debt security counterparties after investing 
premiums to generate a return for policyholders and 
shareholders; and
• risk of default by reinsurance counterparties and non-
reimbursement for claims made after ceding insurance risk.
The amounts outstanding at the balance sheet date in respect 
of these items are shown in the table on page 122.
The credit quality of the reinsurers’ share of liabilities under 
insurance contracts is assessed as ‘satisfactory’ or higher (as 
defined on page 74), with 100% of the exposure being neither 
past due nor impaired (2015: 100%). 
Credit risk on assets supporting unit-linked liabilities is 
predominantly borne by the policyholder; therefore, our 
exposure is primarily related to liabilities under non-linked 
insurance and investment contracts and shareholders’ funds. 
The credit quality of insurance financial assets is included in 
the table on page 88.
Liquidity risk
(Audited)
Description and exposure
Liquidity risk is the risk that an insurance operation, though 
solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources 
available to meet its obligations when they fall due, or can 
secure them only at excessive cost.
The following table shows the expected undiscounted cash 
flows for insurance liabilities at 31 December 2016. The liquidity 
risk exposure is wholly borne by the policyholder in the case of 
unit-linked business and is shared with the policyholder for non-
linked insurance. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 125
The profile of the expected maturity of insurance contracts at 
31 December 2016 remained comparable with 2015.
The remaining contractual maturity of investment contract 
liabilities is included in Note 29.

Insurance risk
Description and exposure
Insurance risk is the risk of loss through adverse experience, in 
either timing or amount, of insurance underwriting parameters 
(non-economic assumptions). These parameters include 
mortality, morbidity, longevity, lapses and unit costs.
The principal risk we face is that, over time, the cost of the 
contract, including claims and benefits, may exceed the total 
amount of premiums and investment income received. 
The tables on pages 122 and 123 analyse our life insurance risk 
exposures by type of contract and by geographical region. 
The insurance risk profile and related exposures remain largely 
consistent with those observed at 31 December 2015.
Sensitivities 
(Audited)
The table below shows the sensitivity of profit and total equity 
to reasonably possible changes in non-economic assumptions 
across all our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries.
Mortality and morbidity risk is typically associated with life 
insurance contracts. The effect on profit of an increase in 
mortality or morbidity depends on the type of business being 
written. Our largest exposures to mortality and morbidity risk 
exist in Hong Kong and Singapore.
Sensitivity to lapse rates depends on the type of contracts 
being written. For a portfolio of term assurance, an increase in 
lapse rates typically has a negative effect on profit due to the 
loss of future income on the lapsed policies. However, some 
contract lapses have a positive effect on profit due to the 
existence of policy surrender charges. We are most sensitive 
to a change in lapse rates on unit-linked and universal life 
contracts in Hong Kong and Singapore, and DPF contracts 
in France.
Expense rate risk is the exposure to a change in the cost 
of administering insurance contracts. To the extent that 
increased expenses cannot be passed on to policyholders, 
an increase in expense rates will have a negative effect on 
our profits.

Market risk
51 Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from the market-making and
warehousing of customer-derived positions.
52 Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a
portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in
unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different
risk types; for example, interest rate, equity and foreign exchange, together
in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the
VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number
represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and
minimum occurs on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful
to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures.
53 The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects.
54 Investments in private equity are primarily made through managed funds that
are subject to limits on the amount of investment. Potential new commitments
are subject to risk appraisal to ensure that industry and geographical
concentrations remain within acceptable levels for the portfolio as a whole.
Regular reviews are performed to substantiate the valuation of the
investments within the portfolio.
55 Investments held to facilitate ongoing business include holdings in
government-sponsored enterprises and local stock exchanges.
56 Instead of assuming that all interest rates move together, we group our
interest rate exposures into currency blocs whose rates are considered likely
to move together. See page 281, ‘Cautionary statement regarding forward-
looking statements’.

contracts.
66 Real annual return guarantees provide the policyholder a guaranteed return
in excess of the rate of inflation, and are supported by inflation-linked debt
securities with yields that are also expressed in real terms.
67 Where a -100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve would result in a
negative interest rate, the effects on profit after tax and total equity have been

• Our common equity tier 1 (‘CET1’) ratio of 13.6%  was up from
11.9% at the end of 2015, mainly due to a change in the regulatory
treatment of Bank of Communications Co., Limited ('BoCom').
• Our CET1 capital base reduced during the year by $14.3bn, driven 
by unfavourable foreign currency movements of $7.7bn, a $5.6bn 
reduction due to the BoCom change, and the $2.5bn share buy-
back.
• A decrease in RWAs in 2016 of $245.8bn from continued
implementation of RWA-reduction initiatives, the BoCom change
and favourable foreign currency movements, supported the increase
in capital ratios.

Capital management
(Audited)
Our objective in the management of Group capital is to maintain 
appropriate levels of capital to support our business strategy, 
and meet our regulatory and stress testing related 
requirements.
Approach and policy
Our approach to capital management is driven by our strategic 
and organisational requirements, taking into account the 
regulatory, economic and commercial environment. It is our 
objective to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks 
inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our 
strategy, meeting both consolidated and local regulatory capital 
requirements at all times. Our policy on capital management is 
underpinned by a capital management framework and our 
internal capital adequacy assessment process (‘ICAAP’), which 
enables us to manage our capital in a consistent manner. The 
framework incorporates a number of different capital measures 
calculated on an economic capital and regulatory capital basis. 
The internal capital adequacy assessment process brings 
together regulatory and internal capital resources and 
requirements with HSBC’s business model, strategy, 
performance and planning, risks to capital, and the implications 
of stress testing to assess the bank’s capital position.
Our assessment of capital adequacy is aligned to our 
assessment of risks. These include credit, market, operational, 
pensions, insurance, structural foreign exchange risk, residual 
risks and interest rate risk in the banking book.
Planning and performance 
Capital plans and RWA plans form part of the Annual Operating 
Plan that is approved by the Board. Revised RWA forecasts are 
submitted to the GMB on a monthly basis and reported RWAs 
are monitored against plan.
The responsibility for global capital allocation principles and 
decisions rests with the Group Finance Director. Through our 
internal governance processes, we seek to maintain discipline 
over our investment and capital allocation decisions, and seek 
to ensure that returns on investment meet the Group’s 
management objectives. Our strategy is to allocate capital to 
businesses and entities to support growth objectives where 
above hurdle returns have been identified and their regulatory 
and economic capital needs.
We manage business returns by use of a return on risk-
weighted assets (‘RoRWA’) measure. In 2016, we augmented 
this through the introduction of financial information and 
metrics on the consumption of, and returns on, capital by global 
business to support management’s assessment of business 
performance and the allocation of capital resources. We plan 
to further embed this in 2017.
Risks to capital
Outside the stress testing framework, other risks may be 
identified that have the potential to affect our RWAs and/or 
capital position. The downside or upside scenarios are assessed 
against our capital management objectives and mitigating 
actions are assigned as necessary. 
Stress testing
In addition to an annual internal stress test, the Group is subject 
to supervisory stress testing in many jurisdictions. Supervisory 
stress testing requirements are increasing in frequency and in 
the granularity with which the results are required. These 
exercises include the programmes of the PRA, the FRB, the 
EBA, the ECB and the HKMA, as well as stress tests undertaken 
in other jurisdictions. We take into account the results of all 
such regulatory stress testing and our internal stress test when 
assessing our internal capital requirements. The outcome of 
stress testing exercises carried out by the PRA will also feed 
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financial Review  Report of the Directors | Capital
128 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
into a PRA buffer under the Pillar 2 requirements, where 
required.
Capital generation
HSBC Holdings is the provider of equity capital to its 
subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital 
where necessary. These investments are substantially funded by 
HSBC Holdings’ own capital issuance and profit retention. As 
part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks 
to maintain a prudent balance between the composition of its 
capital and its investment in subsidiaries.

Throughout 2016, we complied with the Prudential Regulation 
Authority’s (‘PRA’) regulatory capital adequacy requirements, 
including those relating to stress testing.
Following a clarification of policy by the PRA, at 30 September 
2016 the regulatory treatment of our investment in BoCom 
changed from proportional consolidation of RWAs to a 
deduction from capital (subject to regulatory thresholds). 
The revised regulatory treatment is more consistent with our 
financial reporting treatment, aligning with the equity method 
of accounting, and better reflects our relationship with BoCom, 
including the nature of our obligations and financial 
commitments.
CET1 capital decreased during the year by $14.3bn, primarily 
because of:
• unfavourable foreign currency translation differences of 
$7.8bn;
• a $5.6bn reduction from the change in treatment of BoCom; 
and
• the $2.5bn share buy-back.
These decreases were partly offset by:
• $2.4bn from the sale of our operations in Brazil.
Risk-weighted assets
RWAs
RWAs decreased in 2016 by $245.8bn, of which $38.1bn was 
due to foreign currency translation differences. RWA initiatives 
reduced RWAs by $143.2bn, partly offset by book size 
movements increasing RWAs by $38.7bn. The change of 
regulatory treatment of our investment in BoCom reduced 
RWAs by $120.9bn.
The following comments describe RWA movements in 2016, 
excluding foreign currency translation differences. 
RWA initiatives
The main drivers of these reductions were:
• $69.8bn as a result of reduced exposures, refined 
calculations and process improvements;
• $41.8bn from the sale of our activities in Brazil; and
• $31.6bn through the continued reduction in Legacy Credit 
and US run-off portfolios.
Book size
Book size movements increased RWAs by $38.7bn, principally 
from:
• increased corporate lending in GB&M and CMB, increasing 
RWAs by $32bn in Asia and Europe; 
• movements in market parameters increasing counterparty 
credit risk and market risk by $11.7bn; and
• offset by a decrease in operational risk RWAs of $3.4bn 
reflecting the decrease of average income over three years.

* The references identify the lines prescribed in the EBA template.
Our leverage ratio calculated on CRR basis was 5.4% at 
31 December 2016, up from 5.0% at 31 December 2015. 
This was mainly due to a reduction in the exposure measure 
resulting from the change in regulatory treatment of our 
investment in BoCom.
The Group’s UK leverage ratio on a modified basis, excluding 
qualifying central bank balances, was 5.7%. This modification 
to the leverage ratio exposure measure was made following 
recommendations by the Bank of England’s Financial Policy 
Committee.
The Financial Policy Committee has stated that it intends to 
recalibrate the leverage ratio in 2017 to take account of this 
modification. HSBC’s UK leverage ratio on a modified basis 
should be considered in this context.
At 31 December 2016, our UK minimum leverage ratio 
requirement of 3% was supplemented by an additional leverage 
ratio buffer of 0.2%. This additional buffer translates to a value 
of $5bn. The countercyclical leverage ratio buffer results in no 
capital impact. We comfortably exceeded these leverage 
requirements.
Pillar 3 disclosure requirements
Pillar 3 of the Basel regulatory framework is related to market 
discipline and aims to make firms more transparent by requiring 
publication, at least annually, of wide-ranging information on 
their risks, capital and management. Pillar 3 Disclosures 2016 
is published on our website, www.hsbc.com, under Investor 
Relations.

Global Internal Audit Charter www.hsbc.com/investor-relations/
governance/internal-control
HSBC is subject to corporate governance requirements in both 
the UK and Hong Kong. During 2016, HSBC complied with the 
applicable provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and also the requirements of the Hong Kong Corporate 
Governance Code.
Under the Hong Kong Code the Audit Committee should be 
responsible for the oversight of all risk management and 
internal control systems. HSBC’s Group Risk Committee is 
responsible for oversight of internal control, other than internal 
control over financial reporting, and risk management systems. 
This is permitted under the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Board has codified obligations for transactions in HSBC 
Group securities in accordance with the requirements of the 
Market Abuse Regulation and the rules governing the listing of 
securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited 
(‘HKEx’), save that the HKEx has granted waivers from strict 
compliance with the rules that take into account accepted 
practices in the UK, particularly in respect of employee share 
plans. HSBC is in discussion with the HKEx to update these 
waivers to take account of the Market Abuse Regulation. 
Following specific enquiry, each Director has confirmed that he 
or she has complied with their obligations in respect of 
transacting in Group securities during the year.
The Board
The Board aims to promote the Group’s long-term success, 
deliver sustainable value to shareholders and promote a culture 
of openness and debate.
Led by the Group Chairman, the Board sets the Group’s strategy 
and risk appetite. It also approves capital and operating plans 
for achieving strategic objectives, on the recommendation of 
management.
Powers of the Board
The Board is responsible for overseeing the management of 
HSBC globally and, in so doing, may exercise its powers, 
subject to any relevant laws, regulations and HSBC Holdings’ 
Articles of Association (the ‘Articles of Association’).
Although the Board delegates day-to-day management of the 
business and implementation of strategy to the Group Chief 
Executive, certain matters, including annual operating plans, 
risk appetite and performance targets, procedures for 
monitoring and control of operations, approval of credit or 
market risk limits, acquisitions, disposals, investments, capital 
expenditure or realisation or creation of a new venture, specified 
senior appointments and any substantial change in balance 
sheet management policy are reserved by the Board for 
approval.
Executive Directors
The Group Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group 
Finance Director and the Group Chief Risk Officer are HSBC 
employees.
Non-executive Directors
The Board comprises a majority of independent non-executive 
Directors. Their role is to constructively challenge, scrutinise the 
performance of management and help develop proposals on 
strategy. They also review the performance of management in 
meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the Group’s 
risk profile.
The Board considers all non-executive Directors to be 
independent of HSBC. The Board has concluded that there are 
no relationships or circumstances likely to affect any individual 
non-executive Director’s judgement. To satisfy the Rules 
Governing the Listing of Securities on the HKEx, all non-
executive Directors have provided confirmation of their 
independence during the year. Sam Laidlaw has served on the 
Board for more than nine years and, in that respect only, does 
not meet the usual criteria for independence set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the Hong Kong Corporate 
Governance Code. The Board has determined Sam Laidlaw to 
be independent in character and judgement, notwithstanding 
his length of service, taking into account his continuing level of 
constructive challenge of management and strong contribution 
to Board discussions. He will, however, be retiring from the 
Board at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
Role and support of Directors
The roles of Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive are 
separate, with a clear division of responsibilities between the 
running of the Board and executive responsibility for running 
HSBC’s business. Their respective roles are set out in writing 
and are available on the website at www.hsbc.com/about-hsbc/
corporate-governance/board-committees, along with the role 
description of the Senior Independent Director (‘SID’). HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 133

Board of Directors
Appointment, retirement and re-election of 
Directors
Appointments to the Board are made on merit and candidates 
are considered against objective criteria, having due regard to 
the benefits of diversity on the Board. A rigorous selection 
process, overseen by the Nomination Committee and based 
upon agreed requirements using an external search 
consultancy, is followed in relation to the appointment of non-
executive Directors.
During the year Henri de Castries, David Nish, Jackson Tai and 
Paul Walsh were appointed to the Board. Their biographies can 
be found on pages 133 to 136.
The number of Directors must not be less than five nor exceed 
25. The Board may at any time appoint any person as a Director, 
either to fill a vacancy or as an addition to the existing Board. 
The Board may appoint any Director to hold any employment 
or executive office and may revoke or terminate any such 
appointment. Shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, appoint 
a person as a Director or remove any Director before the 
expiration of his or her period of office. 
Newly appointed Directors retire at the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) following appointment and are eligible for election. All 
Directors are nominated for annual re-election by shareholders 
subject to continued satisfactory performance based upon an 
assessment by the Group Chairman and the Nomination 
Committee.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial three-year 
term and, subject to re-election by shareholders at AGMs, are 
typically expected to serve two three-year terms. The Board may 
invite a Director to serve additional periods. Any term beyond 
six years is subject to particularly rigorous review.
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive 
Directors are set out in a letter of appointment, which includes 
the expectations of them and the time estimated for them to 
meet their commitment to the Group. The current anticipated 
minimum time commitment, which is subject to periodic review 
and adjustment by the Board, is 30 days per year. Non-executive 
Directors are also advised that the time they need to devote to 
the Group may be considerably more if they serve on Board 
Committees or as other matters require. All non-executive 
Directors have confirmed they can meet this requirement, 
taking into account any other commitments they have at the 
time of appointment, and most devote considerably more time.
During their term of appointment, non-executive Directors are 
expected to consult the Group Chairman or the Group Company 
Secretary if they are considering whether to accept or vary any 
commitments outside the Group. The agreement of the Group 
Chairman is required if any additional or changed commitment 
might affect the time that a Director is able to devote to his or 
her role with the Group.
Letters setting out the terms of appointment of each non-
executive Director are available for inspection at the registered 
office of HSBC Holdings. The Board diversity policy is available 
at www.hsbc.com/investor-relations/governance/corporate-
governance-codes.
Induction
Formal induction programmes are arranged for newly appointed 
Directors, based on the individual’s needs, skills and experience. 
Typically, these consist of a series of meetings with other 
Directors and senior executives, as well as local site visits, to 
provide familiarity with the business. Directors also receive 
comprehensive guidance from the Group Company Secretary on 
the Group’s governance framework and associated policies, as 
well as their duties as Directors on the Board. During the year 
Henri de Castries, David Nish, Paul Walsh and Jackson Tai 
completed a formal induction programme.
Operation of the Board
The Board regularly reviews reports on performance against 
financial and other strategic objectives, key business 
challenges, risk, business developments, and investor and 
external relations. During 2016, it also considered presentations 
on strategy and performance by each of the global businesses 
and across the principal geographical areas.
All of HSBC’s activities involve the measurement, evaluation, 
acceptance and management of risk or combinations of risks. 
The Board, advised by the Group Risk Committee (‘GRC’), 
Conduct & Values Committee (‘CVC’) and the Financial System 
Vulnerabilities Committee (‘FSVC’), promotes a strong risk 
governance culture which shapes the Group’s attitude to risk. 
The Board and these committees oversee the development and 
maintenance of a strong risk management framework.
The Group Company Secretary will ensure that agenda and 
supporting papers are distributed in advance of Board and 
Board committee meetings to allow reasonable time for review 
and to facilitate full discussion at the meetings.
The Chairman met with the non-executive Directors without the 
other executive Directors in attendance. The SID also facilitated 
meetings of the non-executive Directors without the attendance 
of executive Directors, including that of the Group Chairman.
The Directors are encouraged to have free and open contact 
with management at all levels and full access to all relevant 
information. When attending off-site Board meetings and 
when travelling for other reasons, non-executive Directors are 
encouraged to visit local business operations and meet local 
management.
Directors may take independent professional advice, if 
necessary, at HSBC Holdings’ expense.
Conflicts of interest, indemnification of Directors 
and contracts of significance
The Board has established a policy and procedures relating to 
Directors’ conflicts of interest. Where conflicts of interest arise, 
the Board has the power to authorise them. A review of those 
conflicts which have been authorised, and the terms of those 
authorisations, is undertaken by the Board annually.
The Articles of Association state that Directors are entitled to be 
indemnified out of the assets of HSBC Holdings against claims 
from third parties in respect of certain liabilities. All Directors 
have the benefit of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
None of the Directors had, during the year, a material interest, 
directly or indirectly, in any contract of significance with any 
HSBC company. Each Director is routinely reminded of their 
obligations in respect of transacting in HSBC Group securities 
and has confirmed that he or she has complied with regulatory 
requirements. 
Board performance evaluation
The Board is committed to regular, independent evaluation of its 
own effectiveness and that of its committees. For 2015/16, an 
independent review was undertaken by Heidrick & Struggles/
JCA Group, an independent third-party firm that has no other 
connection with HSBC Holdings. The process involved an 
extensive series of interviews and meetings with the non-
executive Directors, together with input from members of the 
Group Management Board. Actions arising from the review 
were presented and discussed in detail with the Board in 
February 2016 and then tracked throughout the remainder of 
the year and reported to the Board.
Given the ongoing nature of these actions, a follow-up review 
is to be conducted during the first half of 2017, the outcome 
of which will be published in the 2017 Annual Report. In the 
interim period, the performance evaluation of the individual 
Directors was conducted internally, as provided for under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, by the Group Chairman and 
the SID. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 139
Set out below are areas of particular focus from the 2015/16 review that the Board has addressed during the year: 
Theme Action taken
Agenda management Board agendas were revised to allow for a greater focus on business strategy and financial and operational 
performance. 
A rolling cycle of annual deep dives across each of the four global businesses and the Group’s principal 
geographical regions was established. A detailed presentation of the technology and digital opportunities 
facing the Group was also arranged with an explanation of how the Group is currently responding to them 
and the Group’s longer-term strategic response. 
Improvements were made to the process for the preparation, submission and distribution of management 
information and Board and Committee papers.
Committee efficiency The operation of the Committees was reviewed to improve efficiency and address overlaps and any gaps in
their responsibilities.
Continued development of the cohesive
relationship between non-executive
Directors and senior management
More opportunities were created for senior management to interact with non-executive Directors both inside
and outside formal Board meetings, and to increase Board exposure to other high potential managers in the
Group.
Succession planning There has been a continued focus by the Board, through the Nomination Committee, on executive and non-
executive succession planning. A committee has been established to oversee succession planning for the
Group Chairman.
Director performance evaluation
Non-executive Directors’ individual performance evaluation is 
undertaken annually by the Group Chairman. This involves a 
discussion about a Director’s individual contribution, explores 
individual training and development needs, and the time 
commitment that is required to continue to deliver the role 
effectively. The Group Chairman has confirmed that all non-
executive Directors continue to perform effectively, contribute 
positively to the governance of HSBC and are able to fully 
commit the time required for their roles.
Executive Directors’ individual performance evaluation is 
undertaken as part of the performance management process 
for all employees. The results are considered by the Group 
Remuneration Committee when determining variable pay 
awards each year.
The Group Chairman’s performance is evaluated by the non-
executive Directors, led by the SID.
Training and development
Training and development is provided for each Director, and is 
regularly reviewed by the Group Chairman supported by the 
Group Company Secretary. All executive Directors develop 
and refresh their skills and knowledge through day-to-day 
interactions and briefings with senior management of the 
Group’s businesses and functions.
A two-day forum for all of the Group’s non-executive Directors 
was held during the year. Awareness and discussion sessions 
were conducted by senior executives and subject matter experts 
on emerging technologies, financial crime compliance, 
regulatory initiatives and other business developments. The 
following Directors attended these sessions: David Nish, 
Joachim Faber, John Lipsky, Jonathan Symonds, Kathleen 
Casey and Paul Walsh. Jonathan Symonds and Joachim Faber 
hosted a separate forum for the Chairs of the Group’s audit and 
risk committees globally.
In addition, all members of the Group Audit Committee (‘GAC’) 
received refresher training in IFRS 9 and the Committee Chairs 
received training in the requirements of the Senior Managers 
Regime. As part of their induction programme, David Nish, 
Henri de Castries and Paul Walsh received training on the 
Volcker Rule. 
Shareholder engagement
Communication with shareholders is given high priority by the 
Board and a copy of its policy is available at www.hsbc.com. 
Extensive information about HSBC and its activities is provided 
to shareholders in the Annual Report and Accounts, the Strategic 
Report and the Interim Report as well as at www.hsbc.com.
To compliment these, there is regular dialogue with institutional 
investors. Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their 
shareholdings and HSBC’s business are welcomed.
Directors are encouraged to develop an understanding of the 
views of major shareholders. Non-executive Directors are invited 
to attend analyst presentations and other meetings with 
institutional investors and their representative bodies. An annual 
governance breakfast is also held, which gives institutional 
investors an opportunity to engage with the non-executive 
Directors and senior management on governance matters. All 
executive Directors hold regular meetings with institutional 
investors and feedback from these meetings is routinely 
provided to the Board. 
As SID, Rachel Lomax is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that cannot be resolved or for which the normal 
channels would be inappropriate. She may be contacted via 
the Group Company Secretary at 8 Canada Square, London 
E14 5HQ.
The AGM and other general meetings
The 2017 AGM will be held at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference 
Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London SW1P 3EE on 
Friday 28 April at 11.00am and a live webcast will be available 
on www.hsbc.com. A recording of the proceedings will be 
available on www.hsbc.com shortly after the conclusion of the 
AGM until 28 May 2017. An informal meeting of shareholders 
will be held at 1 Queen’s Road Central, Hong Kong on Monday 
24 April at 4.30pm. Shareholders are encouraged to attend 
these meetings. Shareholders may send enquiries to the Board 
in writing via the Group Company Secretary, HSBC Holdings 
plc, 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ or by sending an email 
to shareholderquestions@hsbc.com.
Shareholders may require the Directors to call a general 
meeting other than an AGM as provided by the UK Companies 
Act 2006. Requests to call a general meeting may be made by 
members representing at least 5% of the paid-up capital of 
HSBC Holdings that carries the right of voting at its general 
meetings (excluding any paid-up capital held as treasury 
shares). A request must state the general nature of the business 
to be dealt with at the meeting and may include the text of a 
resolution that may properly be moved and is intended to be 
moved at the meeting. A request may be in hard copy form or 
in electronic form and must be authenticated by the person or 
persons making it. A request may be made in writing to HSBC 
Holdings at its UK address, referred to in the paragraph above 
or by sending an email to shareholderquestions@hsbc.com. At 
any general meeting convened on such request, no business 
shall be transacted except that stated by the requisition or 
proposed by the Board.

Board Committees
The Board has seven standing committees and a Chairman’s 
Committee. In the case of the FSVC and the Philanthropic & 
Community Investment Oversight Committee, membership 
includes co-opted non-Director members as well as non-
executive Directors.
The Chairs of each Committee report matters of significance to 
the Board after each meeting and the minutes of the meetings 
are made available to all Board members.
The detailed roles and responsibilities of each Committee are 
set out in its terms of reference, which can be found on the 
website at www.hsbc.com/about-hsbc/corporate-governance/
board-committees.
Committee interaction
The Board places significant reliance on its Committees and 
delegates a broad range of responsibilities to them. It is 
therefore important that, while unnecessary duplications 
between each remit of the Committees should be avoided, 
effective links should exist between Committees and the
Board where required.
Principal subsidiaries
The GRC works closely with the GAC to strengthen alignment 
with the major regional and global business risk and audit 
committees.
The GAC and GRC make a number of recommendations to the 
Board in relation to the preparation of the financial statements 
which are supported by certificates from the principal 
subsidiaries.
Whistleblowing
The GAC and the CVC are responsible for reviewing the Group’s 
whistleblowing procedures and received regular updates on 
relevant concerns raised under these procedures, together with 
management actions taken in response.
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committees is evaluated as part of the 
overall performance evaluation of the Board as referred to 
above. In addition, the Committees review the papers and the 
effectiveness of each meeting as a standing agenda item to 
ensure that they continue to be effective, challenging and well-
managed, and review a rolling planner of proposed committee 
business.

Role and responsibilities
The GAC has non-executive responsibility for matters relating to 
financial reporting, including Pillar 3 disclosures and internal 
control over financial reporting. 
Governance
The Group Finance Director, Group Chief Accounting Officer, 
Group Head of Internal Audit and other members of senior 
management routinely attend meetings of the GAC. The 
external auditor, PwC, also attended all meetings. The Chairman 
of the GAC had regular meetings to discuss agenda planning 
and specific issues as they arose during the year. 
How the Committee discharges its responsibilities
Financial reporting
The GAC reviews HSBC’s financial and reporting judgements 
and their application to the Group’s financial reporting, 
including Pillar 3 disclosures. It also reviews presentations to 
external analysts including the key financial metrics relating 
to HSBC’s strategic actions.
The GAC assesses the adequacy of resources of the accounting 
and financial reporting function. It also monitors the legal and 
regulatory environment.
Internal controls
The GAC assesses the effectiveness of the internal control 
system for financial reporting and any developments affecting 
it in support of the Board’s assessment of internal control over 
financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
The GAC has received confirmation that executive management 
has taken or is taking the necessary actions to remedy any 
failings or weaknesses identified through the operation of the 
Groups framework of controls.
Further detail of how the Board reviews the effectiveness of 
key aspects of internal control can be found on page 145.
External audit
The GAC meets privately with the external auditor at every 
Committee meeting and the GAC Chairman maintains regular 
contact with the audit partner throughout the year.
The GAC reviews the external auditor’s approach and strategy 
for the annual audit.
All non-audit services provided by PwC are pre-approved by 
the GAC in accordance with the auditor independence policy 
to ensure that services do not create a conflict. The auditor 
independence policy has been revised with effect from 
1 January 2017 to take account of the UK implementation of 
new EU audit rules. Details of the significant engagements for 
non-audit services are contained in Note 6.
A policy is in place and monitored by the GAC on hiring 
employees or former employees of the external auditor.
Internal Audit
The GAC approves Internal Audit’s annual plan, resource and 
budget, and reviews the performance of the Group Head of 
Internal Audit and the performance and effectiveness of its 
head. The Group Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chairman 
of the GAC and the Committee regularly meets with the Group 
Head of Internal Audit without other management present.
Compliance with Regulatory Requirements
The Board is satisfied that each member of the GAC is 
independent according to SEC criteria, may be regarded as 
audit committee financial experts for the purposes of section 
407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and has recent and relevant 
financial experience for the purposes of the UK and Hong Kong 
Corporate Governance Codes. 
The Committee has complied with the relevant parts of the 
Competition and Markets Authority Final Order on the statutory 
audit market for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Principal activities and significant issues considered 
during 2016
External auditor
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of PwC as the 
Group’s external auditor, using a questionnaire which focused 
on the overall audit process, its effectiveness and the quality of 
output. It concluded that PwC had performed a high-quality and 
effective audit in 2016.
Fees payable to PwC for the year ended 31 December 2016 
totalled $111.1m, of which $39.8m or 35.8% was payable in 
respect of non-audit services. A further breakdown of the fees 
paid to the auditors for each of the last three financial years can 
be found in Note 6 on the Financial Statements.
The GAC considered PwC to be independent and PwC, in 
accordance with professional ethical standards, provided the 
GAC with written confirmation of its independence for the 
duration of 2016.
The GAC has therefore recommended to the Board that PwC 
be reappointed as auditor. Resolutions concerning the 
reappointment of PwC and their audit fee for 2017 will be 
proposed to shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
Internal Audit
The GAC concluded that the Internal Audit function remained 
effective.
Finance transformation project
The Finance function has embarked on a large scale three-year 
transformation project to respond to the future needs of a 
changing industry facing increased regulatory demands.
The project also included embedding internal controls and 
improving the consistency of critical financial processes across 
the Group.
Internal control framework
The GAC continued to monitor the progress being made to 
upgrade entity level controls and remediate issues identified 
in 2015.
In particular, the GAC continued to monitor the remediation of 
controls over access management in IT and the next phase in 
terms of the enhancement of strategic controls. The GAC was 
encouraged by the progress being made.
Changing regulatory landscape
Given the changing legal and regulatory landscape, the GAC 
continued to receive detailed presentations and updates from 
management on the Group’s readiness to implement IFRS 9 
Financial Instruments and the revised Basel framework’s Pillar 3 
disclosure requirements.

142 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Significant accounting judgements considered during 2016 included:
Key area Action taken
Appropriateness of
provisioning for legal
proceedings and
regulatory matters
The GAC received reports from management on the recognition and amounts of provisions, the existence of contingent
liabilities, and the disclosures relating to provisions and contingent liabilities for legal proceedings and regulatory
matters. Specific areas addressed included provisioning arising from investigations by US regulators and law
enforcement agencies relating to trading activities in the foreign exchange market and competition law investigations
relating to foreign exchange activities in a number of jurisdictions; and management’s judgement regarding provisions
and contingent liabilities in connection with investigations of HSBC’s Swiss Private Bank by a number of tax
administration, regulatory and law enforcement authorities. The GAC also considered management’s assumptions and
judgements relating to the disclosure of a contingent liability in respect of investigations into historical sales of US
mortgage securitisations by The United States Attorney for the District of Colorado for potential violations of The
Financial Industry Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, 12 U.S.C. § 1833a.
Quarterly and annual
reporting
The GAC considered key judgements in relation to quarterly and annual reporting. In addition, it considered external
analysts’ presentations and key financial metrics included in HSBC’s strategic actions.
Loan impairment, 
allowances and charges
The GAC considered loan impairment allowances for personal and wholesale lending. Significant judgements and
estimates for personal lending included a review of loss emergence periods across the retail loan portfolios and the
potential impact of the UK electorate's vote to leave the EU. For wholesale lending, the GAC considered management’s
judgements and assumptions in respect of the recognition of judgemental collective impairment allowances for oil and
gas exposures, and judgements relating to impairment allowances recognised for individual identified cases, as at
31 December 2016, and noted the ongoing monitoring for signs of credit deterioration that could result from the UK
electorate's vote to leave the EU.
Valuation of financial
instruments
The GAC considered the key valuation metrics and judgements involved in the determination of the fair value of financial
instruments. The GAC considered the valuation control framework, valuation metrics, significant year-end judgements
and emerging valuation topics.
Viability statement Under the obligations of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Directors have carried out a robust assessment of the
principal risks for the Group and parent company. The GAC has considered the Directors' judgement in concluding that
the Group and parent company will be able to continue in operation and meet liabilities as they fall due, and that it is
appropriate that the viability statement covers a period of three years.
UK customer remediation The GAC considered the provisions for redress for mis-selling of payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policies, in the UK,
including management’s judgements regarding the effect of the proposed time-bar for claims ending June 2019. The
GAC also considered provisions in relation to the implications of a 2014 UK court case (‘Plevin’) for the non-disclosure of
levels of commission regarding the historical sales of PPI products, pending finalised guidance from the Financial
Conduct Authority (‘FCA’).
Bank of Communications
Co., Limited (‘BoCom’)
impairment testing
During the year, the GAC considered the regular impairment reviews of HSBC’s investment in BoCom. When testing
investments in associates for impairment, IFRS requires the carrying amount to be compared with the higher of fair value
and value in use. The GAC reviewed a number of aspects of management’s work in this area, including the sensitivity of
the result of the impairment review to estimates and assumptions of projected future cash flows and the discount rate. It
was concluded that the investment was not impaired.
Goodwill impairment
testing
The GAC noted the process and results of the 1 July 2016 annual goodwill impairment test and the review of impairment 
indicators at 30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016. During the year, impairment indicators were noted for GPB Europe 
and GBM Europe. No impairment was recognised for GBM Europe.
The GAC considered management’s judgements in respect of the impairment charge of $0.8bn relating to GPB Europe 
goodwill in H1 2016, and the further impairment charge of $2.4bn in Q4 2016, resulting in the impairment of the entire 
balance of goodwill for GPB Europe in 2016. There were two main factors which led to indicators of impairment being 
identified:
• during the year, revised forecast cash flows became available; and
• management adjusted the discount rates used in the goodwill tests due to the results of the UK EU Referendum 
decision.
Hedge accounting The GAC considered management’s judgements relating to the partial discontinuation of a hedging relationship in France 
in December 2016. The GAC discussed the control weaknesses, which were limited to France, and noted management’s 
actions to address them.
Recognition of deferred
tax assets
In considering the recoverability of the Group’s deferred tax assets, the GAC reviewed the recognition of deferred tax
assets in the US and, in the first half of 2016, in the Brazil operations which were sold in July 2016, and the associated
projections of future taxable income.
Operating segments The GAC considered the change in reportable segments during the year under IFRS 8, from regions to global businesses, 
and the introduction of a Corporate Centre segment.
Group Risk Committee
Members
Joachim Faber (Chairman)
John Lipsky
Rachel Lomax
Heidi Miller
Jackson Tai (appointed on 12 September 2016)
Role and responsibilities
The GRC has non-executive responsibility for the oversight of 
risk-related matters and the principal risks impacting the Group, 
risk governance and internal control systems (other than 
internal financial control systems). The GRC is updated on, but 
is not directly responsible for, overseeing risks relating to 
financial crime, cyber-crime and information security, anti-
bribery and corruption, and culture and conduct. These risks are 
overseen by the FSVC and the CVC.
Governance
The Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Finance Director, Chief 
Legal Officer, Group Head of Internal Audit, Global Head of 
Regulatory Compliance, Global Head of Financial Crime 
Compliance, Group Head of Financial Crime Risk and other 
members of senior management attended meetings of the 
GRC by invitation to contribute to discussions relating to their 
areas of expertise.
The GRC works closely with the GAC to ensure that any areas 
of significant overlap are appropriately addressed and to 
improve inter-committee communication. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 143
The GRC holds meetings with the Group Chief Risk Officer and, 
separately, with the Group Head of Internal Audit without 
management present.
How the Committee discharges its responsibilities
As a standing item on the rolling planner the GRC reviews the 
Group Risk Appetite Statement (‘RAS’), the risk map (which 
describes the Group’s risk profile by risk type across the global 
businesses) and a report on the top and emerging risks 
(together with mitigating actions for the identified risks). This 
also identifies any areas where management needed to assess 
vulnerabilities via stress testing.
Page 64 provides further information on the top and emerging 
risks, the risk map and the risk appetite for the Group.
The GRC receives presentations on a range of topics, including 
stress testing and briefings on developments in the regulatory 
environment. In addition, the GRC requests reports and updates 
from management on risk-related issues for in-depth 
consideration and receives regular reports on matters discussed 
at the Risk Management Meeting of the Group Management 
Board (‘GMB’). It has continued to invite senior management 
from the global businesses and functions to present their risk 
control frameworks, which has led to enhanced discussions of 
the risk environment.
Any revisions to the RAS are reviewed bi-annually by GRC and 
any changes are recommended to the Board. The GRC regularly 
reviews the Group’s risk profile against the key performance 
metrics set out in the RAS. It reviews management’s 
assessment of risk and provides scrutiny of management’s 
proposed mitigating actions.
Regular reports are received on legal and regulatory risks. 
Management actions to mitigate these risks are reviewed 
and the potential impact of future developments in this area 
on the Group are considered.
Principal activities and significant issues considered 
during 2016
The Group Risk Appetite Statement (‘RAS’) and 
monitoring of the Group risk profile against the RAS
There were no significant changes to the RAS in 2016.
Stress testing
The PRA and EBA stress testing exercises and the results of 
stress testing were closely monitored and reviewed prior to 
submission. Reports were received over the course of the stress 
testing exercise and the Committee met an additional four times 
during the year solely to consider stress testing related matters, 
including additional stress tests specific to oil and gas 
exposures and the UK electorate's vote to leave the EU.
Execution risk
Regular reports were received from the Group Chief Operating 
Officer, who updated each meeting on the progress and status 
of the Group’s highest-priority programmes and mitigating 
measures being introduced to manage the identified risks 
appropriately.
Monitoring of this risk and challenging management’s 
assessment of execution risk and corresponding mitigating 
actions remains a priority for the GRC.
Internal control and risk management
The GRC reviewed the Group’s risk management framework 
and system of internal control (other than internal financial 
control systems, which were covered by the GAC) and the 
developments affecting them over the course of 2016, as part 
of the Board’s assessment of internal control.
In 2016 the Group Risk Committee appointed an external 
independent expert to assess the effectiveness of the 
committee.
Further detail of how the Board reviews the effectiveness of key aspects of 
internal control can be found on page 145.

and also employee volunteering.
Principal activities and significant issues considered 
during 2016
Charitable giving
The Committee was responsible for reviewing the Group’s risk 
appetite for charitable donations and the budget for future years 
and long-term committed funds. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 145
Community investment
During the year, the Committee reviewed and endorsed the 
Group’s annual community investment budget and the 
proposed allocation of this budget across agreed sustainability 
themes.
Chairman’s Committee
The Chairman’s Committee acts on behalf of the Board between 
scheduled Board meetings to facilitate ad hoc and other 
business requiring Board approval. It meets when necessary, 
with the required number of attendees determined by the 
nature of the proposed business to be discussed, as set out in 
its terms of reference.
Group Management Board
The GMB is a forum chaired by the Group Chief Executive to 
provide him with recommendations and advice, and assist him 
in his day-to-day management of HSBC and its subsidiaries as 
delegated by the Board.
There are special meetings of the GMB that provide oversight 
of risk matters (the Risk Management Meeting, chaired by the 
Group Chief Risk Officer) and of Global Standards (the Global 
Standards Steering Meeting, chaired by the Group Head of 
Financial Crime Risk).
Internal control
The Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the 
effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems, 
and for determining the aggregate level and types of risks the 
Group is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. 
To meet this requirement and to discharge its obligations under 
the FCA Handbook and the PRA Handbook, procedures have 
been designed for safeguarding assets against unauthorised use 
or disposal; for maintaining proper accounting records; and for 
ensuring the reliability and usefulness of financial information 
used within the business or for publication.
These procedures can only provide reasonable assurance 
against material mis-statement, errors, losses or fraud. They are 
designed to provide effective internal control within the Group 
and accord with the Financial Reporting Council's guidance for 
directors issued in 2014, internal control and related financial 
and business reporting. The procedures have been in place 
throughout the year and up to 21 February 2017, the date 
of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts 2016.
In 2014, the GAC endorsed the adoption of the COSO 2013 
framework for the monitoring of risk management and internal 
control systems to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The key risk management and internal control procedures 
include the following:
• The Group’s Global Standards Manual (‘GSM’) outlines the 
core principles within which the Group must operate 
wherever we conduct business. The GSM overlays all other 
policies and procedures throughout the Group. The 
requirements of the GSM are mandatory, apply to and must 
be observed by all businesses within the Group, regardless 
of the nature or location of their activities.
• Delegation of authority within limits set by the Board: 
subject to certain matters reserved for the Board, the Group 
Chief Executive has been delegated authority limits and 
powers within which to manage the day-to-day affairs of the 
Group, including the right to sub-delegate those limits and 
powers. Each relevant group managing director or executive 
Director has delegated authority within which to manage 
the day-to-day affairs of the business or function for which 
he or she is accountable. Delegation of authority from the 
Board requires those individuals to maintain a clear and 
appropriate apportionment of significant responsibilities and 
to oversee the establishment and maintenance of systems 
of control that are appropriate to their business or function. 
Authorities to enter into credit and market risk exposures 
are delegated with limits to line management of Group 
companies. The concurrence of the appropriate global 
function is required, however, to credit proposals with 
specified higher risk characteristics. Credit and market risks 
are measured and reported at subsidiary company level and 
aggregated for risk concentration analysis on a Group-wide 
basis.
• Risk identification and monitoring: Systems and procedures 
are in place to identify, assess, control and monitor the 
material risk types facing HSBC. Our risk measurement and 
reporting systems are designed to help ensure that risks are 
comprehensively captured with all the attributes necessary 
to support well-founded decisions, that those attributes are 
accurately assessed and that information is delivered in a 
timely manner for those risks to be successfully managed 
and mitigated.
• Changes in market conditions/practices: processes are in 
place to identify new risks arising from changes in market 
conditions/practices or customer behaviours, which could 
expose HSBC to heightened risk of loss or reputational 
damage. The Group employs a top and emerging risks 
framework at all levels of the organisation, which enables 
it to identify current and forward-looking risks and to take 
action which either prevents them materialising or limits 
their impact.
• Responsibility for risk management: All employees are 
responsible for identifying and managing risk within the 
scope of their role as part of the three lines of defence 
model, which is an activity-based model to delineate 
management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk 
management and the control environment. The second line 
of defence sets the policy and guidelines for managing 
specific risk areas, provides advice and guidance in relation 
to the risk, and challenges the first line of defence (the risk 
owners) on effective risk management. 
• Strategic plans: strategic plans are prepared for global 
businesses, global functions and geographical regions 
within the framework of the Group’s overall strategy. Annual 
Operating Plans, informed by detailed analysis of risk 
appetite describing the types and quantum of risk that the 
Group is prepared to take in executing its strategy, are 
prepared and adopted by all major HSBC operating 
companies and set out the key business initiatives and the 
likely financial effects of those initiatives.
• IT operations: centralised control is exercised over all IT 
developments and operations. Common systems are 
employed for similar business processes wherever 
practicable.
• Subsidiary certifications to GRC: half-yearly confirmations 
are provided to the GRC from the risk committees of 
principal subsidiary companies confirming that the 
committees have challenged management on the quality 
of the information provided, reviewed the actions proposed 
by management to address any emerging issues or trends 
indicating material divergence from the Group’s risk appetite 
and that the risk management and internal control systems 
in place are operating effectively.
The key risk management and internal control procedures over 
financial reporting include the following:
• Disclosure Committee: the Disclosure Committee, which is 
chaired by the Group Company Secretary, supports the 
discharge of the Group’s obligations under relevant 
legislation and regulation including the UK and Hong Kong 
Listing Rules, the Market Abuse Regulation and SEC rules. 
Strategic Report Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Governance  Report of the Directors | Corporate Governance
146 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
In so doing the Committee is empowered to (i) determine 
whether a new event or circumstances should be disclosed, 
including the form and timing of such disclosure and (ii) 
review all material disclosures made or to be made by the 
Group. The membership of the Disclosure Committee 
includes the Group Finance Director, Group Chief Risk 
Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Group Chief Accounting Officer, 
Global Head of Public Affairs, Global Head of Investor 
Relations, Group Head of Strategy and Planning and Group 
Financial Controller. The integrity of disclosures is 
underpinned by structures and processes within the Global 
Finance and Global Risk functions that support rigorous 
analytical review of financial reporting and the maintenance 
of proper accounting records.
• Financial reporting: the Group’s financial reporting process 
is controlled using documented accounting policies and 
reporting formats, supported by detailed instructions and 
guidance on reporting requirements, issued to all reporting 
entities within HSBC in advance of each reporting period 
end. The submission of financial information from each 
reporting entity is subject to certification by the responsible 
financial officer, and analytical review procedures at 
reporting entity and Group levels.
• Subsidiary certifications to the GAC: half-yearly 
confirmations are provided to the GAC from the audit 
committees of principal subsidiary companies regarding 
whether their financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with Group policies, present fairly the state of 
affairs of the relevant principal subsidiary and are prepared 
on a going concern basis.
The internal control responsibilities of the GRC and GAC were 
complemented by the activities of the CVC and the FSVC which, 
respectively, oversaw internal control over conduct-related 
matters and financial crime compliance. Collectively, these 
controls are designed to provide effective internal control within 
the Group.
The GRC and the GAC have received confirmation that executive 
management has taken or is taking the necessary actions to 
remedy any failings or weaknesses identified through the 
operation of the Group's framework of controls. In 2015, 
deficiencies in the design and operational effectiveness of a 
number of controls associated with IT privileged access were 
identified. Significant improvement in the control environment 
has been observed as a result of management’s progress on the 
execution of the IT privileged access remediation programme. 
Management has assessed the effectiveness of relevant IT, 
business, monitoring and period-end mitigating controls for 
2016.
The Directors, through the GRC and the GAC, have conducted 
an annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's system 
of risk management and internal control covering all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls, risk management systems, the adequacy of resources, 
qualifications and experience of staff of the accounting and 
financial reporting function and the Global Risk function, and 
their training programmes and budget. The annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk management and 
internal control over financial reporting was conducted with 
reference to the COSO framework. The annual review of other 
controls was undertaken using the Group’s risk management 
framework, further details of which can be found on pages 68 
to 71. Based on the assessment performed, the Directors 
concluded that for the year ended 31 December 2016, the 
Group’s internal controls were effective.
Internal audit
The Global Internal Audit function, which is centrally controlled, 
provides independent and objective assurance of the design 
and operating effectiveness of the Group’s framework of risk 
management, control and governance processes, focusing on 
the areas of greatest risk. As mentioned previously, the Group 
Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chairman of the GAC and 
frequent meetings are held between them during the year. 
Administratively the Group Head of Internal Audit reports to the 
Group Chief Executive. Executive management is responsible 
for ensuring that issues raised by the Global Internal Audit 
function are addressed within an appropriate and agreed 
timetable. Confirmation to this effect must be provided to 
Global Internal Audit.
Going concern and viability
The Directors considered it appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern basis.
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors must 
also provide a viability statement. They must state whether 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities, taking into account its current position and the 
principal risks it faces. They must also specify the period 
covered by, and the appropriateness of, this statement.
The Directors have specified a period of three years to 
31 December 2019. They are satisfied that a forward-looking 
assessment of the Group for this period is sufficient to enable 
a reasonable statement of viability. In addition, this period is 
covered by the Group’s stress testing programmes, and its 
internal projections for profitability, key capital ratios and 
leverage ratios. Notwithstanding this, our stress testing 
programmes also cover scenarios out to five years and our 
assessment of risks are beyond three years where appropriate.
Based upon their assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.
In making their going concern and viability assessments, the 
Directors have considered a wide range of detailed information 
relating to present and potential conditions, including 
projections for profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and 
capital resources.
The Directors have carried out a robust assessment of each 
risk facing the Group to determine the principal risks to the 
long-term viability of the Group, including those that would 
threaten its solvency and liquidity. They have determined that 
the principal risks are the Group’s top and emerging risks as set 
out on pages 64 to 67, which includes the status of the Deferred 
Prosecution Agreement as described on page 66.
The Directors have assessed that all of the top and emerging 
risks identified are considered to be material and, therefore, 
appropriate to be classified as the principal risks to be 
considered in the assessment of viability. They also appraised 
the impact that these principal risks could have on the Group’s 
risk profile, taking account of mitigating actions planned or 
taken for each, and compared this with the Group’s risk 
appetite, as approved by the Board. At 31 December 2016, 
there were five heightened top and emerging risks: economic 
outlook and capital flows, geopolitical risk, cyber threat and 
unauthorised access to systems, IT systems infrastructure and 
resilience, and enhanced model risk management expectations.
In carrying out their assessment of the principal risks, the 
Directors considered a wide range of information including:
• Details of the Group’s business and operating models, and 
strategy.
• Details of the Group’s approach to managing risk and 
allocating capital.
• A summary of the Group’s financial performance, and its 
capital position and annual operating plan.
• Enterprise-wide risk management reports, including the 
Group’s risk appetite profile (see page 68), top and emerging 
risks (see page 64) and risk map (see page 70). HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 147
• Reports and updates regarding regulatory and internal stress 
testing exercises (see page 70). In 2016, the published Bank 
of England ('BoE') stress test results for HSBC showed that 
our capital ratios after taking account of CRD IV restrictions 
and strategic management actions exceeded the BoE’s 
requirements. The results for HSBC included an assumed 
dividend payment in the first year of the severe stress 
projection period.
• Reports and updates from management on risk-related 
issues selected for in-depth consideration.
• Reports and updates on the Group’s compliance-related 
initiatives connected to the resolution of the investigations 
by US and UK regulatory and law enforcement authorities in 
December 2012, and also regulatory developments more 
generally.
• Legal reports.

Listing Rule 9.8.4
The information to be disclosed in the Annual Report and 
Accounts pursuant to UK Listing Rule 9.8.4 is contained within 
the Corporate Governance Report.
Employees
At 31 December 2016, HSBC had a total workforce of 241,000 
full and part-time employees compared with 264,000 at the 
end of 2015 and 266,000 at the end of 2014. Our main centres 
of employment were the UK with approximately 45,000 
employees, India 37,000, Hong Kong 29,000, mainland China 
24,000, Mexico 16,000, the US 13,000 and France 9,000.
We encourage employees to perform at their best, and create 
an environment to make that possible. We also encourage 
employees to speak up, and reflect our purpose and values 
in the decisions we make and how we make them, as these 
decisions shape the future of our customers and colleagues.
Employee relations
We consult with and, where appropriate, negotiate with 
employee representative bodies. It is our policy to maintain 
communications and consultation programmes 
with all employee representative bodies and there have been 
no material disruptions to our operations from labour disputes 
during the past five years.
Diversity and inclusion
HSBC is committed to building a culture where individuals 
are valued, respected and supported; where different ideas, 
backgrounds, styles and perspectives are actively sought out 
to create business value; and where advancement is based on 
objective criteria. Focus continues on the diversity profile of our 
workforce to help ensure it is reflective of the communities in 
which we operate and the customers we serve.
Building a more inclusive workplace is part of everyone’s role at 
HSBC. Our Global Diversity Policy makes clear the responsibility 
of all employees and workers to treat colleagues with dignity 
and respect and to create an inclusive environment free from 
discrimination, bullying, harassment or victimisation, 
irrespective of their age, colour, disability, ethnic or national 
origin, gender, gender identity/expression, marital status, 
pregnancy, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. Our 
employees are expected to demonstrate openness to different 
ideas and cultures, and their performance in this respect is 
reviewed in our year-end review process.
Diversity and inclusion carries the highest level of executive 
support at HSBC, and oversight of our diversity agenda and 
related activities resides with the Global Diversity and Inclusion 
sub-function. We also operate governance forums covering 
diversity and inclusion at global line, regional and country levels.
Employee development
The development of our employees is essential to the future 
strength of our business. We continue to develop and 
implement practices that build employee capability, and identify, 
develop and deploy talented employees to ensure an 
appropriate supply of high calibre individuals with the values, 
skills and experience for current and future senior management 
positions. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 151
In 2016, we focused on developing technical skills, experiences 
and behaviours necessary to deliver against our Global 
Standards commitments, along with several Group-wide 
cultural programmes for employees and managers as part of 
our ‘At Our Best’ initiative.
Employment of people with a disability
We believe in providing equal opportunities for all employees. 
The employment of people with a disability is included in this 
commitment and the recruitment, training, career development 
and promotion of people with a disability is based on the 
aptitudes and abilities of the individual. Should employees 
become disabled during their employment with us, efforts 
are made to continue their employment and, if necessary, 
appropriate training and reasonable equipment and facilities 
are provided.
Health and safety
HSBC is committed to providing a safe physical environment for 
our customers and employees, as well as those who work with 
us. We aim always to meet the minimum health and safety 
standards required by law wherever we operate and, where 
reasonably practical, to exceed them.
Everyone at HSBC has a responsibility for helping to create a 
safe working environment. Employees are expected to take 
ownership of their safety and are encouraged and empowered 
to report any concerns.
Chief operating officers have overall responsibility for ensuring 
that the correct policies, procedures and safeguards are put into 
practice. This includes making sure that everyone in HSBC has 
access to appropriate information, instruction, training and 
supervision.
In 2016, we completed three major global projects to help us 
understand the risks we face, educate and inform our staff, and 
improve the buildings in which we operate. We have:
• Concluded a survey of earthquake resilience in more than 
1,500 HSBC buildings located in countries at medium to 
high risk of earthquakes;
• Conducted more than 250 asbestos surveys in countries 
without bans or controls on the use of the potentially 
harmful material; and
• Completed more than 1,800 fire risk assessments of our 
buildings around the world.

Remuneration policy
The quality and commitment of our employees is fundamental 
to our success and accordingly the Board aims to attract, retain 
and motivate the very best people. As trust and relationships 
are vital in our business our goal is to recruit those who are 
committed to making a long-term career with the Group.
HSBC’s reward strategy supports this objective through 
balancing both short-term and sustainable performance. Our 
remuneration strategy is designed to reward competitively the 
achievement of long-term sustainable performance and attract 
and motivate the very best people who are committed to 
maintaining a long-term career with the Group while performing 
their role in the long-term interests of our stakeholders.
In order to ensure alignment between remuneration and our 
business strategy, individual remuneration is determined 
through assessment of performance delivered against both 
annual and long-term objectives summarised in performance 
scorecards, and adherence to the HSBC Values of being ’open, 
connected and dependable‘ and acting with ’courageous 
integrity’. Altogether, performance is judged, not only on what 
is achieved over the short and long term, but also on how it 
is achieved, as the latter contributes to the sustainability of 
the Group.
The financial and non-financial measures incorporated in the 
annual and long-term scorecards are carefully considered to 
ensure alignment with the long-term strategy of the Group.
Further information on the Group’s approach to remuneration is given on 
page 153.
Employee share plans
Share options and discretionary awards of shares granted under 
HSBC share plans align the interests of employees with the 
creation of shareholder value. The table below sets out the 
particulars of outstanding options, including those held by 
employees working under employment contracts that are 
regarded as ‘continuous contracts’ for the purposes of the Hong 
Kong Employment Ordinance. The options were granted at nil 
consideration. No options have been granted to substantial 
shareholders and suppliers of goods or services, nor in excess 
of the individual limit for each share plan. No options were 
cancelled by HSBC during the year.
A summary for each plan of the total number of the options 
which were granted, exercised or lapsed during 2016 is shown 
in the table below. Further details required to be disclosed 
pursuant to Chapter 17 of the Rules Governing the Listing of 
Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited are 
available on our website at http://www.hsbc.com/about-hsbc/
corporate-governance/employee-share-plans and on the website 
of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited at 
www.hkex.com.hk, or can be obtained upon request from the 
Group Company Secretary, 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ.
Particulars of options held by Directors of HSBC Holdings are set out on 
page 165.
Note 5 on the Financial Statements gives details of share-based payments, 
including discretionary awards of shares granted under HSBC share plans.
All-employee share plans
HSBC operates all-employee share option plans under which 
options are granted over HSBC ordinary shares. Subject to 
leaver provisions, options are normally exercisable after three 
to five years. During 2016, options were granted at the mid- 
market price for HSBC Holdings ordinary shares quoted on 
the London Stock Exchange which, as derived from the Daily 
Official List on 20 September 2016, the day prior to grant, 
was £5.83.
The UK Sharesave will terminate on 23 May 2025 unless the 
Directors resolve to terminate the plans at an earlier date. There 
will be no further grants under the HSBC Holdings Savings-
Related Share Option Plan: International.
The HSBC International Employee Share Purchase Plan was 
introduced in 2013 and now includes employees based in 
26 jurisdictions.

Annual Statement from the Group
Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder, 
The Group Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) is 
guided by a series of principles. These are set out in the 
Strategic Report on page 28, but it is worth mentioning a few 
here to help explain our work.
To attract and retain talent, remuneration at HSBC must be 
competitive. However, we place a strong emphasis on linking 
pay to performance. We particularly emphasise the need for 
performance that benefits the Group over the long-term, and 
reflects HSBC Values and the highest standards of conduct. 
In 2016, we introduced a new remuneration policy for our 
executive Directors. It reflected feedback from shareholders, 
especially in its introduction of a long-term incentive (‘LTI’) 
award with a three-year forward-looking performance period, a 
seven-year deferral period, and a reduction in the cash in lieu of 
pension allowance for the executive Directors. I believe the new 
policy achieves strong alignment between the interests of our 
executive Directors and shareholders, and the performance 
measures for the new LTI award will reward long-term 
sustainable performance. 
We were pleased that the new policy received strong support at 
our Annual General Meeting ('AGM') in April 2016, with over 
96% of shareholders voting in favour.
This year’s Remuneration Report shows how the Committee has 
applied the new policy, aligning executive pay with the Group’s 
performance, both for the year and against its long-term 
strategic objectives.
Performance achieved during 2016
Reported profit before tax for the year fell 62% to $7.1bn. 
However, on an adjusted basis, excluding significant items and 
currency translation differences, profit before tax was $19.3bn, 
broadly in line with prior-year. The Group's cost performance 
improved as prior-year initiatives gained traction and 
substantially offset higher loan impairment charges and 
marginally lower revenues.
The Group is now more than a year into implementing the 
strategic actions set out in its Investor Update in June 2015. 
These aim to improve returns, deliver cost savings, reduce 
RWAs, rebuild profitability in Mexico and the US, optimise and 
capture value from our international network, and complete the 
implementation of Global Standards programme to help combat 
financial crime.
Measures were incorporated into the 2016 annual incentive 
scorecards of the executive Directors to align their pay with 
progress against achievement of these objectives.
The Group made strong progress in a number of areas. It 
reduced RWAs by $143bn in 2016, taking it more than 97% of 
the way towards its target for the end of 2017. It achieved cost 
savings of $2.25bn, despite continued investment in 
compliance, regulatory programmes and growth. Furthermore, 
it is on its way to restoring profitability in Mexico. In the second 
half of 2016, it executed a share buy-back worth approximately 
$2.5bn as a way of distributing capital to shareholders. In 2016, 
in sterling terms, our share price increased by 23% and the total 
shareholder return was 32%.
Group variable pay pool and risk adjustments
The Group variable pay pool is used to fund performance-related 
pay across the Group. In determining the size of the pool for 
2016, the Committee took into consideration the Group’s 
financial performance, fines, penalties and customer redress 
costs, as well as progress implementing and embedding Global 
Standards.
The total value of the pool for 2016 was $3,035m, which was 
12.3% lower than the $3,462m figure for 2015.
In particular, the 2016 pool included the following reductions of:
• $194m for the fines, penalties and cost of customer redress 
faced by the Group; and
• $309m for:
– financial performance in certain key areas, in particular, 
profit before tax, return on risk-weighted assets and 
adjusted jaws;
– performance against certain metrics in our Group risk 
appetite profile; and
– continued work required to address financial crime 
compliance issues and the embedding of Global 
Standards within our businesses.
In addition to the pool adjustments, we reduced variable pay 
awards to certain individuals by $12.1m in aggregate to reflect 
their involvement in certain notable events and individual 
transgressions.
Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2016
In line with the policy approved by shareholders, we have 
reduced the cash in lieu of pension from 50% of base salary to 
30% for executive Directors. This has resulted in fixed pay, 
including allowances, reducing by 7% in 2016. No increases in 
fixed pay are proposed for 2017.
The 2016 annual incentive scorecard outcome for financial 
measures was 35.3% for Stuart Gulliver, 30.0% for Iain Mackay 
and 15.0% for Marc Moses, reflecting their individual 
scorecards and the performance achieved in cost savings, 
reductions in RWAs and achievements against our strategic 
objectives. 
Since establishing the new Financial Crime Risk function in
July 2016, there has been a significant focus on transition from 
a programme of change to business-as-usual financial crime 
management across all countries, regions and global 
businesses. But there is more to be done. The Committee 
exercised its discretion to reduce the Global Standards 
assessments for executive Directors down to 65%. This was 
based on feedback received from the Monitor, matters arising 
from risk and compliance incidents, and a number of 
unsatisfactory internal audits covering anti-money laundering 
(‘AML’) and sanctions-related issues.
Details of the annual incentive scorecard outcome are provided 
on page 161.
In line with the new policy, no Group Performance Share Plan 
(‘GPSP’) awards were made in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2016. This has resulted in a significant decrease in 
the total single figure of remuneration for executive Directors 
when compared with the year ending 31 December 2015.
The new LTI award for our executives, awarded while taking into 
account performance in the financial year ended 31 December 
2016, is subject to a forward-looking three-year performance 
period (1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019) and a seven-year 
Strategic Report Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Governance  Directors’ Remuneration Report
154 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
deferral period. This ensures a significant proportion of 
executive Directors’ pay continues to be deferred. This, together 
with the fact that the majority of compensation is awarded in 
shares, helps ensure it is aligned with the achievement of our 
long-term strategic objectives, and the long-term interests of 
shareholders and other stakeholders. Details of the performance 
measures for the LTI award to be granted in 2017 in respect of 
2016, and the relevant targets for each measure, are provided 
on page 164.
Implementation of policy for 2017
This year will be the final one for implementing the strategic 
actions set out in the Investor Update. The 2017 annual 
incentive scorecards for the executive Directors are designed 
to drive delivery against these objectives.
Details of the performance measures for the 2017 annual 
incentive scorecards are on page 169. However, for reasons of 
commercial sensitivity, the specific targets for each measure 
will not be disclosed until the end of the 2017 performance 
period, when performance against the targets will also be 
disclosed.
Fees for non-executive Directors were reviewed by the 
Committee in 2016. Recognising the growing regulatory 
responsibilities and time commitment required from our 
Directors, their fees have been increased with 
effect from 1 January 2017. A travel allowance has also been 
introduced for non-UK based non-executive Directors to reflect 
the additional time commitment required for travel. The details 
of the increases are provided on page 156.
The Committee will continue to monitor the remuneration 
arrangements for executive Directors, and meet with our major 
shareholders on implementation of the policy in 2017. The 
Committee will also continue to monitor any reform proposed 
for corporate governance and executive pay, and will consider 
any changes that may be required to our approach on 
remuneration in this regard.
Our annual report on remuneration
The following sections of this Remuneration Report provide 
an overview of the policy for executive Directors, which was 
approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM, and details of 
remuneration decisions made for executive Directors in 2016. 
The report also covers the application of the 2016 policy to 
other Group employees. 
As Chairman of the Committee, I hope you will support the 
report.
Finally, I will be retiring as a non-executive Director of the Group 
and as chairman of this Committee at the conclusion of the 
2017 AGM. I am delighted that Pauline van der Meer Mohr, who 
is already a member of the Committee, has agreed to succeed 
me as chairman at that time.

Remuneration policy for all employees
The Committee oversees the Group’s remuneration policy and 
its application to the wider employee population. The 
Committee periodically reviews the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the policy and ensures that it: 
• meets the commercial requirement to remain competitive;
• is affordable;
• allows flexibility in response to prevailing circumstances;
• is compliant with regulatory requirements;
• aligns with the long-term interests of our stakeholders; and
• is consistent with effective risk management.
The mix of fixed and variable pay granted to an employee 
corresponds to the individual’s role, local market factors and 
regulatory requirements. The variable pay for all material risk 
takers (‘MRTs’) is restricted to a maximum of 200% of their fixed 
pay. Individuals are identified as MRTs based on the qualitative 
and quantitative criteria set out in the Regulatory Technical 
Standard EU 604/2014 and additional criteria determined by the 
Committee. The table provides an overview of the different 
remuneration elements for our employees. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 157
Component of remuneration Application
Fixed pay • Attract and retain employees by paying market-competitive pay for the role, skills and experience required by the 
business.
• This may include salary, fixed pay allowance, cash in lieu of pension and other cash allowances in accordance with 
local market practices.
• These payments are fixed and do not vary with performance.
Pension and benefits • Provided in accordance with local market practice. They include, but are not limited to, the provision of pensions, 
medical coverage, life insurance, health assessment, tax return preparation, legal fees and relocation allowances.
Annual incentive • Awards to drive and reward performance based on annual financial and non-financial measures consistent with the 
medium-to-long-term strategy, shareholder interests and adherence to HSBC Values. 
• For MRTs, awards are normally subject to a 40% or 60% deferral, delivered in cash and/or shares, subject to a 
minimum six-month retention period. From 2016 onwards, the deferral period could be three, five or seven years, 
depending on the regulatory status of the employee. Deferred awards are subject to malus. All awards are subject to 
claw-back and compliance with local laws.
• For all other employees, awards can be in the form of cash and/or shares. Awards above a specified threshold are 
subject to deferral based on a deferral table. All deferred awards are subject to malus.
• HSBC operates an anti-hedging policy for all employees who are required to certify each year that they have not 
entered into any personal hedging strategies.
Link between performance and reward
Under our remuneration framework, pay decisions are based 
on a number of factors: business results, individual performance 
against scorecard objectives and adherence to HSBC Values, 
business principles, policies, procedures and Global Standards.
At the end of each performance year, assessment of 
performance against scorecard objectives, including non-
financial and risk objectives, forms the basis of remuneration 
decisions. This helps ensure risk management is embedded and 
forms an integral part of all our activities.
The performance and remuneration of individuals in control 
functions is assessed according to a balanced scorecard of 
objectives specific to the functional role they undertake, to 
ensure their remuneration is determined independent of the 
performance of the business areas they control.
HSBC Values play a key role in ensuring the Group remains 
sound and sustainable. All employees are given a separate 
values-aligned behavioural rating, which informs their eligibility 
for variable pay and influences their variable pay 
determinations.
Regular reviews are undertaken to assess instances of non-
compliance with risk procedures and expected behaviours. 
Instances of non-compliance are escalated for consideration 
in variable pay decisions, using our adjustment, malus and 
claw-back policies (see the next section).
The key features of our remuneration framework that enable us 
to achieve alignment between risk, reward and performance are 
set out below.
Key feature Application
Scorecards • Assessment of performance with reference to clear and relevant objectives set within a performance scorecard framework.
• Global Standards including risk and compliance measures and conduct, set at a minimum of 25% of the scorecard for Group 
Management Board members.
Group variable
pay pool
calculation
• Fines and penalties are automatically included in the Committee’s definition of profit.
• Performance against metrics in the Group Risk Appetite Statement and Conduct Framework is taken into consideration.
Deferral of
variable pay
• Deferral of a significant proportion of variable pay into HSBC shares and/or other instruments to tie recipients to the future 
performance of the Group and business units.
Malus/adjustment
policy
• Allows cancellation/reduction of unvested deferred variable pay awards. Longer deferral period under PRA Remuneration 
Rules increases the time period over which malus can be applied.
• This is in addition to our in-year variable pay adjustments and other disciplinary actions that can be taken under our global 
consequence management policy.
Claw-back policy • Subject to compliance with local labour laws, allows us to recoup/reclaim paid awards in certain circumstances as defined

The following policies help embed values in our remuneration 
structure while ensuring greater global consistency in our 
approach to achieving alignment between risk and reward.
Programmes Application
Values rating for
all employees
• To ensure performance is judged not only on what is achieved in the short and long term but also on how it is achieved, 
which contributes to the sustainability of the Group.
Performance
management
• Strong correlation is expected between performance and values.
• No discretionary variable pay for an unacceptable behaviour rating.
• 2016 focus on moving away from traditional cycle-based performance management towards a culture of everyday 
performance and development.
Global consequence
management policy
• Introduced to increase consistency in approach and actions taken.
• Clear messaging to employees on impact of breaches as part of reward communications (through pay statements, 
manager guidelines, etc.).
Positive adjustments • To focus on positive behaviours in the context of Global Standards through in-year positive variable pay adjustments.
Global recognition
programme
• Circa 80% of the global employee population can now access a single HSBC recognition platform to perform values-based 
peer-to-peer recognition.
• Includes communication of positive stories on our intranet (HSBC Now).
Variable pay adjustment, malus and claw-back
Where there are instances of conduct breaches, the actions 
below can be taken. The Committee has discretion to apply 
malus and claw-back under the policies it has adopted, taking 
into consideration an individual’s proximity to, and responsibility 
for, the issue in question. Where possible, an adjustment will 
be made to current-year variable pay, before the application 
of malus, then claw-back. This is in line with regulatory 
requirements.
Type of action Type of variable pay award affected Circumstances where it may apply (including, but not limited to)
Adjustment • Current-year variable pay. • Detrimental conduct, including conduct which brings the business into disrepute.
• Involvement in events resulting in significant operational losses, or events which 
have caused or have the potential to cause significant harm to HSBC.
• Non-compliance with HSBC Values and other mandatory requirements or policies.
Adjustment
under the
downward
override policy
• Current-year variable pay for 
executive Directors and certain other 
senior executives.
• Downward override policy was introduced in 2014, based on the 
recommendations received from the independent Monitor as appointed by the US 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (‘DPA’).
• A downward adjustment can be applied where there is:
–   insufficient yearly progress in developing an effective AML and sanctions 
compliance programme; or
–   non-compliance with the DPA and other relevant orders.
• In deciding the application and degree of any such downward override to reduce 
variable pay awards, the Committee considers feedback from the Financial System 
Vulnerabilities Committee, the Monitor in relation to cooperation with their review 
and Legal.
Malus • Unvested deferred awards granted in 
prior years.
• Detrimental conduct, including conduct which brings the business into disrepute.
• Past performance being materially worse than originally reported.
• Restatement, correction or amendment of any financial statements.
• Improper or inadequate risk management.
Claw-back • Vested or paid awards granted to 
MRTs on or after 1 January 2015 for 
seven years.
• From 2016 onwards, this period may 
be extended to 10 years for 
employees under the PRA’s Senior 
Manager Regime in the event of 
ongoing internal/regulatory 
investigation at the end of the seven-
year period.
• Participation in, or responsibility for, conduct which results in significant losses.
• Failing to meet appropriate standards and propriety.
• Reasonable evidence of misconduct or material error that would justify, or would 
have justified, summary termination of a contract of employment. 
• HSBC or a business unit suffers a material failure of risk management in the 
context of Group risk-management standards, policies and procedures. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 159

Advisers
The Committee received input and advice from different 
advisers on specific topics during 2016. Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) 
was appointed by the Committee in 2015 as an objective, 
independent adviser to support the Committee on specific 
remuneration matters for executive Directors. The Committee 
made the appointment after considering invited proposals from 
a number of consultancy firms. In 2016, the Committee agreed 
to extend Deloitte’s appointment for a further period of one 
year. Deloitte provided benchmarking data on remuneration 
policy matters and independent advice to the Committee. The 
Committee may request ad-hoc assistance from Deloitte.
Deloitte also provided services to the Group, comprising tax 
compliance and other advisory services. To ensure the advice 
from Deloitte was objective, the Committee required the advice 
to be independent and distinct from any internal review and 
analysis on remuneration policy matters. The Committee was 
satisfied the advice provided by Deloitte was objective and 
independent in 2016. Deloitte is a founding member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates 
under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK.
For 2016, total fees of £168,150 were incurred in relation to its 
remuneration advice provided by Deloitte. This was based on 
pre-agreed fees and a time and materials basis.
During the year, the Group Chief Executive provided regular 
briefings to the Committee. In addition, the Committee received 
updates from the following employees as part of their roles with 
HSBC:
• Pierre Goad, Group Head of Human Resources 
(until August 2016);
• Donna Wong, Acting Group Head of Human Resources 
(from September 2016);
• Alexander Lowen, Group Head of Performance and Reward;
• Marc Moses, Group Chief Risk Officer;
• Iain Mackay, Group Finance Director;
• Colin Bell, Group Head of Financial Crime Risk;
• Robert Werner, Former Global Head of Financial Crime 
Compliance and Group Money Laundering Reporting Officer;
• Ralph Nash, Global Head of Financial Crime Compliance;
• John Flint, Chief Executive Retail Banking and Wealth 
Management;
• Stuart Levey, Chief Legal Officer; and
• Andy Maguire, Group Chief Operating Officer.
The Committee also received feedback and input from the 
Group Risk Committee, the Financial System Vulnerabilities 
Committee and the Conduct & Values Committee on risk and 
compliance-related matters relevant to remuneration. This 
included input from the Financial System Vulnerabilities 
Committee on the implementation and annual assessment of 
progress on the AML and sanctions compliance programme 
for the purposes of the Committee’s determination on any 
adjustments to be made under the downward override policy.

Year-on-year single figure comparison
(Unaudited)
The GPSP was replaced by the LTI in 2016. As such, no GPSP 
award was made for 2016 and the value for 2016 is nil.
The first LTI award will be made in March 2017, with a 
performance period ending in 2019. Vesting of the first 
LTI award will be included in the single figure table for the 
financial year ending on 31 December 2019. For year-on-year 
comparison purposes, if target performance is achieved over the 
three-year performance period, LTI payout for the 2016 award 
would be 50% of grant value. In this case, the 2016 single figure 
total remuneration of the executive Directors for year-on-year 
comparison would be (in £000) £7,670 for Stuart Gulliver, 
£4,069 for Iain Mackay and £4,052 for Marc Moses.

of furniture and taking into account the business use of the property. The taxable value of the accommodation is considered to be 70% of the total of these amounts. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 161
Notional returns
In the single figure of remuneration table above, ‘Notional 
returns’ refers to the notional return on deferred cash.
The deferred cash portion of the annual incentive also includes 
a right to receive notional returns for the period between grant 
date and vesting date, which is determined by reference to the 
dividend yield on HSBC shares, calculated annually.
A payment of notional return is made annually in the same 
proportion as the vesting of the deferred awards on each 
vesting date. The amount is disclosed on a paid basis in the 
year in which the payment is made.
Determining executive Directors’ annual 
performance
(Audited)
Awards made to executive Directors reflected the Committee’s 
assessment of the extent to which they had achieved personal 
and corporate objectives set within their performance scorecard 
as agreed at the beginning of the year, which had been set to 
reflect the risk appetite and strategic priorities. In accordance 
with the downward override policy, the Committee also 
consulted the Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee and 
took into consideration their feedback in relation to progress on 
enhancing AML and sanctions compliance along with progress 
in meeting the Group’s obligations under the US DPA and other 
relevant orders. The Committee also took into consideration the 
report of the independent Monitor in determining the scorecard 
outcomes.
In order for any annual incentive award to be made, each 
executive Director must meet a required behavioural rating 
which is assessed with reference to the HSBC Values. For 2016, 
all executive Directors met the required behavioural rating.
For 2016, the Committee exercised its discretion and reduced 
the Global Standards assessments from 75% to 65% for Stuart 
Gulliver, from 86% to 65% for Iain Mackay and from 74% to 
65% for Marc Moses. This was based on feedback received 
from the Monitor, matters arising from risk and compliance 
incidents, and a number of unsatisfactory internal audits 
covering AML and sanctions-related issues.
The performance achieved by executive Directors in the year is 
shown in the table below.

1 Unvested awards determined based on performance achieved during the period to 31 December 2015. The overall award level could have been 0% of the maximum 
opportunity if minimum performance was achieved for the period to 31 December 2015. After grant, awards are subject to service condition and malus provisions.
2 Share price used is the closing mid-market price on the last working day preceding the date of grant.
GPSP awards were made based on performance up to the 
financial year-end preceding the grant date with no further 
performance conditions after grant. Vesting occurs five years 
after grant date and is normally subject to the Director 
remaining an employee until the vesting date. The net of tax 
shares which the Director becomes entitled to on the vesting 
date are subject to a retention requirement. 
The above table does not include details of shares issued as part 
of the fixed pay allowances, as those shares vest immediately 
and are not subject to any service or performance conditions.

1 The gross number of shares is disclosed. A portion of these shares will be sold at vesting to cover any income tax and social security which falls due at the time of vesting.
2 The current shareholding guideline does not count unvested share-based incentives.
3 An average of three-month closing share price as on 31 December 2016 (£6.3224) has been used to calculate current shareholding as a percentage of salary.
4 Under the annual incentive, in line with regulatory requirements, any deferred shares (net of tax) which the Director becomes entitled to are subject to a retention requirement, 
such that they must be held for a predefined period of time. To provide the executive Directors with appropriate flexibility, the Committee determined that, the requirement to 
hold these shares could be met either by (i) retaining the shares that vested from the underlying award (net of tax) or (ii) by separately retaining a number of shares equivalent to 
those that vested under the award. The Committee consider that such an arrangement results in the employee holding the same number of shares as per the original intention 
of the retention period as set out in the remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2014.
5 All share options are unvested and unexercised. 
6 Includes GPSP awards, which were made following an assessment of performance over the relevant period ending on 31 December immediately before the grant date but are 
subject to a five-year vesting period.
7 Awards granted in March 2013 are subject to service conditions and satisfactory completion of the DPA, as determined by the Committee. The DPA condition ends on the fifth 
anniversary of the award date unless the DPA is extended or otherwise continues beyond that date, in which case the awards will vest on the date on which the DPA expires 
and otherwise ceases to operate. This award will lapse if the Committee determines that the performance conditions are not satisfied.
8 Since the end of the year, the number of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares held by Douglas Flint has increased by 22, following an acquisition, through regular monthly 
contributions in the HSBC Holdings UK Share Incentive Plan.
9 All Group Managing Directors are expected to meet their minimum shareholding guideline by 2019 or within five years of the date of their appointment, whichever is later.

Summary of shareholder return and Group Chief 
Executive remuneration
The following graph shows the total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
performance against the FTSE 100 Total Return Index for the 
eight-year period that ended on 31 December 2016. The 
FTSE 100 Total Return Index has been chosen as this is a 
recognised broad equity market index of which HSBC Holdings 
is a member. The single figure remuneration over the past 
eight years together with the outcomes of the respective 
annual incentive and long-term incentive awards are also 
presented below.

1 The 2012 annual incentive figure for Stuart Gulliver used for this table includes 60% of the annual incentive disclosed in the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report which was 
deferred for five years and subject to service conditions and satisfactory completion of the DPA, as determined by the Committee. The DPA condition ends on the fifth 
anniversary of the award date unless the DPA is extended or otherwise continues beyond that date, in which case the awards will vest on the date on which the DPA expires 
and otherwise ceases to operate. This award will lapse if the Committee determines that the performance conditions are not satisfied.
2 Long-term incentive awards are included in the single figure for the year in which the performance period is deemed to be substantially completed. For GPSP awards this is the 
end of the financial year preceding the date of grant (GPSP awards shown in 2011 to 2015 therefore relate to awards granted in 2012 to 2016). For performance share awards 
that were awarded before introduction of GPSP, the value of awards that vested subject to satisfaction of performance conditions attached to those awards are included at the 
end of the third financial year following the date of grant (for example, performance share awards shown in 2010 relates to awards granted in 2008).  
3 The GPSP was replaced by the LTI in 2016 and the value for GPSP is nil for 2016 as no GPSP award was made for 2016. The first LTI award will be made in March 2017, with a 
performance period ending in 2019. Vesting of the first LTI award will be included in the single figure table for the financial year ending on 31 December 2019. For year-on-year 
comparison purposes, if target performance is achieved over the three-year performance period, LTI payout for the 2016 award would be 50% of grant value. In this case, the 
single figure total remuneration of the executive Directors for year-on-year comparison would be (in £000) £7,670 for Stuart Gulliver. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 167
Comparison of Group Chief Executive and all-employee

The following charts compare the changes in Group Chief

1 Employee group consists of local full-time UK employees as representative of 
employees from different businesses and functions across the Group. Group 
Chief Executive's total fixed pay has not increased since 1 January 2014. 
2 There has been no change in the benefits provided to the Group Chief Executive. 
The change in the value of the benefit is due to the change in the taxable value of 
the benefit as reported in the single figure table.
3 Employee group consists of UK employees eligible for taxable benefits which was 
deemed the most appropriate comparison for the Group Chief Executive given 
varying local requirements. There has been no change in the benefit coverage for 
employees from 2015 to 2016. The reduction in the average cost of benefits per 
employee is reflective of the decrease in the cost of providing such benefit on 
average.
4 Employee group consists of all employees globally, based on annual incentive 
pool as disclosed on page 29 and staff numbers (full-time equivalents at the 
financial year-end). The percentage change in annual incentive award of the 
Group Chief Executive is primarily driven by the difference in the 2015 and 2016 
scorecard outcome, reflecting performance achieved in those years, and change 
in policy. Details of the 2016 total single figure of remuneration for the Group Chief 
Executive are on page 160.

HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 173
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the parent company (‘Company’) and Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors have also elected to 
comply with IFRSs, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and Group and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs issued by IASB have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts 2016 as they appear on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts 2016, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the ‘Report of the Directors: Corporate Governance’ section on pages 
133 to 137 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2016, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group; and
• the management report represented by the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors’ report includes a statement, in the case of each Director 
in office as at the date the Report of the Directors is approved, that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

Our opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion HSBC Holdings plc’s (‘HSBC’) Group financial statements and parent company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and parent company's affairs at 31 December 2016 and of the Group’s and 
parent company’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(‘IFRS’); and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Performing the audit
On behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’), it is my responsibility to form these opinions. This was the second year that you 
have appointed PwC as HSBC’s auditors, and I have therefore provided information on how PwC approached the audit, how it 
changed from the previous year and details of the significant discussions on key audit matters that I, and my senior colleagues, had 
with the Group Audit Committee (‘GAC’).
How the audit approach was structured
The audit approach was structured to reflect how HSBC is organised. It incorporated 4 important aspects.
(1) Risk assessment and audit planning at a Group level, having regard to HSBC’s global businesses and its key legal entities:
In 2015 I appointed partners to lead the audits for each global business. These partners continued in their roles and met regularly 
with the relevant HSBC management to understand strategy and matters which arose throughout the year that could have impacted 
financial reporting. The partners are specialists in the nature of the relevant businesses and were best placed to design the 
appropriate audit approach for that part of HSBC. They oversaw each PwC member firm involved in the audit of that global business 
and assisted me in my review of their work.
(2) Audit work performed at global shared service centres:
A significant amount of HSBC’s operational processes which are critical to financial reporting are undertaken in global shared service 
centres across 10 individual sites in 6 countries. Additionally, many financial reporting processes required to produce the financial 
statements are performed in HSBC’s Global Finance Centre based in Gurugram and Hyderabad, India. Working closely with me, a 
partner coordinated the audit work performed by PwC member firms in each of the global shared service locations. This work 
established an end-to-end picture of the key processes that supported material balances, classes of transactions and disclosures 
within the HSBC financial statements. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the controls over these processes and considered the 
implications for the remainder of our audit work.
(3) Audit work executed on individual legal entities:
We received opinions from PwC member firms which have been appointed as the external auditors of The Hongkong and Shanghai 
Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank plc, HSBC North America Holdings Inc, HSBC Mexico S.A., HSBC Bank Argentina S.A., 
HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, HSBC Bank Canada and HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) S.A.
I was in active dialogue throughout the year with the partners responsible for these audits; this included consideration of how well 
they planned and performed their work. My senior colleagues and I visited these subsidiaries, and attended Audit Committees 
meetings for most of them. We also visited businesses in a further 5 countries. I also attended meetings with management in each of 
these key subsidiaries at the year-end.
The audits of these key subsidiaries relied upon work performed by PwC member firms in Bahrain, China, France, Germany, India, 
Qatar and Turkey. I considered how my subsidiary audit teams instructed and reviewed the work undertaken in these locations in 
order to ensure the quality and adequacy of their work. Collectively, the PwC member firms completed procedures covering 85% of 
assets, 85% of total operating income and 92% of profit before tax.
(4) Audit procedures undertaken at a Group level and on the parent company:
I ensured that appropriate further work was undertaken for the HSBC parent company. This work included auditing, for example,    
the consolidation of the Group’s results, the preparation of the financial statements, certain disclosures within the Directors' 
Remuneration Report, litigation provisions and exposures, and management’s entity level and oversight controls relevant to financial 
reporting. A consideration was also made of all changes to, and pending changes to, financial reporting standards and requirements. 
As an example, we considered the parent company’s decision to adopt the provisions of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ relating to the 
fair value of its own debt, and work continues to be performed as part of wider preparations for the full implementation of the 
standard. 
In aggregate, these four areas provided me with the evidence required to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of 
HSBC.
1 HSBC Holdings plc’s financial statements comprise the consolidated and parent company balance sheets as at 31 December 2016, the consolidated and parent company 
income statements and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended, the consolidated and parent company statement of cash flows for the 
year then ended, the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts 
2016, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 175
Changes to the approach in 2016
In March, I chaired a two-day meeting in London of the partners and staff from PwC member firms who undertake audits of the most 
significant HSBC subsidiaries. This meeting provided an opportunity for those partners and staff to hear directly from HSBC 
management and the Chair of the GAC. We considered during this meeting how our view of significant audit risks had changed. In 
doing so, we used our experience in 2015 and considered how the strategic actions and their related targets may influence areas of 
significant judgement. 
The amount of work required to perform the audit was lower because of the audit knowledge that we had acquired during the 
previous 18 months, and many of the transition processes were not repeated. 
More detailed changes in the approach arose because of 4 areas:
(1) Changes in the structure and strategy of the HSBC Group
The presentation of the financial statements has been amended to reflect the new operating segments adopted by HSBC. Audit work 
has been completed to ensure that this change is both appropriate, and that previously reported information has been represented 
correctly. 
During the year, HSBC Bank Brazil was sold. As a consequence the audit work undertaken on this business was limited to detailed 
procedures on the loss on disposal and an assessment of whether it is appropriately classified in the Group’s income statement. 
In assessing the subsidiaries which were significant in 2016, I concluded that HSBC Insurance (Bermuda) Limited was no longer 
material, and therefore the scope of the audit was changed.
(2) Changes to HSBC processes and controls
As part of the efforts to streamline controls and reduce costs, more activities continued to be migrated to the global shared service 
centres. This resulted in work moving between PwC member firms. In July, a workshop was held in Paris for significant subsidiaries 
and service centre teams so that they could understand the impact of these changes. The other objective was to further standardise 
controls tested and understand the end to end process for significant classes of transaction.
(3) Assessment of controls
I reported to the GAC detailed observations on controls over financial reporting in relation to our work in 2015. The audit was 
designed to consider the work that HSBC management undertook to address these observations. For example, in my 2015 report to 
you I referenced the improvements management was making to controls around privileged access to systems. During 2016, my team 
performed extensive work on management’s actions in this area.
(4) Changes in the macro environment
I considered other macro factors to determine if changes in the approach were required, for example the impact of the United 
Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, the devaluation of the Mexican Peso and changes in the credit environment. I 
reported to the GAC in December that I did not believe that these changed my original risk assessment. 
The purpose and scope of the audit
An audit has an important role in providing confidence in the financial statements that are provided by companies to their members. 
The audit opinion does not provide assurance over any particular number or disclosure, but over the financial statements taken as a 
whole. It is the Directors’ responsibility to prepare the financial statements and to be satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
These responsibilities have been recognised on behalf of the Board of Directors on page 173.
The scope of an audit is sometimes not fully understood. I believe that it is important that you understand the scope in order to 
understand the assurance that my opinion provides. My responsibility is to undertake my work and express my opinion in 
accordance with applicable law and the International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) as issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council of the United Kingdom. These standards also require me to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. A description of the scope of an audit is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditscopeukprivate; I recommend that you read this description carefully. It is also important that you understand the inherent 
limitations of the audit which are disclosed in this description, for example the possibility that an approach based upon sampling and 
other audit techniques may not identify all issues.
In order for me to perform my work, I had regard to the concept of materiality. I determined materiality as follows:
Overall Group materiality $950m.
How I determined it 5% of adjusted profit before tax excluding the debit valuation adjustment and non-qualifying hedges.
Why I believe this is
appropriate
Given the geographically dispersed nature of HSBC and the diversity of its banking activities, I believe a standard 
benchmark of 5% of adjusted profit before tax is an appropriate quantitative indicator of materiality, although of course 
an item could also be material for qualitative reasons.
I selected adjusted profit before tax, because as discussed on page 48, management believes it best reflects the 
performance of HSBC. I excluded the debit valuation adjustment and non-qualifying hedges as they are recurring items 
that in my view form part of ongoing business performance.
When planning the audit, I considered if multiple errors might exist which, when aggregated, could exceed $950m. In order to 
reduce the risk of multiple errors that could aggregate to this amount, I used a lower level of materiality, known as performance 
materiality, of $710m to identify the individual balances, classes of transactions and disclosures that were subject to audit. I asked 
each of the partners reporting to me on the subsidiaries of HSBC to work to assigned materiality levels reflecting the size of the 
operations they audited. These ranged from $67m (HSBC Mexico S.A.) to $760m (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation 
Limited).
Strategic Report Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Governance  Report of the independent auditors to the members of HSBC Holdings plc
176 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Where the audit identified some items that were not reflected appropriately in the audited financial information, I considered these 
items carefully to assess if they were individually or in aggregate material. I reported any such items which exceeded $50m to the 
GAC. The Directors have concluded that all items which remained unadjusted were not material to the financial statements, either 
individually or in aggregate. I agree with their conclusion.
Matters discussed with the GAC
I attended each of the 8 GAC meetings held during the year. Part of each meeting involved a discussion with me without 
management present. I also met with members of the Committee on an ad hoc basis. During these various conversations we 
discussed my observations on a variety of accounting matters and observations on controls over financial reporting.
During the April meeting, the audit plan was presented to the Committee. The plan included the matters which I considered 
presented the highest risk to the audit and other information, such as our approach to the audit of journals, interest income and 
financial instrument valuation, and where the latest technology would be used to obtain better quality audit evidence. Throughout 
the year, this plan was refreshed and revised to account for changes in the external and internal environment at HSBC. As a result of 
operational issues in the US we changed our view of the risks associated with the accounting for pensions. This change led to a 
change in our audit approach which was discussed with the GAC.
In December, the GAC held a meeting with a particular focus on control matters. We also discussed their impact on our audit 
approach, for example we explored how our audit approach would be amended to focus more on the controls used by management 
over key spreadsheets and system-generated information used in financial reporting.
The areas of highest audit risk, where I focused most effort and resource, were:
• IT access management;
• impairment of loans and advances;
• goodwill;
• investment in Bank of Communications Co., Ltd (BoCom);
• application of hedge accounting;
• litigation and regulatory enforcement actions;
• impact of the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA); and
• pension liabilities.
To help you understand their impact on the audit, I have listed them in order of decreasing audit effort. Some of them are common to 
other international banks, and some are specific to HSBC. I have included at the end of this report an explanation of each item, why 
it was considered an area of audit focus and how the audit approach was tailored to address the risk of misstatement.
Going concern
The Directors have made a statement on page 146 regarding going concern. This statement is based on their belief that the Group 
and parent company intend to, and have sufficient resources to, remain in business for 12 months from the date of this report. I am 
required to review this statement, and in doing so I have considered HSBC’s budgets, cash flows, capital plan and stress tests. I have 
nothing to report as a result of my review. I also have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the statement.
Other reporting
The Annual Report and Accounts 2016 also contains a considerable amount of other information that is required by various regulators 
or standard setters. In respect of this information, my responsibilities and my reporting are set out in the table below. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 177

Appendix: Key audit matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee (‘GAC’)
Those areas which presented the greatest risk of material misstatement in the financial statements are required to be discussed with 
the GAC. They had the greatest effect on the audit, including the allocation of resources and effort and are discussed below together 
with an explanation of how the audit was tailored to address these specific areas.
IT Access Management
Nature of area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
All banks are highly dependent on technology due to the significant number of 
transactions that are processed daily. The audit approach relies extensively on automated 
controls and therefore procedures are designed to test access and control over IT 
systems. 
As reported in the prior year, controls over individuals’ access rights to operating 
systems, applications and data used in the financial reporting process required 
improvement. Access rights are important as they ensure that changes to applications 
and data are authorised and made in an appropriate manner. Ensuring staff only have 
appropriate access, and that the access is monitored, are key controls to mitigate the 
potential for fraud or error as a result of a change to an application or underlying data.
A number of enhancements to the control environment have been made by management 
since our last report but some controls were not fully remediated by the year end and we 
continued to assess the risk of a material misstatement arising from access to 
technology as significant for the audit. 
The original approach discussed with the GAC was based 
on the control enhancements proposed by management, 
and involved the testing of new and improved control 
processes. This was supplemented with other control and 
substantive procedures required for the periods of the year 
when the changes would not yet have been effective. As 
the timing of the enhancements to controls changed 
during the year, we reflected this in the nature and extent 
of testing, and our final approach was discussed with the 
GAC in October.
At each GAC meeting, there was a discussion on the status 
of the control remediation programme, work performed by 
management and results of testing performed. 
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
Access rights were tested over the various aspects of technology relied upon for financial reporting. Specifically, the audit tested that:
• new access requests for joiners were properly reviewed and authorised;
• application user access rights were removed on a timely basis when an individual left or moved role;
• access rights to applications were periodically monitored for appropriateness; and
• highly privileged access was restricted to appropriate personnel.
Other areas that were independently assessed included password policies, security configurations, controls over changes to applications and 
databases and that business users, developers and production support did not have access to change applications, the operating system or databases 
in the production environment.
As a consequence of the deficiencies identified a range of other procedures were performed:
• where inappropriate access was identified, we understood the nature of the access, and, where possible, obtained additional evidence on the 
appropriateness of the activities performed;
• additional substantive testing was performed on specific year-end reconciliations (i.e. custodian, bank account and suspense account 
reconciliations) and confirmations with external counterparties;
• testing was performed on other compensating controls such as business performance reviews; and
• a list of users with access to systems was obtained and manually compared to other access lists where segregation of duties was deemed to be of 
higher risk, for example users having access to both core banking and payments systems.

Impairment of loans and advances
Nature of the area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
Impairment allowances represent management’s best estimate of the losses incurred 
within the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. They are calculated on a collective 
basis for portfolios of loans of a similar nature and on an individual basis for significant 
loans. The calculation of both collective and individual impairment allowances is 
inherently judgemental for any bank.
Collective impairment allowances are calculated using models which approximate the 
impact of current economic and credit conditions on large portfolios of loans. The inputs 
to these models are based on historical loss experience with judgement applied to 
determine the assumptions used to calculate impairment. Model overlays are applied 
where data driven parameters or calculations are not considered representative of 
current risks or conditions of the loan portfolios.
For specific impairments, judgement is required to determine when an impairment event 
has occurred and then to estimate the expected future cash flows related to that loan.
The audit was focused on impairment due to the materiality of the loan balances and 
associated impairment allowances and the subjective nature of the impairment 
calculation. 
The largest loan portfolios are in Europe and Asia with the more significant impairment 
allowances being in Europe, North America and Latin America.
At each GAC and Group Risk Committee meeting there 
was a discussion on changes to risk factors and other 
inputs within the collective allowance models as well as 
discussions on individually significant loan impairments. 
We discussed a number of specific risks that changed or 
emerged during the course of the year, including the 
impact of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union; 
the economic slowdown in China; volatility in the oil price 
which impacted individual credits; and the increased 
macroeconomic uncertainty in North America. In all of 
these cases we discussed the performance of the existing 
credit exposures, and the potential need for changes to 
modelling approaches.
We also discussed any significant changes made to the 
inputs or models impacting the collective impairment 
allowance as well as changes in the control environment. 
These included key assumptions over the retail impairment 
models and improvements in the way higher risk loans 
were identified and escalated within the organisation.  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 179
Impairment of loans and advances
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
The controls management has established to support their collective and specific impairment calculations were tested.
• For collective impairment, this included controls over the appropriateness of models used to calculate the charge, the process of determining key 
assumptions and the identification of loans to be included within the calculation.
• For specific impairment charges on individual loans, this included controls over the monitoring of the credit watch list, credit file review processes, 
approval of external collateral valuation vendors and review controls over the approval of significant individual impairments.
• For collective allowances, the appropriateness of the modelling policy and methodology used for material portfolios was independently assessed by 
reference to the accounting standards and market practices. Model calculations were tested through reperformance and code review. Specifically 
with respect to the collective impairment models for the retail portfolios, we reviewed the enhancements made to the models and methodology to 
ensure they were appropriate.
• The appropriateness of management’s judgements was also independently considered in respect of calculation methodologies, segmentation, 
economic factors and judgemental overlays, the period of historical loss rates used, loss emergence periods, cure rates for impaired loans, and the 
valuation of recovery assets and collateral.
• For specific allowances, the appropriateness of provisioning methodologies and policies was independently assessed for a sample of loans across 
the portfolio selected on the basis of risk. An independent view was formed on the levels of provisions booked based on the detailed loan and 
counterparty information in the credit file. Calculations within a sample of discounted cash flow models were reperformed.

Goodwill
Nature of the area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
The Group had goodwill of $15.5bn from a number of historical 
acquisitions across cash-generating units (CGUs).
An assessment is required annually to establish whether 
a CGU’s goodwill should continue to be recognised, or if any 
impairment exists. At each reporting period, management is also 
required to identify any potential indicators, and to perform an 
impairment assessment if any are identified.
The impairment assessment calculation used for the tests were 
based on estimated future cash flows for each CGU discounted 
at an appropriate cost of equity rate. HSBC used its Annual 
Operating Plan as the basis for the first five years of cash flows 
and then extrapolated returns into perpetuity using a terminal 
growth factor. Cost of equity rates were based on the investment 
rates used within the global business and approved by the 
Board.
The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they 
are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant 
judgement. The extent of judgement and the size of the 
goodwill, resulted in this matter being identified as an area of 
focus.
We discussed the conclusions of goodwill assessments with the GAC when they 
considered the annual test and at each reporting period when they considered 
whether indicators of impairment existed.
At 30 June, indicators of impairment were identified in GPB – Europe and GB&M – 
Europe, which prompted a full impairment test for these two CGUs. This led to an 
impairment of $800m of goodwill in GPB – Europe.
The annual assessment was performed in the third quarter based on 1 July data. 
This assessment concluded no further impairment of goodwill was required. The 
discussions with the GAC focused on the key assumptions, both individually and 
when combined together. During these discussions, management confirmed their 
view that the forecasts for each CGU remained appropriate. 
Subsequently, we discussed with the GAC the impact of changing segments on the 
CGUs, particularly the decision to change the CGU associated with GB&M, as 
disclosed on page 240. The discussion also covered the decision not to change the 
other CGUs.
At 31 December, management identified further indicators of impairment in the 
GPB - Europe CGU. A retest was performed and it was concluded that all remaining 
goodwill for the CGU should be written off. In reaching this conclusion, a view was 
taken on the future performance of the business, and the risk associated with these 
forecasts. We discussed the approach and adjustments with the GAC.
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
• Goodwill was assessed immediately before and after the new reporting segments were established. Both bases of the assessment were considered 
in the audit. 
• PwC’s independent valuation experts critically assessed the discount rate and terminal growth rates used in the discounted cash flow models. The 
focus was on the methodology used to estimate discount rates of a CGU; and whether the use of the nominal GDP growth rates was the most 
appropriate in estimating the terminal growth rates into perpetuity for each CGU.
• The calculations used in the model were reperformed to check accuracy and the key inputs in the model were agreed to underlying sources.
• Management’s future cash flow forecasts used in the model were assessed by:
–  testing that the forecasts agreed to the latest Annual Operating Plan approved by management;
–  considering current year performance against plan and the reasons for any deviation, and key drivers or strategies underlying the plan. These were 
discussed with management of the Global Businesses for each sensitive CGU;
–  reviewing the historical achievement of the Annual Operating Plan. Given the uncertainties in forecasting, this identified that forecasts have been 
less accurate for prior periods, and we considered if this was appropriately factored into the valuation model;
– independent sensitivity analysis was performed to identify any further CGUs with a risk of impairment. The reasonableness of management’s 
threshold of sensitive CGUs was assessed; and
– the appropriateness of disclosures made in relation to goodwill was also considered.

Investment in associate – Bank of Communications Company, Limited (‘BoCom’)
Nature of the area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
HSBC's investment in BoCom is accounted for as an associate, using the equity 
method.
This is the fourth consecutive year end that the market value of BoCom has been 
below the carrying value. At 31 December, the market value based on the share 
price was $11.1bn compared with the carrying value of $15.8bn.
This is considered an indicator of potential impairment under IFRS. An impairment 
test was performed by HSBC using a value in use model to estimate the 
investment’s value assuming it continues to be held in perpetuity rather than sold 
($16.1bn). On this basis no impairment was recorded and the share of BoCom’s 
profits has been recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The value in use model determines the present value of HSBC’s share of BoCom’s 
future cash flows. The model is dependent on many assumptions, both short-term 
and long-term in nature. These assumptions are derived from a combination of 
management estimates, analysts’ forecasts and market data, and are highly 
judgemental.
Discussions with the GAC were focused on:
• the continued appropriateness of the value in use model given the 
period of time that the carrying value has been in excess of market 
value;
• the key assumptions used in the model with a particular focus on 
the assumptions with the highest level of uncertainty including the 
long-term growth rate and the long term loan loss rate;
• the reasonably possible alternative assumptions that were 
considered to identify those assumptions to which the value in use 
was most sensitive and to demonstrate the impact on the value in 
use of a movement in those assumptions; and
• the overall justifications for the divergence between the value in 
use and market value. 
During these discussions, HSBC confirmed its view that the model, 
assumptions and cash flow forecasts remained appropriate.
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
• The conclusions on the appropriateness of the model were reviewed and the discount rate used within the model was independently recalculated 
with the assistance of our valuation experts.
• Inputs used in the determination of assumptions within the model were challenged and corroborating information was obtained with reference to 
external market information, third-party sources, including analyst reports, and historical publicly available BoCom information.
• The controls in place over the model were tested.
• The year-end meeting between management and senior BoCom executive management, held specifically to identify facts or circumstances impacting 
management assumptions, was observed.
• The mathematical accuracy of the model was tested.
• Disclosures made in the Annual Report and Accounts 2016 in relation to BoCom were reviewed.

Application of hedge accounting
Nature of the area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
To qualify for hedge accounting, certain criteria must be met including 
documenting the nature and purpose of the hedge and performing regular 
testing over its effectiveness.
Due to the complex nature of the hedge accounting rules this is often an area of 
significant risk for banks. 
In our prior report to you, we noted that audit testing had identified a number of 
instances where hedging was applied, but the accounting rules had not been 
adequately met. This resulted in the remediation of existing controls and the 
implementation of new controls in the last quarter of 2015.
In light of the prior year matters, we determined this to be an area of significant 
audit risk.
We discussed with the GAC during the year, the progress made by 
management in the implementation of the new controls.  
During December 2016, management in France identified a further 
issue with an established hedging relationship, which resulted in a 
partial discontinuation of the hedge. A discussion was held with the 
GAC regarding both the root cause of the matter, the period in 
which the adjustment should be recognised and over which controls 
that had not operated effectively. 
As indicated by the above matter, not all of the hedge accounting 
controls operated effectively in the year. The exceptions noted were 
limited to France.
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
• For all significant macro cash flow hedges, documentation was examined and the relationships assessed to determine if the hedges had been 
appropriately designated. This included consideration of the hedge objectives and specific compliance with IFRS.
• A sample of new hedging relationships was examined and the relationships assessed to determine if they had been appropriately designated. 
This included consideration of the hedge objectives and specific compliance with IFRS.
• Management’s hedge effectiveness reviews, and the measurement and recording of hedge ineffectiveness, were tested for a sample of hedge 
relationships.
• Understood and tested controls over the documentation and review of the hedge relationships and their initial and ongoing effectiveness.
• Additional substantive audit procedures were performed over the partial discontinuation of the hedging relationship in France.

Litigation and regulatory enforcement actions
Nature of the area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
HSBC, like other global banking institutions, is exposed to a significant 
number of open legal cases and regulatory investigations in a number of 
its markets. Given the business is geographically dispersed, the same 
matter could be subject to investigation in multiple jurisdictions.
Provisions of $2.4bn have been established to account for legal 
settlements and regulatory fines. The most significant provisions relate to 
tax-related investigations and foreign exchange market manipulation.
There are a number of legal and regulatory matters for which no provision 
has been established, as discussed on page 257.
There is an inherent risk that legal exposures are not identified and 
considered for financial reporting purposes on a timely basis. Importantly, 
the decision to recognise a provision and the basis of measurement are 
judgemental.
Group Legal provided to each GAC meeting an update on the status of 
legal cases. These updates considered whether all related litigation or 
investigations about a specific matter had been identified.
Material matters were discussed during each meeting and the need for 
changes to provisions considered. We participated in these discussions, 
including consideration of whether any constructive obligation had arisen 
in individual cases.
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
• Controls designed to ensure the completeness and adequacy of current legal and regulatory provisions were tested. Regulatory correspondence from 
material markets was also read, and a sample of legal expenses were reviewed.
• Open legal cases were discussed with Group Legal and in certain instances we obtained and reviewed the relevant regulatory and litigation documents 
in order to assess the facts and circumstances.
• The range of reasonably possible outcomes was considered for material provisions to independently assess the appropriateness of the judgement 
made by HSBC.
• The disclosures of legal exposures and provisions were assessed for completeness and accuracy.

Impact of the deferred prosecution agreement (‘DPA’)
Nature of the area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
HSBC and HSBC Bank USA, N.A., (‘HBUS’) entered into a DPA with the 
US Department of Justice (DoJ), Federal Reserve Board and Financial 
Conduct Authority in 2012 regarding non-compliance with the US Bank 
Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering rules, and sanctions laws. The 
duration of the DPA is five years.
If the DOJ were to conclude that a breach of the DPA had occurred, there 
are a number of potential penalties that could be imposed that could have 
a material adverse effect on HSBC’s business. This could include loss of 
business and withdrawal of funding, restrictions on US dollar clearing 
functions through HSBC Bank USA or revocation of bank licences. The 
loss of this ability could have a significant adverse impact on the going 
concern status of HSBC and its individual subsidiaries in the future.
In considering going concern as the basis of preparation of the financial 
statements, a discussion was held with the GAC about the progress being 
made in responding to the requirements of the DPA. The conversation 
specifically considered the 2016 report of the Monitor.
In the report, he expressed significant concerns about the pace of 
progress, instances of potential financial crime and systems and control 
deficiencies, whether HSBC is on track to meet its goal to the Monitor’s 
satisfaction within the five-year period and, pending further review and 
discussion with HSBC, did not certify as to HSBC’s implementation of, 
and adherence to, remedial measures specified in the DPA.
Assurances were sought from the Directors that they were not aware of 
any information to suggest that the DoJ had concluded that the DPA had 
been breached.
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
• The likelihood of the DPA being breached and a restriction to US dollar clearing imposed was independently assessed through:
–  inquiry with the Monitor, whose role is explained on page 82, to understand the status of his work, the outcome of his most recent country 
reviews, his assessment of management’s progress against the requirements of the DPA and his reporting to the DoJ and FCA;
–  reading the 2016 Monitor annual report and the 11 country reports issued during the year; and
–  reading a sample of reports produced by the compliance function that undertook a Global Standards operational effectiveness exercise, and an 
assessment of the findings.
• Each Group Risk Committee meeting was attended during the year. At each meeting a report was provided by Group Risk on the status of the 
Global Standards programme, which aims to address the DPA recommendations. The related discussion was observed.
• The papers supporting the Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee meeting at the year-end were read. This meeting discussed the 2016 
Monitor report and management’s response.
• Compliance with the DPA was discussed with Group Legal and other members of senior management.

Pension liabilities
Nature of the area of focus Matters discussed with the GAC
HSBC has $39.8bn of pension liabilities as a result of defined benefit 
pension schemes. 
The calculation of these pension liabilities is complex and HSBC uses third 
party actuaries to provide support in the process to ensure appropriate 
expertise is applied to the calculation. The use of these actuaries also 
increases the risk of error as data is passed to third parties for analysis 
and calculation purposes. 
Considering all of these factors, our initial assessment of the risk of 
misstatement did not identify pension liabilities as an area of significant 
focus as there was no history of error and the pension funds were in 
surplus reducing the risk of fraud.
During the year management identified errors in the transfer and use of 
data by third parties for one of the schemes in the US. As a result of this 
error, we reconsidered our assessment of the audit risk surrounding 
pension liability valuations and increased our scope of testing in this area.
The change in the assessment of risk was discussed and agreed with the 
GAC in December 2016.
We focused our testing response and our discussions with GAC on the 
largest schemes in the UK and US, which made up 84% of the overall 
liability balance at 31 December 2016. Our increased testing was focused 
on the transfer and use of data by third parties to form the calculation.
Procedures performed to support our discussions and conclusions
• The controls over the review and approval of actuarial assumptions, the completeness and accuracy of data provided to external actuaries, and the 
reconciliation to data used in experts calculation were tested. 
• Controls over the third party vendors were tested and the third party assurance reports covering controls operated by the vendors were reviewed.
• The output from external actuaries was inspected and an independent view was formed of key actuarial assumptions. 
• Data used by the actuary in the calculation and the system to ledger reconciliations was independently tested.

2 During 2016, HSBC Holdings issued $2,000m of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible capital securities, after issuance costs of $6m and tax benefits of $4m. In 2015, 
HSBC Holdings issued $2,450m and €1,000m of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible capital securities, on which there were $12m of external issuance costs, $25m 
of intra-group issuance costs and $19m of tax. In 2014, HSBC Holdings issued $2,250m, $1,500m and €1,500m of perpetual subordinated contingent convertible capital 
securities, on which there were $13m of external issuance costs and $33m of intra-group issuance costs. Under IFRSs these issuance costs and tax benefits are classified as 
equity. 
3 At 31 December 2016, retained earnings included 353,356,251 treasury shares (2015: 81,580,180; 2014: 85,337,430). The increase principally reflects the share buy-back 
initiative, with the purchase of 325,273,407 ordinary shares to reduce outstanding ordinary shares. In addition, treasury shares are also held within HSBC’s Insurance business 
retirement funds for the benefit of policyholders or beneficiaries within employee trusts for the settlement of shares expected to be delivered under employee share schemes or 
bonus plans, and the market-making activities in Markets.
4 Cumulative goodwill amounting to $5,138m has been charged against reserves in respect of acquisitions of subsidiaries prior to 1 January 1998, including $3,469m charged 
against the merger reserve arising on the acquisition of HSBC Bank plc. The balance of $1,669m has been charged against retained earnings.
5 At 31 December 2015, our operations in Brazil were classified as held for sale (see Note 22). The cumulative amount of other reserves attributable to these operations were as 
follows: available-for-sale fair value reserve debit of $176m, cash flow hedging reserve credit of $34m and foreign exchange reserve debit of $2.6bn.
6 Statutory share premium relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 (the ‘Act’) was taken in respect of the acquisition of HSBC Bank plc in 1992, HSBC France in 2000 
and HSBC Finance Corporation in 2003, and the shares issued were recorded at their nominal value only. In HSBC’s consolidated financial statements the fair value differences 
of $8,290m in respect of HSBC France and $12,768m in respect of HSBC Finance Corporation were recognised in the merger reserve. The merger reserve created on 
the acquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation subsequently became attached to HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited (‘HOHU’), following a number of intra-group 
reorganisations. During 2009, pursuant to Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, statutory share premium relief was taken in respect of the rights issue and $15,796m was 
recognised in the merger reserve. The merger reserve includes a deduction of $614m in respect of costs relating to the rights issue, of which $149m was subsequently 
transferred to the income statement. Of this $149m, $121m was a loss arising from accounting for the agreement with the underwriters as a contingent forward contract. The 
merger reserve excludes the loss of $344m on a forward foreign exchange contract associated with hedging the proceeds of the rights issue.

share buy-back initiative, with the purchase of 325,273,407 ordinary shares ($2,497m) to reduce outstanding ordinary shares. In addition, treasury shares are held to fund 
employee share plans.

Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
194  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
(a) Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB, including interpretations (‘IFRICS’) issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, and 
as endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’). At 31 December 2016, there were no unendorsed standards effective for the year ended 
31 December 2016 affecting these consolidated and separate financial statements, and HSBC’s application of IFRSs results in no 
differences between IFRSs as issued by the IASB and IFRSs as endorsed by the EU.
Standards adopted during the year ended 31 December 2016
There were no new standards applied during the year ended 31 December 2016 by HSBC. 
The requirements of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ relating to the presentation of gains and losses on financial liabilities designated 
at fair value were adopted in the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings. As a result, the effects of changes in those 
liabilities’ credit risk is presented in other comprehensive income with the remaining effect presented in profit or loss. In accordance 
with the transitional requirements of IFRS 9, comparatives have not been restated. Adoption increased profit before tax by $896m 
with the opposite effect on other comprehensive income, with no effect on net assets.
During 2016, HSBC adopted a number of interpretations and amendments to standards which had an insignificant effect on the 
consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings.
(b) Differences between IFRSs and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards
There are no significant differences between IFRSs and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards in terms of their application to 
HSBC and consequently there would be no significant differences had the financial statements been prepared in accordance with 
Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The Notes on the Financial Statements, taken together with the Report of the Directors, 
include the aggregate of all disclosures necessary to satisfy IFRSs and Hong Kong reporting requirements. 
(c) Future accounting developments
Minor amendments to IFRSs
The IASB has published a number of minor amendments to IFRSs in the ‘Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014’ and in a series 
of stand-alone amendments, one of which has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU. HSBC has not early adopted any of the 
amendments effective after 31 December 2016 and it expects they will have an insignificant effect, when adopted, on the 
consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings.
Major new IFRSs
The IASB has published IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. 
IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 have been endorsed for use in the EU and IFRS 16 has not yet been endorsed.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which is the comprehensive standard to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, and includes requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets 
and liabilities, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting.
Classification and measurement
The classification and measurement of financial assets will depend on how these are managed (the entity’s business model) and 
their contractual cash flow characteristics. These factors determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortised cost, 
fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’) or fair value through profit or loss (‘FVPL’). The combined effect of the 
application of the business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics tests may result in some differences in the population 
of financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value compared with IAS 39. However, based on an assessment of financial 
assets performed to date and expectations around changes to balance sheet composition, HSBC expects that the overall impact of 
any change will not be significant.
For financial liabilities designated to be measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are 
to be included in other comprehensive income.
Impairment
The impairment requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI, and lease receivables and certain 
loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, an impairment allowance (or provision in the case of 
commitments and guarantees) is required for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) resulting from default events that are possible within the 
next 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL 
resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where 
ECL is recognised are in ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit 
risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment, so are considered to be in default or 
otherwise credit impaired, are in ‘stage 3’.
The assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are required to be unbiased and probability-weighted, and should 
incorporate all available information relevant to the assessment, including information about past events, current conditions and 
reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take 
into account the time value of money. As a result, the recognition and measurement of impairment is intended to be more forward-
looking than under IAS 39, and the resulting impairment charge will tend to be more volatile. IFRS 9 will also tend to result in an 
increase in the total level of impairment allowances, since all financial assets will be assessed for at least 12-month ECL and the 
population of financial assets to which lifetime ECL applies is likely to be larger than the population for which there is objective 
evidence of impairment in accordance with IAS 39. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 195  
 
Hedge accounting
The general hedge accounting requirements aim to simplify hedge accounting, creating a stronger link with risk management 
strategy and permitting hedge accounting to be applied to a greater variety of hedging instruments and risks. However they do not 
explicitly address macro hedge accounting strategies, which are particularly important for banks. As a result, IFRS 9 includes an 
accounting policy choice to remain with IAS 39 hedge accounting.
Based on the analysis performed to date, HSBC expects to exercise the accounting policy choice to continue IAS 39 hedge 
accounting and therefore is not currently planning to change hedge accounting, although it will implement the revised hedge 
accounting disclosures required by the related amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
Transition
The classification and measurement and impairment requirements are applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet 
at the date of initial application, with no requirement to restate comparative periods. HSBC does not intend to restate comparatives. 
The mandatory application date for the standard as a whole is 1 January 2018, but it is possible to apply the revised presentation for 
certain liabilities measured at fair value from an earlier date. HSBC has early adopted the revised presentation of fair value gains and 
losses relating to an entity’s own credit risk on certain liabilities in the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings from 
1 January 2016, and since interim financial statements have been issued during 2016 without adoption, will adopt new requirements 
in the consolidated financial statements from 1 January 2017. If this presentation was applied in the consolidated financial 
statements at 31 December 2016, the effect would be to increase profit before tax with the opposite effect on other comprehensive 
income based on the change in fair value attributable to changes in HSBC’s credit risk for the year, with no effect on net assets. 
Further information on the change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk, including HSBC’s credit risk, is disclosed in Note 
24. HSBC is assessing the impact that the impairment requirements will have on the financial statements.
The joint Global Risk and Global Finance IFRS 9 Implementation Programme continues to progress with the documentation of Group 
accounting policy, the development of operating and system target operating models and the development, build and testing of risk 
modelling methodologies for the calculation of impairment nearing completion. HSBC intends to perform a parallel run during the 
second half of 2017 to gain a better understanding of the potential effect of the new standard and for the governance framework to 
gain experience. HSBC intends to quantify the potential impact of IFRS 9 once it is practicable to provide reliable estimates, which 
will be no later than in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017. Until reliable estimates of the impact are available, particularly on the 
interaction with the regulatory capital requirements, further information on the expected impact on the financial position and on 
capital planning cannot be provided. Further information about the application of IFRS 9 by HSBC is available on pages 347 to 352 of 
the Annual Report and Accounts 2015.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The original effective date of IFRS 15 has been 
delayed by one year and the standard is now effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with early application 
permitted. IFRS 15 provides a principles-based approach for revenue recognition, and introduces the concept of recognising revenue 
for performance obligations as they are satisfied. The standard should be applied retrospectively, with certain practical expedients 
available. HSBC has assessed the impact of IFRS 15 and expects that the standard will have no significant effect, when applied, on 
the consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ with an effective date for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
IFRS 16 results in lessees accounting for most leases within the scope of the standard in a manner similar to the way in which 
finance leases are currently accounted for under IAS 17 ‘Leases’. Lessees will recognise a ‘right of use’ asset and a corresponding 
financial liability on the balance sheet. The asset will be amortised over the length of the lease and the financial liability measured at 
amortised cost. Lessor accounting remains substantially the same as under IAS 17. HSBC is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 
16, and it is not practicable to quantify the effect at the date of the publication of these financial statements. Existing operating lease 
commitments are set out in Note 34.
(d) Foreign currencies
HSBC’s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the 
major currency bloc in which HSBC transacts and funds its business. The US dollar is also HSBC Holdings’ functional currency 
because the US dollar and currencies linked to it are the most significant currencies relevant to the underlying transactions, events 
and conditions of its subsidiaries, as well as representing a significant proportion of its funds generated from financing activities.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date except non-monetary assets 
and liabilities measured at historical cost that are translated using the rate of exchange at the initial transaction date. Exchange 
differences are included in other comprehensive income or in the income statement depending on where the gain or loss on the 
underlying item is recognised. 
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets, liabilities and results of foreign operations whose functional currency is not US 
dollars are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to the income statement.
(e) Presentation of information
Certain disclosures required by IFRSs have been included in the audited sections of this Annual Report and Accounts as follows:
• segmental disclosures are included in the ‘Report of the Directors: Financial Review’ on pages 30 to 63;
• disclosures concerning the nature and extent of risks relating to insurance contracts and financial instruments are included in 
the ‘Report of the Directors: Risk’ on pages 64 to 126;
• capital disclosures are included in the ‘Report of the Directors: Capital’ on pages 127 to 131; and
Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
196  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
• disclosures relating to HSBC’s securitisation activities and structured products are included in the ‘Report of the Directors: Risk’ 
on pages 64 to 126.
In accordance with HSBC’s policy to provide disclosures that help investors and other stakeholders understand the Group’s 
performance, financial position and changes to them, the information provided in the Notes on the Financial Statements and the 
Report of the Directors goes beyond the minimum levels required by accounting standards, statutory and regulatory requirements 
and listing rules. In addition, HSBC follows the British Bankers’ Association Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure (‘the BBA Code’). 
The BBA Code aims to increase the quality and comparability of UK banks’ disclosures and sets out five disclosure principles 
together with supporting guidance. In line with the principles of the BBA Code, HSBC assesses good practice recommendations 
issued from time to time by relevant regulators and standard setters and will assess the applicability and relevance of such guidance, 
enhancing disclosures where appropriate.
(f) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and judgements about future conditions. In view of the 
inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the recognition or measurement of items highlighted as the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements in section 1.2 below, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ 
from those on which management’s estimates are based, resulting in materially different conclusions from those reached by 
management for the purposes of these Financial Statements. Management’s selection of HSBC’s accounting policies which contain 
critical estimates and judgements reflects the materiality of the items to which the policies are applied and the high degree of 
judgement and estimation uncertainty involved.
(g) Segmental analysis
HSBC’s chief operating decision-maker is the Group Chief Executive, supported by the Group Management Board (‘GMB’), which 
operates as a general management committee under the direct authority of the Board, and operating segments are reported in a 
manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group Chief Executive and the GMB. 
Measurement of segmental assets, liabilities, income and expenses is in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Segmental income and expenses include transfers between segments, and these transfers are conducted at arm’s length. Shared 
costs are included in segments on the basis of the actual recharges made. 
(h) Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the Group and parent company 
have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a 
wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, cash flows and 
capital resources. 
1.2 Summary of significant accounting policies
(a) Consolidation and related policies
Investments in subsidiaries
Where an entity is governed by voting rights, HSBC consolidates when it holds, directly or indirectly, the necessary voting rights to 
pass resolutions by the governing body. In all other cases, the assessment of control is more complex and requires judgement of 
other factors, including having exposure to variability of returns, power to direct relevant activities and whether power is held as 
agent or principal.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The amount of non-controlling interest is measured either 
at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. This election is made 
for each business combination. 
HSBC Holdings’ investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses.
Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. HSBC’s CGUs are based on geographical regions subdivided by 
global business, except for Global Banking and Markets, for which goodwill is monitored on a global basis. 
Impairment testing is performed at least once a year, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the recoverable 
amount of a CGU with its carrying amount. 
Goodwill is included in a disposal group if the disposal group is a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated or it is an operation 
within such a CGU. The amount of goodwill included in a disposal group is measured on the basis of the relative values of the 
operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The review of goodwill for impairment reflects management’s best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these 
cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as follows:
• The future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive to the cash flows projected for the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to 
assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of sustainable cash flows thereafter. Forecasts are compared with actual performance and verifiable 
economic data, but they reflect management’s view of future business prospects at the time of the assessment.
• The rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their valuation and are based on the costs of capital 
assigned to individual CGUs. The cost of capital percentage is generally derived from a capital asset pricing model, which incorporates inputs 
reflecting a number of financial and economic variables, including the risk-free interest rate in the country concerned and a premium for the risk of 
the business being evaluated. These variables are subject to fluctuations in external market rates and economic conditions beyond management’s 
control, are subject to uncertainty and require the exercise of significant judgement.
The accuracy of forecast cash flows is subject to a high degree of uncertainty in volatile market conditions. In such circumstances, management 
retests goodwill for impairment more frequently than once a year when indicators of impairment exist to ensure that the assumptions on which the 
cash flow forecasts are based continue to reflect current market conditions and management’s best estimate of future business prospects. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 197  
 
HSBC sponsored structured entities
HSBC is considered to sponsor another entity if, in addition to ongoing involvement with the entity, it had a key role in establishing 
that entity or in bringing together relevant counterparties so the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur. HSBC is 
generally not considered a sponsor if the only involvement with the entity is merely administrative.
Interests in associates and joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are investments in which HSBC, together with one or more parties, has joint control. Depending on HSBC’s 
rights and obligations, the joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture. HSBC classifies investments 
in entities over which it has significant influence, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint arrangements, as associates.
HSBC recognises its share of the assets, liabilities and results in a joint operation. Investments in associates and interests in joint 
ventures are recognised using the equity method. The attributable share of the results and reserves of joint ventures and associates 
are included in the consolidated financial statements of HSBC based on either financial statements made up to 31 December or pro-
rated amounts adjusted for any material transactions or events occurring between the date the financial statements are available and 
31 December.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an 
indication that the investment may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates is not tested 
separately for impairment but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the investment.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Impairment testing of investments in associates involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the
present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment. The most significant judgements relate to the impairment
testing of our investment in Bank of Communications Co., Limited (‘BoCom’). Key assumptions used in estimating BoCom’s value in use, the
sensitivity of the value in use calculation to different assumptions and a sensitivity analysis that shows the changes in key assumptions that would
reduce the excess of value in use over the carrying amount (the ‘headroom’) to nil are described in Note 17.
(b) Income and expense
Operating income
Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense for all financial instruments, excluding those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value are 
recognised in ‘Interest income’ and ‘Interest expense’ in the income statement using the effective interest method. However, as an 
exception to this, interest on debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated under the fair value option and derivatives managed 
in conjunction with those debt securities are included in interest expense.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of 
measuring the impairment loss.
Non-interest income and expense
Fee income is earned from a diverse range of services provided by HSBC to its customers. Fee income is accounted for as follows:
• income earned on the execution of a significant act is recognised as revenue when the act is completed (for example, fees arising 
from negotiating a transaction, such as the acquisition of shares, for a third party); and
• income earned from the provision of services is recognised as revenue as the services are provided (for example, asset 
management services).
Net trading income comprises all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for 
trading, together with the related interest income, expense and dividends.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for listed equity 
securities, and usually the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities.
Net income/(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair value includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value 
of financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, including derivatives that are managed in conjunction 
with those financial assets and liabilities, and liabilities under investment contracts. Interest income, interest expense and dividend 
income in respect of those financial instruments are also included, except for interest arising from debt securities issued by HSBC 
and derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt securities, which is recognised in ‘Interest expense’.
The accounting policies for insurance premium income are disclosed in Note 1.2(f).
(c) Valuation of financial instruments 
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of a financial 
instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). 
However, if there is a difference between the transaction price and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based 
on a quoted price in an active market or a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, HSBC recognises the 
difference as a trading gain or loss at inception (‘day 1 gain or loss’). In all other cases, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and 
recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures or is closed out, the valuation inputs 
become observable or HSBC enters into an offsetting transaction.
The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on an individual basis. However, in cases where HSBC manages a group 
of financial assets and liabilities according to its net market or credit risk exposure, the fair value of the group of financial instruments 
is measured on a net basis but the underlying financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the financial statements, 
unless they satisfy the IFRS offsetting criteria.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data. However, certain financial instruments are valued on the basis of valuation
techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them the measurement of fair value is more judgemental.
An instrument in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if, in the opinion of management, a significant proportion of
the instrument’s inception profit or greater than 5% of the instrument’s valuation is driven by unobservable inputs. ‘Unobservable’ in this context
means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an arm’s length transaction would be likely to
occur. It generally does not mean that there is no data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value (consensus pricing data may,
for example, be used).
(d) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost
Loans and advances to banks and customers, held-to-maturity investments and most financial liabilities are measured at amortised 
cost. The carrying value of these financial assets at initial recognition includes any directly attributable transactions costs. If the initial 
fair value is lower than the cash amount advanced, such as in the case of some leveraged finance and syndicated lending activities, 
the difference is deferred and recognised over the life of the loan (as described in paragraph (c) above) through the recognition of 
interest income, unless the loan becomes impaired. 
HSBC may commit to underwriting loans on fixed contractual terms for specified periods of time. When the loan arising from the 
lending commitment is expected to be held for trading, the commitment to lend is recorded as a derivative. When HSBC intends 
to hold the loan, a provision on the loan commitment is only recorded where it is probable that HSBC will incur a loss. 
Impairment of loans and advances
Losses for impaired loans are recognised when there is objective evidence that impairment of a loan or portfolio of loans has 
occurred. Losses which may arise from future events are not recognised.
Individually assessed loans and advances
The factors considered in determining whether a loan is individually significant for the purposes of assessing impairment include 
the size of the loan, the number of loans in the portfolio, the importance of the individual loan relationship and how this is managed. 
Loans that are determined to be individually significant will be individually assessed for impairment, except when volumes of defaults 
and losses are sufficient to justify treatment under a collective methodology.
Loans considered as individually significant are typically to corporate and commercial customers, are for larger amounts and are 
managed on an individual basis. For these loans, HSBC considers on a case-by-case basis at each balance sheet date whether there 
is any objective evidence that a loan is impaired. 
The determination of the realisable value of security is based on the most recently updated market value at the time the impairment 
assessment is performed. The value is not adjusted for expected future changes in market prices, though adjustments are made to 
reflect local conditions such as forced sale discounts.
Impairment losses are calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of a loan, which include expected future receipts of 
contractual interest, at the loan’s original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof, and comparing the resultant present 
value with the loan’s current carrying amount. 
Collectively assessed loans and advances
Impairment is assessed collectively to cover losses which have been incurred but have not yet been identified on loans subject to 
individual assessment or for homogeneous groups of loans that are not considered individually significant, generally retail lending 
portfolios.
Incurred but not yet identified impairment
Individually assessed loans for which no evidence of impairment has been specifically identified on an individual basis are grouped 
together according to their credit risk characteristics for a collective impairment assessment. This assessment captures impairment 
losses that HSBC has incurred as a result of events occurring before the balance sheet date which HSBC is not able to identify on an 
individual loan basis, and that can be reliably estimated. When information becomes available which identifies losses on individual 
loans within a group, those loans are removed from the group and assessed individually.
Homogeneous groups of loans and advances
Statistical methods are used to determine collective impairment losses for homogeneous groups of loans not considered individually 
significant. The methods used to calculate collective allowances are set out below:
• When appropriate empirical information is available, HSBC utilises roll-rate methodology, which employs statistical analyses of 
historical data and experience of delinquency and default to reliably estimate the amount of the loans that will eventually be 
written off as a result of the events occurring before the balance sheet date. Individual loans are grouped using ranges of past 
due days, and statistical estimates are made of the likelihood that loans in each range will progress through the various stages of 
delinquency and become irrecoverable. Additionally, individual loans are segmented based on their credit characteristics, such 
as industry sector, loan grade or product. In applying this methodology, adjustments are made to estimate the periods of time 
between a loss event occurring, for example because of a missed payment, and its confirmation through write-off (known as the 
loss identification period). Current economic conditions are also evaluated when calculating the appropriate level of allowance 
required to cover inherent loss. In certain highly developed markets, models also take into account behavioural and account 
management trends as revealed in, for example, bankruptcy and rescheduling statistics.
• When the portfolio size is small or when information is insufficient or not reliable enough to adopt a roll-rate methodology, HSBC 
adopts a basic formulaic approach based on historical loss rate experience, or a discounted cash flow model. Where a basic 
formulaic approach is undertaken, the period between a loss event occurring and its identification is estimated by local 
management, and is typically between six and 12 months. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 199  
 
Write-off of loans and advances
Loans (and the related impairment allowance accounts) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic 
prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security. In 
circumstances where the net realisable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further 
recovery, write-off may be earlier.
Reversals of impairment
If the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent period, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the excess is written back by reducing the loan impairment allowance account 
accordingly. The write-back is recognised in the income statement.
Assets acquired in exchange for loans
When non-financial assets acquired in exchange for loans as part of an orderly realisation are held for sale, these assets are recorded 
as ‘Assets held for sale.’ 
Renegotiated loans
Loans subject to collective impairment assessment whose terms have been renegotiated are no longer considered past due, but are 
treated as up-to-date loans for measurement purposes once a minimum number of payments required has been received. Where 
collectively assessed loan portfolios include significant levels of renegotiated loans, these loans are segregated from other parts of 
the loan portfolio for the purposes of collective impairment assessment to reflect their risk profile. Loans subject to individual 
impairment assessment, whose terms have been renegotiated, are subject to ongoing review to determine whether they remain 
impaired. The carrying amounts of loans that have been classified as renegotiated retain this classification until maturity or 
derecognition.
A loan that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement made on substantially 
different terms or if the terms of an existing agreement are modified such that the renegotiated loan is substantially a different 
financial instrument. Any new loans that arise following derecognition events will continue to be disclosed as renegotiated loans 
and are assessed for impairment as above.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Loan impairment allowances represent management’s best estimate of losses incurred in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date. Management 
is required to exercise judgement in making assumptions and estimates when calculating loan impairment allowances on both individually and 
collectively assessed loans and advances. 
Collective impairment allowances are subject to estimation uncertainty, in part because it is not practicable to identify losses on an individual loan 
basis due to the large number of individually insignificant loans in the portfolio. The estimation methods include the use of statistical analyses of 
historical information, supplemented with significant management judgement, to assess whether current economic and credit conditions are such 
that the actual level of incurred losses is likely to be greater or less than historical experience. Where changes in economic, regulatory or behavioural 
conditions result in the most recent trends in portfolio risk factors being not fully reflected in the statistical models, risk factors are taken into account 
by adjusting the impairment allowances derived solely from historical loss experience.
Risk factors include loan portfolio growth, product mix, unemployment rates, bankruptcy trends, geographical concentrations, loan product features, 
economic conditions such as national and local trends in housing markets, the level of interest rates, portfolio seasoning, account management 
policies and practices, changes in laws and regulations, and other influences on customer payment patterns. Different factors are applied in different 
regions and countries to reflect local economic conditions, laws and regulations. The methodology and the assumptions used in calculating 
impairment losses are reviewed regularly in the light of differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience. For example, roll rates, loss 
rates and the expected timing of future recoveries are regularly benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate.
For individually assessed loans, judgement is required in determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred and, if so, the 
measurement of the impairment allowance. In determining whether there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred, judgement is exercised 
in evaluating all relevant information on indicators of impairment, including the consideration of whether payments are contractually past due and the 
consideration of other factors indicating deterioration in the financial condition and outlook of borrowers affecting their ability to pay. 
A higher level of judgement is required for loans to borrowers showing signs of financial difficulty in market sectors experiencing economic stress, 
particularly where the likelihood of repayment is affected by the prospects for refinancing or the sale of a specified asset. For those loans where 
objective evidence of impairment exists, management determines the size of the allowance required based on a range of factors such as the realisable 
value of security, the likely dividend available on liquidation or bankruptcy, the viability of the customer’s business model and the capacity to trade 
successfully out of financial difficulties and generate sufficient cash flow to service debt obligations.
HSBC might provide loan forbearance to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by agreeing to modify the contractual payment terms of loans in 
order to improve the management of customer relationships, maximise collection opportunities or avoid default or repossession. Where forbearance 
activities are significant, higher levels of judgement and estimation uncertainty are involved in determining their effects on loan impairment 
allowances. Judgements are involved in differentiating the credit risk characteristics of forbearance cases, including those which return to performing 
status following renegotiation. Where collectively assessed loan portfolios include significant levels of loan forbearance, portfolios are segmented to 
reflect the different credit risk characteristics of forbearance cases, and estimates are made of the incurred losses inherent within each forbearance 
portfolio segment. Forbearance activities take place in both retail and wholesale loan portfolios, but our largest concentration is in the US, in HSBC 
Finance’s CML run-off portfolio.
The exercise of judgement requires the use of assumptions which are highly subjective and very sensitive to the risk factors, in particular to changes in 
economic and credit conditions across a large number of geographical areas. Many of the factors have a high degree of interdependency and there is 
no single factor to which our loan impairment allowances as a whole are sensitive.
Non-trading reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements
When securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price (‘repos’), they remain on the balance 
sheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received. Securities purchased under commitments to resell (‘reverse 
repos’) are not recognised on the balance sheet and an asset is recorded in respect of the initial consideration paid. Non-trading 
repos and reverse repos are measured at amortised cost. The difference between the sale and repurchase price or between the 
purchase and resale price is treated as interest and recognised in net interest income over the life of the agreement.
Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
200  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
(e) Financial instruments measured at fair value
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on the trade date when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements to purchase 
those instruments, and are normally derecognised when the securities are either sold or redeemed. They are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value, and changes therein are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are either sold or 
become impaired. Upon disposal, the cumulative gains or losses in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income 
statement as ‘Gains less losses from financial investments’.
Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are assessed at each balance sheet date for objective evidence of impairment. Impairment losses 
are recognised in the income statement within ‘Loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions’ for debt instruments and 
within ‘Gains less losses from financial investments’ for equities. 
Available-for-sale debt securities
In assessing objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date, HSBC considers all available evidence, including observable data 
or information about events specifically relating to the securities which may result in a shortfall in the recovery of future cash flows. 
A subsequent decline in the fair value of the instrument is recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of decreases in the estimated future cash flows. Where there is no further objective evidence of impairment, 
the decline in the fair value of the financial asset is recognised in other comprehensive income. If the fair value of a debt security 
increases in a subsequent period, and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was 
recognised in the income statement, or the instrument is no longer impaired, the impairment loss is reversed through the income 
statement.
Available-for-sale equity securities
A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the equity below its cost is objective evidence of impairment. In assessing 
whether it is significant, the decline in fair value is evaluated against the original cost of the asset at initial recognition. In assessing 
whether it is prolonged, the decline is evaluated against the continuous period in which the fair value of the asset has been below its 
original cost at initial recognition. 
All subsequent increases in the fair value of the instrument are treated as a revaluation and are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Subsequent decreases in the fair value of the available-for-sale equity security are recognised in the income statement to the 
extent that further cumulative impairment losses have been incurred. Impairment losses recognised on the equity security are not 
reversed through the income statement.
Financial instruments designated at fair value
Financial instruments, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they meet one or more of the criteria set out 
below, and are so designated irrevocably at inception:
• the use of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch;
• when a group of financial assets, liabilities or both is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in 
accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; and
• where financial instruments contain one or more non-closely related embedded derivatives.
Designated financial assets are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on trade date, 
and are normally derecognised when the rights to the cash flows expire or are transferred. Designated financial liabilities are 
recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on settlement date, and are normally 
derecognised when extinguished. Subsequent changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in ‘Net income/
(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair value’.
Under this criterion, the main classes of financial instruments designated by HSBC are:
Long-term debt issues
The interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain fixed rate debt securities issued has been matched with the interest and/
or foreign exchange exposure on certain swaps as part of a documented risk management strategy.
Financial assets and financial liabilities under unit-linked and non-linked investment contracts
A contract under which HSBC does not accept significant insurance risk from another party is not classified as an insurance contract, 
other than investment contracts with discretionary participation features ('DPF'), but is accounted for as a financial liability. See Note 
1.2(f) for investment contracts with DPF and contracts where HSBC accepts significant insurance risk. Customer liabilities under 
linked and certain non-linked investment contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries and the corresponding financial assets are 
designated at fair value. Liabilities are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value which is calculated by reference to the 
value of the relevant underlying funds or indices. Premiums receivable and amounts withdrawn are accounted for as increases or 
decreases in the liability recorded in respect of investment contracts. The incremental costs directly related to the acquisition of new 
investment contracts or renewing existing investment contracts are deferred and amortised over the period during which the 
investment management services are provided.
Derivatives
Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, interest rates or other 
indices. Derivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are classified as assets when 
their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative; this includes embedded derivatives which are bifurcated 
from the host contract when they meet the definition of a derivative on a stand-alone basis. 
Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in ‘Net trading 
income’. Gains and losses on derivatives managed in conjunction with financial instruments designated at fair value are reported in 
‘Net income/(expense) from financial instruments designated at fair value’ together with the gains and losses on the economically  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 201  
 
hedged items. Where the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value, the 
contractual interest is shown in ‘Interest expense’ together with the interest payable on the issued debt.
Hedge accounting
When derivatives are held for risk management purposes they are designated in hedge relationships where the required criteria for 
documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. HSBC enters into fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments 
in foreign operations as appropriate to the risk being hedged.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the income statement, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged 
assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge 
accounting is discontinued; the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income 
statement on a recalculated effective interest rate over the residual period to maturity, unless the hedged item has been 
derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives is recognised in other comprehensive income; the ineffective portion 
of the change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘Net trading income’. The accumulated gains 
and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the same periods in which the 
hedged item affects profit or loss. In hedges of forecast transactions that result in recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, 
previous gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. 
When a hedge relationship is discontinued, or partially discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately 
reclassified to the income statement.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. A gain or loss on the 
effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income; the residual change in fair value is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to the income statement on the disposal, or part disposal, of the foreign operation.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Non-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not 
applied.
(f) Insurance contracts
A contract is classified as an insurance contract where HSBC accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing to 
compensate that party on the occurrence of a specified uncertain future event. An insurance contract may also transfer financial risk, 
but is accounted for as an insurance contract if the insurance risk is significant. In addition, HSBC issues investment contracts with 
DPF which are also accounted for as insurance contracts as required by IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’.
Net insurance premium income
Premiums for life insurance contracts are accounted for when receivable, except in unit-linked insurance contracts where premiums 
are accounted for when liabilities are established.
Reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the direct insurance contracts to which 
they relate.
Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movements in liabilities to policyholders
Gross insurance claims for life insurance contracts reflect the total cost of claims arising during the year, including claim handling 
costs and any policyholder bonuses allocated in anticipation of a bonus declaration.
Maturity claims are recognised when due for payment. Surrenders are recognised when paid or at an earlier date on which, following 
notification, the policy ceases to be included within the calculation of the related insurance liabilities. Death claims are recognised 
when notified.
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
Liabilities under insurance contracts
Liabilities under non-linked life insurance contracts are calculated by each life insurance operation based on local actuarial principles. 
Liabilities under unit-linked life insurance contracts are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value, which is calculated by 
reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices.
Future profit participation on insurance contracts with DPF
Where contracts provide discretionary profit participation benefits to policyholders, liabilities for these contracts include provisions 
for the future discretionary benefits to policyholders. These provisions reflect the actual performance of the investment portfolio to 
date and management’s expectation of the future performance of the assets backing the contracts, as well as other experience 
factors such as mortality, lapses and operational efficiency, where appropriate. The benefits to policyholders may be determined by 
the contractual terms, regulation, or past distribution policy.
Investment contracts with DPF
While investment contracts with DPF are financial instruments, they continue to be treated as insurance contracts as required by 
IFRS 4. The Group therefore recognises the premiums for these contracts as revenue and recognises as an expense the resulting 
increase in the carrying amount of the liability.
Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
202  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
In the case of net unrealised investment gains on these contracts, whose discretionary benefits principally reflect the actual 
performance of the investment portfolio, the corresponding increase in the liabilities is recognised in either the income statement or 
other comprehensive income, following the treatment of the unrealised gains on the relevant assets. In the case of net unrealised 
losses, a deferred participating asset is recognised only to the extent that its recoverability is highly probable. Movements in the 
liabilities arising from realised gains and losses on relevant assets are recognised in the income statement.
Present value of in-force long-term insurance business
HSBC recognises the value placed on insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF, which are classified as long-term and 
in-force at the balance sheet date, as an asset. The asset represents the present value of the equity holders’ interest in the issuing 
insurance companies’ profits expected to emerge from these contracts written at the balance sheet date. The present value of in-
force business (‘PVIF’) is determined by discounting those expected future profits using appropriate assumptions in assessing factors 
such as future mortality, lapse rates and levels of expenses, and a risk discount rate that reflects the risk premium attributable to the 
respective contracts. The PVIF incorporates allowances for both non-market risk and the value of financial options and guarantees. 
The PVIF asset is presented gross of attributable tax in the balance sheet and movements in the PVIF asset are included in ‘Other 
operating income’ on a gross of tax basis.
(g) Employee compensation and benefits
Share-based payments
HSBC enters into both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment arrangements with its employees as compensation for 
services provided by employees. 
The vesting period for these schemes may commence before the grant date if the employees have started to render services in 
respect of the award before the grant date. Expenses are recognised when the employee starts to render service to which the award 
relates. 
Cancellations result from the failure to meet a non-vesting condition during the vesting period, and are treated as an acceleration of 
vesting recognised immediately in the income statement. Failure to meet a vesting condition by the employee is not treated as a 
cancellation, and the amount of expense recognised for the award is adjusted to reflect the number of awards expected to vest. 
Post-employment benefit plans
HSBC operates a number of pension schemes (including defined benefit and defined contribution) and post-employment benefit 
schemes.
Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense as the employees render service. 
Defined benefit pension obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The net charge to the income statement 
mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability, and is presented in operating 
expenses.
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets 
(excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive 
income. The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value 
of plan assets, after applying the asset ceiling test, where the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available 
refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The cost of obligations arising from other post-employment plans are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension 
plans.
(h) Tax
Income tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised in the same 
statement as the related item appears.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years. HSBC provides for potential current tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to 
the tax authorities. 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, and 
the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply 
in the periods in which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled.
Current and deferred tax is calculated based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The recognition of a deferred tax asset relies on an assessment of the probability and sufficiency of future taxable profits, future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. In the absence of a history of taxable profits, the most significant judgements
relate to expected future profitability and to the applicability of tax planning strategies, including corporate reorganisations.
(i) Provisions, contingent liabilities and guarantees
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or 
constructive obligation that has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 203  
 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Judgement is involved in determining whether a present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows.
Professional expert advice is taken on the assessment of litigation, property (including onerous contracts) and similar obligations. Provisions for
legal proceedings and regulatory matters typically require a higher degree of judgement than other types of provisions. When matters are at an
early stage, accounting judgements can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty associated with determining whether a present
obligation exists, and estimating the probability and amount of any outflows that may arise. As matters progress, management and legal advisers
evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, revising previous judgements and estimates as appropriate. At more
advanced stages, it is typically easier to make judgements and estimates around a better defined set of possible outcomes. However, the amount
provisioned can remain very sensitive to the assumptions used. There could be a wide range of possible outcomes for any pending legal
proceedings, investigations or inquiries. As a result, it is often not practicable to quantify a range of possible outcomes for individual matters. It is
also not practicable to meaningfully quantify ranges of potential outcomes in aggregate for these types of provisions because of the diverse nature
and circumstances of such matters and the wide range of uncertainties involved. Provisions for customer remediation also require significant levels
of estimation and judgement. The amounts of provisions recognised depend on a number of different assumptions, such as, the volume of inbound
complaints, the projected period of inbound complaint volumes, the decay rate of complaint volumes, the population identified as systemically
mis-sold and the number of policies per customer complaint.
Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees 
Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities, which include certain guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security, and contingent liabilities 
related to legal proceedings or regulatory matters, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the 
probability of settlement is remote.
Financial guarantee contracts
Liabilities under financial guarantee contracts which are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded initially at their fair value, 
which is generally the fee received or present value of the fee receivable.
HSBC Holdings has issued financial guarantees and similar contracts to other Group entities. HSBC elects to account for certain 
guarantees as insurance contracts in HSBC Holdings’ financial statements, in which case they are measured and recognised as 
insurance liabilities. This election is made on a contract by contract basis, and is irrevocable.

Post-employment benefit plans
The Group operates pension plans throughout the world for its employees. ‘Pension risk management’ on page 84 contains details of 
the policies and practices associated with these pension plans. Some are defined benefit plans, of which the largest is the HSBC 
Bank (UK) Pension Scheme (‘the principal plan’). 
The principal plan
The principal plan has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section. The defined benefit section was closed to future 
benefit accrual in 2015, with defined benefits earned by employees at that date continuing to be linked to their salary while they 
remain employed by HSBC Bank. The plan is overseen by an independent corporate trustee, who has a fiduciary responsibility for the 
operation of the plan. Its assets are held separately from the assets of the Group.
The investment strategy of the plan is to hold the majority of assets in bonds, with the remainder in a diverse range of investments. It 
also includes some interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk and inflation swaps to reduce inflation risk. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 209  
 
The latest funding valuation of the plan at 31 December 2014 was carried out by Colin G Singer, of Willis Towers Watson Limited, 
who is a Fellow of the UK Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. At that date, the market value of 
the plan’s assets was £24.6bn ($30.3bn) and this exceeded the value placed on its liabilities on an ongoing basis by £520m ($641m), 
giving a funding level of 102%. The main differences between the assumptions used for assessing the liabilities for this funding 
valuation and those used for IAS 19 (see ‘Key actuarial assumptions’ section below) are more prudent discount rate, inflation and 
longevity assumptions.
Although the plan was in surplus at the valuation date, HSBC agreed to make further contributions to the plan to support a lower-risk 
investment strategy over the longer term. These contributions amounted to £128m ($158m) in 2016 and are expected to amount to 
£64m ($79m) in each of 2017, 2018 and 2019, and £160m ($197m) in each of 2020 and 2021. 
The chart below shows the expected profile of future benefits payable from the plan. 
Future benefit payments ($bn)
The actuary also assessed the value of the liabilities if the plan were to be stopped and an insurance company asked to secure all 
future pension payments. This is generally larger than the amount needed on the ongoing basis described above because an 
insurance company would use more prudent assumptions and include an explicit allowance for the future administrative expenses 
of the plan. Under this approach, the amount of assets needed was estimated to be £31bn ($38bn) at 31 December 2014.

Post-employment defined benefit plans’ principal actuarial financial assumptions
HSBC determines the discount rates to be applied to its obligations in consultation with the plans’ local actuaries, on the basis of 
current average yields of high quality (AA-rated or equivalent) debt instruments with maturities consistent with those of the defined 
benefit obligations.

HSBC Holdings
Employee compensation and benefit expense in respect of HSBC Holdings’ employees in 2016 amounted to $571m (2015: $908m). 
The average number of persons employed during 2016 was 1,660 (2015: 2,656). Employees who are members of defined benefit 
pension plans are principally members of either the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme or the HSBC International Staff Retirement 
Benefits Scheme. HSBC Holdings pays contributions to such plans for its own employees in accordance with the schedules of 
contributions determined by the trustees of the plans and recognises these contributions as an expense as they fall due. 
From 1 July 2016 employment costs of most employees are recognised by the ServCo group and the ServCo group has started 
providing services to HSBC Holdings. HSBC Holdings recognised a management charge of $406m for these services which is 
included under ‘General and administrative expenses’.

The Group’s profits are taxed at different rates depending on the country in which the profits arise. The key applicable tax rates 
include Hong Kong (16.5%), USA (35%) and UK (20%). If the Group’s profits were taxed at the statutory rates of the countries in 
which the profits arise then the tax rate for the year would have been 20.6% (2015: 20.65%). The effective tax rate for the year was 
51.6% (2015: 20%) and was significantly higher than 2015 due to the non-deductible goodwill write-down and loss on disposal of 
Brazil, tax losses not recognised, adjustments in respect of prior periods and the 8% UK banking surcharge, which became 
applicable from 1 January 2016.
Accounting for taxes involves some estimation because the tax law is uncertain and its application requires a degree of judgement, 
which authorities may dispute. Liabilities are recognised based on best estimates of the probable outcome, taking into account 
external advice where appropriate. We do not expect significant liabilities to arise in excess of the amounts provided. HSBC only 
recognises current and deferred tax assets where recovery is probable.

2 After netting off balances within countries, the balances as disclosed in the accounts are as follows: deferred tax assets $6,163m (2015: $6,051m); and deferred tax liabilities 
$1,623m (2015: $1,760m).
3 Excludes a tax credit of $195m relating to deferred tax balances in Brazil, which were included within 'Assets held for sale' prior to disposal.
In applying judgement in recognising deferred tax assets, management has critically assessed all available information, including 
future business profit projections and the track record of meeting forecasts.
The net deferred tax asset of $4.5bn (2015: $4.3bn) includes $4.8bn (2015: $4.5bn) deferred tax assets relating to the US, of which 
$2bn deferred tax asset relates to US tax losses that expire in 16-20 years. Management expects the US deferred tax asset to be 
substantially recovered in six to seven years, with the majority recovered in the first five years. The most recent financial forecasts 
approved by management covers a five-year period and the forecasts have been extrapolated beyond five years by assuming that 
performance remains constant after the fifth year. The forecasts also include additional tax losses in 2017 – these losses expire in 
2037 and are expected to be utilised by 2023. 
The US reported a loss for the current period, mainly due to the Household International class action litigation settlement. Excluding 
the Household International class action settlement the US would have reported a profit for the current year. In addition, the US 
reported a profit in 2014 and 2015. Management does not expect the current year loss to adversely impact future deferred tax asset 
recovery to a significant extent.
The US deferred tax asset has been calculated using the current federal tax rate of 35%. Any possible future reduction of the US 
federal tax rate from 35% would reduce the value of the US deferred tax assets and create a tax charge in the period in which any 
change in the tax rate is enacted. This tax charge should be ultimately offset by the benefit of reduced US tax charges in future years.
Unrecognised deferred tax
The amount of gross temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the 
balance sheet was $18.2bn (2015: $15.5bn). These amounts included unused state losses arising in the Group’s US operations of 
$12.3bn (2015: $11.3bn). Of the total amounts unrecognised, $4.9bn (2015: $3.1bn) had no expiry date, $1.0bn (2015: $0.9bn) was 
scheduled to expire within 10 years and the remaining balance is expected to expire after 10 years.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries and branches where HSBC is able to control the 
timing of remittance or other realisation and where remittance or realisation is not probable in the foreseeable future. The aggregate 
temporary differences relating to unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on investments in subsidiaries and branches is $10.6bn  
(2015: $9.1bn) and the corresponding unrecognised deferred tax liability is $0.7bn (2015: $0.6bn). HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 215

9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent company by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is 
calculated by dividing the basic earnings, which require no adjustment for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held, plus the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that would be issued on conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares.

11 Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value
Control framework
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that they are either determined or validated by a function 
independent of the risk taker.
Where fair values are determined by reference to externally quoted prices or observable pricing inputs to models, independent price 
determination or validation is used. For inactive markets, HSBC sources alternative market information, with greater weight given to 
information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. Examples of the factors considered are price observability, instrument 
comparability, consistency of data sources, underlying data accuracy and timing of prices.
For fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework includes development or validation by independent support 
functions of the model logic, inputs, model outputs and adjustments. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence 
before becoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis. 
Changes in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process and are disaggregated into high-level categories 
including portfolio changes, market movements and other fair value adjustments.
The majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GB&M. GB&M’s fair value governance structure comprises its 
Finance function, Valuation Committees and a Valuation Committee Review Group. Finance is responsible for establishing 
procedures governing valuation and ensuring fair values are in compliance with accounting standards. The fair values are reviewed 
by the Valuation Committees, which consist of independent support functions. These Committees are overseen by the Valuation 
Committee Review Group, which considers all material subjective valuations.
Financial liabilities measured at fair value
In certain circumstances, HSBC records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific 
instrument. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for 
which are either based on quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices 
in an active market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread which is 
appropriate to HSBC’s liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Group’s own credit spread is 
computed as follows: for each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using 
credit spreads for similar securities for the same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using a Libor-based 
discount curve. The difference in the valuations is attributable to the Group’s own credit spread. This methodology is applied 
consistently across all securities.
Structured notes issued and certain other hybrid instruments are included within trading liabilities and are measured at fair value. 
The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC issues structured notes.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC reverse over the contractual life of the debt, 
provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount.
Fair value hierarchy
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy:
• Level 1 – valuation technique using quoted market price: financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in 
active markets that HSBC can access at the measurement date.
• Level 2 – valuation technique using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active 
markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models 
where all significant inputs are observable.
• Level 3 – valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where 
one or more significant inputs are unobservable.

Fair value adjustments
Fair value adjustments are adopted when HSBC determines there are additional factors considered by market participants that are 
not incorporated within the valuation model. Movements in the level of fair value adjustments do not necessarily result in the 
recognition of profits or losses within the income statement, such as when models are enhanced and fair value adjustments may no 
longer be required.

Fair value adjustments declined by $352m during the year. The most significant movement was a decline of $220m in respect of the 
credit valuation adjustment, driven by the disposal of Brazilian operations, refinements to modelling methodology and as a result of 
tightening credit spreads.
Bid-offer
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ requires use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. 
Valuation models will typically generate mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs 
would be incurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by 
disposing of or unwinding the position.
Uncertainty
Certain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data, and/or the choice of model itself may be more subjective. 
In these circumstances an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that market participants would adopt more 
conservative values for uncertain parameters and/or model assumptions than those used in HSBC’s valuation model.
Credit and debit valuation adjustments 
The CVA is an adjustment to the valuation of over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative contracts to reflect the possibility that the 
counterparty may default and that HSBC may not receive the full market value of the transactions.
The DVA is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect the possibility that HSBC may default, and that it 
may not pay the full market value of the transactions. 
HSBC calculates a separate CVA and DVA for each legal entity, and for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure. With the 
exception of central clearing parties, all third-party counterparties are included in the CVA and DVA calculations, and these 
adjustments are not netted across Group entities. 
HSBC calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default (‘PD’) of the counterparty, conditional on the non-default of HSBC, 
to HSBC’s expected positive exposure to the counterparty and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. 
Conversely, HSBC calculates the DVA by applying the PD of HSBC, conditional on the non-default of the counterparty, to the 
expected positive exposure of the counterparty to HSBC and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. 
Both calculations are performed over the life of the potential exposure.
For most products HSBC uses a simulation methodology, which incorporates a range of potential exposures over the life of the 
portfolio, to calculate the expected positive exposure to a counterparty. The simulation methodology includes credit mitigants, such 
as counterparty netting agreements and collateral agreements with the counterparty. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 219  
 
The methodologies do not, in general, account for ‘wrong-way risk’ which arises when the underlying value of the derivative prior to 
any CVA is positively correlated to the PD of the counterparty. When there is significant wrong-way risk, a trade-specific approach is 
applied to reflect this risk in the valuation.
Funding fair value adjustment
The FFVA is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of any uncollateralised 
component of the OTC derivative portfolio. The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation methodology, where 
available, and is adjusted for events that may terminate the exposure, such as the default of HSBC or the counterparty. The FFVA and 
DVA are calculated independently.
Model limitation
Models used for portfolio valuation purposes may be based upon a simplified set of assumptions that do not capture all current and 
future material market characteristics. In these circumstances, model limitation adjustments are adopted.
Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves)
Inception profit adjustments are adopted when the fair value estimated by a valuation model is based on one or more significant 
unobservable inputs. The accounting for inception profit adjustments is discussed in Note 1.

Level 3 instruments are present in both ongoing and legacy businesses. Loans held for securitisation, derivatives with monolines, 
certain ‘other derivatives’ and predominantly all Level 3 ABSs are legacy positions. HSBC has the capability to hold these positions.
Private equity including strategic investments
The investment’s fair value is estimated: on the basis of an analysis of the investee’s financial position and results, risk profile, 
prospects and other factors; by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market; or the price at which 
similar companies have changed ownership.
Asset-backed securities
While quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of these securities, valuation models are used to 
substantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to quoted market prices are 
required. For certain ABSs such as residential mortgage-backed securities, the valuation uses an industry standard model with 
assumptions relating to prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and performance, as 
appropriate. The valuations output is benchmarked for consistency against observable data for securities of a similar nature.
Structured notes
The fair value of Level 3 structured notes is derived from the fair value of the underlying debt security, and the fair value of the 
embedded derivative is determined as described in the paragraph below on derivatives. These structured notes comprise principally 
equity-linked notes issued by HSBC which provide the counterparty with a return linked to the performance of equity securities and 
other portfolios. Examples of the unobservable parameters include long-dated equity volatilities and correlations between equity 
prices, and interest and foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives
OTC derivative valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon ‘no-arbitrage’ principles. For 
many vanilla derivative products, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry. For more complex derivative 
products, there may be some differences in market practice. Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data 
wherever possible, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. Certain inputs may 
not be observable in the market directly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated 
from historical data or other sources.

The sensitivity analysis aims to measure a range of fair values consistent with the application of a 95% confidence interval. 
Methodologies take account of the nature of the valuation technique employed, as well as the availability and reliability of observable 
proxy and historical data.
When the fair value of a financial instrument is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the above table reflects the 
most favourable or the most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.

Private equity including strategic investments
Given the bespoke nature of the analysis in respect of each holding, it is not practical to quote a range of key unobservable inputs. 
Prepayment rates
Prepayment rates are a measure of the anticipated future speed at which a loan portfolio will be repaid in advance of the due date. 
They vary according to the nature of the loan portfolio and expectations of future market conditions, and may be estimated using a 
variety of evidence, such as prepayment rates implied from proxy observable security prices, current or historical prepayment rates 
and macroeconomic modelling.
Market proxy
Market proxy pricing may be used for an instrument when specific market pricing is not available but there is evidence from 
instruments with common characteristics. In some cases it might be possible to identify a specific proxy, but more generally 
evidence across a wider range of instruments will be used to understand the factors that influence current market pricing and the 
manner of that influence.
Volatility
Volatility is a measure of the anticipated future variability of a market price. It varies by underlying reference market price, and by 
strike and maturity of the option.
Certain volatilities, typically those of a longer-dated nature, are unobservable and are estimated from observable data. The range of 
unobservable volatilities reflects the wide variation in volatility inputs by reference market price. The core range is significantly 
narrower than the full range because these examples with extreme volatilities occur relatively rarely within the HSBC portfolio.
Correlation
Correlation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two market prices and is expressed as a number between minus one and 
one. It is used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market price. There is a wide 
range of instruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations and cross-
asset correlations is used. In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset 
correlations.
Unobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade 
prices, proxy correlations and examination of historical price relationships. The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table 
reflects the wide variation in correlation inputs by market price pair.
Credit spread
Credit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality. In a discounted 
cash flow model, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an 
asset. Credit spreads may be implied from market prices and may not be observable in more illiquid markets.
Inter-relationships between key unobservable inputs
Key unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments may not be independent of each other. As described above, market 
variables may be correlated. This correlation typically reflects the manner in which different markets tend to react to macroeconomic 
or other events. Furthermore, the effect of changing market variables on the HSBC portfolio will depend on HSBC’s net risk position 
in respect of each variable.

Other financial instruments not carried at fair value are typically short-term in nature and reprice to current market rates frequently. 
Accordingly, their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. They include cash and balances at central banks, 
items in the course of collection from and transmission to other banks, Hong Kong Government certificates of indebtedness and 
Hong Kong currency notes in circulation, all of which are measured at amortised cost. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 225

Valuation
Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. It does not reflect the economic benefits and costs that HSBC expects to flow 
from an instrument’s cash flow over its expected future life. Our valuation methodologies and assumptions in determining fair values 
for which no observable market prices are available may differ from those of other companies.
Loans and advances to banks and customers
To determine the fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers, loans are segregated, as far as possible, into portfolios of 
similar characteristics. Fair values are based on observable market transactions, when available. When they are unavailable, fair 
values are estimated using valuation models incorporating a range of input assumptions. These assumptions may include: value 
estimates from third-party brokers reflecting over-the-counter trading activity; forward-looking discounted cash flow models, taking 
account of expected customer prepayment rates, using assumptions that HSBC believes are consistent with those that would be 
used by market participants in valuing such loans; new business rates estimates for similar loans; and trading inputs from other 
market participants including observed primary and secondary trades. From time to time, we may engage a third party valuation 
specialist to measure the fair value of a pool of loans.
The fair value of loans reflects impairments at the balance sheet date and estimates of market participants’ expectations of credit 
losses over the life of the loans, and the fair value effect of repricing between origination and the balance sheet date. For impaired 
loans, fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows over the time period they are expected to be recovered.
Financial investments
The fair values of listed financial investments are determined using bid market prices. The fair values of unlisted financial investments 
are determined using valuation techniques that incorporate the prices and future earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities.
Deposits by banks and customer accounts
The fair values of on demand deposits are approximated by their carrying value. For deposits with longer-term maturities, fair values 
are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities
Fair values are determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date where available, or by reference to quoted market 
prices for similar instruments.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements – non-trading
Fair values approximate carrying amounts as balances are generally short dated.

disclosure are described above.

Use of derivatives
For details regarding use of derivatives, see page 116 under ‘Market Risk’.
Trading derivatives
Most of HSBC’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of 
derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities 
include market-making and risk management. Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the 
purpose of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Risk management activity is undertaken to manage the risk arising 
from client transactions, with the principal purpose of retaining client margin. Other derivatives classified as held for trading include 
non-qualifying hedging derivatives.
Substantially all of HSBC Holdings’ derivatives entered into with subsidiaries are managed in conjunction with financial liabilities 
designated at fair value.

Cash flow hedges
HSBC’s cash flow hedges consist principally of interest rate swaps, futures and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect 
against exposures to variability in future interest cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates 
or which are expected to be re-funded or reinvested in the future. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both 
principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their contractual terms 
and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate principal balances and interest cash 
flows across all portfolios over time form the basis for identifying gains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated 
as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions.

This table reflects the interest rate repricing profile of the underlying hedged items. During the year to 31 December 2016 a loss of 
$5m (2015: gain of $15m; 2014: gain of $34m) was recognised due to hedge ineffectiveness. A gain of $129m was recognised in 
respect of amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statement for partially discontinued macro cash 
flow hedges, where the hedged forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur (2015: nil; 2014: nil).
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of certain consolidated net investments. Hedging is undertaken using forward foreign 
exchange contracts or by financing with foreign currency borrowings. At 31 December 2016, the fair values of outstanding financial 
instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations were assets of $137m (2015: $111m), liabilities of $7m 
(2015: $12m) and notional contract values of $3,544m (2015: $4,210m). Ineffectiveness recognised in ‘Net trading income’ in the 
year ended 31 December 2016 was nil (2015: nil; 2014: nil). HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 229

Assets pledged as collateral include all assets categorised as encumbered in the disclosure on page 76.
The amount of assets pledged to secure liabilities may be greater than the book value of assets utilised as collateral. For example, in 
the case of securitisations and covered bonds, the amount of liabilities issued plus mandatory over-collateralisation is less than the 
book value of the pool of assets available for use as collateral. This is also the case where assets are placed with a custodian or a 
settlement agent which has a floating charge over all the assets placed to secure any liabilities under settlement accounts.
These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to collateralised transactions including, where relevant, 
standard securities lending and borrowing, repurchase agreements and derivative margining. HSBC places both cash and non-cash 
collateral in relation to derivative transactions.

Collateral received
The fair value of assets accepted as collateral, relating primarily to standard securities lending, reverse repurchase agreements and 
derivative margining, that HSBC is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was $250,919m (2015: $222,065m). The fair 
value of any such collateral sold or repledged was $149,185m (2015: $139,532m).
HSBC is obliged to return equivalent securities. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to 
standard securities lending, reverse repurchase agreements and derivative margining.
Assets transferred
The assets pledged include transfers to third parties that do not qualify for derecognition, notably secured borrowings such as debt 
securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements and equity securities lent under securities lending 
agreements. The transferred asset collateral continues to be recognised in full and a related liability, reflecting the Group’s obligation 
to repurchase the assets for a fixed price at a future date is also recognised on the balance sheet. The Group is unable to use, sell or 
pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction, and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these 
pledged assets. With the exception of ‘Other sales’ in the table below, the counterparty’s recourse is not limited to the transferred 
assets.

Bank of Communications Co., Limited
The Group’s significant influence in Bank of Communications Co., Limited (‘BoCom’) was established via representation on BoCom’s 
board of directors and a technical cooperation and exchange programme (‘TCEP’). Under the TCEP, a number of HSBC staff have 
been seconded to assist in the maintenance of BoCom’s financial and operating policies.

Impairment testing
At 31 December 2016, the fair value of HSBC’s investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately 56 
months. As a result, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount of the investment in BoCom, which confirmed 
there was no impairment at 31 December 2016.

Bank of Communications Co., Limited 16.1 15.8 10.2 17.0 15.3 9.9
Basis of recoverable amount
The impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of BoCom, determined by a value in use (‘VIU’) 
calculation, with its carrying amount. The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management’s estimates 
of earnings. Cash flows beyond the short to medium term are extrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term growth rate. An imputed 
capital maintenance charge (‘CMC’) is calculated to reflect expected regulatory capital requirements, and is deducted from forecast 
cash flows. The principal inputs to the CMC calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total 
assets, and the expected regulatory capital requirements. Management judgement is required in estimating the future cash flows of 
BoCom.
Key assumptions in value in use calculation
The assumptions we used in our VIU calculation were:
• Long-term profit growth rate 5% (2015: 5%) for periods after 2019, which does not exceed forecast GDP growth in mainland 
China.
• Long-term asset growth rate: 4% (2015: 4%) for periods after 2019, which is the rate that assets are expected to grow to achieve 
long-term profit growth of 5%.
• Discount rate: 13% (2015: 13%), which is derived from a range of values obtained by applying a capital asset pricing model 
(‘CAPM’) calculation for BoCom, using market data. Management also compares rates derived from the CAPM with discount rates 
from external sources, and HSBC’s discount rate for evaluating investments in mainland China. The discount rate used was within 
the range of 10.2% to 15.0% (2015: 10.1% to 14.2%) indicated by the CAPM and external sources.
• Loan impairment charge as a percentage of customer advances: a range from 0.72% to 0.87% (2015: 0.71% to 0.78%) in the short 
to medium term, based on forecasts disclosed by external analysts. For periods after 2019, the ratio is 0.70% (2015: 0.70%), 
slightly higher than the historical average.
• Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets: 62% for all forecast periods (2015: 67%). This is consistent with the medium-
term forecasts disclosed by external analysts.
• Cost-income ratio: 40% (2015: 41%) in the short to medium term. The ratios were consistent with the short- to medium-term 
range forecasts of 39.9% to 40.2% (2015: 40.3% to 40.7%) disclosed by external analysts.
The following table shows the change to each key assumption in the VIU calculation that on its own would reduce the headroom 
to nil.
Key assumption Changes to key assumption to reduce headroom to nil
• Long-term profit growth rate • Decrease by 13 basis points
• Long-term asset growth rate • Increase by 14 basis points
• Discount rate • Increase by 17 basis points
• Loan impairment charge as a percentage of customer advances • Increase by 3 basis points
• Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets • Increase by 95 basis points
• Cost-income ratio • Increase by 60 basis points HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 233  
 
The following table illustrates the effect on VIU of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions. This reflects the sensitivity of the 
VIU to each key assumption on its own, and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change will occur at the 
same time.

Details of the debt, subordinated debt and preference shares issued by the principal subsidiaries to parties external to the Group are 
included in Notes 25 ‘Debt securities in issue’, 28 ‘Subordinated liabilities’ and 31 ‘Non-controlling interests’, respectively.
A list of all related undertakings is set out on pages 265 to 271. The principal countries of operation are the same as the countries of 
incorporation except for HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, which operates mainly in the Middle East and North Africa, and HSBC Life 
(International) Limited, which operates mainly in Hong Kong.
HSBC is structured as a network of regional banks and locally incorporated regulated banking entities. Each bank is separately 
capitalised in accordance with applicable prudential requirements and maintains a capital buffer consistent with the Group’s risk 
appetite for the relevant country or region. HSBC’s capital management process is incorporated in the Annual Operating Plan, which 
is approved by the Board.
HSBC Holdings is the primary provider of equity capital to its subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital where 
necessary. These investments are substantially funded by HSBC Holdings’ issuance of equity and non-equity capital and by profit 
retention. As part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a balance between the composition of its 
capital and its investment in subsidiaries. Subject to this, there is no current or foreseen impediment to HSBC Holdings’ ability to 
provide funding for such investments. During 2016, consistent with the Group's capital plan, the Group’s subsidiaries did not 
experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions 
envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to 
HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange 
controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance.
The amount of guarantees by HSBC Holdings in favour of other HSBC Group entities is set out in Note 33.
Information on structured entities consolidated by HSBC where HSBC owns less than 50% of the voting rights is included in Note 19 
‘Structured entities’. In each of these cases, HSBC controls and consolidates an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

conduits and investment funds, established either by HSBC or a third party.

Conduits
HSBC has established and manages two types of conduits: securities investment conduits (‘SICs’) and multi-seller conduits. 
Securities investment conduits
The SICs purchase highly rated ABSs to facilitate tailored investment opportunities.
• Solitaire – At 31 December 2016, Solitaire, HSBC’s principal SIC held $4.7bn of ABSs (2015: $6.2bn). These are included within 
the disclosures of ABSs on page 105. It is currently funded entirely by commercial paper (‘CP’) issued to HSBC. Although HSBC 
continues to provide a liquidity facility, Solitaire has no need to draw on it as long as HSBC purchases its issued CP, which HSBC 
intends to do for the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2016, HSBC held $6.1bn of CP (2015: $8.0bn).
• Mazarin, Barion and Malachite – All three SICs are predominantly funded by repurchase agreements and medium-term notes. 
HSBC is exposed to the par value of Mazarin assets through the provision of a liquidity facility equal to the lesser of the amortised 
cost of issued debt and the amortised cost of non-defaulted assets. At 31 December 2016, this amounted to $1.0bn (2015: 
$1.8bn). HSBC’s primary exposure to Barion and Malachite is represented by the amortised cost of the debt required to support 
the non-cash assets of the vehicles. At 31 December 2016, this amounted to $0.8bn (2015: $1.4bn). For all three SICs first loss 
protection is provided through the capital notes issued by these vehicles, which are held substantially by third parties. At 
31 December 2016, HSBC held 12.2% of the capital notes (2015: 7.2%) issued by these vehicles with a par value of $69.5m 
(2015: $55.2m) and a carrying amount of $27.9m (2015: $24.7m).
Multi-seller conduit
HSBC’s multi-seller conduit was established to provide access to flexible market-based sources of finance for its clients. Currently, 
HSBC bears risk equal to the transaction-specific liquidity facility offered to the multi-seller conduit, amounting to $10.2bn at 
31 December 2016 (2015: $19.8bn). First loss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through 
transaction-specific credit enhancements. A layer of secondary loss protection is provided by HSBC in the form of programme-wide 
enhancement facilities.
Securitisations
HSBC uses structured entities to securitise customer loans and advances it originates in order to diversify its sources of funding for 
asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The loans and advances are transferred by HSBC to the structured entities for cash 
or synthetically through credit default swaps, and the structured entities issue debt securities to investors.
HSBC managed funds
HSBC has established a number of money market and non-money market funds. Where it is deemed to be acting as principal rather 
than agent in its role as investment manager, HSBC controls these funds. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 237  
 
Other
HSBC has also entered into a number of transactions in the normal course of business which include asset and structured finance 
transactions where it has control of the structured entity. In addition, HSBC is deemed to control a number of third-party managed 
funds through its involvement as a principal in the funds.
Unconsolidated structured entities
The term ‘unconsolidated structured entities’ refers to all structured entities not controlled by HSBC. The Group enters into 
transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for 
specific investment opportunities.

The maximum exposure to loss from HSBC’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities represents the maximum loss it could 
incur as a result of its involvement with these entities regardless of the probability of the loss being incurred.
• For commitments, guarantees and written credit default swaps, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of 
potential future losses.
• For retained and purchased investments in and loans to unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss is the 
carrying value of these interests at the balance sheet reporting date.
The maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate HSBC’s 
exposure to loss.
Securitisations
HSBC has interests in unconsolidated securitisation vehicles through holding notes issued by these entities. In addition, HSBC has 
investments in ABSs issued by third party structured entities as set out on page 105.
HSBC managed funds
HSBC establishes and manages money market funds and non-money market investment funds to provide customers with investment 
opportunities. Further information on funds under management is provided on page 61.
HSBC, as fund manager, may be entitled to receive management and performance fees based on the assets under management. 
HSBC may also retain units in these funds.
Non-HSBC managed funds

Impairment testing
The Group’s impairment test in respect of goodwill allocated to each cash generating unit (CGU) is performed as at 1 July each year. 
A review for indicators of impairment is undertaken at each subsequent quarter-end and as at 31 December 2016. Subsequent to the
1 July 2016 annual test the CGU for Global Banking and Markets was amended from a regional to a global basis. This change is 
discussed further below.
30 June and 31 December 2016 impairment indicators review
At 30 June 2016, we reviewed the inputs used in our 2015 impairment tests in the light of current economic and market conditions. 
As a result, impairment tests were performed for Global Private Banking – Europe and Global Banking and Markets – Europe. 
Following these tests an impairment of $0.8bn was recognised in respect of the Global Private Banking – Europe.
At 31 December 2016, we reviewed the inputs used in our 1 July 2016 impairment test and identified that indicators of impairment 
existed within the Global Private Banking – Europe CGU. There were no indicators of impairment in respect of our other CGUs at this 
time. Refreshed cash flow projections that became available for Global Private Banking – Europe were significantly adverse when 
compared to those used in the 1 July 2016 impairment test. The reduction in cash flow forecasts is driven by the continuing 
repositioning of the business and lower net new money and associated return on asset expectations. As a result, an impairment test 
was performed resulting in an impairment of $2.4bn.

Basis of the recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of all CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated was equal to its value in use (VIU) at each respective 
testing date for 2015 and 2016. For each CGU, the VIU is calculated by discounting management’s cash flow projections for the 
CGU. The key assumptions used in the VIU calculation for each significant CGU are discussed below. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 239

At 1 July 2016, aggregate goodwill of $3,025m (1 July 2015: $2,787m) had been allocated to CGUs that were not considered 
individually significant. The Group’s CGUs do not carry on their balance sheets any significant intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives, other than goodwill.
Management’s judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU: The cash flow projections for each CGU are based on plans 
approved by the GMB. For the goodwill impairment test conducted at 1 July 2016, management’s cash flow projections until the end 
of 2020 were used.
Discount rate: The rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of capital assigned to each CGU, which is derived 
using a capital asset pricing model (‘CAPM’). CAPM depends on a number of inputs reflecting financial and economic variables, 
including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on 
the market’s assessment of the economic variables and management’s judgement. The discount rates for each CGU are refined to 
reflect the rates of inflation for the countries within which the CGU operate. In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for 
impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM, 
with cost of capital rates produced by external sources for businesses operating in similar markets. For the purpose of goodwill 
testing as at 1 July 2016, all European CGUs include a 100bps uplift to reflect the increased risk in European markets following the 
UK referendum on membership of the EU.
Nominal long-term growth rate: The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the 
perspective within the Group of business units making up the CGUs. These growth rates reflect GDP and inflation for the 
countries within which the CGU operates or derives revenue from.
Global Banking and Markets CGU basis
As described on page 44, the Group has changed its operating segments from a geographical region to a global businesses basis, 
and this change prompted a review of the goodwill allocation. Following this review it has been determined that Global Banking and 
Markets should be assessed as a single CGU rather than on a regional basis reflecting the global management and customer base of 
this business. An analysis was performed and Global Banking and Markets is considered to have significant headroom to support its 
goodwill. All other CGUs remain unchanged.
Sensitivities of key assumptions in calculating VIU
At 1 July 2016, Retail Banking and Wealth Management – Europe was sensitive to reasonably possible adverse changes in the 
discount rate, growth rate or management’s projections of cash flows assumptions supporting the recoverable amount. Changes in 
one or more of these assumptions could cause an impairment to be recognised. In making an estimate of reasonably possible 
changes to assumptions, management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the model such as the external 
range of discount rates observable, historical performance against forecast and risks attaching to the key assumptions underlying 
cash flow projections.
The following table presents a summary of the key assumptions underlying the most sensitive inputs to the model for this CGU; the 
key risks attached; and details of a reasonably possible change to assumptions where, in the opinion of management, these could 
result in an impairment.

Present value of in-force long-term insurance business
When calculating the present value of in-force insurance business (‘PVIF’), expected cash flows are projected after adjusting for a 
variety of assumptions made by each insurance operation to reflect local market conditions and management’s judgement of future 
trends, and after applying risk margins to reflect any uncertainty in the underlying assumptions. Variations in actual experience and 
changes to assumptions can contribute to volatility in the results of the insurance business.
Actuarial Control Committees of each key insurance entity meet on a quarterly basis to review and approve PVIF assumptions. All 
changes to non-economic assumptions, economic assumptions that are not observable and model methodology must be approved 
by the Actuarial Control Committee.

• $301m (2015: $209m), reflecting the future sharing of returns with policyholders on contracts with discretionary participation 
features (‘DPF’), to the extent this sharing is not already included in liabilities under insurance contracts.
• $(67)m (2015: $181m), driven by other changes in assumptions and experience variances to projected future profits. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 241  
 
Key assumptions used in the computation of PVIF for main life insurance operations
Economic assumptions are set in a way that is consistent with observable market values. The valuation of PVIF is sensitive to 
observed market movements and the impact of such changes is included in the sensitivities presented below.

1 For 2016, the calculation of France’s PVIF assumes a risk discount rate of 1.84% (2015: 2.55%) plus a risk margin of $101m (2015: $51m). 
Sensitivity to changes in economic assumptions
The Group sets the risk discount rate applied to the PVIF calculation by starting from a risk-free rate curve and adding explicit 
allowances for risks not reflected in the best estimate cash flow modelling. Where the insurance operations provide options and 
guarantees to policyholders the cost of these options and guarantees is an explicit reduction to PVIF, unless it is already allowed for 
as an explicit addition to the technical provisions required by regulators. See page 123 for further details of these guarantees and the 
impact of changes in economic assumptions on our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries.
Sensitivity to changes in non-economic assumptions
Policyholder liabilities and PVIF are determined by reference to non-economic assumptions including mortality and/or morbidity, 
lapse rates and expense rates. See page 125 for further details on the impact of changes in non-economic assumptions on our 
insurance manufacturing operations.

or tribunal proceedings brought against HSBC companies (whether by way of claim or counterclaim); or civil disputes that may, if not 
settled, result in court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings. Regulatory matters refers to investigations, reviews and other actions 
carried out by, or in response to the actions of, regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with alleged wrongdoing by 
HSBC.
Customer remediation refers to HSBC’s activities to compensate customers for losses or damages associated with a failure to 
comply with regulations or to treat customers fairly. Customer remediation is often initiated by HSBC in response to customer 
complaints and/or industry developments in sales practices, and is not necessarily initiated by regulatory action. Further details of 
customer remediation are set out in this note.
Payment protection insurance
At 31 December 2016, a provision of $919m (2015: $1,039m) was held relating to the estimated liability for redress in respect of the 
possible mis-selling of payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policies in previous years. Cumulative provisions made since the Judicial 
Review ruling in the first half of 2011 amount to $5.1bn, of which $4.1bn has been paid as at 31 December 2016.
An increase in provisions of $492m was recognised during the year, primarily reflecting a delay to the inception of the expected time 
bar on inbound complaints; and an anticipated adjustment to the redress parameters surrounding ‘Plevin’ (a 2014 decision of the UK 
Supreme Court which held that, judged on its own facts, non-disclosure of the amounts of commissions payable in connection with 
the sale of PPI to a customer created an unfair relationship under the provisions of the UK Consumer Credit Act).
The estimated liability for redress is calculated on the basis of the total premiums paid by the customer plus simple interest of 8% per 
annum (or the rate inherent in the related loan product where higher). The basis for calculating the redress liability is the same for 
single premium and regular premium policies. Future estimated redress levels are based on the historically observed redress per 
policy.
A total of 5.4 million PPI policies have been sold since 2000, generating estimated revenues of $3.5bn at 2016 average exchange 
rates. The gross written premiums on these policies were approximately $4.6bn.
At 31 December 2016, the estimated total complaints expected to be received were 2.0 million, representing 37% of total policies 
sold. It is estimated that contact will be made with regard to 2.4 million policies, representing 45% of total policies sold. This 
estimate includes inbound complaints as well as the group's proactive contact exercise on certain policies (‘outbound contact’).
The following table details the cumulative number of complaints received at 31 December 2016 and the number of claims expected 
in the future:

1 Amounts owed to third parties represent securities included in the capital base of HSBC as tier 2 securities in accordance with the grandfathering provisions under CRD IV 
rules.
2 These securities are included in the capital base of HSBC as fully CRD IV compliant tier 2 securities on an end point basis.
3 The interest rate payable after October 2017 is the sum of the three-month sterling Libor plus 1.3 percentage points.
4 These subordinated notes are measured at amortised cost in HSBC Holdings, where the interest rate risk is hedged using a fair value hedge, while they are measured at fair 
value in the Group.
Additional tier 1 capital securities
Additional tier 1 capital securities are perpetual subordinated securities on which coupon payments may be deferred or cancelled at 
the discretion of HSBC Holdings. The securities presented in this Note are accounted for as liabilities because HSBC has an 
obligation to pay dividends in perpetuity. See Note 35 for additional tier 1 capital securities accounted for as equity.
The additional tier 1 securities presented in this section do not meet the identifying criteria in full for recognition as tier 1 capital 
under CRD IV but are eligible as regulatory capital subject to grandfathering limits and progressive phase-out.
Guaranteed by HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc
These capital securities were issued by the Jersey limited partnerships and proceeds lent to the respective guarantors by the limited 
partnerships in the form of subordinated notes. They qualify as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC under CRD IV by virtue of the 
application of grandfathering provisions, and the two capital securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc (‘HSBC Bank’) also qualify as 
additional tier 1 capital for HSBC Bank (on a solo and a consolidated basis) under CRD IV by virtue of the same grandfathering 
process.
These preferred securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to provide investors with economic rights equivalent to the 
rights that they would have had if they had purchased non-cumulative perpetual preference shares of the relevant issuer. There are 
limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are prohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a 
payment would cause a breach of HSBC’s capital adequacy requirements or if HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank has insufficient 
distributable reserves (as defined).
HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank have individually covenanted that if prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions 
on the preferred securities in full, they will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of their ordinary shares, or repurchase 
or redeem their ordinary shares, until the distribution on the preferred securities has been paid in full.
Preference shares of HSBC Holdings that have economic terms equal in all material respects to the preferred securities and their 
guarantee together will be substituted for the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Holdings if the total capital ratio of HSBC 
Holdings falls below the regulatory minimum required, or the Directors expect it to in the near term. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 247  
 
Preference shares of HSBC Bank that have economic terms equal in all material respects to the preferred securities and their 
guarantee together will be substituted for the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank if any of the two issues of preferred 
securities are outstanding in April 2049 or November 2048, respectively; or the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank on a solo and 
consolidated basis falls below the regulatory minimum required, or the Directors expect it to in the near term.
Tier 2 capital securities
These capital securities are included within HSBC’s regulatory capital base as tier 2 capital under CRD IV by virtue of the application 
of grandfathering provisions (with the exception of identified HSBC Holding securities which are compliant with CRD IV end point 
rules). Tier 2 capital securities are either perpetual subordinated securities or dated securities on which there is an obligation to pay 
coupons. In accordance with CRD IV, the capital contribution of all tier 2 securities is amortised for regulatory purposes in their final 
five years before maturity.
29 Maturity analysis of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments
The table on page 248 provides an analysis of consolidated total assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments by residual 
contractual maturity at the balance sheet date. These balances are included in the maturity analysis as follows:
• Trading assets and liabilities (including trading derivatives but excluding reverse repos, repos and debt securities in issue) are 
included in the ‘Due not more than 1 month’ time bucket, because trading balances are typically held for short periods of time.
• Financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity (such as equity securities) are included in the ‘Due over 5 years’ time 
bucket. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified based on the contractual notice period which the counterparty of the 
instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are included in the 
‘Due over 5 years’ time bucket.
• Non-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are included in the ‘Due over 5 years’ time bucket.
• Financial instruments included within assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale are classified on the basis of the 
contractual maturity of the underlying instruments and not on the basis of the disposal transaction.
• Liabilities under insurance contracts are included in the ‘Due over 5 years’ time bucket. Liabilities under investment contracts 
are classified in accordance with their contractual maturity. Undated investment contracts are included in the ‘Due over 5 years’ 
time bucket, however, such contracts are subject to surrender and transfer options by the policyholders.
• Loan and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.

30 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
The ‘Amounts not set off in the balance sheet’ include transactions where:
• the counterparty has an offsetting exposure with HSBC and a master netting or similar arrangement is in place with a right to set 
off only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy, or the offset criteria are otherwise not satisfied; and 
• in the case of derivatives and reverse repurchase/repurchase, stock borrowing/lending and similar agreements, cash and non-
cash collateral has been received/pledged.
For risk management purposes, the net amounts of loans and advances to customers are subject to limits, which are monitored and 
the relevant customer agreements are subject to review and updated, as necessary, to ensure that the legal right to set off remains 
appropriate.

Preferred securities issued by subsidiaries
Preferred securities are securities for which there is no obligation to pay a dividend and, if the dividend is not paid, it may not be 
cumulative. Such securities do not generally carry voting rights but rank higher than ordinary shares for dividend payments and in 
the event of a winding-up. These securities have no stated maturity date but may be called and redeemed by the issuer, subject to 
prior notification to the PRA and, where relevant, the consent of the local banking regulator.
All non-cumulative preferred securities are classified as additional tier 1 capital.

Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
254  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
HSBC Holdings non-cumulative preference shares of $0.01
HSBC Holdings pays dividends on non-cumulative preference shares of $0.01 each (‘dollar preference shares’) quarterly, at the sole 
and absolute discretion of the Board. The Board will not declare a dividend on them if this would stop the company from meeting the 
PRA’s capital adequacy requirements, or if profit available for distribution as dividends is insufficient to also pay dividends on other 
shares that are equally entitled and scheduled on the same date.
HSBC Holdings may not declare or pay dividends on shares ranking lower in the right to dividends than dollar preference shares, or 
redeem or purchase any of its other shares ranking equal or lower than dollar preference shares, unless it has fully paid, or set aside 
an amount to fully pay, the dividends on the dollar preference shares for the then current dividend period.
The dollar preference shares carry no rights to conversion into ordinary shares. Holders of dollar preference shares are only entitled 
to attend and vote at shareholder meetings if dividends on these shares have not been paid in full on four consecutive dividend 
payment dates. In such circumstances, holders of these shares are entitled to vote at shareholder meetings until HSBC Holdings has 
paid a full dividend on them. Since 16 December 2010, HSBC Holdings has been able to redeem dollar preference shares at any time, 
subject to prior notification to the PRA.
HSBC Holdings non-cumulative preference share of £0.01
The one non-cumulative sterling preference share of £0.01 (‘sterling preference share’) has been in issue since 29 December 2010 
and is held by a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. Dividends are paid quarterly at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board. The 
sterling preference share carries no rights of conversion into ordinary shares of HSBC Holdings and no rights to attend and vote at 
shareholder meetings of HSBC Holdings. HSBC Holdings may redeem it at any time. 
Other equity instruments
HSBC Holdings includes three types of additional tier 1 capital securities in its tier 1 capital. Two are presented in this Note and are 
accounted for as equity because HSBC does not have an obligation to transfer cash or a variable number of its own ordinary shares 
to holders under any circumstances outside its control. See Note 28 for additional tier 1 securities accounted for as liabilities.
Additional tier 1 capital securities
Additional tier 1 capital securities are perpetual subordinated securities on which coupon payments may be deferred at HSBC 
Holdings’ discretion. While any coupon payments are unpaid or deferred, HSBC Holdings will not declare or pay dividends or make 
distributions or similar periodic payments in respect of any securities of lower or equal rank, or repurchase or redeem them. Such 
securities do not generally carry voting rights but rank higher than ordinary shares for coupon payments, and in the event of a 
winding-up. They do not meet the identifying criteria in full for recognition as tier 1 capital under CRD IV but are eligible as regulatory 
capital subject to grandfathering limits and progressive phase-out.
At HSBC Holdings’ discretion, and subject to certain conditions being satisfied, the capital securities may be exchanged on any 
coupon payment date for non-cumulative preference shares to be issued by HSBC Holdings and ranking pari passu with the dollar 
and sterling preference shares in issue. The preference shares would be issued at a nominal value of $0.01 per share and a premium 
of $24.99 per share, with both amounts being subscribed and fully paid. These securities may be called and redeemed by HSBC 
subject to prior notification to the PRA.

Additional tier 1 capital – contingent convertible securities
During 2016, HSBC continued to issue contingent convertible securities that are included in HSBC’s capital base as fully CRD IV 
compliant additional tier 1 capital securities on an end point basis. The net proceeds of the issuances will be used for general 
corporate purposes and to further strengthen the capital base to meet requirements under CRD IV. These securities bear a fixed rate 
of interest until their initial call dates. After the initial call dates, if they are not redeemed, the securities will bear interest at rates 
fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on prevailing market rates. Interest on the contingent convertible securities 
will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of HSBC, and HSBC has sole and absolute discretion at all times to cancel for any 
reason (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any payment date. Distributions will not be paid 
if they are prohibited under UK banking regulations or if the company has insufficient reserves or fails to meet the solvency 
conditions defined in the securities’ terms.
The contingent convertible securities are undated and are repayable, at the option of HSBC, in whole at the initial call date, or on any 
fifth anniversary after this date. In addition, the securities are repayable at the option of HSBC in whole for certain regulatory or tax 
reasons. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA. These securities rank pari passu with HSBC’s dollar and sterling 
preference shares and are therefore ahead of ordinary shares. The contingent convertible securities will be converted into fully paid 
ordinary shares of HSBC at a pre-determined price, should HSBC’s consolidated end point CET1 ratio fall below 7.0%. Therefore, in 
accordance with the terms of the securities, if the end point CET1 ratio breaches the 7.0% trigger, the securities will convert into 
ordinary shares at fixed contractual conversion prices in the issuance currencies of the relevant securities, equivalent to £2.70 at the 
prevailing rate of exchange on the issuance date, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 255

fully drawn upon and clients default. As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being 
drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not indicative of future liquidity requirements.
Approximately half the guarantees have a term of less than one year, while guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject 
to HSBC’s annual credit review process. 
Contingent liabilities arising from legal proceedings, regulatory and other matters against Group companies are disclosed in Notes 27 
and 35.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (‘FSCS’) has provided compensation to consumers following the collapse of a number 
of deposit takers. The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans from HM Treasury, which at 
31 December 2016 stood at approximately £15.7bn ($19.3bn). The Group could be liable to pay a proportion of the outstanding 
amount that the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury. The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapses cannot 
currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS 
and changes in the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.
Associates
HSBC’s share of associates’ contingent liabilities amounted to $35.3bn at 31 December 2016 (2015: $39.2bn). No matters arose 
where HSBC was severally liable.

35 Legal proceedings and regulatory matters
HSBC is party to legal proceedings and regulatory matters in a number of jurisdictions arising out of its normal business operations. 
Apart from the matters described below, HSBC considers that none of these matters are material. The recognition of provisions is 
determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 1. While the outcome of legal proceedings and regulatory 
matters is inherently uncertain, management believes that, based on the information available to it, appropriate provisions have been 
made in respect of these matters as at 31 December 2016 (see Note 27). Where an individual provision is material, the fact that a 
provision has been made is stated and quantified, except to the extent doing so would be seriously prejudicial. Any provision 
recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate 
of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class of contingent liabilities.
Securities litigation
Household International, Inc. (‘Household International’) and certain former officers were named as defendants in a securities class 
action lawsuit, Jaffe v. Household International, Inc., et al., filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the 
‘Illinois District Court’) in August 2002. The complaint asserted claims under the US Securities Exchange Act and alleged that the 
defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements of material fact relating to Household International’s 
Consumer Lending operations (some of which ultimately led to a 2002 settlement with 46 states and the District of Columbia) and 
certain accounting practices, as evidenced by an August 2002 restatement of previously reported consolidated financial statements. 
A class was certified on behalf of all persons who acquired and disposed of Household International common stock between July 
1999 and October 2002. In April 2009, a jury trial was decided partly in favour of the plaintiffs and, in October 2013, the Illinois 
District Court entered a partial final judgment against the defendants in the amount of approximately $2.5bn (including pre-judgment 
interest). The defendants appealed the partial final judgment and, in May 2015, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit 
reversed the partial final judgment of the Illinois District Court and remanded the case for a new trial on loss causation.
In June 2016, HSBC reached an agreement to pay $1.6bn to settle all claims. Final court approval of the settlement and a final court 
order of dismissal with prejudice was granted in November 2016. 
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC
Bernard L. Madoff (‘Madoff’) was arrested in December 2008 and later pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi scheme. His firm, Bernard L. 
Madoff Investment Securities LLC (‘Madoff Securities’), is being liquidated in the US by a trustee (the ‘Trustee’).
Various non-US HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds incorporated outside 
the US whose assets were invested with Madoff Securities. Based on information provided by Madoff Securities, as at 30 November 
2008, the purported aggregate value of these funds was $8.4bn, including fictitious profits reported by Madoff.
Based on information available to HSBC, the funds’ actual transfers to Madoff Securities minus their actual withdrawals from Madoff 
Securities during the time HSBC serviced the funds are estimated to have totalled approximately $4bn. Various HSBC companies 
have been named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of Madoff Securities’ fraud.
US/UK litigation: The Trustee has brought lawsuits against various HSBC companies in the US Bankruptcy Court and in the English 
High Court, seeking recovery of transfers from Madoff Securities to HSBC in an amount not yet pleaded or determined. HSBC and 
other parties to the action have moved to dismiss the Trustee’s US actions. The US Bankruptcy Court granted HSBC’s motion to 
dismiss with respect to certain of the Trustee’s claims in November 2016, though this ruling is subject to appeal. 
The deadline by which the Trustee must serve HSBC with his English action has been extended to September 2017 for UK-based 
defendants and November 2017 for all other defendants.
Alpha Prime Fund Ltd (‘Alpha Prime’) and Senator Fund SPC (‘Senator’), co-defendants in one of the Trustee’s US actions, have each 
brought cross-claims against certain HSBC defendants. In December 2016, the US Bankruptcy Court granted HSBC’s motion to 
dismiss the cross-claims and Alpha Prime and Senator’s failure to appeal renders the court’s ruling final.
Fairfield Sentry Limited, Fairfield Sigma Limited and Fairfield Lambda Limited (together, ‘Fairfield’) (in liquidation since July 2009) 
have brought lawsuits in the US and the British Virgin Islands (‘BVI’) against fund shareholders, including HSBC companies that  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 257  
 
acted as nominees for clients, seeking restitution of redemption payments. In October 2016, the liquidators for Fairfield ('Fairfield 
Liquidators') filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaints in the US Bankruptcy Court. Briefing on the defendants' 
opposition to the Liquidators' motion and the defendants' own motion to dismiss is underway. In January 2017, the defendants filed 
their consolidated motion to dismiss and opposition to the Fairfield Liquidators’ motion seeking leave to amend. 
In December 2014, three additional actions were filed in the US. A purported class of direct investors in Madoff Securities asserted 
common law claims against various HSBC companies in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 
‘New York District Court’). In September 2016, the New York District Court granted HSBC’s motion to dismiss this action and the 
plaintiffs’ failure to appeal renders the court’s ruling final. Two investors in Hermes International Fund Limited (‘Hermes’) also 
asserted common law claims against various HSBC companies in the New York District Court. HSBC's motion to dismiss this action 
remains pending. In addition, SPV Optimal SUS Ltd (‘SPV OSUS’), the purported assignee of the Madoff-invested company, Optimal 
Strategic US Equity Ltd (‘Optimal’), filed a lawsuit in New York state court against various HSBC companies and others, seeking 
damages on various alleged grounds, including breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust. This action has been stayed pending the 
issuance of a potentially dispositive decision in an action initiated by Optimal regarding the validity of the assignment of its claims to 
SPV OSUS.
BVI litigation: Beginning in October 2009, the Fairfield Liquidators commenced lawsuits against fund shareholders, including HSBC 
companies that acted as nominees for clients, seeking recovery of redemption payments. In March 2016, the BVI court denied a 
motion brought by certain non-HSBC defendants challenging the Fairfield Liquidators’ authorisation to pursue their US claims, which 
those defendants have appealed. In August 2016, the Fairfield Liquidators voluntarily discontinued their actions against the HSBC 
defendants. 
Bermuda litigation: In January 2009, Kingate Global Fund Limited and Kingate Euro Fund Limited (together, ‘Kingate’) brought an 
action against HSBC Bank Bermuda Limited (‘HBBM’) for recovery of funds held in Kingate’s accounts, fees and dividends. This 
action is pending, but is not expected to move forward until the resolution of the Trustee’s US actions against Kingate and HBBM.
Thema Fund Limited (‘Thema’) and Hermes each brought three actions in 2009. The first set of actions seeks recovery of funds in 
frozen accounts held at HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Bermuda) Limited. The second set of actions asserts liability against HSBC 
Institutional Trust Services (Bermuda) Limited in relation to claims for mistake, recovery of fees and damages for breach of contract. 
The third set of actions seeks return of fees from HBBM and HSBC Securities Services (Bermuda) Limited. The parties have agreed to 
a standstill in respect of all three sets of actions.
Cayman Islands litigation: In February 2013, Primeo Fund Limited (‘Primeo’) (in liquidation since April 2009) brought an action 
against HSBC Securities Services Luxembourg (‘HSSL’) and The Bank of Bermuda (Cayman), alleging breach of contract and breach 
of fiduciary duty, and claiming damages and equitable compensation. Trial began in November 2016 and is scheduled to run until the 
end of February 2017.
Luxembourg litigation: In April 2009, Herald Fund SPC (‘Herald’) (in liquidation since July 2013) brought an action against HSSL 
before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking restitution of cash and securities Herald purportedly lost because of Madoff 
Securities’ fraud, or money damages. The Luxembourg District Court dismissed Herald’s securities restitution claim, but reserved 
Herald’s cash restitution claim and its claim for money damages. Herald has appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeal.
In March 2010, Herald (Lux) SICAV (‘Herald (Lux)’) (in liquidation since April 2009) brought an action against HSSL before the 
Luxembourg District Court seeking restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. Herald (Lux) has also 
requested the restitution of fees paid to HSSL.
In October 2009, Alpha Prime and, in December 2014, Senator, each brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District 
Court, seeking the restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. The action initiated by Senator has been 
temporarily suspended at Senator's request. In April 2015, Senator commenced an action against the Luxembourg branch of HSBC 
Bank plc asserting identical claims before the Luxembourg District Court.
HSSL has also been named as a defendant in various actions by shareholders in Primeo Select Fund, Herald, Herald (Lux), and 
Hermes. Most of these actions have been dismissed, suspended or postponed.
Ireland litigation: In November 2013, Defender Limited brought an action against HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Ireland) Limited 
(‘HTIE’) and others, alleging breach of contract and claiming damages and indemnification for fund losses. A trial date has not yet 
been scheduled.
In May 2016, following a hearing on two preliminary issues, HTIE was successful in obtaining an order dismissing two remaining 
claims by purported shareholders in Thema International Fund plc.
SPV OSUS’s action against HTIE and HSBC Securities Services (Ireland) Limited alleging breach of contract and claiming damages 
and indemnification for fund losses was dismissed in October 2015. SPV OSUS’s appeal against this first instance decision was 
heard in January 2017.
There are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of the various Madoff-
related proceedings described above, including but not limited to the multiple jurisdictions in which the proceedings have been 
brought. Based upon the information currently available, management’s estimate of possible aggregate damages that might arise as 
a result of all claims in the various Madoff-related proceedings is up to or exceeding $800m, excluding costs and interest. Due to 
uncertainties and limitations of this estimate, the ultimate damages could differ significantly from this amount.
US mortgage-related investigations
In April 2011, HSBC Bank USA N.A. (‘HSBC Bank USA’) entered into a consent order (the 'OCC Servicing Consent Order') with the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (‘OCC’), and HSBC Finance Corporation (‘HSBC Finance’) and HSBC North America 
Holdings Inc. (‘HNAH’) entered into a similar consent order with the Federal Reserve Board (‘FRB’) (together with the OCC Servicing 
Consent Order, the ‘Servicing Consent Orders’).
The Servicing Consent Orders required prescribed actions to address certain foreclosure practice deficiencies. The Servicing Consent 
Orders also required an independent foreclosure review which, pursuant to amendments to the Servicing Consent Orders in February 
2013, ceased and was replaced by a settlement under which HSBC and 12 other participating servicers agreed to provide cash 
payments and other assistance to eligible borrowers. In June 2015, the OCC issued an amended OCC Servicing Consent Order citing 
Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
258  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
the failure of HSBC Bank USA to be in compliance with all requirements of the OCC Servicing Consent Order and stating that the 
failure to satisfy all requirements of the OCC Servicing Consent Order may result in a variety of regulatory consequences for HSBC 
Bank USA, including the imposition of civil money penalties. In January 2017, the OCC terminated the OCC Servicing Consent Order, 
together with its February 2013 and June 2015 amendments, after determining that HSBC Bank USA had satisfied the requirements 
thereunder. In connection with the termination of the Servicing Consent Order, the OCC also assessed a civil money penalty against 
HSBC Bank USA finding that HSBC Bank USA failed to correct deficiencies identified under the OCC Servicing Consent Order in a 
timely fashion. 
In February 2016, HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance, HSBC Mortgage Services Inc. and HNAH entered into an agreement with the 
US Department of Justice (the ‘DoJ’), the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, other federal agencies (the ‘Federal Parties’) and the Attorneys General of 49 states and the District of Columbia (the ‘State 
Parties’) to resolve civil claims related to past residential mortgage loan origination and servicing practices (the ‘National Mortgage 
Settlement Agreement’). In addition, in February 2016, the FRB announced the imposition against HSBC Finance and HNAH of a 
$131m civil money penalty in connection with the FRB’s consent order of April 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the FRB’s civil money 
penalty order, the penalty will be satisfied through the cash payments made to the Federal Parties and the consumer relief provided 
under the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement.
The Servicing Consent Orders and the National Mortgage Settlement Agreement do not completely preclude other enforcement 
actions by regulatory, governmental or law enforcement agencies related to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices, 
including, but not limited to, matters relating to the securitisation of mortgages for investors, which could include the imposition of 
civil money penalties, criminal fines or other sanctions. In addition, these practices have in the past resulted in private litigation, and 
may result in further private litigation. 
US mortgage securitisation activity and litigation
HSBC Bank USA was a sponsor or seller of loans used to facilitate whole loan securitisations underwritten by HSBC Securities (USA) 
Inc. (‘HSI’). From 2005 to 2007, HSBC Bank USA purchased and sold approximately $24bn of such loans to HSI, which were 
subsequently securitised and sold by HSI to third parties. The outstanding principal balance was approximately $4.6bn as at 
31 December 2016. HSBC notes that the scale of its mortgage securitisation activities was more limited in relation to a number of 
other banks in the industry. In addition, HSI served as an underwriter on securitisations issued by HSBC Finance or third parties, and 
HSBC Bank USA served as trustee on behalf of various mortgage securitisation trusts.
Mortgage foreclosure and trustee matters: As the industry’s residential mortgage foreclosure issues continue, HSBC Bank USA 
has taken title to a number of foreclosed homes as trustee on behalf of various mortgage securitisation trusts. As nominal record 
owner of these properties, HSBC Bank USA has been sued by municipalities and tenants alleging various violations of law, including 
laws relating to property upkeep and tenants’ rights. While HSBC believes and continues to maintain that these obligations and any 
related liabilities are those of the servicer of each trust, HSBC continues to receive significant adverse publicity in connection with 
these and similar matters, including foreclosures that are serviced by others in the name of ‘HSBC, as trustee’.
Beginning in June 2014, a number of lawsuits were filed in state and federal court in New York and Ohio against HSBC Bank USA as 
trustee of over 320 mortgage securitisation trusts. These lawsuits are brought on behalf of the trusts by a putative class of investors 
including, among others, BlackRock and PIMCO funds. The complaints allege that the trusts have sustained losses in collateral value 
of approximately $38bn. The lawsuits seek unspecified damages resulting from alleged breaches of the US Trust Indenture Act, 
breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of contract and breach of the common law duty of trust. HSBC’s motions to dismiss in 
several of these lawsuits were, for the most part, denied.
It is not practicable to estimate the possible financial impact of these matters, as there are many factors that may affect the range of 
possible outcomes; however, the resulting financial impact could be significant.
Loan repurchase matters: HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance and Decision One Mortgage Company LLC (an indirect subsidiary of 
HSBC Finance) (‘Decision One’) have been named as defendants in various mortgage loan repurchase actions brought by trustees of 
mortgage securitisation trusts. In the aggregate, these actions seek to have the HSBC defendants repurchase mortgage loans, or pay 
compensatory damages, totalling at least $1bn. In August 2016, HSBC reached an agreement in principle to settle one of the matters 
and the other matters remain pending. 
HSBC Mortgage Corporation (USA) Inc. and Decision One have also been named as defendants in two separate actions filed by 
Residential Funding Company LLC (‘RFC’), a mortgage loan purchase counterparty, seeking unspecified damages in connection with 
approximately 25,000 mortgage loans.
It is not practicable to estimate the possible financial impact of these matters, as there are many factors that may affect the range of 
possible outcomes; however, the resulting financial impact could be significant.
FIRREA: Since 2010, various HSBC entities have received subpoenas and requests for information from the DoJ and the 
Massachusetts state Attorney General seeking the production of documents and information regarding HSBC’s involvement in 
certain RMBS transactions as an issuer, sponsor, underwriter, depositor, trustee, custodian or servicer. In November 2014, HNAH, on 
behalf of itself and various subsidiaries including, but not limited to, HSBC Bank USA, HSI Asset Securitization Corp., HSI, HSBC 
Mortgage Corporation (USA), HSBC Finance and Decision One, received a subpoena from the US Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Colorado, pursuant to the Financial Industry Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (‘FIRREA’), concerning the origination, 
financing, purchase, securitisation and servicing of subprime and non-subprime residential mortgages.
HSBC continues to cooperate with the DoJ’s investigation, which is at or nearing completion. In December 2016, HSBC had an initial 
discussion with the DoJ, wherein the DoJ stated its preliminary view that HSBC is subject to liability under FIRREA in connection 
with certain securitisations from 2005 to 2007 with respect to which HSBC Bank USA served as sponsor or seller of loans and HSI 
served as underwriter. HSBC disagrees with the DoJ’s preliminary view, and the DoJ has offered HSBC an opportunity to respond. 
There can be no assurance as to how or when this matter will be resolved, or whether this matter will be resolved prior to the 
institution of formal legal proceedings by the DoJ. Moreover, it is possible that any such resolution could result in significant 
penalties and other costs. To date, at least one bank has been sued by the DoJ and at least eight other banks have reported 
settlements of mortgage-backed securities-related matters pursuant to FIRREA. The prior DoJ settlements provide no clear guidance 
as to how those individual settlement amounts were calculated, and due to the high degree of uncertainty involved, it is not 
practicable to estimate any possible financial effect of this matter, which could be significant.  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 259  
 
HSBC expects the focus on mortgage securitisations to continue and may be subject to additional claims, litigation and 
governmental or regulatory scrutiny relating to its participation in the US mortgage securitisation market.
Anti-money laundering and sanctions-related matters
In October 2010, HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent order with the OCC, and HNAH entered into a consent order with the 
FRB (each an ‘Order’ and together, the ‘Orders’). These Orders required improvements to establish an effective compliance risk 
management programme across HSBC’s US businesses, including risk management related to the Bank Secrecy Act (‘BSA’) and 
AML compliance. HSBC Bank USA is not currently in compliance with the OCC Order. Steps are being taken to address the 
requirements of the Orders.
In December 2012, HSBC Holdings, HNAH and HSBC Bank USA entered into agreements with US and UK government agencies 
regarding past inadequate compliance with the BSA, AML and sanctions laws. Among those agreements, HSBC Holdings and HSBC 
Bank USA entered into a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with, among others, the DoJ (the ‘US DPA’); and HSBC Holdings 
consented to a cease-and-desist order, and HSBC Holdings and HNAH consented to a civil money penalty order with the FRB. HSBC 
Holdings also entered into an agreement with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (‘OFAC’) regarding historical transactions involving 
parties subject to OFAC sanctions, as well as an undertaking with the UK FCA to comply with certain forward-looking AML and 
sanctions-related obligations. In addition, HSBC Bank USA entered into civil money penalty orders with the Financial Crimes 
Enforcement Network of the US Treasury Department and the OCC.
Under these agreements, HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank USA made payments totalling $1.9bn to US authorities and undertook 
various further obligations, including, among others, to continue to cooperate fully with the DoJ in any and all investigations, not to 
commit any crime under US federal law subsequent to the signing of the agreement, and to retain an independent compliance 
monitor (the ‘Monitor’). In February 2017, the Monitor delivered his third annual follow-up review report.
Through his country-level reviews, the Monitor identified potential anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance issues that the 
DoJ and HSBC are reviewing further. Additionally, as discussed elsewhere in this Note, HSBC is the subject of other ongoing 
investigations and reviews by the DoJ. HSBC Bank plc is also the subject of an investigation by the FCA into its compliance with UK 
money laundering regulations and financial crime systems and controls requirements. The potential consequences of breaching the 
US DPA, as well as the role of the Monitor and his third annual review, are discussed on page 82.
HSBC Bank USA also entered into two consent orders with the OCC. These required HSBC Bank USA to correct the circumstances 
noted in the OCC’s report and to adopt an enterprise-wide compliance programme, and imposed restrictions on acquiring control of, 
or holding an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, or commencing a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, without the 
OCC’s prior approval.
These settlements with US and UK authorities have led to private litigation, and do not preclude further private litigation related to 
HSBC’s compliance with applicable BSA, AML and sanctions laws or other regulatory or law enforcement actions for BSA, AML, 
sanctions or other matters not covered by the various agreements.
In May 2014, a shareholder derivative action was filed by a shareholder of HSBC Holdings purportedly on behalf of HSBC Holdings, 
HSBC Bank USA, HNAH and HSBC USA Inc. (the ‘Nominal Corporate Defendants’) in New York state court against certain current 
and former directors and officers of those HSBC companies (the ‘Individual Defendants’). The complaint alleges that the Individual 
Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Nominal Corporate Defendants and caused a waste of corporate assets by allegedly 
permitting and/or causing the conduct underlying the US DPA. In November 2015, the New York state court granted the Nominal 
Corporate Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The plaintiff has appealed that decision. 
In July 2014, a claim was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against HSBC Holdings and a former employee purportedly on 
behalf of a class of persons who purchased HSBC common shares and American Depositary Shares between July 2006 and July 
2012. The complaint, which seeks monetary damages of up to CA$20bn, alleges that the defendants made statutory and common 
law misrepresentations in documents released by HSBC Holdings and its wholly owned indirect subsidiary, HSBC Bank Canada, 
relating to HSBC’s compliance with BSA, AML, sanctions and other laws. 
Since November 2014, four lawsuits have been filed in federal court in New York, Illinois and Texas, against various HSBC companies 
and others, on behalf of plaintiffs who are, or are related to, victims of terrorist attacks in Iraq, Jordan and Mexico. In each case, it is 
alleged that the defendants aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of various sanctioned parties in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism 
Act. These actions are at an early stage.
Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these lawsuits, including 
the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.
Tax-related investigations
Various tax administration, regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the US, France, Belgium, 
Argentina and India, are conducting investigations and reviews of HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA (‘HSBC Swiss Private Bank’) and 
other HSBC companies in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money laundering and unlawful cross-border 
banking solicitation. 
HSBC continues to cooperate in ongoing investigations by the DoJ and the US Internal Revenue Service regarding whether certain 
HSBC companies and employees, including those associated with HSBC Swiss Private Bank and an HSBC company in India, acted 
appropriately in relation to certain customers who had US tax reporting obligations. In connection with these investigations, HSBC 
Swiss Private Bank, with due regard for Swiss law, has produced records and other documents to the DoJ. In August 2013, the DoJ 
informed HSBC Swiss Private Bank that it was not eligible for the ‘Program for Non-Prosecution Agreements or Non-Target Letters 
for Swiss Banks’ since a formal investigation had previously been authorised.
In November 2014, HSBC Swiss Private Bank was placed under formal criminal examination in Belgium for alleged tax-related 
offences. In November 2014, HSBC Swiss Private Bank was also placed under formal criminal examination in France for alleged tax-
related offences in 2006 and 2007 and required to pay bail of €50m. In April 2015, HSBC Holdings was informed that it had been 
placed under formal criminal examination in France in connection with the conduct of HSBC Swiss Private Bank, and a €1bn bail was 
imposed. HSBC Holdings appealed the bail decision and, in June 2015, bail was reduced to €100m. The ultimate financial impact of 
these matters could differ significantly, however, from the bail amounts of €150m. In March 2016, HSBC was informed that the 
Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
260  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
French magistrates had completed their investigation with respect to HSBC Swiss Private Bank and HSBC Holdings, and have 
referred the matter to the French public prosecutor for a recommendation on any potential charges. In October 2016, HSBC Swiss 
Private Bank and HSBC Holdings received the French public prosecutor`s brief in which the prosecutor recommended the judge to 
refer the cases to trial, and HSBC Swiss Private Bank and HSBC Holdings have responded to the prosecutor’s brief. 
In November 2014, the Argentine tax authority initiated a criminal action against various individuals, including current and former 
HSBC employees. The criminal action includes allegations of tax evasion, conspiracy to launder undeclared funds and an unlawful 
association among HSBC Swiss Private Bank, HSBC Bank Argentina, HSBC Bank USA and certain HSBC employees, which allegedly 
enabled numerous HSBC customers to evade their Argentine tax obligations.
In February 2015, the Indian tax authority issued a summons and request for information to an HSBC company in India. In August 
2015 and November 2015, HSBC companies received notices issued by two offices of the Indian tax authority, alleging that the 
Indian tax authority had sufficient evidence to initiate prosecution against HSBC Swiss Private Bank and an HSBC company in Dubai 
for allegedly abetting tax evasion of four different Indian individuals and/or families and requesting that the HSBC companies show 
why such prosecution should not be initiated. HSBC Swiss Private Bank and the HSBC company in Dubai have responded to the 
show cause notices.
HSBC is cooperating with the relevant authorities. As at 31 December 2016, HSBC has recognised a provision for these various 
matters in the amount of $773m. There are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, 
of these investigations and reviews. Due to uncertainties and limitations of these estimates, the ultimate penalties could differ 
significantly from the amount provided.
In light of the media attention regarding these matters, it is possible that other tax administration, regulatory or law enforcement 
authorities will also initiate or enlarge similar investigations or regulatory proceedings.
Mossack Fonseca & Co.
HSBC has received requests for information from various regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world concerning 
persons and entities believed to be linked to Mossack Fonseca & Co., a service provider of personal investment companies. HSBC is 
cooperating with the relevant authorities.
Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the 
timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.
London interbank offered rates, European interbank offered rates and other benchmark interest rate 
investigations and litigation
Various regulators and competition and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the UK, the US, the EU and 
Switzerland, are conducting investigations and reviews related to certain past submissions made by panel banks and the processes 
for making submissions in connection with the setting of Libor, Euribor and other benchmark interest rates. As certain HSBC 
companies are members of such panels, HSBC has been the subject of regulatory demands for information and is cooperating with 
those investigations and reviews.
In December 2016, the European Commission (the ‘Commission’) issued a decision finding that HSBC, among other banks, engaged 
in anti-competitive practices in connection with the pricing of euro interest rate derivatives in early 2007. The Commission 
determined that the duration of HSBC’s infringement was 1 month and fined HSBC. HSBC has appealed the decision.
US dollar Libor: Beginning in 2011, HSBC and other panel banks have been named as defendants in a number of private lawsuits 
filed in the US with respect to the setting of US dollar Libor. The complaints assert claims under various US laws, including US 
antitrust and racketeering laws, the US Commodity Exchange Act (‘US CEA’), and state law. The lawsuits include individual and 
putative class actions, most of which have been transferred and/or consolidated for pre-trial purposes before the New York District 
Court.
The New York District Court has issued decisions dismissing certain of the claims in response to motions filed by the defendants. 
Those decisions resulted in the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ federal and state antitrust claims, racketeering claims, and unjust 
enrichment claims. Dismissal of certain of these claims was appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which 
reversed the New York District Court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ antitrust claims in May 2016. In July 2016, defendants filed a joint 
motion to dismiss all antitrust claims and, in December 2016, the New York District Court granted in part and denied in part the 
motion, leaving only certain antitrust claims to be litigated. Separately, in October 2016, the New York District Court granted a 
motion to dismiss claims brought by an individual plaintiff for lack of personal jurisdiction, which dismissal is currently on appeal to 
the Second Circuit. Finally, in January 2017, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss certain of the remaining 
antitrust claims against defendants that did not serve on the US dollar Libor submission panel.
Euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate (‘Tibor’) and/or Japanese yen Libor: In April 2012 and July 2015, HSBC and other panel 
banks were named as defendants in putative class actions filed in the New York District Court on behalf of persons who transacted in 
financial instruments allegedly related to the euroyen Tibor and/or Japanese yen Libor. The complaints allege, among other things, 
misconduct related to euroyen Tibor, although HSBC is not a member of the Japanese Bankers Association’s euroyen Tibor panel, as 
well as Japanese yen Libor, in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA, and state law. In May 2016, HSBC reached an agreement in 
principle with plaintiffs to resolve both of these actions, and the settlement was granted final court approval in November 2016.
Euribor: In November 2013, HSBC and other panel banks were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the New York 
District Court on behalf of persons who transacted in euro futures contracts and other financial instruments allegedly related to 
Euribor. The complaint alleges, among other things, misconduct related to Euribor in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and 
state law. In May 2016, HSBC reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs to resolve this action, subject to court approval.
Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (‘SIBOR’), Singapore Swap Offer Rate (‘SOR’) and Australia Bank Bill Swap Rate 
('BBSW'): In July 2016 and August 2016, HSBC and other panel banks were named as defendants in two putative class actions filed 
in the New York District Court on behalf of persons who transacted in products related to the SIBOR, SOR and BBSW benchmark 
rates. The complaints allege, among other things, misconduct related to these benchmark rates in violation of US antitrust, 
commodities and racketeering laws, and state law. These matters are at an early stage. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 261  
 
US dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association fix (‘ISDAfix’): In September 2014, HSBC and other panel banks 
were named as defendants in a number of putative class actions consolidated in the New York District Court on behalf of persons 
who transacted in interest rate derivatives or purchased or sold financial instruments that were either tied to ISDAfix rates or were 
executed shortly before, during, or after the time of the daily ISDAfix setting window. The consolidated complaint alleges, among 
other things, misconduct related to these activities in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and state law. HSBC’s motion to 
dismiss the complaint was denied in March 2016.
There are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters, which could be 
significant.
Foreign exchange rate investigations and litigation
Various regulators and competition and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the US, the EU, Switzerland, 
Brazil, South Korea and South Africa are conducting investigations and reviews into trading by HSBC and others on the foreign 
exchange markets. HSBC is cooperating with these investigations and reviews.
In May 2015, the DoJ resolved its investigations with respect to five non-HSBC financial institutions, four of whom agreed to plead 
guilty to criminal charges of conspiring to manipulate prices in the foreign exchange spot market, and resulting in the imposition of 
criminal fines in the aggregate of more than $2.5bn. Additional penalties were imposed at the same time by the FRB and other 
banking regulators. HSBC was not a party to these resolutions. In August 2016, the DoJ indicted one current and one former HSBC 
employee and charged them with wire fraud and conspiracy relating to a 2011 foreign exchange transaction. The trial is currently 
scheduled to begin in September 2017. HSBC was not named as a defendant in the indictment, and investigations into HSBC by the 
DoJ, FRB and others continue.
In December 2016, HSBC Bank plc entered into a settlement with Brazil’s Administrative Council of Economic Defense (‘CADE’) in 
connection with its investigation into 15 banks, including HSBC Bank plc, as well as 30 individuals, relating to practices in the 
offshore foreign exchange market. Under the terms of the settlement, HSBC Bank plc agreed to pay a financial penalty to CADE.
In February 2017, the Competition Commission of South Africa referred a complaint for proceedings before the South African 
Competition Tribunal against 18 financial institutions, including HSBC Bank plc, for alleged misconduct related to the foreign 
exchange market in violation of South African antitrust laws. These proceedings are at an early stage. 
In late 2013 and early 2014, HSBC and other banks were named as defendants in various putative class actions consolidated in the 
New York District Court. The consolidated complaint alleged, among other things, that the defendants conspired to manipulate the 
WM/Reuters foreign exchange benchmark rates. In September 2015, HSBC reached an agreement with plaintiffs to resolve the 
consolidated action, subject to court approval. In December 2015, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, and 
HSBC made payment of the agreed settlement amount into an escrow account. The final settlement approval hearing is scheduled 
for October 2017. 
In June 2015, a putative class action was filed in the New York District Court making similar allegations on behalf of Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (‘ERISA’) plan participants, and another complaint was filed in the US District Court for the 
Northern District of California in May 2015. The court dismissed the claims in the ERISA action, and the plaintiffs have appealed to 
the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. HSBC filed a motion to transfer the California action to New York, which was granted 
in November 2015. In September 2016, a putative class action making similar allegations on behalf of purported ‘indirect’ purchasers 
of foreign exchange products was filed in New York. This action is at an early stage. 
In September 2015, two additional putative class actions making similar allegations under Canadian law were issued in Canada 
against various HSBC companies and other financial institutions. 
As at 31 December 2016, HSBC has recognised a provision for these various matters in the amount of $1.2bn. There are many 
factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters. Due to uncertainties and 
limitations of these estimates, the ultimate penalties could differ significantly from the amount provided.
Precious metals fix-related investigations and litigation
Various regulators and competition and law enforcement authorities, including in the US and the EU, are conducting investigations 
and reviews relating to HSBC’s precious metals operations and trading. HSBC is cooperating with these investigations and reviews. 
In November 2014, the Antitrust Division and Criminal Fraud Section of the DoJ issued a document request to HSBC Holdings, 
seeking the voluntary production of certain documents in connection with a criminal investigation that the DoJ is conducting of 
alleged anti-competitive and manipulative conduct in precious metals trading. In January 2016, the Antitrust Division of the DoJ 
informed HSBC that it was closing its investigation; however, the Criminal Fraud Section’s investigation remains ongoing.
Gold: Beginning in March 2014, numerous putative class actions were filed in the New York District Court and the US District Courts 
for the District of New Jersey and the Northern District of California, naming HSBC and other members of The London Gold Market 
Fixing Limited as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2004 to the present, defendants conspired to manipulate the 
price of gold and gold derivatives for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and New York state law. The 
actions were consolidated in the New York District Court. Defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated action was granted in part 
and denied in part in October 2016.
In December 2015, a putative class action under Canadian law was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against various 
HSBC companies and other financial institutions. Plaintiffs allege that, among other things, from January 2004 to March 2014, 
defendants conspired to manipulate the price of gold and gold derivatives in violation of the Canadian Competition Act and common 
law. This action is at an early stage.
Silver: Beginning in July 2014, numerous putative class actions were filed in the US District Courts for the Southern and Eastern 
Districts of New York, naming HSBC and other members of The London Silver Market Fixing Ltd as defendants. The complaints 
allege that, from January 1999 to the present, defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver and silver derivatives for their 
collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and New York state law. The actions were consolidated in the New 
York District Court. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated action was granted in part and denied in part in October 2016.
In April 2016, two putative class actions under Canadian law were filed in the Ontario and Quebec Superior Courts of Justice against 
various HSBC companies and other financial institutions. Plaintiffs in both actions allege that, from January 1999 to August 2014, 
Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Shareholder Information Financial Statements  Notes on the Financial Statements
262  HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver and silver derivatives in violation of the Canadian Competition Act and 
common law. The Ontario action is at an early stage. The Quebec action has been temporarily stayed.
Platinum and palladium: Between late 2014 and early 2015, numerous putative class actions were filed in the New York District 
Court, naming HSBC and other members of The London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Limited as defendants. The 
complaints allege that, from January 2008 to the present, defendants conspired to manipulate the price of platinum group metals 
(‘PGM’) and PGM-based financial products for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws and the US CEA. Defendants 
have moved to dismiss the action.
There are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters, which could be 
significant.
Credit default swap litigation
Various HSBC companies, among other financial institutions, ISDA, and Markit, were named as defendants in numerous putative 
class actions filed in the New York District Court and the Illinois District Court. The actions alleged that the defendants violated 
US antitrust laws by, among other things, conspiring to restrict access to credit default swap pricing exchanges and block new 
entrants into the exchange market. The actions were subsequently consolidated in the New York District Court. In September 2015, 
the HSBC defendants reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to resolve the consolidated action, and final court approval of that 
settlement was granted in April 2016. 
Treasury auctions
Beginning in July 2015, HSI, amongst other financial institutions, was named as a defendant in several putative class actions filed in 
the New York District Court. The complaints generally allege that the defendants violated US antitrust laws and the US CEA by 
colluding to manipulate prices of US Treasury securities sold at auction. The cases have been consolidated in the New York District 
Court. This matter is at an early stage.
The DoJ has requested information from HSBC and reportedly other banks regarding US Treasury securities trading practices. HSBC 
is cooperating with this ongoing investigation. 
Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the 
timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.
Interest rate swap litigation
In February 2016, various HSBC companies, among others, were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the New 
York District Court. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated US antitrust laws by, among other things, conspiring to 
boycott and eliminate various entities and practices that would have brought exchange trading to buy-side investors in the interest 
rate swaps marketplace. In June 2016, this action along with other complaints filed in the New York District Court and the Illinois 
District Court were consolidated in the New York District Court, and in January 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. This 
matter is at an early stage.
Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the 
timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.
Fédération Internationale de Football Association (‘FIFA’) related investigations
HSBC has received inquiries from the DoJ regarding its banking relationships with certain individuals and entities that are or may be 
associated with FIFA. The DoJ is investigating whether multiple financial institutions, including HSBC, permitted the processing of 
suspicious or otherwise improper transactions, or failed to observe applicable AML laws and regulations. HSBC is cooperating with 
the DoJ’s investigation.
Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the 
timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.
Hiring practices investigation
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’) is investigating multiple financial institutions, including HSBC, in relation to 
hiring practices of candidates referred by or related to government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises in Asia-Pacific. 
HSBC has received various requests for information and is cooperating with the SEC’s investigation.
Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of this matter, including the 
timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.

Taxation of shares and dividends
Taxation – UK residents
The following is a summary, under current law, of certain UK tax 
considerations that are likely to be material to the ownership 
and disposition of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares. The 
summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of 
all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of 
shares. In particular, the summary deals with shareholders who 
are resident solely in the UK for UK tax purposes and only with 
holders who hold the shares as investments and who are the 
beneficial owners of the shares, and does not address the tax 
treatment of certain classes of holders such as dealers in 
securities. Holders and prospective purchasers should consult 
their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an 
investment in shares in light of their particular circumstances, 
including the effect of any national, state or local laws.
Taxation of dividends
Currently, no tax is withheld from dividends paid by
HSBC Holdings.
UK resident individuals
With effect for the tax year beginning 6 April 2016, UK resident 
individuals are given an annual tax-free allowance of £5,000 on 
dividend income. To the extent that dividend income received by 
an individual in the relevant tax year does not exceed the 
allowance, a nil tax rate will apply. Dividend income in excess of 
this allowance will be taxed at 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 
32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate 
taxpayers.
UK resident companies 
Shareholders that are within the charge to UK corporation 
tax should generally be entitled to an exemption from UK 
corporation tax on any dividends received from HSBC Holdings. 
However, the exemptions are not comprehensive and are 
subject to anti-avoidance rules. 
If the conditions for exemption are not met or cease to be 
satisfied, or a shareholder within the charge to UK corporation 
tax elects for an otherwise exempt dividend to be taxable, the 
shareholder will be subject to UK corporation tax on dividends 
received from HSBC Holdings at the rate of corporation tax 
applicable to that shareholder.
Scrip dividends
Information on the taxation consequences of the HSBC 
Holdings scrip dividends offered in lieu of the 2015 fourth 
interim dividend and the first, second and third interim 
dividends for 2016 was set out in the Secretary’s letters to 
shareholders of 18 March, 3 June, 25 August and 3 November 
2016. In no case was the difference between the cash dividend 
forgone and the market value of the scrip dividend in excess of 
15% of the market value. Accordingly, for individual 
shareholders, the amount of the dividend income chargeable to 
tax, and, the acquisition price of the HSBC Holdings ordinary 
shares for UK capital gains tax purposes, was the cash dividend 
forgone.
Taxation of capital gains
The computation of the capital gains tax liability arising on 
disposals of shares in HSBC Holdings by shareholders subject 
to UK tax on capital gains can be complex, partly depending on 
whether, for example, the shares were purchased since April 
1991, acquired in 1991 in exchange for shares in The Hongkong 
and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, or acquired 
subsequent to 1991 in exchange for shares in other companies.
For capital gains tax purposes, the acquisition cost for ordinary 
shares is adjusted to take account of subsequent rights and 
capitalisation issues. Any capital gain arising on a disposal by a 
UK company may also be adjusted to take account of indexation 
allowance. If in doubt, shareholders are recommended to 
consult their professional advisers.
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Transfers of shares by a written instrument of transfer generally 
will be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% of the 
consideration paid for the transfer (rounded up to the next £5), 
and such stamp duty is generally payable by the transferee. An 
agreement to transfer shares, or any interest therein, normally 
will give rise to a charge to stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 
0.5% of the consideration. However, provided an instrument of 
transfer of the shares is executed pursuant to the agreement 
and duly stamped before the date on which the stamp duty 
reserve tax becomes payable, under the current practice of UK 
HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) it will not be necessary to 
pay the stamp duty reserve tax, nor to apply for such tax to be 
cancelled. Stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable by the 
transferee.
Paperless transfers of shares within CREST, the UK’s paperless 
share transfer system, are liable to stamp duty reserve tax at the 
rate of 0.5% of the consideration. In CREST transactions, the tax 
is calculated and payment made automatically. Deposits of 
shares into CREST generally will not be subject to stamp duty 
reserve tax, unless the transfer into CREST is itself for 
consideration. Following the case HSBC pursued before the 
European Court of Justice (Case C-569/07 HSBC Holdings plc 
and Vidacos Nominees Ltd v The Commissioners for HM 
Revenue & Customs) and a subsequent case in relation to 
depositary receipts, HMRC now accepts that the charge to 
stamp duty reserve tax at 1.5% on the issue of shares to a 
depositary receipt issuer or a clearance service is prohibited.
Taxation – US residents
The following is a summary, under current law, of the principal 
UK tax and US federal income tax considerations that are likely 
to be material to the ownership and disposition of shares or 
American Depositary Shares (‘ADS’s) by a holder that is a 
resident of the US for US federal income tax purposes (a ‘US 
holder’) and who is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes.
The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive 
description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant 
to a holder of shares or ADSs. In particular, the summary deals 
only with US holders that hold shares or ADSs as capital assets, 
and does not address the tax treatment of holders that are 
subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt entities, 
insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, 
persons that hold shares or ADSs as part of an integrated 
investment (including a ‘straddle’) comprised of a share or ADS 
and one or more other positions, and persons that own, directly 
or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of HSBC 
Holdings. This discussion is based on laws, treaties, judicial 
decisions and regulatory interpretations in effect on the date 
hereof, all of which are subject to change.
Holders and prospective purchasers should consult their own 
advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in 
shares or ADSs in light of their particular circumstances, 
including the effect of any national, state or local laws.
Any US federal tax advice included in this Annual Report and 
Accounts is for informational purposes only; it was not intended 
or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of 
avoiding US federal tax penalties.
Taxation of dividends
Currently, no tax is withheld from dividends paid by HSBC 
Holdings. For US tax purposes, a US holder must include cash 
dividends paid on the shares or ADSs in ordinary income on the 
date that such holder or the ADS depositary receives them, 
translating dividends paid in UK pounds sterling into US dollars 
using the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. A US 
holder that elects to receive shares in lieu of a cash dividend 
must include in ordinary income the fair market value of such 
Strategic Report Financial Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information  Shareholder information
278 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
shares on the dividend payment date, and the tax basis of those 
shares will equal such fair market value.
Subject to certain exceptions for positions that are held for less 
than 61 days or are hedged, and subject to a foreign corporation 
being considered a ‘qualified foreign corporation’ (which 
includes not being classified for US federal income tax purposes 
as a passive foreign investment company), certain dividends 
(‘qualified dividends’) received by an individual US holder 
generally will be subject to US taxation at preferential rates. 
Based on the company’s audited financial statements and 
relevant market and shareholder data, HSBC Holdings does not 
anticipate being classified as a passive foreign investment 
company. Accordingly, dividends paid on the shares or ADSs 
generally should be treated as qualified dividends.
Taxation of capital gains
Gains realised by a US holder on the sale or other disposition of 
shares or ADSs normally will not be subject to UK taxation 
unless at the time of the sale or other disposition the holder 
carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a 
branch or agency or permanent establishment and the shares or 
ADSs are or have been used, held or acquired for the purposes 
of such trade, profession, vocation, branch or agency or 
permanent establishment. Such gains will be included in 
income for US tax purposes, and will be long- term capital gains 
if the shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. A long-
term capital gain realised by an individual US holder generally 
will be subject to US tax at preferential rates.
Inheritance tax
Shares or ADSs held by an individual whose domicile is 
determined to be the US for the purposes of the United States-
United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention relating to estate 
and gift taxes (the ‘Estate Tax Treaty’) and who is not for such 
purposes a national of the UK will not, provided any US federal 
estate or gift tax chargeable has been paid, be subject to UK 
inheritance tax on the individual’s death or on a lifetime transfer 
of shares or ADSs except in certain cases where the shares or 
ADSs (i) are comprised in a settlement (unless, at the time of 
the settlement, the settlor was domiciled in the US and was not 
a national of the UK), (ii) are part of the business property of a 
UK permanent establishment of an enterprise, or (iii) pertain to a 
UK fixed base of an individual used for the performance of 
independent personal services. In such cases, the Estate Tax 
Treaty generally provides a credit against US federal tax liability 
for the amount of any tax paid in the UK in a case where the 
shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to 
US federal estate or gift tax.
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax – ADSs
If shares are transferred to a clearance service or American 
Depositary Receipt (‘ADR’) issuer (which will include a transfer 
of shares to the Depositary) under the current HMRC practice 
UK stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable. 
The stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable 
on the consideration for the transfer and is payable at the 
aggregate rate of 1.5%.
The amount of stamp duty reserve tax payable on such a 
transfer will be reduced by any stamp duty paid in connection 
with the same transfer.
No stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of, or agreement 
to transfer, an ADS, provided that the ADR and any separate 
instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remain 
at all times outside the UK, and provided further that any such 
transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the 
UK. No stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on a transfer of, 
or agreement to transfer, an ADS effected by the transfer of an 
ADR.
US backup withholding tax and information reporting
Distributions made on shares or ADSs and proceeds from the 
sale of shares or ADSs that are paid within the US, or through 
certain financial intermediaries to US holders, are subject to 
information reporting and may be subject to a US ‘backup’ 
withholding tax unless, in general, the US holder complies with 
certain certification procedures or is a corporation or other 
person exempt from such withholding. Holders that are not US 
persons generally are not subject to information reporting or 
backup withholding tax, but may be required to comply with 
applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not 
US persons in order to avoid the application of such information 
reporting requirements or backup withholding tax to payments 
received within the US or through certain financial 
intermediaries. HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 279
Cautionary statement regarding 
forward-looking statements
The Annual Report and Accounts 2016 contains certain forward-
looking statements with respect to HSBC’s financial condition, 
results of operations and business.
Statements that are not historical facts, including statements 
about HSBC’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking 
statements. Words such as ‘expects’, ‘targets’, ‘anticipates’, 
‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’, ‘seeks’, ‘estimates’, ‘potential’ and 
‘reasonably possible’, variations of these words and similar 
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
These statements are based on current plans, estimates and 
projections, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed 
on them. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date 
they are made. HSBC makes no commitment to revise or 
update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or 
circumstances occurring or existing after the date of any 
forward-looking statements.
Written and/or oral forward-looking statements may also be 
made in the periodic reports to the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission, summary financial statements to shareholders, 
proxy statements, offering circulars and prospectuses, press 
releases and other written materials, and in oral statements 
made by HSBC’s Directors, officers or employees to third 
parties, including financial analysts.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and 
uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that a number of factors 
could cause actual results to differ, in some instances 
materially, from those anticipated or implied in any forward-
looking statement. These include, but are not limited to: 
• Changes in general economic conditions in the markets 
in which we operate, such as continuing or deepening 
recessions and fluctuations in employment beyond those 
factored into consensus forecasts; changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates; volatility in equity 
markets; lack of liquidity in wholesale funding markets; 
illiquidity and downward price pressure in national real 
estate markets; adverse changes in central banks’ policies 
with respect to the provision of liquidity support to financial 
markets; heightened market concerns over sovereign 
creditworthiness in over-indebted countries; adverse 
changes in the funding status of public or private defined 
benefit pensions; and consumer perception as to the 
continuing availability of credit and price competition in 
the market segments we serve.
• Changes in government policy and regulation, including the 
monetary, interest rate and other policies of central banks 
and other regulatory authorities; initiatives to change the 
size, scope of activities and interconnectedness of financial 
institutions in connection with the implementation of stricter 
regulation of financial institutions in key markets worldwide; 
revised capital and liquidity benchmarks which could serve 
to deleverage bank balance sheets and lower returns 
available from the current business model and portfolio mix; 
imposition of levies or taxes designed to change business 
mix and risk appetite; the practices, pricing or 
responsibilities of financial institutions serving their 
 consumer markets; expropriation, nationalisation, 
confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating 
to foreign ownership; changes in bankruptcy legislation in 
the principal markets in which we operate and the 
consequences thereof; general changes in government 
policy that may significantly influence investor decisions; 
extraordinary government actions as a result of current 
market turmoil; other unfavourable political or diplomatic 
developments producing social instability or legal 
uncertainty which in turn may affect demand for our 
products and services; the costs, effects and outcomes of 
product regulatory reviews, actions or litigation, including 
any additional compliance requirements; and the effects of 
competition in the markets where we operate including 
increased competition from non-bank financial services 
companies, including securities firms.
• Factors specific to HSBC, including our success in 
adequately identifying the risks we face, such as the 
incidence of loan losses or delinquency, and managing 
those risks (through account management, hedging and 
other techniques). Effective risk management depends on, 
among other things, our ability through stress testing and 
other techniques to prepare for events that cannot be 
captured by the statistical models it uses; and our success in 
addressing operational, legal and regulatory, and litigation 
challenges, notably compliance with the US DPA; and other 
risks and uncertainties we identify in ‘top and emerging 
risks’ on pages 64 and 67.

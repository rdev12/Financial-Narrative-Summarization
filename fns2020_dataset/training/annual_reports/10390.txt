Our 
strategy
We have a simple strategy to ensure our future success: 
To deliver stakeholder value through a focus on sustainable, 
proﬁ table growth.
This strategy can be broken down into four areas that are 
all linked to our key performance indicators (KPIs) and other 
management tools, which we use to measure our success 
and our progress.
“ We have been 
able to grow much 
faster than the 
markets in which 
we operate.” MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 5 
Our strategy is to deliver value to 
all our stakeholders including our 
shareholders, customers, employees 
and the wider community.
We have an uncompromising 
commitment to deliver value to our 
customers by providing them with 
quality services. Our ability to do 
this directly impacts on our ability 
to retain our clients. We measure 
this part of our strategy using our 
contract retention KPI. Many of 
the principles in delivering quality 
services start with the attitude of the 
people carrying out those services. 
This is why MITIE is all about having 
the right people for the job and the 
right attitude to getting it done. We 
know that the best way to make 
sure that we have the right people 
is to recruit, motivate and retain 
the best talent in our industry. To do 
this we provide a comprehensive 
set of beneﬁ ts, rewards, incentives 
and training. We measure our 
performance in this area through 
our management retention KPI. By 
providing our clients with quality 
services delivered by quality 
people, we will also deliver value 
to our shareholders, through the 
sustainable, proﬁ table growth of the 
Group. Our ﬁ nancial KPI set reﬂ ects 
our performance in this area.
Stakeholders
Sustainability
Sustainability has many 
interpretations. For us, it’s about 
building and protecting a long-term 
business, managing our growth 
rates and planning our resource 
requirements. Our forward order 
book is a KPI and helps us to monitor 
the visibility and demands of our 
future workloads and earnings. 
We act responsibly as a business 
and aim to build a reputation that 
enhances our brand and makes 
us attractive to shareholders, 
customers and future employees 
in the long term. 
Our corporate responsibility (CR) 
programme is a differentiator for 
clients seeking to do business with 
like-minded organisations and we 
believe that it contributes to our 
ability to sustain our growth in the 
future. CR is an important part of 
our strategy and we measure our 
impact on the environment as a 
KPI in the form of our CO
2
 emissions 
per employee. We also produce 
a separate CR Report each year 
which uses key measurements 
to benchmark our progress in 
developing our CR programme.
We are focused on growing 
our business proﬁ tably and on 
maintaining our margins within our 
target ranges. The remuneration 
of our senior management is 
inﬂ uenced by proﬁ t-related 
performance and we recognise 
that focusing on proﬁ tability rather 
than top line growth is a key factor in 
creating value for our shareholders. 
We use our EBITA margin as one 
of our ﬁ nancial KPIs to monitor 
our performance. 
Proﬁ tability
We have a track record that has 
seen double digit organic growth 
every year since our formation in 
1987. We are conﬁ dent of continued 
success. During the year , we grew 
revenue at a rate of 14.5%, with 
organic growth of 10.4%, whilst 
we saw our markets grow at an 
average of 6.0%.
We are well placed to take 
advantage of the trends towards 
both integrated and larger scale 
national contracts that can only be 
delivered by a small number 
of providers. 
Part of our strategy is to supplement 
our organic growth through 
acquisitions of companies that 
can enhance our service offering. 
We look for companies that 
have a similar culture to us – an 
entrepreneurial culture supported 
by strong management, where 
achievement is rewarded and 
the satisfaction of customers is the 
primary focus. MITIE’s own success 
can be attributed to the strength 
and motivation of its people, and it 
is a vital ingredient for any company 
that we consider acquiring. 
Growth 6 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our 
performance
Description: Our strength lies in the 
management of people and in 
the provision of suitable assets to 
support their work, but our business 
is not capital intensive. We continue 
to monitor and control capital 
expenditure, and target growth 
and acquisitions in areas that do not 
require substantial capital expenditure.
Target range: Maintain below 2.0% 
of revenue.
Comment: We have reduced our 
capital expenditure KPI to 1.4% 
(2007: 1.8%) keeping it well below 
the 2.0% target limit.
Description: It is important that we 
continue to target a progressive 
dividend policy that provides an 
appropriate return to shareholders 
and that provides a dividend which 
grows in line with the underlying 
earnings of the Group. 
Dividend cover is calculated 
by reference to our underlying, 
cash-based earnings which we 
measure using our basic EPS 
before amortisation of intangibles, 
imputed interest charges relating 
to acquisitions and material non-
recurring charges. There were no

Conversion of EBITDA to cash (%)
Description: The efﬁ ciency with which 
we manage the generation of cash is 
an important indicator for our business. 
MITIE is built on a sound understanding 
of the importance of cash and working 
capital management and that ethos 
remains critical to our business. The 
conversion of the Group’s earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) to cash is one 
of the signiﬁ cant cash ﬂ ow indicators 
for MITIE.
Target range: Over 90.0% of Group 
EBITDA converted to cash.
Comment: We have achieved our 
target this year with 90.3% of Group 
EBITDA being converted to cash.
Description: Our earnings before 
interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) 
margin provides us with a good 
indicator of the proﬁ tability of our 
business. Where we have material, 
non-recurring charges, such as 
integration costs, we exclude these 
from our measure. 
Target range: Maintain EBITA margins 
between 5.0% and 6.0% per annum.
Comment: We have maintained 
our underlying margins at 5.1% and 
improved our reported margins from 
their 2007 levels of 4.9%. Acquisition 
related integration costs reduced 
reported EBITA in 2007.
material non-recurring charges 
in 2008, whilst in 2007 adjustment 
was made in respect of acquisition 
related integration costs. The 
adjusted EPS after these items is 
14.9p (2007: 12.8p) giving rise to 
underlying growth of 16.4%.
Target range: At least in line with 
underlying earnings growth at 
a cover rate of 2.5 times 
adjusted earnings.
Comment: Our dividend growth 
for the year is 17.6 %, giving cover 
of 2.5 times adjusted earnings. MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 7 
MITIE’s strategy is centred on sustainable, proﬁ table growth. 
In delivering this strategy our main aim is to secure value 
enhancement for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
We use the following ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial key 
performance indicators (KPIs) along with other management 
tools to measure our success in the delivery of our strategy 
and the management of our business: 
Description: In order to achieve 
sustainable, proﬁ table growth, 
we monitor the percentage of 
existing contracts retained in our 
Facilities Services division on a rolling 
12-month basis. 
Target: Achieve contract retention 
rates in excess of 90.0%.
Comment: We have improved 
our contract retention rate in our 
Facilities Services division to 86.0%.

Single service
The ﬁ rst experience of outsourcing 
for most organisations is usually 
to outsource some of their single 
services. It is usually possible to 
provide signiﬁ cant cost savings 
on ﬁ rst-time outsourced contracts 
as specialist suppliers may bring in 
process improvements and new 
technology, or may reduce the 
headcount of the service team. 
As organisations outsource more 
specialist non-core services, the 
number of suppliers and contracts 
that they have to manage increases. 
Multi-service
In a multi-service contract, a client 
will outsource more than one service 
to MITIE. We know that by providing 
quality services to our clients, it is 
more likely that they will outsource 
other services to us rather than 
going to a different supplier. Multi-
service contracts are a common 
progression for organisations that 
have already outsourced some 
of their non-core support services. 
For second and third generation 
outsourced contracts, it becomes 
harder to save money by process 
improvement alone. In a multi-
service contract, our clients can 
reduce the number of suppliers that 
they have to monitor by contracting 
with us to provide multiple services. 
The beneﬁ ts include possible 
synergies in the management and 
delivery of the services, one invoice 
every month, one health and safety/
quality management system to audit 
and fewer suppliers to manage. 
We are a valuable partner for 
clients who wish to rationalise their 
supply chain without losing any 
of the expertise that comes with 
outsourcing to specialist suppliers. 
Facilities 
management 
Organisations that are comfortable 
with outsourcing may wish to 
engage with us in a facilities 
management (FM) contract. This 
type of contract is an end-to-
end facilities solution where MITIE 
is brought in to manage the FM 
department for a client. We can 
help an organisation identify what 
should be outsourced, then deliver 
the services with one integrated 
team. With MITIE’s range of services, 
we are able to provide directly the 
vast majority of services that most 
other FM companies would have to 
subcontract. This can help to drive 
down costs and encourage a ‘one 
team’ approach. We see the area 
of FM as a large potential growth 
area for MITIE. 
Facilities 
Services 
We provide integrated facilities 
services and are responsible 
for managing and maintaining 
properties and workspaces for some 
of the UK’s largest businesses and 
organisations. We have the expertise 
in place to support our customers 
in achieving their strategic goals – 
improving services, reducing costs 
and creating great workplaces for 
their people. 
Our comprehensive range of 
services means that we can provide 
all of our facilities services directly 
without having to subcontract to 
third parties, saving our customers 
time, money and increasing co-
operation and efﬁ ciency between 
service teams. 
We also provide the specialist 
knowledge to support our customers 
in addressing change, from energy 
and environmental management 
and specialist facilities management 
technology, to lifecycle management 
and consultancy services. 
Property 
Services
We provide a full suite of property 
services, from refurbishment to 
repairs, working with clients as 
varied as housing associations, 
industrial companies and property 
developers. We have specialist 
skills in every aspect of property 
care, including interior ﬁ t-out, 
minor repairs and redecoration, 
passive ﬁ re protection, plumbing 
and heating, refurbishment, repair 
and maintenance and rooﬁ ng. 
Our energy and commitment 
to improving and transforming 
buildings, both inside and out, 
has made us one of the strongest 
providers in our sector.
Engineering 
Services 
We deliver leading-edge, 
sustainable engineering services 
for buildings. 
Our services cover every aspect of 
design, consultancy and installation, 
from mainstream mechanical and 
electrical engineering to technology 
infrastructure, heating, ventilation 
and air-conditioning. We have 
also gained impressive expertise in 
renewable energy technologies and 
are helping clients make substantial 
reductions in the carbon footprint 
and lifecycle costs of their buildings. 10 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 11 
Milton Keynes Council
Services provided: responsive repairs, void 
reinstatement and supply chain management.
Overview 
We are helping Milton Keynes Council to improve 
their housing service by reinstating empty properties 
more quickly and providing a more effective 
method of carrying out housing repairs on its stock 
of 12,000 homes. 
Key successes
We were contracted to deliver a vastly improved 
and more cost-effective maintenance programme 
through a locally based service that encompasses 
all of the main building trades, building works and 
improvement programmes within properties.
A new process that places great emphasis on 
empowering tradesmen to complete all calls 
on a ‘zero defects, zero complaints’ basis has 
been implemented. As a direct result, the level of 
responsive repairs completed on time has risen by 
13% to 95%. Average working days for non-urgent 
repairs have fallen from 70 days to just 12 days. 
These improvements have increased ﬁ rst-time ﬁ xes 
and have enabled a larger percentage of every 
pound of the council’s repairs budget to be spent 
on maintenance rather than on administering 
the service. 12 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Communities and Local Government 
and the Government Ofﬁ ce for London
Services provided: facilities management, 
maintenance and engineering, cleaning, 
catering, business services (reception, porterage 
and mail), security and waste management.
Overview
In 2004, the then Ofﬁ ce of the Deputy Prime 
Minister was delivering facilities services through a 
managing agent, with a range of subcontractors. 
With a need to streamline the management of 
their estates and increasing sustainability targets, 
the government department, now known as 
Communities and Local Government embarked 
on a process to select a single supplier to deliver 
a fully integrated facilities management service. 
Since then MITIE has been working with the central 
government department to deliver an integrated 
FM service. 
Key successes
MITIE has been successful in delivering savings of 
over £500,000 across the contract, which have 
been achieved as a result of a continuous drive for 
improvements, supporting the central government 
department in rationalising the efﬁ ciency of their 
estate whilst adding considerable value across 
the contract. 
The contract is based around a focus on delivering 
innovation and expertise to improve service 
delivery, involving all members of the MITIE team 
and members of the client team to deliver 
these improvements. They have included the 
centralisation of the on-site mailrooms, providing 
considerable ﬁ nancial and space saving beneﬁ ts 
to the government department, through to 
providing environmental management expertise 
to support Communities and Local Government to 
achieve the recent targets introduced across the 
government estate, to reduce CO
2
 emissions by 
20% by 2012. 
MITIE have introduced a range of initiatives across 
the sites to reduce waste and energy usage and 
support the achievement of sustainability targets. 
This has included a project to re-programme the 
time-settings on the passive infrared motion-sensors 
across the various sites and the introduction of a 
food composting programme which saw MITIE 
working in partnership with a locally based social 
enterprise to support the increase in recycling 
across the sites. Combined with a range of other 
recycling initiatives, this has resulted in a dramatic 
increase in recycling across all sites over the last 
two years, with MITIE continuing to work with 
Communities and Local Government to achieve 
their targets in this area.  MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 13  14 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Her Majesty’s Courts Service (HMCS)
Services provided: front of house, access 
control, CCTV monitoring, jury supervision 
and car park management. 
Overview
In 2007, HMCS and the Tribunal Service decided 
they wanted a more consistent security presence, 
with an exclusive manned guarding provider 
across all their sites. The key requirement for the 
courts was to have a dedicated, motivated and 
specially trained team, with the ability to deal with 
a broad range of responsibilities and cope in any 
eventuality. 
Key successes
MITIE has succeeded in providing an excellent 
service with a team of more than 1,400 ofﬁ cers at all 
425 county, magistrates and tribunal courts across 
England and Wales.
Our approach has resulted in one of the lowest 
turnover rates of security ofﬁ cers in our industry. 
We pay close attention to looking after our people, 
supplying consistent uniforms across the board and 
providing high quality training delivered at our own 
bespoke academy. 
It’s important to both the courts and to MITIE 
to maintain this level of excellence and keep 
our people motivated. The results have been 
a cost-effective and efﬁ cient guarding service 
for staff, juries and visitors delivered by a motivated 
security team from a provider with 15 years’ 
experience in dealing with the demanding 
court environment. MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 15  16 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
HBOS
Services provided: cleaning, landscaping 
and pest control.
Overview
Our relationship with HBOS started in 1998 
when MITIE was awarded contracts for major 
employment sites in Aylesbury, London, Scotland 
and Birmingham as well as the post room in 
Bristol. Today, MITIE cleans over 1,000 high street 
branches around the country and more than 130 
HBOS ofﬁ ces too, employing over 2,000 people 
overseen by an account director with their own 
management team. As a national accounts 
contract it has direct access to our own 24hr call 
centre based in Bristol, allowing for instant remedies 
of cleaning requirements. 
Key successes
The high street retail network was mobilised 
in record time – nearly 1,000 of the branches 
were made ready in just over six weeks. We 
have also developed our own quality auditing 
system that uses the latest technology. Each 
account manager completes their monthly audit 
using a handheld device. Once the audit has 
been completed, the real-time information sits 
on a secure website alongside other essential 
management information which can be 
accessed by all authorised stakeholders. 
This is used extensively on each HBOS site.
We have also worked hard with HBOS to develop 
an automated computer system which plays an 
important part in guaranteeing service delivery 
compliance across the contract. In addition, 
the system has the ability to address the issue of 
MITIE’s people who work on their own, often during 
unsociable hours, allowing us to be sure of their 
whereabouts for health and safety reasons. This 
system is unique and offers a real differentiation 
in the marketplace. MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 17  18 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Chairman’s 
statement
I am delighted to announce that 
2008 has been another year of 
strong growth for MITIE. This year 
was our 20
th
 year of revenue and 
proﬁ ts growth.
Throughout the last year we have 
continued to forge new relationships 
and build on long-term partnerships 
with our clients and are delighted to 
welcome thousands of new people 
to MITIE.
We are now well positioned for 
the next stage in our development 
with an excellent management 
team and a well developed 
strategy in place targeting our 
three markets of facilities, property 
and engineering services.
Results
MITIE has had another excellent year , 
with 14.5% growth in our revenue 
to £1,407.2m (2007: £1,228.8m). 
Operating proﬁ t before amortisation 
rose by 20.5% to £72.2m (2007: 
£59.9m) with proﬁ t before tax 
increasing by 20.0% to £67.9m (2007: 
£56.6m). Adjusted earnings per share 
grew by 21.1% to 14.9p per share 
(2007: 12.3p per share). Underlying 
operating proﬁ t margins were 
maintained within our target range 
of 5–6% at 5.1% (2007: 5.1%) whilst 
reported operating proﬁ t margins 
increased from 4.9% to 5.1%.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a 
ﬁ nal dividend of 3.2p per Ordinary 
share making a total of 6.0p per 
share for the year , a 17.6% increase 
on 2007. This increase is in line with 
our dividend policy to maintain 
dividends in line with underlying 
earnings growth at a cover ratio 
of 2.5 times adjusted earnings.
The dividend will be paid on 
4 August 2008 to shareholders 
on the register at 4 July 2008. 
Pensions
The Group contributes to a range 
of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned 
contribution pension schemes. I am 
pleased to report that the surplus 
within the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes 
has continued this year with a net 
surplus of £7.5m (2007: £0.5m). 
Board changes 
This will be my last year as non-
executive Chairman of MITIE as I 
will retire at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) on 31 July 
2008. I have thoroughly enjoyed the 
last six years with MITIE. I will leave the 
Company in a very strong ﬁ nancial 
position and with excellent prospects 
to succeed in the future under the 
stewardship of Roger Matthews, who 
will be appointed as non-executive 
Chairman at the close of the AGM. 
Roger has been a non-executive 
director since December 2006 and 
brings with him a wide range of skills 
and experience from his previous 
positions as Group Finance director of 
J Sainsbury plc and Group Managing 
director and Group Finance director 
of Compass Group PLC.
Cullum McAlpine, who has been 
a non-executive director of MITIE 
since April 2003 and is Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and senior 
independent non-executive director , 
will also retire from the Board at 
the Company’s AGM. I would like 
to thank Cullum for his support to 
MITIE and the Board over the past 
ﬁ ve years.
The following Board changes will 
also take effect from 31 July 2008. 
David Jenkins will be appointed as 
senior independent non-executive 
director and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Roger Matthews will 
assume the chairmanship of the 
Nomination Committee. 
The recruitment of a new non-
executive director will commence 
during the year.
Corporate governance
We are committed to maintaining 
high standards of corporate 
governance. The Board recognises 
that MITIE is expected to act to the 
highest standards of responsibility at 
all times and we therefore have in 
place a set of governance structures 
and practices designed to ensure 
that MITIE is run responsibly in the best 
interests of all its stakeholders. 
Outlook
In this my last year as Chairman 
of MITIE, I would like to wish the 
management team every success 
for the future. We enter the new 
ﬁ nancial year with our business 
aligned to meet the needs of our 
ever changing markets. Current 
economic conditions are requiring 
businesses to re-evaluate their cost 
base and to focus resource and 
attention on reducing risk and 
uncertainty in volatile markets. This 
provides us with opportunities as 
organisations seek to reduce costs 
through outsourcing.
We are conﬁ dent that we are well 
positioned to continue our strategy 
of delivering stakeholder value by 
focusing on sustainable, proﬁ table 
growth through 2008 and beyond.

Chief 
Executive’s 
review
At the end of my ﬁ rst full year as 
Chief Executive, I am delighted 
that we have continued our record 
of double digit growth, increasing 
revenue by 14.5% in the year. Our 
operating proﬁ t before amortisation 
has increased by 20.5% and all three 
of our divisions have performed well, 
enabling us to maintain our overall 
underlying operating proﬁ t margins 
within our target range at 5.1%. 
In order to deliver value to our 
stakeholders by delivering future 
sustainable growth, we have spent 
the year ensuring that we are well 
placed to meet the needs of our 
ever changing markets.
We have aligned our Facilities 
Services division to focus on growth 
in the FM and multi-service markets. 
With the formation of our new 
FM business, we are now able to 
compete for the larger FM contracts. 
The business now provides us with 
a vehicle that has been created 
to really understand our clients’ FM 
needs and show how we can match 
them with MITIE’s capabilities. 
Our Property Services division has 
been reorganised to align our 
specialist skills to the market place 
in which we operate. We are 
intent on making each area of our 
business a truly national offering, 
focusing on rooﬁ ng, minor repairs 
and redecoration, interior ﬁ t-out, 
plumbing and heating, social 
housing and ﬁ re protection.
Our Engineering Services division has 
also been focusing on aligning the 
structure of the division with its three 
main markets: energy; technology 
and infrastructure; and building 
services. In the energy markets, we 
offer a full energy management 
consultancy for our clients, reducing 
their carbon footprints through 
renewable technologies and use of 
efﬁ cient materials. The technology 
and infrastructure markets 
concentrate on providing information 
communications technology services 
(ICT) as well as power generation and 
cooling solutions for data centres. The 
building services market is the more 
traditional mechanical and electrical 
contracting arm of the business.
We have had an excellent year and 
have delivered record results. Our 
business is focused on growth through 
its strength in integrated facilities, 
property and engineering services. 
We are conﬁ dent in our ability to 
make progress in this economic 
climate and there are positive trading 
conditions across all three divisions. 
We have a record order book 
and are well positioned to deliver 
sustainable, proﬁ table growth.
Order book
Our forward order book has grown 
to £4.4bn (2007: £4.1bn). 82% of this 
order book is within our Facilities 
Services division, 11% within Property 
Services and 7% in Engineering 
Services. This year , we have secured 
78% of our budgeted revenue for 
the year ending 31 March 2009 
compared to 75% at the same 
point last year. 
Acquisitions
We continue to seek to acquire 
businesses that complement or ﬁ t 
within our existing company and in 
2008 made three acquisitions. In April 
2007, we acquired Jabez Holdings 
Limited, the holding company of the 
Robert Prettie plumbing business. 
In March 2008, we completed 
the acquisitions of both Catering 
Partnership Holdings Limited and 
DW Tilley Limited.
All three acquisitions complement 
our existing activities: 
•  Robert Prettie is a Nottingham-
based business that works in 
partnership with local authorities, 
councils, developers and 
registered social landlords on 
kitchen and bathroom installations, 
heating replacement, gas 
servicing, maintenance and 
call-out services. This acquisition 
has added signiﬁ cantly to the 
capabilities of our Property Services 
division in the housing sector and 
has complemented the existing 
regional operations; 
“ We have realigned 
our divisions to 
meet the needs of 
our ever changing 
markets.” 22 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
•  Catering Partnership Holdings 
Limited is a Midlands-based 
catering company. The company 
complements the geographical 
coverage of our existing 
operations; and 
•  DW Tilley Limited is a national 
rooﬁ ng contractor , based in 
the North East of England. The 
company complements our 
existing Property Services division 
and provides us with a national 
rooﬁ ng capability.
Equity incentivisation
We continue to start new businesses 
and support ﬁ rst generation equity 
start-ups within MITIE. In October 
2007 we started MITIE Client Services 
Limited. This business operates 
within the Facilities Services division 
and will provide clients with high 
quality, client facing support services 
including reception, switchboard, 
helpdesk and events management. 
As part of the development of 
our equity incentivisation model, 
we have introduced a second 
generation equity scheme into 
some of our established businesses 
to provide an equity opportunity 
for the new management teams 
within those businesses whereby 
management share the risks and 
rewards of ownership.
Second generation schemes have 
been set up in our Property Services 
division and also in the Cleaning, 
Landscaping and Security businesses 
within our Facilities Services division. 
The second generation scheme in 
our Security business was introduced 
on 4 October 2007 following 
shareholder approval at an EGM. 
The introduction of this scheme 
is important for the successful 
development and consolidation 
of our Security business which has 
grown rapidly, particularly over the 
last two years. 
Our Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
scheme was also introduced in July 
2007 following shareholder approval 
at the AGM. EPS growth targets 
over three years form the basis of 
the performance criteria for the 
LTIP , with shares being offered to a 
number of key senior management. 
This scheme ensures that we have 
market leading reward mechanisms 
to attract the best management 
in our sector to MITIE.
Market development
Our markets have always been 
demanding and will continue to 
be so. Uncertainty in the general 
economy creates opportunity for 
MITIE as customers seek innovation 
and fresh thinking from their service 
providers. Our relatively low market 
share, range of services and 
integrated delivery makes us 
an attractive partner. 
One way that customers are saving 
money and increasing efﬁ ciency 
is through enlarging the scope of 
facilities contracts. The move towards 
larger multi-service and FM contracts 
provides us with opportunity due to 
our unrivalled range of services and 
wealth of knowledge. 
The workplace environment is more 
demanding than ever for our clients. 
Issues such as waste and recycling, 
energy management, carbon 
footprint and through-life cost asset 
management all demand forward 
thinking and integration into their 
strategic planning.
MITIE is well positioned to take 
advantage of these current 
markets and has the capability 
to provide integrated services 
through a measured and thought-
out approach. We can assist 
our clients by using the expertise 
developed within our business in 
these increasingly complex areas, 
providing the thought needed to 
develop integrated solutions that 
understand the unique needs of 
each and every client.
In our engineering markets, we are 
ﬁ nding that clients are increasingly 
looking to award contracts on a 
framework basis. The long-term 
visibility provided by a framework 
approach to workload allocation 
and the continued aggregation of 
the procurement philosophy of both 
public and private sector customers 
continues to work to MITIE’s beneﬁ t. 
We are well placed to take 
advantage of this shift in work type 
due to our substantial knowledge of 
key sectors, our national capability 
and our expertise of renewable 
technologies.
The engineering sector is also 
responding to new legislation, in 
particular the requirement of energy 
certiﬁ cates for all buildings that 
are constructed, sold, rented or 
occupied. The certiﬁ cates will show

how energy efﬁ cient a building is

 it emits into the 
atmosphere. Responsible contractors 
within this sector are providing the 
expertise and innovation to deal 
with this new requirement. MITIE has 
invested heavily in resources and 
is actively involved in the design 
and application of more efﬁ cient 
forms of energy generation and 
distribution to the built environment. 
This commitment and investment 
ensures that our Engineering Services 
division is at the forefront when it 
comes to advising clients and the 
supply chain on planning regulations 
and requirements.
Our Property Services division 
continues to operate in diverse 
markets. The acquisition of Robert 
Prettie provides us with the technical 
ability and expertise to create a 
service aimed at the wider housing 
market. We believe this new 
offering will prove attractive to the 
sector and provide us with future, 
sustainable organic growth. The 
social housing market continues to 
afford us opportunities to increase 
our presence in this sector. 
International services
MITIE is the UK’s market leader in 
providing facilities, property and 
engineering services. As our markets 
are very fragmented, we still only 
have a relatively small market 
share in the UK. Our primary focus 
remains on growing our UK business. 
Nevertheless, we do have the 
capability to deliver contracts outside 
the UK when asked to do so by our 
increasingly global client base. 
Corporate responsibility (CR)
For us, CR is about behaviour and 
attitude. We aim to ensure that our 
CR programme involves every area 
of our business. CR is undoubtedly 
a differentiator for us, and has 
been cited as the deciding factor 
for some clients when awarding 
us contracts. CR issues, such as 
reducing the carbon footprint of 
buildings, create opportunities for us 
as we have substantial experience in 
renewable energy technology and 
energy consultancy.
This year we will publish our third CR 
Report. The Report covers our CR 
programme in detail and expands 
upon the summary of our CR 
performance that is in this Annual 
Report and Accounts. We are proud 
of this year’s achievements including 
gaining a silver award scoring 81.5% 
in Business in the Community’s 
Corporate Responsibility Index (2007: 
bronze award with 70.0%) and 
featuring in the Top 100 ‘Companies 
that Count’ for the second year 
in a row. The index is a voluntary, 
self-assessment survey, providing 
an annual benchmark of how 
companies manage, measure and 
report their corporate responsibility. 
Our greatest asset is our people
We continue to see our people as 
being our greatest and most valued 
asset. Without their commitment 
and hard work, MITIE would not be 
successful, so I would like to thank 
personally all of our people for their 
efforts over the last 12 months. 
We have always recognised and 
promoted success within MITIE and 
this year have launched a new 
recognition scheme called MITIE 
Stars. The new scheme will be a 
key tool in recognising excellence 
within MITIE, helping us to drive 
performance improvement and 
support the need for consistency 
across the organisation.
In MITIE, our success has been built 
on the strength of our teams. It 
is unusual for us to single out the 
contribution of one individual, but on 
this occasion I would like to extend 
my personal thanks and those of the 
Board to David Ord, who will step 
down as non-executive Chairman 
of MITIE following our AGM in July 
2008. David has been instrumental in 
supporting the development of the 
Group since his appointment and I 
wish him every success in the future.

Rewarding our stars
We have launched a new employee 
awards scheme across MITIE in order 
to give something back in return for all 
their energy and commitment. It’s called 
the MITIE Stars awards scheme and it 
will make sure that the most important 
part of our business is recognised and 
rewarded – our people. The overall 
winner will take home more than £25,000 
worth in prizes from a total prize fund of 
more than £100,000. 24 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Cable & Wireless
In July 2007, we were awarded the 
contract to maintain the mechanical 
and electrical infrastructure for 725 Cable 
& Wireless sites across the UK. The high 
technical and performance requirements 
of the contract sees almost 80 dedicated 
MITIE people working to make sure 
Cable & Wireless’ systems run smoothly. 
Our solution offers a dedicated mobile 
maintenance team, supported by ﬂ exible 
back-up engineers from our regional 
service centres. This has combined 
with our 24/7 intelligent helpdesk at 
our Tamworth service centre offering 
technical engineer support and response 
services to increase the response times 
and adherence to KPIs. MITIE has 
expanded its relationship to provide a 
facilities management service, delivering 
cleaning, ofﬁ ce services, helpdesk and 
other ancillary services to their UK and 
Ireland Estate, including their Bracknell HQ 
and other locations around the country. MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 25

Facilities 
Services
Our Facilities Services division 
combines the operating activities 
of our broad range of FM services. 
The division has had a good year 
with new contract awards across the 
division increasing revenue by 12.1% 
to £820.4m (2007: £732.1m) and 
operating proﬁ t growing by 17.8% 
to £48.9m (2007: £41.5m). Reported 
operating proﬁ t margins increased 
by 0.3% to 6.0% (2007: 5.7%) whilst 
underlying operating proﬁ t margins 
were maintained at 6.0% (2007: 
6.0%). Our medium-term target 
range for this division is 6.0% to 7.0%.
Within Facilities Services this year , we 
have had a focus on consolidation 
which will allow our businesses to 
work together more easily and assist 
them in delivering effective multi-
service and FM contracts going 
forward. We now recognise ﬁ ve 
business lines as follows: Cleaning 
and Environmental Services which 
encompasses the cleaning, 
landscaping and pest control 
businesses with revenues this year of 
£269.6m (2007: £236.9m); Facilities 
Management which comprises the 
Managed Services, Business Services 
and PFI businesses which had 
revenues of £136.4m (2007: £124.0m); 
Security with revenue of £257.4m 
(2007: £241.8m); Engineering 
Maintenance with revenue of 
£135.2m (2007: £109.7m) and 
Catering with revenue of £21.8m 
(2007: £19.7m).
We set out below a range of 
contract awards.
Within the government sector, we 
have been awarded a ﬁ ve-year 
contract to provide an FM solution 
for The Ofﬁ ce for National Statistics 
delivering project management 
services as well as a full solution to 
provide facilities services for their 
UK estate.
We have also recently been 
awarded a large contract with the 
Atomic Weapons Establishment to 
provide security services, where our 
team will be under the operational 
and tactical control of the MoD 
Police to manage access and 
egress at their Aldermaston and 
Burghﬁ eld sites.
Our national contract with Her 
Majesty’s Courts Service to provide 
security services continues to 
expand, with additional revenue 
secured in the last ﬁ nancial year. 
This enlarged contract is the largest 
single manned guarding contract 
in the UK security industry.
Our focus on the education sector 
has enabled us to win several 
new cleaning contracts with 
Carnegie College in Fife, and 
both Stevenson College and the 
new Queen Margaret University 
Campus in Edinburgh. 
We have secured a key role in Perth 
and Kinross Council’s Investment in 
Learning project – a public private 
partnership agreement between 
Perth and Kinross Council and Axiom

Engineering 
Services
We have seen steady growth in our 
Engineering Services division as the 
business transitions to a lower risk 
work mix. Contract awards have 
increased revenues in the division 
by 6.9% to £301.1m (2007: £281.6m) 
with operating proﬁ t also increasing 
by 6.4% to £8.3m (2007: £7.8m). 
Operating margins were maintained 
at 2.8% (2007: 2.8%). Our medium-
term target range for this division is 
3.0% to 4.0%. 
Our engineering team’s traditional 
work is evolving to meet the 
changing requirements of our 
customer base. New government 
legislation promotes on-site 
energy generation in new-build 
developments and reduction in 
carbon emissions through the use of 
green technologies. Our new energy 
offering in these areas makes us an 
even more attractive partner in the 
marketplace. This is reﬂ ected in some 
of our latest contract awards:
In the government sector, we 
have been awarded a contract 
with the National Assembly for 
Wales’ regional headquarters in 
Aberystwyth. Work has started on 
the project, with staff set to occupy 
the building in spring 2009. The 
contract is for mechanical and 
electrical works, and includes many 
environmentally friendly features 
such as a biomass boiler , ammonia 
chillers, rainwater harvesting, 
natural ventilation and controls, 
solar panels, quietrevolution wind 
turbine, cooling pond and intelligent 
lighting. The aim will be to achieve 
a Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method 
(BREEAM) rating of Excellent.
As part of our work in the education 
sector, we have been awarded 
some great new contracts, including 
a design and build contract for 
University Campus Suffolk. The 
new-build campus development in 
Ipswich sees us integrated straight 
into the project team to develop 
the platform design and ensure the 
client’s vision is fully realised. Works 
include air-cooled chiller plant with 
heat recovery, chilled beams and a 
sophisticated lighting control system 
harvesting sunlight on bright days. 
The building also features a sedum or 
‘living’ roof, which provides a really 
natural feel to the campus.
MITIE continues to build on its strong 
relationship with the University of 
Bristol with the award of a combined 
heat and power (CHP) and waste 
heat recovery project at the 
University’s Langford veterinary 
campus. The project includes both 
the supply and installation of a 
containerised CHP unit with 380kW 
electrical and 500kW heat output, as 
well as the provision of infrastructure 
works at the University. The 
proposed development will create 
over £50m of educational and 
research facilities, and laboratories 
for the Biological Sciences and 
Mathematics departments. 
We have been awarded the 
contract on the new-build Melksham 
Oak Community School in Wiltshire 
to provide the mechanical and 
electrical engineering. The school is 
part of the Building Schools for the 
Future ‘Pathﬁ nder’ programme. 
MITIE’s design concepts for the 
school include good quality internal 
environment, simple, user friendly 
systems, low energy and capital 
costs minimising CO
2 
emissions while 
applying value engineering where 
possible. It will feature energy efﬁ cient 
heating and lighting together with 
rainwater harvesting and night time 
cooling. There will also be a focus 
on providing a natural environment 
for learning centred on a natural 
ventilation strategy.
We have continued to build on 
our relationship with Standard 
Life Investments in the ﬁ nancial 
and professional services sector, 
offering an integrated approach 
to provide the engineering ﬁ t-
out and maintenance. This has 
resulted in us securing three 
new-build projects with them in 
Guildford, Ealing and London. 
The Woodbridge Road project in 
Guildford sees us utilise geo-thermal 
energy, generating 137mWh of 
renewable energy for the building. 
Our commitment to partnering and 
substantial knowledge of renewable 
technologies was instrumental in 
securing this contract.
We have secured further 
infrastructure works at Great 
Ormond Street Hospital in the 
healthcare sector, following our 
excellent performance as principal 
contractor on the initial project 
that was completed in October 
2007. The hospital’s redevelopment 
programme continues through to 
2012 and our strong relationship with 
the hospital and their team means 
we are well placed for future works.
In the leisure sector, we have 
continued our relationship with 
the world famous The Langham 
Hotel, London, by recently securing 
two major projects. Running 
concurrently, these are the 
public area works, which consist 
of a complete mechanical and 
electrical refurbishment in all public 
areas, including the main entrance 
and function rooms. The other 
project is the guest room ﬁ t-out 
of 161 rooms, which will be taking 
place in the occupied hotel over the 
next year. 
In the property management sector, 
our recent award at Easter Park, 
Aldermaston allows us to exploit our 
in-depth knowledge of geothermal 
technology, satisfying the client’s 
objective to create ‘green’ ofﬁ ce 
space for this new-build business 
park development near Reading. 
The contract includes the design, 
build and installation of closed loop 
boreﬁ elds and a ground source heat 
pump system.

Other recent contracts include 
Salt Quay House, a new ofﬁ ce 
development at Sutton Harbour , 
Plymouth, which meets the latest 
environmental standards and 
includes energy saving initiatives, 
such as air-conditioning using latest 
generation heat recovery pumps 
with thermal wheel air handling units 
to maximise free cooling.
Our work in the science and 
technology sector has grown by 
securing a major infrastructure 
upgrade project in May 2007 with 
one of the world’s largest providers 
of data centre space. The project, 
located in London’s Docklands 
area, is now our largest engineering 
contract and consists of the 
construction of two new power 
stations, upgrade of an existing 
power station and the increase in 
the cooling capacity to the data 
centre ﬂ oors.
The completion and integration 
of the MITIE project works into the 
existing data centre infrastructure will 
provide the client with an increased 
capacity and increased resilience 
to the building. This will enable 
additional space to be sold on the 
ﬂ oors and will underpin the current 
and future service level agreements.
We have also formed an exciting 
partnership with the wind turbine 
design company, quietrevolution, to 
install and integrate its wind turbines 
across the UK. MITIE has incorporated 
the use of these turbines as an 
essential component within many of 
our low carbon schemes, including 
the National Assembly for Wales, 
and this product forms an integral 
part of Engineering Services’ new 
microgeneration energy offering.
According to an Energy Saving Trust 
report, it is estimated that small scale 
wind generation, together with other 
forms of microgeneration, could 
provide 30–40% of the UK’s electricity 
needs by 2050.
Another notable contract award 
is our appointment onto the 
framework contract for Diamond 
Light Source at its new scientiﬁ c 
facility in Oxfordshire. The contract, 
initially for three years, will see 
Engineering Services acting 
as principal contractor for the 
installation of beamline cabins 
including mechanical, electrical 
and specialist services. 
Standard Life Investments
Standard Life Investments has partnered 
with MITIE to build a new state-of-the-art 
ofﬁ ce complex in Guildford. Our energy 
experts have proposed an energy solution 
based upon the use of geothermal 
energy as its heat source. MITIE will also 
be carrying out the interior ﬁ t-out of 
the building and the mechanical and 
electrical maintenance.  32 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Financial review
Our ﬁ nancial results for the year 
reﬂ ect continuing growth across 
all of our three divisions with an 
improved reported margin, helping 
to deliver strong growth in proﬁ ts. 
Our strategy of making acquisitions 
which complement and strengthen 
the existing service offerings 
continues, with three acquisitions 
made during the year.
Key performance indicators 
(KPIs)
Our ﬁ nancial KPIs of proﬁ t margins 
before the amortisation of 
intangibles, interest and tax (EBITA) 
and proﬁ t to cash conversion 
levels are important indicators of 
the trading performance of the 
Group. We are satisﬁ ed that the 
levels of performance in these 
measures across the Group are 
consistent with our medium-term 
targets. Furthermore, our strategy 
of operating low capital intensive 
businesses continues and capital 
expenditure levels are being 
managed within the target range 
of less than 2% of revenue.
Our results support the continued 
growth in dividends. Our dividend 
is based on post tax earnings 
attributable to Ordinary shareholders 
adjusted to exclude non-cash 
items associated with acquisitions 
(amortisation and imputed ﬁ nance 
charges) and material non-recurring 
items such as integration costs. This 
ensures that dividend payments to 
shareholders track the underlying 
operating earnings of our business. 
This has resulted in a dividend for 
the full year of 6.0p per share (2007: 
5.1p), an increase of 17.6% for the 
year. This reﬂ ects a dividend cover of 
2.5 times based on our adjusted EPS 
measure. Our ﬁ nal dividend for the 
year ended 31 March 2008 will be 
paid on 4 August 2008.
Growth in revenue
The year to 31 March 2008 has 
seen growth across all three of 
our divisions and our revenue has 
increased by 14.5% to £1,407.2m 
(2007: £1,228.8m). We have 
achieved organic growth across the 
business of 10.4% (2007: 17.4%). The 
acquisition of Robert Prettie, which 
was completed on 2 April 2007, has 
brought a further £49.1m of revenues 
to the Group.
Revenue in our Facilities Services 
division grew organically by 12.1% 
to £820.4m (2007: £732.1m). In 
Property Services, revenue grew by 
32.8% to £285.7m (2007: £215.1m) 
reﬂ ecting organic growth of 10.0% 
and revenue of £49.1m from Robert 
Prettie. In Engineering Services, 
controlled organic growth increased 
revenue by 6.9% to £301.1m (2007: 
£281.6m) reﬂ ecting the continued 
focus on sustainable growth.
Proﬁ tability
Operating proﬁ t before amortisation 
of intangibles (EBITA) rose to £72.2m 
(2007: £59.9m). This includes a 
charge for share-based payments 
of £1.5m (2007: £1.1m) which 
reﬂ ects the accounting charges 
in respect of our Save As You Earn, 
Executive Share Option and Long 
Term Incentive Plan schemes. 
The increase in the share-based 
payment charge reﬂ ects the 
introduction of the LTIP in July 2007 
following shareholder approval at 
the AGM. 
Reported EBITA proﬁ t margin 
increased to 5.1% (2007: 4.9%). 
Underlying margins were maintained 
at 5.1% (2007: 5.1%). The reported 
operating proﬁ t margins within 
Facilities Services were 6.0% (2007: 
5.7%) whilst underlying proﬁ t margins 
(before material integration costs 
in 2007) remained at 6.0%. In 
Property Services, margins increased 
to 5.3% (2007: 4.9%) reﬂ ecting the 
change in the mix of work following 
the Robert Prettie acquisition. 
Engineering Services’ margins remain 
consistent with the prior year at 2.8% 
(2007: 2.8%).
“ Strong balance 
sheet and a net 
pensions surplus.” 34 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
The charge in respect of the 
amortisation of intangible assets 
arising on acquisitions was £1.9m 
(2007: £1.6m). The increase is 
largely due to the amortisation of 
the intangible assets recognised 
following the Robert Prettie 
acquisition. Operating proﬁ t after 
the amortisation of intangibles was 
£70.3m (2007: £58.3m). 
Investment and ﬁ nance costs for 
the year were £2.4m (2007: £1.7m) 
reﬂ ecting the increased level of net 
debt across the Group and the 
non-cash ﬁ nance charge of 
£0.8m (2007: £nil) relating to the 
unwinding of the discount on 
deferred contingent consideration 
in respect of the purchase of Robert 
Prettie at the beginning of the 
year. The Group also settled in cash 
the deferred consideration which 
had previously been held as loan 
notes amounting to £8.0m on two 
prior acquisitions as detailed in the 
acquisitions section below.
The tax charge for the year was 
£20.6m (2007: £17.4m), representing 
an effective rate of tax on our proﬁ t 
on continuing operations of 30.3% 
(2007: 30.7%). 
These results generated a proﬁ t 
after tax for the year of £47.3m 
(2007: £39.2m), an increase of 20.7% 
on the prior year. Of this, £45.0m 
or 95.1% (2007: £37.0m, 94.4%) is 
attributable to the shareholders 
of MITIE Group PLC.
Growth in earnings per share 
(EPS)
Basic EPS before other items 
increased by 21.1% to 14.9p per share 
(2007: 12.3p per share). Basic EPS 
before amortisation rose by 19.5% 
to 14.7p per share (2007: 12.3p per 
share). Basic EPS increased to 14.3p 
per share (2007: 11.9p per share), an 
increase of 20.2%. Fully diluted EPS 
increased by 19.5% to 14.1p per share 
(2007: 11.8p per share).
We have intentionally changed the 
format of our published consolidated 
income statement to disclose the 
impact of non-cash items relating 
to acquisitions – amortisation and 
unwinding of discount on deferred 
contingent consideration. In 
keeping with the MITIE ethos, we 
aim to structure acquisitions which 
encourage business performance 
through deferred contingent 
consideration. This is discounted in 
the balance sheet and unwinds 
through ﬁ nance costs in the 
consolidated income statement. 
The amount included this year was 
£0.8m (2007: £nil) and has impacted 
headline EPS disclosure this year.
Acquisitions 
In April 2007, we acquired 
the plumbing and heating 
company Robert Prettie. The initial 
consideration was £8.6m, of which 
£7.0m was in cash and £1.6m in 
loan notes. A total of £0.8m of 
cash has been retained against 
potential warranty claims. Debt of 
£3.7m was assumed by MITIE on the 
acquisition. Deferred consideration 
on the acquisition up to a maximum 
£22.8m is payable in a combination 
of loan notes and cash based on 
performance over a three-year 
period. The deferred consideration 
can be triggered between 2010 and 
2012. The fair value of the deferred 
consideration on the acquisition of 
£15.3m is included within provisions in 
the consolidated balance sheet. 
In March 2008, MITIE completed the 
acquisition of the entire issued share 
capital of both Catering Partnership 
Holdings Limited and DW Tilley 
Limited. 
The fair value of the total expected 
consideration payable for Catering 
Partnership Holdings Limited is 
£7.5m with initial consideration of 
£6.6m paid in cash on completion. 
Deferred consideration of up 
to £2.3m, payable in cash, is 
dependent on the future ﬁ nancial 
performance of the acquired 
business and is included within 
provisions in the consolidated 
balance sheet. 
The fair value of the total 
consideration expected to be 
paid for DW Tilley Limited is £14.7m. 
Initial consideration of £7.5m for 
the equity of the company and 
£3.6m for the cash balances in 
the company was paid in cash on 
completion. Deferred consideration 
of up to £5.0m, payable in cash, is 
dependent on the future ﬁ nancial

performance of the acquired 
business and is included within 
provisions in the consolidated 
balance sheet.
The Group also acquired some or 
all of the minority interests in the 
equity share capital of seven of 
its subsidiaries. The total maximum 
consideration payable in respect 
of those acquisitions is £8.1m. The 
consideration was largely settled by 
the issue of new MITIE shares.
In August 2007, the Group also 
settled deferred consideration of 
£0.2m in respect of the purchase last 
year of the minority shareholding 
in MITIE Engineering Maintenance 
(South West) Limited. This was settled 
by the issue of new MITIE shares. 
The total number of MITIE Group 
PLC shares issued in respect of these 
transactions was 2.4m.
Other acquisition related 
transactions include the redemption 
in cash of £8.0m of loan notes 
issued in respect of the deferred 
consideration for the acquisition 
of MITIE Security (London) Limited 
(formerly MITIE Trident Security 
Limited) of £7.0m and The Watch 
Security Limited of £1.0m. 
Pensions
The Group contributes to a range 
of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t and deﬁ ned 
contribution pension schemes. In 
addition, MITIE makes contributions 
to its customers’ deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes under Admitted 
Body Local Government and other 
arrangements in respect of certain 
employees who have transferred 
to the Group under TUPE. The net 
surplus before tax included in the 
Group’s balance sheet arising from 
these pension schemes was £7.5m 
(2007: £0.5m). 
Cash ﬂ ow
The underlying cash ﬂ ow 
performance of the Group remains 
strong, with the conversion of EBITDA 
to cash of 90.3% (2007: 114.4%). 
The prior year EBITDA conversion 
of 114.4% was particularly high 
due to one-off short-term timing 
differences at March 2007; the 
average cash conversion over the 
past two years was 101.3% reﬂ ecting 
strong cash ﬂ ow performance, 
well in line with our current KPI of 
conversion above 90.0%. 
At 31 March 2008, the net debt of 
the Group was £15.6m (2007: £8.1m) 
with loans of £50m being drawn 
at that time (2007: £20m). Deposits 
held by the Group’s reinsurance 
subsidiary, which are not readily 
available to the Group, totalled 
£12.4m at 31 March 2008 
(2007: £10.3m).
Group Treasury has responsibility for 
managing and reducing ﬁ nancial 
risks and ensuring sufﬁ cient liquidity 
is available to meet foreseeable 
needs. It operates within policies and 
procedures approved by the Board 
which have not changed during 
the year. Borrowings are arranged 
centrally by Group Treasury and 
made available to operating 
subsidiaries on commercial terms. 
The Board’s ongoing policy is to 
ﬁ nance the Group through retained 
earnings and borrowings.
During the year the Group 
renegotiated its existing banking 
facility which was established during 
the previous year. It extended 
its committed ﬁ ve-year £150m 
revolving credit facility to £230m. 
The principal covenants in respect of 
this facility remained the same and 
put a cap on the maximum level of 
debt within the Group at 3.5 times 
EBITDA, and require a minimum ratio 
of proﬁ t to interest payable of 3:1. 
The Group has operated within these 
covenants throughout the year.
Share buyback
While MITIE did not buy back any 
shares in the past ﬁ nancial year , we 
will be seeking shareholder approval 
to renew the authority to purchase 
up to 10.0% of the MITIE Group PLC’s 
issued share capital at our next 
AGM on 31 July 2008. This authority 
will provide the directors with the 
ﬂ exibility to take advantage of 
business opportunities as they arise.

Corporate 
responsibility
At MITIE, we are committed to the 
operation of a responsible business 
model and to the delivery of our 
CR strategy. For us, it makes sound 
business sense. 
We have consciously structured our 
programme with an emphasis on 
the development of skills and the 
environment. As an employer of 
over 49,000 people working in the 
built environment, these two areas 
are particularly important to us, and 
have helped to shape our activities 
and business model to meet the 
ever changing demands of our 
markets and our stakeholders.
Every year we set challenging 
targets to drive our business forward. 
Our ambitions in CR are no different. 
We have the same passionate 
commitment to protecting our 
people, enhancing our workplaces, 
our communities, our marketplaces 
and the environments in which we 
all work.
MITIE endorses the Business for 
Social Responsibility deﬁ nition 
of Corporate Responsibility as; 
‘achieving commercial success in 
ways that honour ethical values 
and respect people, communities, 
and the natural environment’ . This 
year , by working closely with our 
stakeholders to improve our CR 
policies, practices and procedures, 
we managed to continue our 
success in improving our CR 
performance and achieved an 
overall score of 81.5% (2007: 70.0%) in 
the Business in the Community (BiTC) 
CR Index. For the second year in a 
row, we are featured as one of the 
Top 100 ‘Companies that Count’ 
for companies who completed 
the BiTC CR Index. We’re pleased 
to announce that this year , MITIE 
has improved on its bronze award 
last year and is now listed in the 
‘silver’ section of the ‘Companies 
that Count’ survey published in the 
Sunday Times in May 2008.
This year we have again published 
a separate CR Report which will be 
issued to all of our shareholders. The 
report provides more detail on our 
CR activity and related performance 
measures during the year.
Health and safety
The health and safety of our people 
is of principal importance for us at 
MITIE. We set high standards and 
we expect everyone to play their 
part in maintaining them. MITIE has 
a team of over 60 dedicated health 
and safety professionals working 
in our business, engaged in formal 
programmes to improve our health 
and safety performance across our 
business on an ongoing basis. 
As a Company of world-class people 
delivering world-class services, we 
have an extensive range of training 
programmes available to all our 
people, including over 25 health 
and safety training courses. In the 
year over 2,000 people successfully 
completed these courses that 
included; Working Safely, Managing 
Safely, Management of Work at 
Height and Safe Driving. 
The results of our efforts are there 
to see. In addition to the positive 
feedback we have had from our 
employee surveys, we achieved a 
23% reduction in major injuries during 
the year , with a 22% reduction in the 
reportable incident rate. Regrettably 
we received four enforcement 
notices during the year and we 
have put in place remedial actions 
to address the issues raised and learn 
the lessons across the Group.
We have now held four Health 
Awareness Days at our ofﬁ ces 
across the UK, giving our people 
access to medical information and 
advice at work. They can have a 
full check-up on-site during working 
hours, including body mass index, 
cholesterol checks, diabetes test, 
and lung capacity testing. 
During the year we increased 
our focus on teleconferencing, 
car pooling and public transport 
as ways to cut down our ﬂ eet’s 
carbon emissions, and reduce 
the risks to our people from driving 
related incidents. That said, driving 
will always be a necessary part 
of our business, especially for our 
emergency response vehicles. 
However , there is still a great deal 
we can do to make it as safe and 
efﬁ cient as possible.
One way we’re doing this is through 
the government-backed safe and 
fuel efﬁ cient driving scheme, or 
SAFED. Some of our people have 
now attended this course, which 
gives them tips on safer and more 
environmentally friendly driving. 
Workplace
As a people business, we treat every 
one of our 49,505 people who work 
for us with respect. We’re passionate 
about helping our people reach 
their full potential, because the 
more successful they are, the more 
successful we are. We ensure they 
have the skills, training and support 
they need to excel, and a fair , 
equal and responsible environment 
to work in. 
Training is important for everyone, at 
every stage of their career. We offer 
an integrated career and personal 
development programme to all 
levels of our workforce. Last year 
over 21,000 MITIE people undertook 
one or more of our wide range 
of training courses. Furthermore, 
since the start of our relationship 
with the Institute of Leadership and 
Management (ILM) in April 2006, 
almost 1,000 MITIE people have 
completed ILM courses, including 
ILM Level 2 in Team Leading, ILM 
Level 3 in First Line Management 
and ILM Level 5 in Management.  MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 37 
“ Alternative 
energy is a key 
ingredient in 
our low carbon 
schemes.”
quietrevolution
We have now made quietrevolution 
turbines a key component of many of 
our low carbon schemes, and an integral 
part of our Engineering Services division’s 
new microgeneration offering. In the 
past, many wind generation schemes 
were often refused planning permission 
because of noise, vibration, or the 
impact on their surroundings. However , 
quietrevolution’s designs have managed 
to deal with almost all of these objections, 
which is why so many local councils 
across the UK recommend them for small-
scale urban wind generators.
quietrevolution turbines are virtually 
silent, and can generate 10,000kWh a 
year , equivalent to 10% of the energy 
requirements of a 600m
2
 ofﬁ ce building. 
In the UK, this is equivalent to displacing 
4,000–6,000kg of annual CO
2
 emissions 
associated with grid-generated electricity. 38 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
We have also developed our in-
house Navigator men’s personal 
development programme and 
SpringBoard women’s personal 
development programme which 
were launched in April 2007. These 
programmes have been speciﬁ cally 
developed for non-managerial 
people and give advice on a wide 
range of issues both in and out of the 
workplace, from getting a promotion 
to building self-conﬁ dence. Coming 
out of the programme, candidates 
moved forward with their action 
plans and were offered individual 
trained mentors to support their 
future development. 
On 14 June 2007 MITIE became one 
of the ﬁ rst employers to make the UK 
government Skills Pledge – a speciﬁ c 
and voluntary promise, made by 
an employer to its employees, that 
every eligible member of staff will 
be helped to gain basic literacy 
and numeracy skills and a full Level 
2 qualiﬁ cation, equal to ﬁ ve GCSEs 
at A*– C. Speaking at the launch 
last year Gordon Brown said: ‘In 
the future, skills will be the only 
route to prosperity and jobs.’ Our 
commitment to the Skills Pledge is 
a key part of our strategy: we will 
only deliver world-class services if 
we have skilled, competent and 
able people who can seize all the 
opportunities offered to them.
Signing up to the Skills Pledge gives 
us the opportunity to demonstrate 
publicly the importance MITIE places 
on investing in the skills of our people. 
MITIE’s commitment to developing 
a better skilled and qualiﬁ ed 
workforce beneﬁ ts our business’ 
competitive advantage, as well as 
aiding the training, development 
and employability requirements of 
our people.

and we’re pleased to announce 
that it’s just received Big Tick re-
accreditation for 2008. In the last 
three years the scheme has won 
prestigious Big Tick Excellence 
Awards, the 2006 PFM Partners with 
People Award and the Greater 
London Training Award. The 59
th
 
apprentice to go through the 
programme has recently been 
offered a full-time job with us, and 
29 young people found work with 
MITIE in London last year , the highest 
number so far.
Marketplace
We know that selecting the right 
suppliers and subcontractors is a 
key way to reduce business risk and 
improve performance. In fact we 
see our suppliers as partners in our 
own success, and we demand the 
same standards from those partners 
that we observe ourselves.
In 2007 we set up a new Supplier 
Improvement Programme to ensure 
that our main suppliers are aligned 
with our CR principles and apply 
‘downstream accountability’ in their 
own supply chains. Our partnering 
relationship with national building 
products supplier Wolseley has 
proven to be particularly rewarding. 
We see each other not just as 
trading partners and exchange 
CR knowledge and practice by 
participating in each other’s CR 
and Environment Forums. Wolseley 
generously support our Construction 
Skills Centres by providing materials 
and employment opportunities for 
the student apprentices. Wolseley 
also participate in our employee 
volunteering events.
Last year , our catering business 
managed to drive costs down and 
proﬁ ts up while at the same time 
improving our own sustainability 
performance, and satisfying clients’ 
demands for more sustainable 
products. By simply changing our 
confectionery supplier to a main 
grocery chain, our catering business 
saved approximately 64,000 food 
miles of deliveries to our sites. 
Likewise, by sourcing our bakery 
products locally, we’re investing in 
the surrounding communities and 
getting the freshest food available.
It doesn’t stop there though, over 
70% of our 57,000 black waste sacks 
are now made from bio-degradable 
materials as are the 4.5m napkins we 
use in our restaurants, and the 50,000 
disposable takeaway bags we give 
out with our deli-food. Additionally, 
our 160,000 fruit and yoghurt pots 
are now packaged in plastic cups 
made from polylactic acid. 
MITIE also endorses the International 
Labour Organisation’s Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work and the Ethical 
Trading Initiative ‘Base Code’. We 
ensure that employment with us is 
always freely chosen, freedom of 
association is respected, working 
conditions are safe and hygienic, 
child labour is not used, pay is not 
lower than the minimum wage, 
working hours are not excessive, 
regular employment is provided, 
and no harsh or inhumane treatment 
is allowed.
Environment
We know our business can have an 
impact on the natural environment, 
and we do what we can to 
minimise and mitigate this by using 
environmentally-friendly materials 
and practices. We have developed 
our products and services to meet 
the environmental demands of our 
clients and are proud to help them 
achieve their environmental targets.
In November 2007 our work in energy 
management and sustainability with 
the Department for Culture, Media 
and Sport was recognised at the 
Premises and Facilities Management 
annual awards, where we picked up 
the Partners in Sustainability Award 
2007. We were also awarded a 
Green Apple Award for our work on 
the same contract. At the beginning 
of the year we implemented an 
energy action plan and a number of 
other sustainability initiatives, helping 
to support the department in its drive 
to achieve its environmental targets. 
To date the plan has identiﬁ ed 
savings of £83,000 per year and the 
equivalent of 546 tonnes of CO
2
. 
Our work has also helped them 
become the ﬁ rst Whitehall 
government department to 
be accredited by the Carbon 
Trust’s Energy Efﬁ ciency 
Accreditation Scheme.
Last year we won a highly 
commended certiﬁ cate in the FM 
Excellence Awards for Sustainability, 
to recognise our partnership with 
Castle V ale School in Birmingham, 
home to one of our Skills Centres. The 
award was for our support for their 
entry in the ‘Go Green’ challenge 
on Teachers TV. One of MITIE’s 
energy managers, voted NEMEX 
Energy Manager of the Year 2007, 
worked closely with both staff and 
pupils to help them reduce their 
electricity and gas use by 10% in a 
single term. The total amount saved 
came to 51 tonnes of CO
2
, and over 
£8,000 per year. 40 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Skills for life
Over 500 students are currently 
studying on nationally recognised 
construction vocational courses 
in the MITIE Skills Centres.
As part of the government’s 
renewable energy drive every major 
new building in the UK must now 
generate at least 10% of its power 
on-site from renewable sources. 
Faced with this challenge Standard 
Life Investments came to us to help 
them install a geothermal energy 
system at their new Guildford ofﬁ ces. 
The project is due for completion in 
October 2008, and we will also be 
carrying out the mechanical and 
electrical elements of the design 
and build.
In addition to this, we have now 
made quietrevolution turbines a 
key component of many of our low 
carbon schemes, and an integral 
part of the engineering services 
team’s new microgeneration 
offering. A single turbine can 
generate 10,000kWh a year , 
equivalent to 10% of the energy 
requirements of a 600m
2
 ofﬁ ce 
building. The ﬁ rst project to go live 
was at Merton Abbey Mills in London 
which is used to power The Colour 
House Children’s Theatre. 
Community
We believe in giving something back 
to the many communities we work 
in: building links with local businesses, 
supporting our people in their own 
neighbourhoods, and reinforcing 
our reputation as a responsible 
Company. The value of our 
community investment during the 
year amounted to nearly £600,000. 
We will continue to give our skills 
and our time, as well as money to 
supporting employee volunteering 
and fundraising. We play our part 
in communities across the world, 
as well as at home in the UK.
Our Skills Centres are particularly 
close to our hearts, and are our most 
important and visible commitment 
to supporting the development of 
young people. The ﬁ rst Skills Centre 
was opened in Portsmouth in 2001 
and was hailed at the time as a 
revolutionary new way to tackle the 
vocational skills shortage facing the 
UK by bridging the gap between 
education and employment. The 
centres give school children an 
introduction to construction and 
building skills. Over 500 students 
are currently studying on nationally 
recognised construction vocational 
courses in the MITIE Skills Centres.
During the year we opened a further 
Skills Centre at Caldervale High 
School in Airdrie – the ﬁ rst of its kind 
in Scotland.
MITIE’s people have a wealth of skills 
and experience that we can share 
with the community. Since 2005, 
over 1,000 students have beneﬁ ted 
from our ‘World of Work’ days, 
which are designed to increase 
their employability skills. 
We are keen to expand the 
understanding of opportunities 
within the workplace to more 
young people, and in 2008/09 
we’ll build upon the ‘World of Work’ 
programme. This initiative will be 
designed to help young people 
to understand the roles that could 
be available to them when they 
leave school.
Our work with the Bansang Saving 
Lives Appeal continued. From its 
base in a remote area of the African 
bush, Bansang Hospital looks after 
the healthcare needs of some 
600,000 people from the Gambia, 
Senegal, Mali, Guinea Bissau, Guinea 
Conakry and refugees 
from Sierra Leone. 
The most recent work with the 
hospital was a complete reﬁ t of 
the old colonial building to create 
twelve single bedrooms and two self-
contained units for married medical 
staff. Our mechanical and electrical 
engineers worked alongside local 
workers on the new ‘MITIE House’, 
which opened in early 2008. 
The project used local materials 
wherever possible, as well as other 
items donated by our UK suppliers. 
As we continue to grow into a world-
class Company delivering world-
class services, our commitment, 
responsibility and levels of investment 
to our communities grows with us. 
Corporate responsibility

Corporate 
governance
The Board recognises that the manner in which the Group is governed is critical to the long-term success of the business. The Board 
is committed to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are achieved throughout the Group. 
This statement, together with the directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report, provides details of key aspects of MITIE’s corporate 
governance environment and explains the manner in which the Board has applied the principles and provisions of good governance as 
set out in section 1 of the Combined Code issued in June 2006 (the Code).
The Board
Board responsibility
Matters that are exclusively dealt with by the Board include: setting Group objectives and strategies; approving business plans and budgets 
and monitoring performance against these; approving material tenders, acquisitions, disposals, and business start-ups; approving the 
Group’s Half-yearly and Annual Report and Accounts; appointing and removing the Chairman, directors and company secretary; and 
monitoring the Group’s corporate governance arrangements. These matters are set out in a schedule of matters reserved for the Board 
which was approved by the Board on 19 May 2006 and which is available on the Group’s website, www.mitie.co.uk. 
Board of directors
On 1 April 2007 there were six executive directors, six independent non-executive directors, one non-independent non-executive director 
(Ian Stewart) and the Chairman. During the year two executive directors resigned from the Board (Colin Acheson and Colin Hale). In 
addition, as announced on 19 May 2008, the Chairman David Ord (having served six years as a non-executive director of MITIE) and Cullum 
McAlpine (having served ﬁ ve years as a non-executive director of MITIE) intend to resign as non-executive directors with effect from the 
conclusion of the AGM on 31 July 2008. These decisions to resign have taken account of the Board’s orderly succession planning. Roger 
Matthews (an independent non-executive director) will succeed David Ord as Chairman following the AGM. 
Directors are appointed and may be removed in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and the provisions of the 
Companies Act. All directors are subject to re-election at intervals of no more than three years in accordance with the Articles of Association 
and the Code. The names and biographical details of all directors serving on the Board as at 31 March 2008 are set out on page 48. As part 
of the formal Board evaluation, the Board has considered the performance of each director seeking re-election and is satisﬁ ed that they 
continue to be effective and demonstrate clear commitment to the role.
Board balance
As part of the ongoing review of Board performance (as set out below) the Nomination Committee and the Board have speciﬁ cally 
reviewed the roles of Chairman and senior independent non-executive director (SID), and the composition and chairmanship of each 
of its committees.
The Board and the Nomination Committee recognise that, notwithstanding the reduction in the number of executive directors on the Board 
from six to four during the year , there will be an imbalance in the number of executive and independent non-executive directors following 
the resignation of David Ord and Cullum McAlpine. The composition of the Board did not comply with provision A.3.2 of the Code prior to 
the resignation of Colin Hale in January 2008 and will similarly not comply with provision A.3.2 following the date of the AGM. The Board is 
broadly satisﬁ ed that the anticipated composition following the date of the AGM is appropriate having regard in particular to the integrity, 
skills, knowledge and experience of its directors and the size and nature of the business. The Board is also keen to ensure that the Board does 
not become too large and unwieldy. However , it is mindful of the need to maintain a balance of independent non-executive directors 
and non-independent directors and has accordingly reviewed its composition and has initiated a search process to recruit an additional 
independent non-executive director to the Board. It is hoped that this recruitment process will be concluded within a reasonable timeframe.
Board appointments
Chairman 
The Nomination Committee and the Board have reviewed the role of Chairman and resolved to appoint Roger Matthews as Chairman 
with effect from the conclusion of the AGM. This is in accordance with the Board succession planning in recruiting Roger Matthews in 
December 2006 and follows a period of familiarisation for Roger Matthews with the Group. In reaching this decision the committee and the 
Board prepared a detailed job speciﬁ cation for the role and determined that the appointment of an independent internal candidate from 
amongst the existing non-executive directors was in the Group’s best interests. As part of this process the committee and the Board have 
reviewed the independence of Roger Matthews as set out below.
Senior independent non-executive director (SID) 
Following Cullum McAlpine’s decision to resign from the Board, the Board has reviewed the role of SID and resolved to appoint David Jenkins 
to the role with effect from the conclusion of the AGM.
Committee chairmanships and composition 
The Board has similarly reviewed the composition and chairmanship of its committees with a view to ensuring that power and responsibility 
is not concentrated in a few individuals and that the committees draw appropriately on the range of skills and experience of the executive 
and non-executive directors. The following changes to the chairmanship and composition of the committees will, subject to re-election take 
effect on the conclusion of the AGM: 
•  David Jenkins will assume the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee;
•  Roger Matthews will step down from the Audit Committee; and
•  Roger Matthews will assume the role of Chairman of the Nomination Committee. 42 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Corporate governance
continued
Chairman and Chief Executive: division of responsibility
There is a clear division between the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive as formally set out in the terms of reference for each of these 
roles. These terms of reference have been reviewed as part of the review of the job speciﬁ cation of the Chairman.
The Chairman is responsible for the effective running of the Board. This includes ensuring that the non-executive directors contribute 
effectively and that the Board is aware of the views of major shareholders. He is also responsible for ensuring that the Board addresses major 
challenges faced by MITIE and for the effective performance of the Board and its committees. The Chairman is available to consult with 
shareholders throughout the year and is available at the AGM.
As Chief Executive, Ruby McGregor-Smith is responsible for all aspects of the operation and management of the Group and its business 
during the year within the authorities delegated by the Board. 
The role of the executive and non-executive directors
The executive directors are collectively responsible for proposing strategy and for making and implementing operational decisions. non-
executive directors are responsible for exercising their independent skill and judgement and contributing to the formulation of strategy, 
policy and decision making. The terms of appointment of the non-executive directors’ and the executive directors’ service contracts are 
available for inspection at MITIE’s registered ofﬁ ce, the head ofﬁ ce and at the AGM. 
Company secretary
Richard Allan was appointed as the company secretary on 21 May 2007 as successor to Suzanne Baxter. The company secretary is responsible 
for ensuring that Board procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed, as well as advising on all governance matters. 
Director independence
During the year , non-executive director independence was considered by the Board. The Board determined that all non-executive directors 
as at 31 March 2008, with the exception of the Deputy Chairman Ian Stewart, were independent in mind and judgement, and free from 
any material relationship that could interfere with their ability to discharge their duties effectively. Speciﬁ c consideration was given to David 
Jenkins’ prior role with Deloitte & Touche LLP , MITIE’s external auditors. The Board determined that David is independent given that he had 
not been involved in the provision of services to MITIE and the passage of time since his departure from Deloitte & Touche LLP. Additional 
consideration was given to directorships held by both Cullum McAlpine and David Jenkins on the Board of Renewable Energy Systems 
Holdings Limited and two of its subsidiaries. The Board does not consider these directorships to adversely impact either of the non-executive 
directors’ independence.
External appointments and commitments
Executive directors are permitted to accept appointments outside the Group providing permission is sought from the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive and that the additional appointments do not interfere with the directors’ ability to effectively discharge their duties. The 
commitments outside the Group of the executive directors are detailed on page 54. Executive directors are entitled to retain any fees 
earned from these external appointments. 
Board meetings
Directors are supplied with an agenda and supporting papers for all Board meetings on a timely basis. This ensures that each director is 
appropriately briefed and able to properly discharge their duties. Papers submitted regularly for the Board’s review include reports on: 
current trading and performance; corporate development activities; health and safety; and, matters relating to corporate governance. The 
Board will also receive, from time to time, detailed presentations from non-Board members on operational matters. The Board, its committees 
and its directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and, where appropriate, external independent legal 
advice funded by MITIE. 
All directors are expected, where possible, to attend all Board meetings and the AGM. During the year ended 31 March 2008, there were six 
scheduled Board meetings. Additional unscheduled Board meetings were held to deal with administrative matters, predominantly for the 
approval of the issue of shares. Dedicated budget review meetings have also been held. Directors’ attendance at scheduled Board and 
committee meetings (Audit, Remuneration and Nomination) of which they are members is shown in the following table:

In addition to scheduled Board and committee meetings during the year , the Chairman met with the non-executive directors on several 
occasions without the executive directors being present. 
Director appointment, induction and training
No new directors were appointed to the Board during the relevant period. However , the Board has a general policy that subsequent to 
appointment to the Board: all new directors are subject to re-election by the shareholders at the ﬁ rst AGM after their appointment; that 
each new director receives a tailored induction suitable to their role; and, that all new directors receive a tailored information pack which 
includes a copy of MITIE’s Memorandum and Articles of Association, latest Annual Report and Accounts, committee terms of reference 
and copies of recent Board minutes and supporting papers. In accordance with MITIE’s Articles of Association all directors are subject to 
re-election at least once in every three-year period. None of the executive or non-executive directors has a service contract with a notice 
period greater than 12 months. All directors have access to management and the operating businesses in MITIE at their request and have 
secure remote access to Board and other relevant papers held on a dedicated facility.
Review of Board performance
The Board is committed to effective and rigorous review of its performance and that of the committees and individual directors 
and accordingly a formal evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its committees and of each director is 
performed annually. 
Director performance evaluation for the current year has been carried out using a combination of formal appraisal questionnaires completed 
by all Board members and through informal meetings and discussions. The results of these reviews are reported to the Board and used to 
improve the Board’s performance. Results of the prior year appraisal process identiﬁ ed an overall level of satisfaction with the performance 
of the Board and that of its committees and directors. Additionally, action taken in response to this feedback included the need to continue 
to monitor the balance of executive and independent non-executive directors, and the sector relevant expertise of the independent non-
executive directors, and minor changes to the information reported to the Board. Similarly, action will be taken throughout the current year 
to introduce improvements as identiﬁ ed in the evaluation exercise undertaken for the year ended 31 March 2008.
The committees
The speciﬁ c duties and responsibilities of each committee are set out in its terms of reference which are available on the Group’s website, 
www.mitie.co.uk. Further details in relation to the composition, role and functioning of each committee are set out below.
Executive committee and executive board
During the year the Group operated an executive committee of the Board which managed the operational matters delegated to it by the 
Board. The committee members were the executive directors, and senior management were invited to attend speciﬁ c meetings. During 
the year , the Board approved the formation of an executive board which now fulﬁ ls the operational management role of the executive 
committee. The purpose of this change was to enable non-directors to be full participating members of the executive management team 
rather than involvement through invitation. The executive board is not a formal committee of the Board but operates on a review and 
consultative basis under the existing powers of the Chief Executive and other executive directors.
The executive committee now remains as a formal approval and signing committee of the Board.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists entirely of independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Cullum McAlpine. During the year the 
Audit Committee comprised David Jenkins, Ishbel Macpherson, Roger Matthews and Cullum McAlpine. All members of the committee are 
considered as being appropriately experienced to fulﬁ l its duties, while David Jenkins, Ishbel Macpherson and Roger Matthews continue 
to be deemed, as at the date of this report, by the Board to have signiﬁ cant, recent and relevant ﬁ nancial experience through their 
qualiﬁ cations and their previous appointments. 
During the year the Audit Committee invited the external auditors, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Head of Internal Audit to 
attend meetings of the committee. The committee also met separately with the external auditors and the Head of Internal Audit without the 
presence of the executive directors. 
Report of the Audit Committee
During the year the Audit Committee held three meetings. The matters under consideration at these meetings included: 
•  The Group’s Half-yearly Financial Report and Annual Report and Accounts;
•  Critical accounting policies and judgements;
•  The review of the external auditors’ audit plan, nature and scope of work and overall summary of key issues and judgements;
•  The re-appointment of the external auditors; 
•  The approval of fees for the external auditors;
•  The effectiveness of the external auditors including the appropriateness and skills of the audit team;
•  Compliance with the Group policy on the provision of non-audit services by the external auditors and maintenance of 
auditor independence;
•  The approval of the Group risk assurance framework and the internal audit plan for the year ending 31 March 2008 and for the year 
ending 31 March 2009;
•  The review of key internal audit reports and ﬁ ndings; and
•  The effectiveness of the internal audit function. 
The Audit Committee is committed to ensuring the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and conﬁ rms that the 
requirements of the Group’s policy on the provision of non-audit services were met. This policy restricts the external auditors from performing 
work which will result in them auditing their own work, making management decisions for the Group, creating a conﬂ ict of interest, ﬁ nding 
themselves in the role of advocate for MITIE or creating any potential threat to their independence. Additionally, the external auditors will 
only be considered for the provision of non-audit services if they are best suited to perform the work in question. Deloitte & Touche LLP also 
maintains its own internal controls designed to safeguard their independence. A summary of the fees paid to the external auditors is given 
in Note 4 to the ﬁ nancial statements.
The remit of the Audit Committee also includes monitoring the arrangements by which employees may raise concerns regarding any 
matters of ﬁ nancial reporting or other perceived improprieties across the Group. During the year ‘whistle-blowing’ activity has been 
communicated to the committee along with the results of investigations carried out. These investigations have not identiﬁ ed any material 
risks to the Group. 44 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Corporate governance
continued
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Remuneration Committee’s members were Ishbel Macpherson, David Jenkins, Graham Potts and Cullum McAlpine, all of 
whom are independent non-executive directors. The committee held ﬁ ve meetings during the year and is chaired by Ishbel Macpherson.
The key duty of the Remuneration Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the individual remuneration packages of 
executive directors. As a part of this process the committee oversaw the introduction of a LTIP (following shareholder approval at the AGM 
in July 2007) to reward, retain and incentivise senior members of the MITIE management team. During the year the committee has been 
advised by the following external remuneration consultants: New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in relation to the introduction of the LTIP; and, 
Kepler Associates in relation to executive director remuneration through formal benchmarking with market and industry comparators. The 
Board is responsible for reviewing and setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors. 
Nomination Committee
During the year the Nomination Committee comprised David Jenkins, Ishbel Macpherson, Cullum McAlpine and David Ord. On 26 July 2007 
Ruby McGregor-Smith was appointed as a member of the committee. During the year three meetings of the committee took place. A key 
function of the committee is to evaluate the balance and composition of the Board and ensure that new directors bring the requisite skills, 
knowledge and experience required for the role being considered. A full evaluation of succession planning was also undertaken by the 
committee during the year as described more fully above. 
Shareholder communications
The Board is committed to an ongoing dialogue with institutional and private investors. The principal method of communication between 
the Board and shareholders remains news announcements, the Half-yearly Financial Report, the Annual Report and Accounts, the 
CR Report and MITIE’s website, www.mitie.co.uk. A full programme of formal and informal events, institutional investor meetings and 
presentations are also held following the Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary Results announcements which are led by the Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director. The Chairman, SID and non-executive directors may attend and are available for additional 
meetings with shareholders upon request.
Latest Group information, ﬁ nancial reports, corporate governance and CR matters, Half-yearly Financial Report and Preliminary Results 
presentations, major shareholder information and all announcements are made available to shareholders via the MITIE website (www.mitie.
co.uk) which has a speciﬁ c area dedicated to investor relations. The 2007 AGM approved changes to the Articles of Association of the 
Company implementing the use of electronic communications as enabled under recent changes in company law. Under the new Articles 
the Company can communicate with its shareholders in three ways: in hard copy (as under the previous Articles); in electronic form to 
shareholders who have elected to receive documents electronically; and by making the document available on the website and notifying 
each relevant shareholder that the document or information has been made available on the website. The Company has deemed that 
any shareholder who failed, within 28 days of the 2007 AGM, to elect to receive either electronic or hard copy communications, has agreed 
to receive notiﬁ cation of documents made available on the Company’s website.
Signiﬁ cant importance is attached to investor feedback on the Group’s performance, and as such the executive board receives an investor 
relations report at each meeting detailing corporate news, share price activity, investor relations activity and major shareholder movements. 
The Board is updated by the executive directors on these matters and receives analyst feedback following the Half-yearly Financial Report 
and Preliminary Results presentations.
The AGM also allows shareholders to address and discuss any issues surrounding the Group directly with the executive and 
non-executive directors. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board recognises that it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is designed 
to support the Group’s pursuit of achieving its objectives and strategies and also the identiﬁ cation and management of risks that may 
impact upon MITIE and the environment in which the Group operates. The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failing to achieve these objectives and strategies, and it will only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement and loss. 
Key features of MITIE’s system of internal control are set out below.
Culture, responsibility and accountability
The Board and senior management are responsible for maintaining and developing a culture of integrity, competence, fairness and 
responsibility throughout the Group. Essential to this is the recruitment and retention of highly skilled individuals who promote the highest 
standards of integrity, competence, governance and ethical behaviour. 
Group policies and procedures support the business by providing an operational internal control framework for the Group, each division 
and operating business to work within which is appropriate to the nature of the business being undertaken. This framework is designed to 
balance the need for Group-wide consistency and control with the autonomy local management require to develop and manage each 
operating business successfully. 
In order to delegate responsibilities clearly and effectively to the Group’s operating businesses, and to ensure compliance with the matters 
reserved for the Board, a formal delegated authorities matrix is issued to all operating subsidiaries that includes both ﬁ nancial and non-
ﬁ nancial authorities and matters relating to strategy, contract approval, recruitment, capital expenditure, banking transactions and speciﬁ c 
Group policies. Each operating subsidiary is headed by a managing or regional director who has authority to manage their business within 
this framework of delegated authorities and Group policies and procedures outlined above.
To support the business further , the Group central team has a team of specialist resources with individuals responsible for speciﬁ c functions 
including legal, health and safety, IT , insurance, human resources, tax, pensions, purchasing, ﬁ nance and business risk. Regular dialogue 
between these functions and the operating businesses provides additional support and forms a key part of the system of internal control.
Information and communication
The Group maintains a number of systems and processes that report relevant information to Group executive management and the Board 
as necessary. This includes ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial information regarding business performance, compliance with policy and procedure, 
relevant regulations and business critical matters.
At an operational level each division and business holds regular executive board meetings. To maintain and develop relationships between 
separate divisions, and to address speciﬁ c matters, regional meetings are also held and are attended by regional representatives of each 
division. Senior Group management regularly attend these meetings.
The Group also maintains an extensive intranet which allows all employees to access key information as well as Group policies, procedures 
and guidelines.  MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 45 
Risk management
The Board conﬁ rms that there is a continuing process for identifying, evaluating, and managing signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group. The 
Board also conﬁ rms that this process has been in place throughout the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and Accounts, and that this process is monitored by the Board in accordance with the revised guidance on internal control issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council.
The process for identifying, evaluating and managing principal risks requires the Group and its principal businesses to consider strategic, 
operational, ﬁ nancial and compliance risks and the effectiveness of the mitigating controls based on a pre and post controls risk evaluation. 
The principal risks identiﬁ ed from this process are recorded on the Group’s risk register which is maintained by the Group’s Business Risk 
function. This register is reviewed by the Board twice a year and will similarly be reviewed by the executive board twice a year. 
Monitoring the system of internal control
The Board is responsible for monitoring the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Monitoring is carried out 
throughout the year via the receipt and review of various reports, presentations and discussions with management, as set out above. 
Speciﬁ cally, the Audit Committee supports the Board by monitoring and guiding the activities of the internal audit function, including 
approving the internal audit programme, reviewing regular reports from the function and via meetings with the Head of Internal Audit. The 
internal audit programme is designed to provide a level of assurance over key risks as identiﬁ ed in the Group risk register and is developed 
by the Head of Internal Audit who reports to the company secretary and independently to the Audit Committee. 
During the reporting period a review was initiated by the Audit Committee into the Group’s assurance framework encompassing both 
the Group’s Business Risk function and Group level controls, and the assurance framework within the operating divisions. The review was 
conducted by external consultants, Grant Thornton, who reported in November 2007. A number of recommendations set out in the report 
have been implemented in order to strengthen further the Group’s risk assurance framework.
The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from the external auditors who contribute a further independent perspective on certain 
aspects of the internal ﬁ nancial control systems arising from their work. As necessary the Audit Committee will have dialogue with the 
executive directors on their control responsibilities, and in particular , those relating to speciﬁ c matters reported by internal or external audit.
Reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control
The Board performs a formal annual assessment of the operation and effectiveness of the system of internal control and updates this 
assessment prior to the signing of the Annual Report and Accounts. This includes consideration of reports on principal risks, controls and their 
effectiveness from the heads of each central team function and an independent report from the Head of Internal Audit summarising key 
audit ﬁ ndings. The Board also holds discussions with senior management and reviews the results of a formal internal controls review and 
system effectiveness conﬁ rmation from each operating subsidiary.
The Board conﬁ rms that management has taken steps during the year to improve further the system of internal control, embed effective 
controls further into the operations of the Group and to address improvements as they come to management’s attention. These steps are 
monitored to ensure they are implemented appropriately and that ultimately they are effective. 
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board conﬁ rms that throughout the year ended 31 March 2008 the Group has complied with the provisions set out in section 1 of the 
Code with the exception that the Board did not consist of an at least equal number of independent non-executive and executive directors 
between 1 April 2007 and 14 January 2008. 46 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
The Group has an established risk management framework which is designed to identify, evaluate and manage the risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group. This framework is described further in the corporate governance statement. Within this framework, MITIE classiﬁ es risks into 
four distinct categories according to their potential impact on the Group:
•  Strategic – risks impacting long-term strategic objectives;
•  Operational – risks arising during day-to-day activities which if not managed could impact upon the running of the business;
•  Financial – risks directly impacting upon the ﬁ nances of the business; and
•  Compliance – risks relating to legal and regulatory sanctions and damage to goodwill arising from failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations.
Principal strategic risks
New business
The Group is increasingly tendering for and winning more complex and larger multi-service business. There is an associated increase in the 
risks relating to appropriate scoping and pricing of contracts to ensure a fair balance of risk and reward, securing balanced commercial 
terms and ensuring compliant delivery of services. Robust systems to gain visibility of these risks and manage them effectively will beneﬁ t 
the Group’s service delivery capabilities and ﬁ nancial performance, whilst any realisation of the negative effect of these risks would have 
a detrimental impact on the Group’s proﬁ tability and reputation. 
To ensure visibility and good management of these risks MITIE’s system of internal controls incorporates strict bid and contract review and 
approval mechanisms. Depending upon the scope and risk of a speciﬁ c tender a dedicated commercial bid team and other specialists 
are utilised. Effective contract management and monitoring procedures are used to ensure that ongoing risks are properly managed 
through the life of each relevant contract.
Loss of major contracts
MITIE has a number of major contracts which although not individually material by value to the Group are important in supporting our 
future growth. We adopt a key account management strategy for these contracts which includes, where appropriate, director-level client 
relationships, and we monitor closely key client relations, helping to reduce the risk of losing any of these contracts.
Acquisitions
MITIE continues to seek to acquire businesses that ﬁ t with, or complement our existing range of service offerings and culture. The strategic 
risks associated with acquisitions include: a failure to gain visibility of, and manage, risks that are assumed through acquisition; valuation risk 
relating to the acquisition; a failure to achieve a cultural ﬁ t; and, the synergistic and operational transition of the acquired business into the 
Group. If these risks were crystallised they could lead to material business disruption, and loss of proﬁ ts and associated investor conﬁ dence. 
These risks are managed and mitigated by the use of an experienced acquisitions team, supported by internal specialists and external 
professionals, and by the directors who closely monitor the acquisition process. All material acquisitions require full Board approval. Following 
any acquisition an executive director is appointed as an integration project sponsor with responsibility for ensuring that the acquired business 
is integrated successfully and the performance of the integration process closely monitored.
Infrastructure and systems
MITIE is increasingly dependent upon the successful implementation and ongoing operation of information technology infrastructure and 
related systems. Failure to improve and invest in our infrastructure and systems on a continuing basis and to ensure their ongoing operational 
integrity could impact MITIE’s ability to meet our operational commitments and may result in liabilities being incurred under customer 
contracts. MITIE’s infrastructure is continually reviewed by the Board to ensure it is appropriate to the operations performed and that it 
enables employees to deliver services to its clients successfully. The ongoing investment in a new SAP based ﬁ nance and HR system will 
improve and strengthen further MITIE’s IT infrastructure.
Reputational risk
MITIE operates in business sectors that are vulnerable to reputational damage through operational failings. Incidents that result in damage 
to MITIE’s reputation may impact existing customer relations, MITIE’s ability to attract future business, and damage to shareholder value. MITIE 
addresses this risk through the use of robust and well established operational procedures to ensure compliance with regulatory and legal 
requirements and with contractual obligations. Clearly deﬁ ned escalation procedures are in place to ensure that senior management have 
timely visibility of high risk matters.
Principal operational risks 
Health, safety and environment
The breadth and nature of activities that MITIE undertakes gives rise to a range of potential health, safety and environmental risks. These 
risks could impact upon MITIE, its customers, employees, members of the public and the environment generally through injury or loss of life, 
environmental damage, disruption to business activities, loss of reputation and the incurring of ﬁ nancial penalties. Speciﬁ c examples of 
potential risks encountered by employees include working at height, installing and maintaining electrical systems, using machinery and 
controlled chemicals, and operating in hazardous sites and public areas.
MITIE manages these risks through the maintenance of a culture that encourages every employee to take responsibility for their health and 
safety and where all operational activities have a strong safety focus. The Chief Executive is responsible for health and safety and is supported 
by the executive board, the head of health and safety and a network of dedicated health and safety experts within the business. All parties are 
committed to the continual development and improvement of processes and procedures to reduce the likelihood and impact of incidents. 
Training and education of all employees is a fundamental part of the improvement process and promotes a culture of both collective and 
individual responsibility for health and well being of our employees, our clients’ employees and the general public. 
Employee skill shortages
MITIE recognises that there may be skill shortages in some sectors in which the Group operates. This would impact upon our ability to mobilise 
and service new and existing contracts and potentially upon MITIE’s ability to grow its business generally. In order to recruit and retain the 
people that MITIE needs, we regularly review, at the appropriate level, our remuneration, incentivisation and reward structures. The Group 
continues its emphasis on equity-based incentivisation for employees and other employee incentive and reward schemes.
We place great emphasis on succession planning and on the need to train and develop all our employees. As part of this MITIE continues 
to provide work-based learning and training opportunities and currently employs 321 construction, engineering and other apprentices. 
MITIE also supports vocational education in the wider community by providing Skills Centres in secondary schools. In the last year we have 
opened our eighth Skills Centre.
Statement of principal risks and uncertainties MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 47 
Principal ﬁ nancial risks 
Liquidity
Maintaining sufﬁ cient levels of liquidity and ﬁ nancial capacity is essential to enabling MITIE to function at an operational level and to fund 
its growth strategy. Failure to manage liquidity properly could impact operational activities and the Group’s ability to grow further. Speciﬁ c 
liquidity risks include the ability to manage working capital and sufﬁ ciency of banking arrangements. 
The Group Treasury function is responsible for the management of liquidity risk and operates within a framework of policies and procedures 
that are approved by the Board. Forecasting, monitoring and reporting of cash ﬂ ows to senior management and the Board ensures the 
appropriate level of visibility over the processes to control this risk. Furthermore, within the reporting period, pre-existing, committed ﬁ ve-year 
banking facilities were extended by £80m on existing terms to £230m to provide ongoing funding to support the Group’s growth strategy. 
Further details regarding ﬁ nancial risk are shown in Note 23.
Principal compliance risks 
Pensions
Risks associated with the operation and management of the Group’s pension funds concern the ability of the pension fund assets to meet 
future pension liabilities. Within the Group this applies to MITIE’s own pension schemes and to pension liabilities assumed by MITIE where a 
workforce transfers to the Group under new business contracts and relevant legislation.
Trustees manage the MITIE Group pension funds and the required contribution rates are set on the basis of independent actuarial advice. 
Actuarial valuations are sensitive to changes in assumptions made regarding future events including mortality rates and the long-term return 
on scheme assets. The funding positions of these funds are regularly reviewed.
In respect of pensions schemes associated with transferring employees, for example the Local Government Pension Scheme, the principal 
risk concerns the potential for scheme liabilities to exceed scheme assets requiring increases in post-transfer contribution levels. MITIE 
manages this risk through ensuring that appropriate advice is obtained in the bidding and transfer process, that the risk is fairly and properly 
priced and that binding contractual commitments are secured as to how future liabilities are met and on the funding position on transfer. 
Further information regarding pensions is shown in Note 34.  48 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008

    Number of Ordinary shares of 2.5p each % of share capital
Fidelity International Limited      10,065,118  3.18%
Legal & General Group PLC      12,753,391  4.03%
Mirabaud Investment Management Limited      15,673,517  4.95%
In June 2004 the Company commenced a share buyback programme which has continued pursuant to the renewed authority given by 
shareholders at the AGM in 2007. During the year to 31 March 2008 there have been no further purchases by the Company of MITIE shares. 
The exact amount and timing of future purchases will be determined by the Company and will be dependent on market conditions and 
other factors. It is the Company’s present intention to cancel any shares it buys back, rather than hold them in treasury, but this policy will be 
reviewed on a case by case basis. Further details on the proposed renewal of powers for share buyback and the allotment of shares in the 
Company are provided in the notice of the AGM booklet. 
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
Under the Company’s Articles of Association holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to participate in any dividends pro rata to their holding. 
The Board may propose and pay interim dividends and recommend a ﬁ nal dividend for approval by the shareholders at the AGM. A ﬁ nal 
dividend may be declared by the shareholders in a general meeting by ordinary resolution, but such dividend cannot exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Company’s Articles of Association contain various provisions relating to voting rights attaching to Ordinary 
shares and restrictions on the transfer of Ordinary shares which are in line with standard administrative practice. No person holds securities in 
the Company carrying special rights with regards to control of the Company and the Company is not aware of any agreement between its 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares.
Board of directors
The membership of the Board as at 31 March 2008 and biographical details of the directors (including details of committee chairmanships 
and other positions held) are given on page 48. The notice of the AGM booklet contains details of those directors who are retiring by 
rotation and proposed for re-election. The Board considers that the performance of those directors proposed for re-election continues to 
be effective and that they demonstrate a strong commitment to their role.
On 19 May 2008 David Ord announced his intention to retire from his role as Chairman and as a director of the Company and Cullum 
McAlpine announced his intention to retire from his role as Chairman of the Audit Committee, senior independent non-executive director 
(SID) and as a director of the Company. These retirements will be effective on the conclusion of the AGM on 31 July 2008 and Roger 
Matthews will thereupon assume the role of Chairman. With effect from the conclusion of the AGM: David Jenkins will become Chairman 
of the Audit Committee; Roger Matthews will become Chairman of the Nomination Committee; and David Jenkins will become senior 
independent non-executive director. Further details on the selection process in respect of these appointments are provided in the corporate 
governance statement. During the year Colin Acheson and Colin Hale stepped down as executive directors of the Company.
Directors’ interests
Details of the beneﬁ cial and non-beneﬁ cial interests (including share options) of each director and connected persons in the Ordinary share 
capital of the Company are provided in the remuneration report.  50 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Directors’ indemnities
The Company maintains directors’ and ofﬁ cers’ liability insurance providing appropriate cover for any legal action brought against its 
directors and/or ofﬁ cers. The 2007 AGM approved various amendments to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company 
to extend the protection provided to directors in respect of any litigation against directors relating to their position as a director of the 
Company. These changes were made possible by recent amendments to company law. The amended Memorandum and Articles of 
Association speciﬁ cally provide that the Company may indemnify directors against any liability incurred in connection with any negligence, 
default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company and that the Company may fund defence costs. Individual directors 
would still be liable to pay damages awarded to the Company in any action against them by the Company and to repay their defence 
costs (to the extent funded by the Company) if their defence was unsuccessful.
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement that, as at the date of approving the ﬁ nancial statements, there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁ nancial statements. The directors are required to prepare the ﬁ nancial 
statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS) and have chosen to 
prepare Company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
In the case of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounts, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁ nancial 
statements present fairly for each ﬁ nancial year the Company’s ﬁ nancial position, ﬁ nancial performance and cash ﬂ ows. This requires the 
faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the deﬁ nitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and 
Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with IFRS where 
applicable. The directors are also required to: properly select and apply accounting policies; present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and, provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the speciﬁ c IFRS requirements is insufﬁ cient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁ nancial position and ﬁ nancial performance.
In the case of UK GAAP accounts, the directors are required to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year which give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these ﬁ nancial 
statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and, state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁ nancial statements.
The directors are responsible for: keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Company; safeguarding the assets; taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities; 
and, the preparation of a directors’ report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. 
The directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Financial statements published by the 
Company on this website are prepared in accordance with UK legislation which may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
To the best of each director’s knowledge: the ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS and contained within this Annual 
Report and Accounts, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or loss of the Group and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and, the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report includes a 
fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with the description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
Auditors and disclosure of information to the auditors
Each of the directors in ofﬁ ce as of the date of approval of this Annual Report conﬁ rms that:
•  So far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information (being information required by the auditors in the preparation of their 
report) of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
•  They have each taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of such information.
Deloitte & Touche LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in ofﬁ ce as auditors and the resolution to reappoint them will be proposed 
at the forthcoming AGM.
Events after the balance sheet date
There have not been any signiﬁ cant events since the balance sheet date. 
Financial instruments
The Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments comprise bank loans, ﬁ nance leases, overdrafts and performance guarantees. The principal purpose 
of these is to raise funds for general corporate purposes. In addition, various other ﬁ nancial instruments such as trade creditors and trade 
debtors arise from its trade. The use of interest rate swaps and currency swaps will be used to manage interest and currency risk when 
necessary or material.
Payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to comply with the terms of payment agreed with suppliers. Where terms are not negotiated, the Group endeavours to 
adhere to the suppliers’ standard terms. At 31 March 2008, the Group had 47 days’ purchases outstanding (2007: 48 days). MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 51 
Employee involvement, disability and opportunities
The Board remains committed to developing further a culture that encourages the inclusion and diversity of all of the Group’s employees 
through respecting and appreciating their differences, and to promoting the continuous development of employees through skills 
enhancement and training programmes. The Group’s employment policies are designed to attract, retain, train and motivate the very best 
people, recognising that this can be achieved only through offering equal opportunities regardless of gender , race, religion, age, disability 
or any other aspect of diversity. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons 
should, as far as reasonably possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Communication with employees continues to have a high priority. The Company maintains a group-wide intranet site and delivers 
bi-annual publications to all employees. Through the use of their own communication processes each of the Group’s businesses is 
encouraged to ensure that employees are kept informed on Group and individual business developments. 
Employees remain actively involved in the Group’s activities via an employee forum. This year the forum held two meetings chaired by 
Ruby McGregor-Smith. We look forward to an increase in involvement and activity of our company representatives.
Equity incentivisation of employees
The Board remains committed to fostering and developing a culture of equity involvement whereby employees should be encouraged 
to build a stake in the Company through the Company’s various equity-based incentive schemes. The Board believes that it is this culture 
of equity involvement that has driven the Group’s growth performance and that it assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed 
employees. During the year , and as approved at the 2007 AGM, the Group has: implemented the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) to 
incentivise and reward senior members of the MITIE management team; and has made adjustments to the discretionary (those not open to 
all employees) executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) to simplify the incentive effect for employees below Board level. The Board is seeking 
shareholder approval at the AGM for a change to the Group’s Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SA YE) to reduce the savings contract 
period from ﬁ ve years to three years. The Board believes that this is in line with general market practice and will make the scheme more 
attractive to, and should increase uptake of the scheme by, MITIE’s employees. 
The Group has historically grown by giving entrepreneurial managers the opportunity to create wealth for themselves by taking the risk 
of starting a new business, taking equity stakes at fair value in those new businesses in conjunction with MITIE and then, dependent on a 
pre-agreed pricing structure, offering to sell that stake to MITIE in exchange for MITIE shares. This incentivisation scheme typically provides 
for such managers to elect to offer their stake in their business to MITIE between the ﬁ fth and tenth years from the date of establishment of 
the business. Recipients of shares under this incentivisation scheme are generally restricted from selling the MITIE shares for a minimum of 
two years. The Board believes that this is a unique business model that has driven MITIE’s past performance and continues to ensure a close 
alignment in interest between MITIE shareholders and the management and employees of the Group. During the reporting period the 
Group further expanded its use of this incentivisation scheme through the restructuring and recapitalisation of the Group’s Security business 
and through the start-up of the Client Services business. It is the Board’s current intent to continue to utilise this incentivisation scheme.
Donations
Charitable donations were made during the year (amounting to £106,850 (2007: £116,650)) to charities serving the communities in which 
the Group operates. As a matter of policy, no political contributions were made during the year (2007: £nil). The total value of community 
investment as disclosed in more detail in our CR Report 2008 was £592,132 (2007: £611,836).
Electronic communications
The directors remain committed to improving and extending the methods in which the Company communicates with its shareholders and 
wish to move towards an increase in electronic communication. At the 2007 AGM, shareholders approved certain amendments which 
aligned the Company’s Articles of Association with the new provisions of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to electronic shareholder 
communications. The Board has been disappointed with the level of uptake by shareholders to date and would wish to encourage all 
shareholders to ‘opt in’ to electronic communications – thus realising the environmental and cost beneﬁ ts of reduced printing and carriage 
of hard copy reports and other communications.
AGM
The notice of the AGM to be held on 31 July 2008 is given, together with explanatory notes, in the booklet which accompanies this 
Annual Report.

Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
This remuneration report summarises the Company’s remuneration policy and particularly, its application in relation to the directors. 
The report describes how the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to directors’ remuneration in 
accordance with the Combined Code 2006, the directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relevant company law, and the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority. The Company’s auditors are required to report on certain sections of this report (the ‘audited 
information’) and to state if the report has been properly prepared in accordance with these regulations. Shareholders will be provided with 
an opportunity to vote on this remuneration report at the forthcoming AGM. Further details are contained in the notice of AGM booklet that 
accompanies this report. 
Shareholder approval will also be sought at the AGM for two changes in the Company’s existing equity-based employee incentive 
schemes. The ﬁ rst is a change to the maximum grant level of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The second, a reduction in 
the contract period under the all-employee MITIE Group PLC 2001 Savings Related Share Option Scheme, known as the Save As You Earn 
(SA YE) Scheme, from ﬁ ve years to three years. Details of these schemes are set out below and speciﬁ c details of the proposed changes are 
set out in the notice of AGM booklet that accompanies this report. 
Part 1: information not subject to audit
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the committee) has responsibility for determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors. It 
is also responsible for overseeing the operation of all equity-based employee incentive schemes operated by the Company. The terms of 
reference of the committee are available on the Group’s website (www.mitie.co.uk) and upon request. 
During the year , the members of the committee were: Ishbel Macpherson (Chairman); David Jenkins; Graeme Potts; and Cullum McAlpine. 
Certain decisions affecting Group remuneration policy were taken during the period immediately prior to the reporting period when Sir John 
Jennings was a member of the committee. Sir John Jennings retired on 30 March 2007 and Graeme Potts was appointed a member on 30 
March 2007 in his place. All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors. By invitation of the committee, meetings 
may also be attended by David Ord, Roger Matthews and Ruby McGregor-Smith. 
During the year , the committee was advised by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in relation to the introduction of the 2007 LTIP. In 
November 2007 the committee engaged the services of Kepler Associates to assist with a review of executive remuneration policy 
(including the remuneration of executive directors) and to review the LTIP and SA YE schemes. The proposed changes to these schemes are 
the result of this review. Other than remuneration advice, neither New Bridge Street Consultants LLP nor Kepler Associates provided any other 
services to the Company. 
Remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy for the Company’s executive directors and other Group senior executives is shaped by the need to recruit, retain 
and motivate individuals of the right calibre. The policy also has regard to the Company’s and the Group’s culture which encourages equity 
ownership in order to maximise the alignment between the Company’s executives and its shareholders and is a long-standing feature of the 
Group’s executive remuneration structures. The committee, and the Board, continues to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation 
has been a key driving force in the past success of the Group. Consequently, in order to maintain and develop further MITIE’s performance 
culture, the remuneration packages of executive directors and other Group executives should continue to contain signiﬁ cant performance-
related elements.
Chairman’s remuneration
The remuneration for the Chairman, David Ord, is recommended by the committee for approval by the Board. The level of remuneration 
for the Chairman reﬂ ects the responsibilities and commitment of this role and was reviewed during the year following receipt of advice from 
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in relation to market comparators. 
Non-executive director remuneration
The fees for the non-executive directors are set by the Chairman and the executive directors and they are reviewed annually. The fee level 
is designed both to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the levels of experience and 
skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the Group. The non-executive directors are paid a basic fee with 
an additional fee for chairmanship of committees, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company. 
non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Company’s schemes or the annual bonus scheme, nor do they receive 
pensions or ancillary beneﬁ ts. Further details of fees paid to non-executive directors are provided in the audited section of this report.
Executive directors’ remuneration
Overall policy
The committee has, during the year , further reviewed its policy in respect of remuneration for executive directors. Kepler Associates were 
engaged to assist in this process. The changes proposed to the LTIP scheme (as set out in greater detail below and in the notice of AGM 
booklet accompanying this report) will enable the Company to provide an executive director remuneration package that is more strongly 
weighted towards share-based incentives – reinforcing the link between the interests of executive directors and those of the shareholders. 
The overall package for executive directors consists of salary, an annual performance-related bonus, long-term equity-based incentives, 
pension contributions and other beneﬁ ts. The committee has continued its policy of providing a remuneration structure with a strong 
variable performance-related element. There are two key components of variable remuneration: the annual performance-related cash 
bonus and the performance-related LTIP. The committee believes that where the executive directors receive remuneration packages at 
or above the median of an appropriate Group of comparator companies, this appropriately reﬂ ects the relative outperformance of MITIE 
when compared with such sector and size comparator companies. 
Salary and beneﬁ ts
Salaries for executive directors are reviewed annually and any change to salary is generally made with effect from 1 April. Kepler Associates 
advised the committee during the year on a formal benchmarking process in respect of executive director pay which took account of 
pay levels in sector and size comparator companies. The committee also took account of a range of other factors when determining 
appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills of the individual directors. Details of the salaries of the 
executive directors during the year , together with the details of and value of other emoluments and beneﬁ ts are given below. MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 53 
Annual bonus scheme 
The annual bonus schemes for executive directors in respect of the reporting period were designed to enable the executive directors to 
share in the success of MITIE and, where relevant, the divisions for which the executive director is responsible. All the executive directors 
have a maximum annual bonus potential of 100% of salary. The bonuses payable to Ruby McGregor-Smith and Suzanne Baxter for the 
year were based on the achievement of Group budgeted performance levels. The bonuses payable to the other executive directors 
were calculated on the basis of 50% of their bonus being dependent on the achievement of Group budgeted performance levels and 
50% being calculated on the performance against budget of the respective areas of the Group’s business within each individual director’s 
direct control. The proﬁ tability performance targets for the year were delivered and as a result maximum awards under the scheme were 
paid to the executive directors.

Equity-based incentive schemes
The Group operates three equity-based incentive schemes from which awards can be made. The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) targeted 
at executive directors and other senior executives and the MITIE Group PLC 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) are both 
discretionary schemes and therefore not open to all employees of the Group. The SA YE, an Inland Revenue approved scheme, is open 
to all our UK employees.
LTIP
The LTIP was established in 2007 and is the principal equity-based incentive scheme for executive directors. Awards may be granted in 
the form of nil cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares. The committee is examining the possibility of granting awards using a 
combination of these award types. The committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based 
awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so. An award may not be granted after 26 July 
2017. No payment (other than in respect of individual recipients electing to pay income tax, where appropriate) is required for the grant of 
an award. Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable. 
Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met. The LTIP awards made in 2007 
are subject to performance conditions that require adjusted earnings per share (EPS), less inﬂ ation (measured by the retail prices index 
– RPI), to exceed certain performance thresholds over a three-year period. Where EPS growth is less than inﬂ ation plus 5% per annum 
none of the awards will vest. Awards vest in full for EPS growth equal to inﬂ ation plus 14% per annum. V esting will be on a straight-line basis 
for performance between these levels. Following advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP and a consultation exercise with the 
Company’s principal shareholders in 2007, the committee determined and continues to believe that EPS is the most appropriate long-term 
performance measure for MITIE. It brings the advantages of simplicity and visibility of the value of the award which the committee believes 
enhances the LTIP’s effectiveness as an incentive tool. In the event of a change-of-control, awards will be pro-rated both for time and 
performance, subject to the discretion of the committee.  54 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Currently an individual may not ordinarily receive awards in any ﬁ nancial year over shares having a market value in excess of 100% of annual 
base salary in that ﬁ nancial year. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, the rules currently allow for this limit to be 
increased to 200% of any employee’s annual base salary. It is proposed that the threshold in respect of annual grants is amended to 200% to 
allow certain executive directors, who have not otherwise had the opportunity, a greater possibility to build shareholdings in the Company, 
subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance targets. As part of its review of the LTIP , the committee considered the introduction of a 
second performance target for awards of over 100% of an executive director’s base salary. The committee decided against this believing 
it would dilute the clarity and simplicity of the scheme, and that a single target is more in keeping with the other successful equity-based 
incentive schemes that operate within the Group. It is also proposed to increase the maximum award in exceptional circumstances to 250% 
of base salary. The 2008 notice of AGM booklet accompanying this report contains further details of these proposed amendments.
Further details of the LTIP were provided in the 2007 notice of AGM booklet (available in the investor section of the MITIE website at www.
mitie.co.uk).
ESOS
The current ESOS was established in 2001. The scheme has been approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and options 
over shares to an individual limit of £30,000 can be awarded under the approved element of the scheme. Options have in the past been 
awarded under this scheme to executive directors but, following the introduction of the LTIP it is intended that the ESOS will be focused on 
employees below main Board level. The committee does not currently intend to make any further awards under the ESOS to executive 
directors or to other participants in the LTIP. There is a limit on the grant level set at 100% of an individual’s base salary and the scheme has, 
following changes to the scheme approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM, a single performance threshold for vesting of the options – 
average growth in earnings per share over the three-year vesting period must exceed inﬂ ation (measured as RPI) plus 4%. The scheme 
permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement of outstanding unapproved options with share appreciation rights. 
SA YE
The current MITIE Group PLC Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SA YE) was established in 2001. The SA YE is open to all qualifying 
employees within the MITIE Group including executive directors. HMRC rules restrict the maximum amount saved to £250 per month. When 
the savings contract is started, options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will be when the contract matures, 
at a discounted price set at the start of the scheme. In 2007 this discount was set at 13.5%. The scheme currently provides that the savings 
scheme will run for , and options cannot normally be exercised before, ﬁ ve years. The committee is concerned that take-up of the SA YE 
should be improved and the lapse rate reduced, and accordingly it is proposing that shareholders agree an amendment to the scheme 
rules to provide for a lesser savings contract period and option exercise period of three years. The notice of AGM booklet accompanying 
this report contains further details of the proposed amendments to the SA YE.
Dilution limits
For historic reasons the Schemes’ rules have incorporated limitations on the grant of equity-based incentives which exceed the ABI 
guidelines. These limitations have historically been that the Company will not issue in any ten-year period: more than 12% of the issued 
Ordinary share capital of the Company in respect of equity-based incentive schemes (both all-employee schemes and discretionary 
schemes); and more than 6% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company in respect of discretionary equity-based incentive 
schemes. However , the Company will endeavour to keep within the best practice ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital 
in respect of both all-employee schemes and discretionary schemes (the ESOS, LTIP and SA YE) and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes 
(the ESOS and the LTIP). In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available ‘headroom’ on a ten-year ﬂ at-
line basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital. As at 31 March 2008, the potential 
dilution of the Company’s issued share capital was equal to 6.2% of the issued share capital in respect of all outstanding options granted 
under the Company’s equity-based incentive schemes (which will be satisﬁ ed through the allotment of new shares), and 3.0% of the issued 
share capital in respect of all outstanding options granted under the Company’s discretionary equity-based incentive schemes (which will 
be satisﬁ ed through the allotment of new shares).
Shareholding policy
A shareholding policy for executive directors was introduced in 2007 at the same time as the LTIP. Under the current policy, all executive 
directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary. The committee recognises that the 
principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding 
requirement is met, executive directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares (net of taxes) that vest under the LTIP. 
In view of the proposal to increase the maximum level of LTIP award (as set out above), the committee has deemed it appropriate to 
increase the level of shares required to be held by any executive director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of their base 
salary to a level equivalent to 150% of base salary. 
The level of executive director share ownership as at 31 March 2008 expressed as a percentage of base salary is set out in the share 
ownership table below.
Policy on external appointments
The Board recognises that the appointment of executive directors to non-executive positions at other companies can be beneﬁ cial both for 
the individual director and the wider Group through the broadening of their experience and knowledge. Individual directors retain their fees 
in respect of any such appointments. Roger Goodman receives £25,000 per annum in fees in respect of his role as Chairman of Networkers 
International plc. Ruby McGregor-Smith receives £43,000 per annum in fees in respect of her role as a non-executive director of Michael 
Page International plc.

The mid-market price of MITIE Ordinary shares on the date of exercise was 263p per share.
The share options stated above were granted under the ESOS. The performance criterion for the Scheme that applied at the date of grant 
requires a percentage growth in the Company’s earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10.0% per annum compound over the period 
from the date of grant of the option to the date on which the option ﬁ rst becomes exercisable. The performance criterion selected is no 
different for the executive directors than for any other member of the Scheme. No payment was made for the grant of the options and 
there have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criterion for share options since the grant date. The market price 
of Ordinary shares of 2.5p each at 31 March 2008 was 242.00p.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of MITIE Group PLC
We have audited the group ﬁ nancial statements of MITIE Group 
PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated balance sheet, 
the Consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement, the Consolidated statement 
of recognised income and expense and the related Notes 1 to 
36. These group ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ remuneration report and the group ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are 
set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group ﬁ nancial 
statements give a true and fair view, whether the group ﬁ nancial 
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
whether the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as 
having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our 
opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent 
with the group ﬁ nancial statements. The information given in the 
Directors’ report includes that speciﬁ c information presented in the 
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Operating 
review, the Financial review and the Corporate governance 
statement that is cross referred from the Business review section 
of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂ ects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review by the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We 
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on 
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures or 
its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited group ﬁ nancial statements. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the group 
ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further 
information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group 
ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant 
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation 
of the group ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the group ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of 
the presentation of information in the group ﬁ nancial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  The group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the 
state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of its proﬁ t for 
the year then ended;
•  The group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation; 
•  The part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having 
been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985; and
•  The information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the 
group ﬁ nancial statements.

1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008 are prepared in accordance with International Accounting 
Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and 
as adopted for use in the European Union.  
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the 
preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 except for the adoption of new standards 
and interpretations, noted below. Adoption of these standards and interpretations did not have any significant effect on the financial 
position or performance of the Group. 
• Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures’; 
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; 
• IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’; 
• IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’; 
• IFRIC 10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’; 
• IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’; and 
• Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’. 
The following standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective. The directors do not anticipate that the 
adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material financial impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period 
of initial application. 
• IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’; 
• IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’;  
• IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’;  
• IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 Ceiling and Minimum Funding Requirements’;  
• IAS 1 (Revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’; 
• IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’; 
• IFRS 3 ( Revised) ‘Business Combinations’; 
• Amendment to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’; and 
• Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’. 
Significant accounting policies under IFRS 
The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group’s IFRS financial information are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of MITIE Group PLC and all its subsidiaries. The financial 
statements of the parent Company and subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(UK GAAP). Adjustments are made in the consolidated accounts to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist 
between UK GAAP and IFRS. 
All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated  
in full. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
Interests of minority Shareholders are measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of 
the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition 
date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non Current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, 
after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Cost of acquisition 
includes all deferred amounts that become payable in the future. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. It is 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
the profit or loss on disposal.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
66 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008  
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to 
being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets identified in a business acquisition are capitalised at fair 
value as at the date of acquisition.  
Development expenditure relating to software is capitalised as an intangible asset if the asset created can be identified, if it is probable 
that the asset created will generate future economic benefits and if the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Following initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation expense is charged to administrative expenses in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over its useful life. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue represents fee income recognised in respect of services provided during the period (stated net of value 
added tax) and is earned solely within the United Kingdom. 
Revenue from multi-service contracts consists of various components which operate independently of each other and for which 
reliable fair values can be established. Accordingly, each component is accounted for separately as if it were an individual 
contractual arrangement. 
Revenue from long-term contracts represents the sales value of work done in the year, including fees invoiced and estimates in respect 
of amounts to be invoiced after the year end. Profits are recognised on long-term contracts where the final outcome can be assessed 
with reasonable certainty. In calculating this, the percentage of completion method is used based on the proportion of costs incurred 
to the total estimated cost. Cost includes direct staff costs and outlays. Full provision is made for all known or anticipated losses on each 
contract immediately such losses are forecast. 
Gross amounts due from customers are stated at the proportion of the anticipated net sales value earned to date less amounts billed 
on account. To the extent that fees paid on account exceed the value of work performed, they are included in creditors as gross 
amounts due to customers. 
Variations in contract work and claims are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated before investment revenue and finance costs.  
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in 
which they are incurred. 
Leasing 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.  
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any 
lease incentives are amortised over the lesser of the life of the operating lease or to the first opportunity for termination. 
Foreign currency 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.  
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss 
for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for 
the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised 
directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
Retirement benefit costs  
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes and participates in a number of other defined benefit schemes. In respect 
of the other schemes in which the Group participates, the Group accounts for its legal and constructive obligations over the period of 
its participation which is for a fixed period only. 
In addition, the Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees. 
Payments to the defined contribution and stakeholder pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.   
MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 67 
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised outside profit and loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-
line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this 
calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit 
nor the accounting profit. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is charged 
so as to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property – over 50 years 
Leasehold improvements – period of the lease 
Plant and vehicles – 3–10 years 
Annually the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs represent materials, direct labour and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location. Net 
realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and estimated selling 
costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises financial assets and liabilities only when the contractual rights and 
obligations are discharged or expire. 
Assets that are assessed not to be individually impaired are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective 
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables includes the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, the number of 
delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period as well as observable changes in national or local economic 
conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly with the exception of trade receivables, where the 
carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectable, it is 
written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance 
account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
68 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008  
1. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
Financial assets comprise loans and receivables and are measured at initial recognition at amortised cost. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in 
the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in 
which they arise. 
Trade payables are measured at fair value. There are no financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit and loss or held for trading. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an 
insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The 
expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost. 
Pre-contract costs 
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award (or full recovery of costs) is virtually 
certain. Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within trade and other receivables. On the contract award these bid 
costs are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by reference to the stage of completion of the contract 
activity at the balance sheet date. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair 
value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to 
equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 April 2005. 
2.  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 above, management has made the 
following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised for certain project based contracts based on the stage of completion of the contract activity. This is measured 
by comparing the proportion of costs incurred against the estimated whole-life contract costs except where this would not be 
representative of the stage of completion. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated. The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of cash-generating units and also the 
selection of the appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to use in order to calculate present values. The carrying value of 
goodwill is £203.3m (2007: £148.4m) at the balance sheet date; see Note 11.  
Retirement benefit obligations 
The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, 
future returns on assets and future contribution rates. The present value of retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date is 
£129.4m (2007: £143.3m); see Note 34.

Corporation tax is calculated at 30.0% (2007: 30.0%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. 
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the consolidated income statement as follows:

In addition to the amount charged to the consolidated income statement, deferred tax relating to retirement benefit costs, share-
based payments and short-term timing differences amounting to £2.3m has been charged directly to equity (2007: £1.8m credit) (see 
Note 19). The benefit of tax savings relating to retirement benefit costs and share-based payments amounting to £0.8m (2007: £0.5m) 
has been credited directly to equity. 
The reduction in the corporation tax rate next year to 28% has not materially impacted deferred tax.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to 
benefit from that business combination. Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs in the following business segments, which is how

The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the 
period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs 
are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five 
years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2% per annum. This rate does not 
exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows from CGUs are as follows:

Before accepting new customers, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality  
and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring are updated as appropriate. The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation  
to trade receivables at the balance sheet date is the fair value of trade receivables. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base 
being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the 
allowance for doubtful debt.  
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Included in cash and cash equivalents are deposits totalling £12.4m (2007: £10.3m) held by the Group’s insurance subsidiary, which are 
not readily available for the general purposes of the Group. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned 
by recognised international credit-rating agencies.

unsecured loan notes which are repayable between 2008 and 2013. The secured loan notes are supported by a bank guarantee. 
During the year £1.6m of loan notes were issued to the vendors of Robert Prettie (Note 29); £7.0m of loan notes in respect of MITIE 
Security (London) Limited (formerly MITIE Trident Security Limited) and £1.0m of loan notes in respect of The Watch Security Limited  
were redeemed. 
All borrowings are in sterling. The directors estimate that the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings approximates their fair value.

conditions precedent had been met. The facilities have an expiry date of January 2012. The loans carry interest rates which are 
currently fixed at 6.1% and are currently determined at 0.4% over LIBOR. The overdraft carries interest at 0.9% over base rate. The 
secured loan notes are backed by a bank guarantee. Details of the Group’s contingent liabilities are provided in Note 31.

23.  Financial risk management objectives 
The Group’s Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. These risks include credit 
risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and market risk. 
Credit risk  
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables. 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. In addition, where appropriate, certain debts 
are subject to credit insurance. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group has very limited trading transactions in foreign currency and currently there is no hedging of these exposures. Any material 
transactions would be appropriately hedged. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a cash flow projection model which considers the maturity of the Group’s assets 
and liabilities and the projected cash flows from operations. Bank facilities which allow for appropriate headroom in the Group’s daily 
cash movements are then arranged. 
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities:

 Financing liabilities 30.9 2.8 33.7 
 Financial liabilities 240.1 2.8 242.9 
Market risk  
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of interest rates. However, all Group debt is currently due to short-term working 
capital fluctuations and hence is not hedged as at 31 March 2008. The Group’s Treasury function reviews its risk management strategy 
on a regular basis. 
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended 
31 March 2008 and reserves would decrease/increase by £0.1m (2007: £0.1m).  
Capital risk management  
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt per Note 25 
and equity per Note 28.  
The Group’s capital structure is reviewed regularly. The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

The average remaining lease term is 23 months (2007: 28 months). For the year ended 31 March 2008, the average effective borrowing 
rate was 5.8% (2007: 5.3%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements 
have been entered into for contingent rental payments. All lease obligations are denominated in sterling. 
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are 
secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

During the year £0.2m of deferred consideration in respect of the purchase last year of the minority shareholdings in MITIE Engineering 
Maintenance (South West) Limited was settled by the issue of new MITIE shares giving rise to a merger reserve of £0.1m. 
Provision is made for contingent deferred consideration, which may become payable from 2008–2013 subject to profit targets being 
attained, at the best estimate of the directors. A total of £1.1m was provided for deferred consideration to the minority shareholders of 
MITIE Technology Limited and MITIE Engineering Services (Liverpool) Limited, £15.3m in respect of Robert Prettie (including the 
unwinding of discounted deferred contingent consideration) and £4.5m in respect of other current year acquisitions. 
The provision for insurance claims represents amounts payable by MITIE Reinsurance Company Limited in respect of outstanding claims 
incurred at the balance sheet dates. These amounts will become payable as each year’s claims are settled.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Purchase of Robert Prettie  
On 2 April 2007 MITIE acquired 100% of Property Services company Robert Prettie for estimated total consideration of £23.6m. The 
transaction was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Below we provide final information on the fair value of net

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Robert Prettie is attributable to the underlying profitability of the Company, expected 
profitability arising from new business and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from assimilation into the Group.  
The Company contributed £49.1m to revenue and £3.3m to the Group’s profit before tax for the period. Integration costs of £0.4m 
have been absorbed within the Property Services division. As the Group acquired Robert Prettie on 2 April 2007 there is no difference 
between the revenue and profit as reported from that which would have been made had the acquisition been made on the first day 
of the financial year. 
The unwinding of the discounted deferred contingent consideration gave rise to a £0.8m finance charge in the year.

The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the underlying profitability of the businesses, expected profitability arising from 
new business and the anticipated future operating synergies arising from assimilation into the Group.  
The companies contributed £1.2m to revenue and £0.1m to the Group’s profit before tax for the period. Had the Group acquired the 
companies on the first day of the financial year they would have contributed £28.2m to revenue and £1.9m to profit before tax. 
The unwinding of the discounted deferred contingent consideration gave rise to no material finance charge in the year.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Additions to fixtures and equipment during the year amounting to £2.2m (2007: £1.7m) were financed by new finance leases.  
Cash and cash equivalents (which are presented as a single class of assets on the face of the balance sheet) comprise cash at bank 
and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. 
31. Contingent liabilities  
The Company is party with other Group companies to cross guarantees of each other’s bank loans, commitments and overdrafts of 
£270m (2007: £190m). 
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims that are in the ordinary 
course of business. The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in 
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. 
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been accrued at the directors’ best estimate of the likely future obligation of £20.9m 
per Note 26. The actual amounts payable may vary up to a maximum of £31.2m dependent upon the results of the acquired businesses. 
In addition, the Group and its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance, issued by financial 
institutions on its behalf, amounting to £9.2m (2007: £19.0m) in the ordinary course of business. These are not expected to result in any 
material financial loss.

33. Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share option schemes 
The Company has five share option schemes: 
The MITIE Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP was introduced in July 2007 following shareholder approval at the AGM. The awards of shares or rights to acquire shares (the 
awards) are offered to a small number of key senior management. Where offered as options the exercise price is nil. The vesting period 
is three years. If the awards remain unexercised after a period of four years from the date of grant, the awards expire. The awards may 
be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group. Before the awards can be exercised, a performance condition must be satisfied; the 
number of awards that vest is determined by a sliding scale of between 5.0% and 14.0% above the Retail Price Index per annum 
compound growth in earnings per share over a three-year period. 
The MITIE Group PLC 1991 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme is open to all employees. The exercise price is equal to the market value of the shares on the date 
of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the 
options expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group. No options have been granted under this scheme since 
August 2001. 
The MITIE Group PLC 2001 Executive share option scheme  
The Executive share option scheme is open to all employees. The exercise price is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of 
grant. The vesting period is three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options 
expire. Options may be forfeited if the employee leaves the Group. Before options can be exercised, the performance condition that must 
be satisfied is that the percentage growth in the earnings per share over a three-year period must be equal or greater than 10.0% per 
annum compound in respect of awards prior to 26 July 2007 and 4.0% above the Retail Price per annum thereafter. 
The MITIE Group PLC 1991 and 2001 Savings related share option scheme 
The Savings related share option scheme is open to all employees. The exercise price is not less than 80.0% of the market value of the 
shares on the day preceding the date on which invitations to participate in the Scheme are issued. The vesting period is five years. If 
the options remain unexercised after a period of five years and nine months from the date of grant, the options expire. Options may be 
forfeited if the employee leaves the Group. No options have been granted under the 1991 scheme since August 2001.

 Included within this balance are 0.8m (2007: 2.3m) options that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted on or 
before 7 November 2002. These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

  1.5 1.1 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 264p (2007: 216p). The 
options outstanding at 31 March 2008 had exercise prices ranging from 58p – 254p (2007: 58p – 191p) and a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of 5.1 years (2007: 5.1 years). In the year ended 31 March 2008, options were granted in July and August 2007 
in respect of the LTIP, Executive and Savings related share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options 
granted on those dates is £3.0m. In the year ended 31 March 2007, options were granted in June and July 2006 in respect of the 
Executive and Savings related share option schemes. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates 
is £1.5m. 
The fair value of options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 
  2008 2007 
 Share price (p) 133–230 130–193 
 Exercise price (p) 0–254 120–191 
 Expected volatility (%) 27–30 28–30 
 Expected life (years) 4–6 4–6 
 Risk-free rate (%) 4.17–5.25 4.17–5.12 
 Expected dividends (%) 1.43–2.29 1.43–2.29 
Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes. The expected life is based upon 
historical data and has been adjusted based on management’s best estimates for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

34. Retirement benefit schemes  
Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes 
are held separately from those of the Group in funds controlled by the scheme providers.  
Defined benefit schemes 
Group defined benefit schemes 
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme and the MITIE Group PLC 
Passport Pension Scheme where MITIE Group PLC is the principal employer. 
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the Group. Contributions to the schemes are charged to the income statement so 
as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees’ working lives with the Group.  
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0 and 66% of final salary on attainment of a 
retirement age of 65. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The schemes are funded schemes. 
The most recent actuarial valuations of the Group schemes’ assets and the present value of their defined benefit obligations were 
carried out at 1 April 2005 by Mr David Higgs, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. 
Other defined benefit schemes 
Grouped together under ‘Other schemes’ are three (2007: two) schemes in which the Group is a participating employer and several 
schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers’ defined benefit schemes in respect of 
certain TUPE employees. These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each balance sheet date. The present values of the defined 
benefit obligations, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
For the Admitted Body Schemes (principally the West Midlands Pension Fund), which are all part of the Local Government Pension 
Scheme, the Group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts. The Group is required to pay regular 
contributions as decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes’ Schedule of Contributions. In a number of 
cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess recovered from the body that the employees transferred 
from. In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the Group will be required to pay any deficit (as determined by the 
Scheme Actuary) that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme.

 Future pension increases  3.30 3.00 3.30 3.00 
The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return of each asset class. The expected 
return on equities is the sum of dividend growth and capital growth net of investment expenses. The return on gilts and bonds is the 
current market yield on long-term bonds. The expected return on property has been set equal to that expected on equities less a 
margin. The expected return on other assets is the rate earned by the scheme on cash.

The pension schemes have invested in property occupied by the Group with a fair value of £3.2m (2007: £3.2m) generating rental of 
£0.3m (2007: £0.3m). At 31 March 2008 the pension schemes held 53,000 of MITIE Group PLC shares (2007: nil). The pension schemes 
have not invested in any other assets used by the Group. Transactions between the Group and the pension schemes are conducted 
at arm’s length. 
The mortality for the Group schemes is based upon up to date tables which project mortality improvements in the future. For a male 
aged 65.0 years the expected life is 85.1 years (2007: 85.1 years) and for a female aged 65.0 years the expected life is 88.0 years (2007: 
88.0 years). Mortality for the other schemes is that used by the relevant scheme actuary.

90 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008  
We have audited the parent company financial statements of 
MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008 which 
comprise the company balance sheet and the related Notes 37 
to 50. These parent company financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the group financial statements 
of MITIE Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2008 and on the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited.  
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this  
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the directors’ remuneration report and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK  
and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial 
statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes 
that specific information presented in the Chairman’s statement, 
the Chief Executive’s review, the Operating review, the Financial 
review and the Corporate governance statement that is cross 
referred from the Business review section of the Directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report  
as described in the contents section and consider whether it  
is consistent with the audited parent company financial 
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information 
outside the Annual Report. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
parent company financial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made  
by the directors in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies  
are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent company financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent 
company financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• The parent company financial statements give a true and  
fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2008; 
• The parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
• The information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.

37. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by company law. They have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.  
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding 
year with the exception of FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ which was adopted in the current year. The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption allowed by paragraph 2D (b) of FRS 29 not to make these disclosures in its own entity financial statements 
as the consolidated financial statements include the required disclosures for the Group. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.  
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is charged so as to 
write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives and is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows: 
Plant and vehicles – 3–10 years 
Software and development costs – 5–10 years 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the 
assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of tangible fixed assets is the 
greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in 
which they are incurred. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. Where the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, 
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any 
provision is charged to the profit and loss account, net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.  
Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to 
pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences 
arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are 
included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets 
where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment 
to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Financial instruments  
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the profit and loss account where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss 
account and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Trade payables are measured at fair value. 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of executive and employee share option schemes. For all grants of share options and awards, the 
fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the corresponding expense is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Options over the Company’s shares awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries 
are accounted for as a capital contribution within the carrying value of Investments in subsidiary undertakings.   
MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 93 
37. Significant accounting policies continued 
Pensions  
Pension costs represent amounts paid to one of the Group’s pension schemes. For the purposes of FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ the 
Company has been unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the main Group defined benefit pension 
scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Therefore the Company is accounting for contributions to the scheme as if it were a 
defined contribution scheme. Note 34 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the details of the IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ net 
pension asset of £7.5m (2007: £0.5m).  
38. Profit for the year 
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for 
the year. MITIE Group PLC reported a profit after taxation for the financial year ended 31 March 2008 of £27.0m (2007: £33.6m) before 
an exceptional unrealised gain of £187.7m which arose on the insertion of intermediate holding companies within the Group.  
The auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £40,000 (2007: £35,000).  
The average number of persons employed, being full time equivalents, by the Company during the year, including directors, was 107 
(2007: 76). 
The costs incurred in respect of these employees were:

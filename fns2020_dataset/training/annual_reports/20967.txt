Overview
Introduction
Across most of Europe’s
economies, there’s a weight
of debt that is bearing
down on people and
businesses, creating
strains upon the
individuals,
balance sheets
and societies.
What can
we do
about
it? Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 03
Overview
At
Arrow
Global
we’ re here
to turn this
potentially
very negative
circumstance upside 
down, and by putting
customers’ interests at 
the top of our agenda,  
create better outcomes for the  
cust omer , our clients and business.
Relieving the burden of problem debt.
As a leading purchaser and manager of 
debt, Arrow Global has a very simple, 
powerful ethos. We firmly believe that by 
putting the interests of our customers –  
those in debt – first, we are also able to 
best serve the interests of creditors,  
our own business, people, investors and 
partners, and society at large. The scale  
of unmanageable debt is a major issue  
for societies across Europe. In the UK 
alone, approximately 9 million people are 
struggling with it. 1.5 million are seeking 
advice and a further 1.8 million are said  
to be in denial.
Making problem debt 
manageable. We are 
currently helping more 
than 465,000 people 
repay their debts and in 
2014, 77 ,000 Arrow

Overview
Jonathan Bloomer
Chairman
5 March 2015 Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 07
Overview
Against a backdrop of increased regulation, 
we expect the trend for market 
consolidation to continue, with a smaller 
number of large, highly compliant 
providers emerging.
Arrow Global has been a FTSE-listed 
company for a little over a year and has 
settled into life as a PLC very successfully, 
having paid its maiden interim dividend 
and proposed a final dividend of 3.4p 
bringing the total full-year dividend to 5.1p.
Our achievements this year couldn’t 
have been delivered without the hard work 
of my fellow directors, the Group’s 
executive committee and colleagues from 
across the business as a whole.
We continue to refresh the composition 
of the board to ensure that it is best placed 
to operate effectively. On the retirement 
of Gillian Key-Vice from the board on  
27 November 2014, we announced that we 
were seeking a replacement. We were 
delighted to announce on 3 March 2015 the 
appointment of Lan Tu as a non-executive 
director with effect from 9 March 2015. 
Her strong financial and commercial 
pedigree, especially in the area of regulated 
financial services within Europe, will 
enable her to make a strong contribution 
to the Group and will complement the 
existing experience of the board.
As a board of directors, we remain 
firmly committed to serving customers 
and creditors, and have a very strong 
focus on treating customers fairly, which 
is also a key pillar of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s (FCA’s) oversight regime.
Our landing slot for full FCA 
authorisation is Q3 2015. This is an 
important date for us and a key deliverable 
for the business this year. As part of our 
preparations, we have embedded  
our three lines of defence model and, in  
April 2014, formally appointed BDO as 
internal auditors. 
Having reviewed the information  
in this report, my fellow directors and  
I confirm that the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the performance, strategy  
and business model of the company.
We look forward to a successful 2015, 
where we will continue to deliver for 
customers and shareholders alike, and hope 
to see many of you at our annual general 
meeting on 3 June 2015 in Manchester.
Chairman’s statement
2014 was another transformational year for  
Arrow Global Group PLC, perhaps most notably 
because of the acquisition of Capquest, following 
resounding shareholder approval at our general 
meeting in November. As part of the acquisition, 
we successfully raised €225 million through the 
issue of senior secured notes.
Our landing slot for  
full FCA authorisation  
is Q3 2015. This is an 
important date for us  
and a key deliverable  
for the business this year.  Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 08
Overview
Tom Drury
Chief executive officer
5 March 2015 Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 09
Overview
Our business is performing well, thanks 
to our focus on rigorous underwriting 
discipline and the quality of our data. Arrow 
Global is a dynamic, agile and fast-growing 
business and we are working hard to 
achieve our vision of becoming Europe’s 
leading purchaser and manager of debt.
We have increased underlying net 
income by 17 .7% to £29 .6 million delivering 
an underlying return on equity (ROE)  
in 2014 of 26.1%. Our profit attributable  
to shareholders increased by 20.9% to  
£18.3 million.
During the year, we invested over 
£300 million, consolidating our position 
in the UK with the acquisition of Capquest, 
and further developing our mainland 
European footprint. Here, we acquired  
a 15% interest in a French market leader, 
MCS, and entered the Dutch market with 
a small portfolio purchase. We also 
significantly increased the value of the 
assets we hold in Portugal.
We continued to focus on portfolio 
purchases with attractive returns, with 
organic purchases for the year totalling 
£1,267 .5 million by face value for a purchase 
price of £137.7 million, and an average 
120-month cash-on-cash multiple of 2.2x 
(84-month 1.8x) from the date of purchase. 
The new portfolios, combined with  
the Capquest back book, increased our 
total purchased loan portfolios by 74.3%  
to £477.5 million as at 31 December 2014, 
increasing our 120-month Estimated 
Remaining Collections (ERC) by 66.9% to 
£1,085.4 million (our 84-month ERC 
increased by 59 .0% to £897 .3 million). This 
increase in the size of the portfolio  
assets drives the foundation for future 
earnings and collections growth. 
Migration to the FCA, on 1 April 2014, has 
led to significant industry consolidation 
and we expect this to continue with  
a smaller number of highly compliant 
providers emerging. The addition of 
Capquest has further strengthened our 
expertise by enhancing our customer 
servicing capabilities and providing access 
to new origination sources and markets, 
including, among others, motor finance 
and secured loans. Importantly, it has 
reinforced our established commitment 
to putting the customer at the heart of 
our business. 
Capquest’s substantial in-house 
servicing capability, underpinned by what 
we believe to be an industry leading  
IT customer service platform, enhances 
our business model. In addition, the 
continued rationalisation of our servicer 
panel will further increase the level of 
oversight we have as we work towards full 
FCA authorisation, with a Q3 2015 landing 
slot scheduled. 
We are well progressed in combining 
the two businesses – a new group-wide 
organisational structure came into effect 
from 1 December 2014 and servicer 
migration activity has also commenced. 
As a result, we remain confident of 
achieving the £6.5 million of pre-tax cost 
savings in 2016. Following completion  
of the acquisition at the end of November, 
one month of Capquest figures have 
been included in our results.
As we move into 2015, we have a strong 
investment pipeline and expect portfolio 
purchases for the year to be in line with our 
expectations, underpinned by a higher 
level of committed purchases of £36 million 
for 2015, with a further £25 million already

our reach, and increasing our customer focus. 
This past year has seen Arrow Global reinforce its 
position as one of the leading businesses in  
our industry.
in place for 2016. These committed 
purchases are important as they allow us 
to lock in future portfolio acquisitions  
at prices that meet our targeted return 
expectations. 
We will continue to evolve our business 
model in order to meet new regulatory 
standards and to further embed customers 
at the heart of our business. We believe 
that increased regulation of the industry 
will benefit the leading market players 
and, as such, feel we are well placed to 
deliver continued strong growth.
Our five strategic objectives
To help us achieve our vision, we have 
developed five strategic objectives. 
These are as follows:
1  To protect and enhance Arrow Global’s 
leading market position and build  
on the platform created by our public 
listing and track record to date.
2  To deliver attractive risk-adjusted 
investment returns alongside balance 
sheet optimisation.
3  To maintain Arrow Global’s leading 
position in data enhancement, analytical 
insight and supply chain excellence.
4  To deliver a best-in-class customer 
experience and to minimise regulatory 
risk through a cautious approach to 
product extension.
5  To pursue diversification through  
a disciplined approach to geographic 
expansion and new asset classes.

our strategic objectives, please see

Strategic report
Arrow Global is one of the UK’s 
largest and fastest growing 
purchasers and managers of debt. 
We are a Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) regulated business 
that buys predominantly non-
performing loans (NPLs) and, as  
at 31 December 2014, the Group 
had purchased loan portfolios with 
a face value of £12.7 billion, across 
8.3 million customer accounts 
(2013: £7 .2 billion across 5.1 million 
customer accounts).
Regulation
As the market consolidates against  
the backdrop of a tighter regulatory 
environment, the number of debt 
purchase and collection agencies in the 
UK is decreasing.
As a company we are now regulated 
by the FCA and, rightly, the FCA expects  
all firms within the credit ecosystem to put 
customers at the heart of what they do.  
In order to meet these higher standards, 
banks and other credit originators have 
increased their level of oversight and we, 
in turn, have continued to increase  
our own level of oversight of those on  
our servicer panel.
This heightened focus on the 
customer ensures they receive the right 
outcomes and are therefore treated 
fairly. Putting customers’ interests first 
makes it considerably easier to meet  
the stringent requirements of CONC, the 
specialist consumer credit sourcebook, 
which details requirements and obligations 
for firms undertaking credit-related 
regulated activities.
Industry context
The debt purchase and collections 
industry is an integral part of the credit 
ecosystem. As part of their underwriting 
decisions and wider business models, 
creditors (e.g. banks or building societies) 
factor in a certain level of customer 
default. Their appetite for accepting this 
risk will be determined by a multitude  
of factors and ultimately, will be reflected 
in the lending rates and decisions  
they make. 
In order to release capital, maintain  
a healthy balance sheet and focus on their 
core specialism of lending, creditors will 
often sell defaulted loans to companies 
like Arrow Global, who have the expertise 
and data resources to better understand 
customers who have previously defaulted 
on their accounts.
By the time lending institutions  
come to sell debt, they have normally 
been either heavily or fully provisioned 
for. As accounting rules and regulatory 
requirements continue to evolve, we 
believe that the need for credit institutions 
to move asset risk of defaulted debt 
portfolios to third party specialists will 
continue and is likely to increase.
Who we are
� Arrow Global was established in the UK in 2005.
�  Following the successful acquisition of Capquest, as at  
31 December 2014, Arrow Global employs 485 people across four

France, Holland and Portugal.

60 different sellers.

What we do
When Arrow Global buys portfolios of 
non-performing loans, we look to build 
consolidated profiles of our customers 
by using our superior data assets.
By taking the time to better understand 
our customers and their current financial 
situation, we are able to set up affordable 
repayment plans. Importantly, we do 
not charge customers interest or fees on 
defaulted debt, unless there is a statutory 
requirement, in effect freezing the 
amount they owe. 
Our approach enables our customers to 
restructure and settle their outstanding 
balances in a more manageable way, 
rehabilitate and improve their credit score, 
and ultimately, enhances their ability  
to gain access to affordable credit in  
the future.
Defaulted debts purchased at a 
significant discount to face value.
Affordable and compliant repayment plans or 
settlement agreed. Defaulted debts converted 
into sustainable long-term repayment plans.
We have established relationships 
with creditors throughout the 
consumer credit industry, leading 
to repeat business with a core 
group of 60+ creditors.
Robust governance and 
independent review characterise 
the underwriting process, 
while highly accurate portfolio 
collection estimates enable 
competitive pricing and strong 
unlevered returns.
Post purchase, we seek to  
build consolidated customer 
profiles through our data  
models to better understand  
and serve customers. These 
profiles are constantly updated 
to reflect current customer 
circumstances.
We work with a carefully  
selected and monitored network 
of specialist third parties who 
manage customer accounts on 
our behalf. Our panel approach 
ensures customers are looked 
after by organisations most 
suited to assisting in light of each 
individual’s circumstances.
Following the acquisition of 
Capquest we also have an in-house 
collections capability giving us 
added flexibility and the ability to 
undertake, test and learn activity 
for specific groups of customers.

Common reasons for  
debt problems
A significant piece of research by 
StepChange Debt Charity* suggests that 
87% of people who find themselves in 
unmanageable debt, are in the situation 
due to circumstances beyond their 
control. This can leave them feeling 
trapped, often creating an unbearable 
strain on them. Some of the most 
common reasons are:
>  Divorce/relationship breakdown. 
>  Loss of job, redundancy or loss  
of income.
>  Death of a loved one.
>  Drug, alcohol and gambling addiction.
>  Poor physical and mental health.
Our customers
>  Across the Arrow Global Group we have 
acquired portfolios made up of 8.3 million 
customer accounts.
>  Circa 800,000 individual customers  
made one or more payments against their 
accounts to Arrow Global in 2014.
>  1.1 million customers have set up repayment 
plans with us over the last five years. 
>  In the UK, the average Arrow Global 
customer account balance at 31 December 
2014 is £1,389.
>  The average monthly payment received 
by Arrow Global in 2014 is £24.35.
>  Where appropriate, we take every 
opportunity to signpost our customers to 
free impartial advice, and we estimate that 
33% use the services of a not-for-profit 
third party debt manager.**
Our financial model
Using our data and collection capabilities, 
we establish sustainable repayment plans 
with customers that result in long-term, 
annuity like cash flows. We forecast future 
cash flows at an individual customer 
account level and the aggregate of  
these forecasts is our estimated remaining 
collection (ERC). We report this on  
a seven-year (84-month) or ten-year 
(120-month) time period.
The debt we buy is sold at a discount. 
By using our enhanced data capabilities 
we are typically able to recoup more than 
the purchase price paid, whilst at the 
same time helping customers clear any 
outstanding balances and start to 
rehabilitate their credit records.
Following the purchase of Capquest, we 
will use a mixture of in-house collections 
as well as a panel of specialist third party 
servicers. It is envisaged that we will employ 
an approximate mix of 40% in-house 
versus 60% third party collections by 
value of repayments received.
Because of the purchases we make 
through the year and portfolios from earlier 
years, we have good earnings visibility 
and predictable future cash flows. In 2014, 
76% of our adjusted EBITDA came from 
assets we owned on 1 January 2014.

Our risk and  
compliance model
Principal risks and uncertainties.
We have an enterprise-wide risk management 
framework in place, which sits alongside the 
strategic business plan, and is designed to support 
the identification, assessment, management  
and control of material risks that threaten the 
achievement of our business objectives. Risks  
are categorised as strategic, conduct, operational, 
financial and investment.
 Strategic risk
Definition
Risk to earnings arising from changes  
in the business environment and from 
adverse business decisions, improper 
implementation of decisions or lack of 
responsiveness to changes in the 
business environment. 
Effect on the Group
>  Economic risk: the Group’s growth 
strategy is based on the future purchase 
of, and collection from, distressed  
loan portfolios.
Changes in economic conditions 
could impact the ability to collect  
from portfolios, or the amount of debt 
portfolios that are sold.
The Group is exposed to Eurozone 
economic uncertainty through its 
investment in mainland Europe.
>  Reputational risk: negative news and 
attention regarding the debt collection 
industry and individual debt collectors 
may have a negative impact on ability  
to acquire portfolios and a customer’s 
willingness to pay the debt that the 
Group acquires.
Approach
Management ensure that all portfolios 
are purchased at an appropriate price, 
and we also build strong relationships 
with our creditor client base in order  
to mitigate such risks.
Appropriate currency liquidity 
management and scenario planning  
is in place.
We manage this risk through 
compliance and industry best practice 
collection approaches.
 Conduct risk
Definition
Risk of inappropriate strategy, systems, 
behaviours, or processes leads to  
poor and/or unfair customer outcomes 
or customer detriment.
Effect on the Group
Any action which leads to poor and/ or 
unfair customer outcomes or customer 
detriment goes against our core  
values and could also lead to regulatory 
censure, financial loss and reputational 
damage to our brand.
Approach
Conduct risk and treating customers 
fairly (TCF) are at the heart of our business. 
All employees and third parties acting on 
our behalf receive TCF training. We have 
an oversight framework focused on 
compliance, performance, and customer 
outcomes across our in-house operations 
and third party panel members. All new 
third party panel members are rigorously 
checked to ensure they conform to our 
compliance and quality standards, and are 
then monitored on a regular basis.
 Operational risk
Definition
Risk of loss resulting from inadequate  
or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events.
>  Regulatory risk: risk of failing to  
comply with the legal and regulatory 
requirements applying to business 
arrangements and activities, for example 
data protection regulation.
>  Legal risk: risk of documentation 
deficiencies within purchased portfolios 
that are unable to be mitigated  
through contract and/or warranties.
>  Integration risk: risk of failing to 
successfully integrate Capquest into the 
wider Arrow Global Group and operating 
model, for example, IT system integration 
not executed correctly. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 15
Strategic report
Effect on the Group
We are partly reliant on a panel of third 
party partners to manage customer 
accounts and collect outstanding debts 
where accounts are outsourced. Should 
third party debt servicers experience 
sustained business interruption or  
are subject to takeover by an unfriendly 
competitor firm, we could suffer  
financial loss.
We are also reliant on IT systems for 
data management and analysis.
Failure to comply with relevant  
regulation could result in the suspension 
or termination of our ability to conduct 
business and could lead to regulatory 
censure and financial loss.
Exposure to remediation cost and 
cases pursued by claims management 
companies.
Failure to realise forecast synergies and 
potential poor customer outcomes.
Approach
We have on-going oversight of our 
third party panel and in-house collections 
teams to ensure standards are met  
and that businesses have plans in place  
to manage business interruption. Our 
third party panel is diversified to ensure 
that we do not become reliant on any 
one particular third party debt servicer.
IT systems are regularly backed up  
and are managed through a tight set of 
quality and security policies, supported 
by a robust disaster recovery plan. We 
adhere to ISO27001 standards and practise 
ITIL-based procedures.
We employ industry specialists to 
monitor the latest regulations and 
update our internal policies accordingly. 
Where required, we take external 
specialist advice. We also engage in

 Financial risk
Definition
>  Market risk: the risk of losses in portfolios 
due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
and the level of interest rates. 
>  Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group  
is unable to meet its obligations as they 
fall due.
>  Credit risk: risk to earnings or capital 
arising when a counter party defaults  
on its contractual obligations, including 
failure to perform its obligations in a  
timely manner.
>  Tax risk: tax compliance risks arise from 
the complex nature of tax legislation  
and practice.
Effect on the Group
The Group’s financial risk management 
strategy is governed by a policy framework 
based upon sound economic objectives 
and corporate practices. The main 
financial risks concern the availability of 
funds to meet obligations as they fall  
due (liquidity risk), movements in foreign 
exchange rates (foreign exchange risk), 
and fluctuations in interest rates (interest 
rate risk).
Approach
Liquidity risk is managed through 
matching the maturity of our funding 
facilities with the maturity our assets, 
forecasting funding requirements and 
applying appropriate stress testing and 
ensuring we maintain a balanced maturity 
profile of debt facilities. We are highly 
cash generative and aim to maintain a 
flexible cost base. Portfolio investment is 
largely discretionary which provides a large 
degree of control over working capital.
Foreign exchange risk is managed on 
a Group level principally through the use 
of forward contracts.
Management reduce interest rate  
risk by principally using interest rate swaps.
The Group engages tax specialists to 
advise about its tax compliance obligations, 
and the application of tax legislation and 
practice to the transactions and activities 
it undertakes.
The Group’s risk management policies 
on foreign exchange, interest rates, 
credit risk and market risk are explained 
in more detail within note 24 on  
pages 102 to 107 .
 Investment risk
Definition
The risk of returns adverse to forecast as  
a result of inadequate portfolio purchase 
analysis and consequent mispricing.
Effect on the Group
The statistical models and analytics used, 
including the calculation ERC, may prove 
to be inaccurate, which could lead to poor 
decision making and the Group failing to 
achieve its anticipated recoveries.
Approach
Rigorous change controls are in place 
prior to any new data influencing our 
decision making model, and due diligence 
and executive review through an 
‘investment gate’ process is carried out 
prior to investment. Portfolio performance 
is monitored by senior management.
Continuous monitoring of risk
We have a continuous process for 
monitoring risk, with senior management 
owning individual risk registers, which 
are reviewed and updated on a regular 
basis, and are reported to the quarterly 
audit and risk committee meetings. 
During the year, the risk structure was 
further enhanced through the 
appointment of a number of additional 
experienced risk professionals. 
Risk awareness and management  
is an integral part of all employees’ 
roles and responsibilities, and employees 
are supported through briefings and 
training, which includes testing. During 
2014, following a competitive tendering 
process, the Group appointed BDO as  
its internal auditors. In addition, creditors 
continue to undertake frequent  
audits of the Group to satisfy their own 
risk management models. Our three lines of  
defence model

Business strategy  
and objectives
Our vision is to be Europe’s leading purchaser

by leveraging our sophisticated data-driven 
business model, newly acquired Capquest servicing 
platform and leading position in growth markets 
via the following:

Approach
2014 performance  
and key performance

We have established long-term 
relationships with creditors, many of 
whom are leading financial services 
institutions, and we consistently win repeat 
business with a core group.
Compliance, risk management and 
treating customers fairly are at the heart 
of our business culture and operations. 
As an important partner to major 
financial institutions, a reputation for 
consistency and leadership in these  
areas is critical to maintaining our position 
on creditors’ preferred purchasing 
panels. Additionally, these same elements 
play an important role in reinforcing  
our position as a sustainable business, 
recognised as performing an important 
role in the broader credit system.
>  60+ creditor client relationships.
>  Remained on all major financial services

from £273.9 million to £477 .5 million  
with 120-month ERC: £1,085.4 million,  
up 66.9% (2013: £650.3 million)  
84-month up 59.0% to £897 .3 million, 
(2013: £564.3 million).

greatest potential to purchase debt  
of outside auction processes.
We maintain strong governance  
around our underwriting processes and  
be disciplined in ensuring we acquire 
portfolios in line with our risk-adjusted 
target returns.
Funding and capital structure are 
important parts of our business model. We 
seek to optimise our balance sheet and 
establish the right balance of debt within 
our capital structure, keeping the ratio  
of net debt to adjusted EBITDA less than 
3.5x on a pro forma basis and cash cover 
more than 4x.

Strategic report
We seek to continue to develop our  
data analysis tools to facilitate a better 
understanding of individual customers’ 
circumstances. For example, we seek  
to increase the records held in our 
Proprietary Collection Bureau (PCB), in 
order to enable us to identify a larger 
number of non-paying accounts for which 
we already have data, before we make 
the decision to purchase a portfolio.
We also continuously look to invest  
in new raw data and processes to 
improve key activities such as customer 
tracing and forecasting.

Strategic report
In September 2014, Arrow Global announced  
the proposed acquisition of Capquest, a top 5 UK 
player based on 120-month ERC. Following 
shareholder approval and a successful debt capital 
raising exercise, the purchase was completed  
on 28 November 2014.
Above: Capquest, Glasgow. Left: Capquest, Farnborough.
Capquest acquisition
The financial benefits  
of the acquisition  
have already started  
to be realised, with  
a new organisation 
structure implemented 
from the beginning  
of December 2014.
The financial benefits
The financial benefits of the acquisition 
have already started to be realised,  
with a new organisational structure being 
implemented from the beginning of 
December 2014. 
We expect the majority of financial 
benefits to be realised in the next year and 
we remain confident of achieving annual 
pre-tax cost savings of £6.5 million in 2016. 
Importantly, as part of the acquisition 
we also acquired over £104.0 million of 
UK portfolio assets at returns in line with 
Arrow Global’s usual targets, with a  
2.1 times 120-month gross cash-on-cash 
money multiple and 120-month ERC of 
£214.5 million (84-month: £181.4 million). 
New services and revenue streams
With a collections capability housed  
in Farnborough and Glasgow, we can now 
offer contingency collections, additional 
asset management services, and the ability 
to work with creditors on a place-to-sell 
basis (i.e. placed with Arrow Global in a 
management capacity, with a view to sell 
at a later date).
Benefits to customers
As discussed in more depth later in  
this report, Arrow Global operates in an 
increasingly regulated sector. 
The acquisition of Capquest brings 
together two businesses with a shared 
commitment to customer engagement 
and compliance. The enhanced data assets 
and servicing platform, which the new 
enlarged Group now enjoys, will provide 
yet greater customer insight and 
enhance Arrow Global’s ability to deliver 
a high quality offering to customers and 
creditor clients. 
The Capquest acquisition  
has given Arrow Global:
>  An in-house collections capability 
which boasts a best-in-class customer 
service and IT platform.
>  Enhanced data assets that will further 
improve underwriting and collections 
operations and enhance customers’ 
experience.
>  New and broader sources of origination.
>  Expertise across a wider range of  
debt type.
>  Greater customer insight from 
expertise held within the Capquest 
collection operations.
>  Greater collection flexibility.
>  Additional economies of scale and  
cost savings. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 22
Strategic report
Increasing regulation is likely  
to benefit our business and fuel  
our expansion into Europe Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 23
Strategic report
The regulatory environment has 
continued to tighten, both in the UK and 
mainland Europe, and we believe that 
this will increase the propensity of financial 
institutions to sell and is likely to continue 
to do so. In particular, the trilogy of the 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
9 (IFRS9), Asset Quality Review (AQR) 
and Basel III have had a significant effect.
We have strong links with financial 
institutions across the UK and mainland 
Europe and expect to benefit from sales 
generated as a result of these drivers. 
Across Arrow Global’s current portfolio, 
77.5% by purchase cost is classed as 
financial services.
Expanding in mainland Europe
Arrow Global first entered the mainland 
Europe market in 2009, when we invested 
in Portugal, buying from an international 
bank that was already an existing creditor 
client in the UK. 
We look to enter markets where we 
believe we have an opportunity to lead in 
key asset classes with good data assets, 
quality creditor clients, and a robust supply 
chain. In 2014, Arrow Global continued to 
expand in mainland Europe, by choosing 
to enter two new markets, Holland  
and France. 
In France, we acquired a 15% interest 
in a market leader, MCS. Here, the market
is still relatively underdeveloped, with  
the proportion of debt sold by French 
banks estimated to be less than 5% versus 
20-80% in more developed markets, such 
as the UK and US, providing significant 
potential headroom for future growth. 
MCS focuses on high-balance SME loans, 
personal guarantee segments and 
consumer loans.
In Holland, we obtained our licence  
to operate and completed a €1 million 
portfolio investment.
We have continued to invest in new 
portfolios in Portugal, purchasing from 
domestic, rather than international banks, 
for the first time in 2014. During the  
year, we grew the value of assets (by face 
value) we hold in the geography to over 
€2 billion. This investment has significantly 
increased our data assets and, as part  
of the acquisition of new portfolios earlier 
in the year, we were able to match 
approximately 26% of customer records 
to existing Arrow Global records. As  
at 31 December 2014, we now have circa 
500,000 accounts in Portugal, equating  
to circa 400,000 individual customers, 
across consumer and commercial SME 
portfolios and estimate that this equates 
to approximately 5% of the total adult 
population of the country.
In the last year, there have been a significant 
number of regulatory and market changes  
across Europe that have caused financial services 
organisations – banks and building societies 
especially – to review their balance sheets.
European markets
IFRS 9
IFRS 9 is a new accounting 
standard, expected to  
be implemented from  
1 January 2018, which will 
require banks to calculate 
expected losses for 
accounting purposes  
more prudently on  
assets that have seen a 
‘significant’ deterioration  
in credit quality, on  
a lifetime rather than  
one-year basis.
AQR
Under the European 
Banking Authority definition, 
loans will be considered 
non-performing when they 
are more than 90 days 
overdue or unlikely to be 
repaid. This definition means 
that a higher proportion  
of loans in bank portfolios 
will have to be classified  
as non-performing.
As part of the AQR, in  
a review by the European 
Central Bank, where 
institutions were found to 
be under-reporting credit 
impaired loans, they were 
required to write down the 
value of those assets and 
increase levels of capital to 
cover them. 
Basel III
The Basel III framework 
requires a certain amount 
of a bank’s regulatory 
capital to be allocated to 
every loan or commitment. 
This restricts the amount 
of business a bank may do 
before it raises fresh capital.
As a result of these changes, banks in particular are already taking a more active 
approach to balance sheet management and loss provisioning. This is likely to cause 
an increase in the volume of debts financial institutions sell. Arrow Global has a history  
of leading the way in the fairer  
treatment of customers
Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 24
Strategic report Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 25
Strategic report
Arrow Global’s approach to customer 
engagement is to use data to understand 
our customers’ individual circumstances 
and further enhance their experience. 
This enables us to make more informed 
decisions about the method and way  
in which we correspond with customers.
We know that this approach is only 
part of a very complex puzzle, which has 
lots of component parts. With the 
addition of Capquest’s industry leading 
customer service platform and an 
enhanced servicer oversight model, we 
continue to focus on and analyse the 
detail of the services we provide and how 
we interact with our customers.
We have a history of leading thinking 
in the way in which customers who find 
themselves in difficult financial situations 
should be treated. We are proud of the 
work we have done with a number of debt 
charities, as well as our own research  
into barriers to engagement, carried out 
in conjunction with the Personal Finance 
Research Centre at the University of 
Bristol, the Royal College of Psychiatrists 
and Plymouth Focus Advice Centre. 
Like many in the consumer credit 
industry, we have invested heavily in our 
preparations to operate in a new FCA 
regulatory environment. Over the last 
two years we have been building and 
strengthening our risk and compliance 
capability, including the appointment  
of our internal auditor, BDO, in April 2014.
We welcome the FCA taking over 
regulation of the industry from 1 April 2014 
as we believe that this philosophy  
of putting the customers at the heart of 
what debt purchasing and management 
companies do has encouraged the 
industry to fundamentally re-examine the 
way it works. For Arrow Global, this has 
meant reviewing and consolidating our 
own third party servicer network, 
mirroring what our creditor clients have 
done with their debt purchaser panels.
Our creditor clients are increasingly 
interested in the way in which their 
customers are handled once their debts 
have been sold and they only want to 
deal with purchasers who can protect their 
reputations. Ultimately, they want to 
work with a small number of large, highly 
capable and compliant partners, as this 
will allow them to maintain and develop 
more meaningful relationships with both 
purchasers and their customers. Arrow 
Global is currently on all major bank 
selling panels.
We are also looking at different ways 
in which we remunerate our network of 
servicers to ensure they are rewarded not 
just for what they collect, but for the 
customer outcomes they achieve and the 
activities they undertake.
Internally, we formally test employees 
to ensure that they have appropriate 
knowledge and understanding of their 
risk and compliance responsibilities.
Like others in the industry, in order to 
truly embed and foster the FCA’s ‘treating 
customers fairly’ culture, we have invested 
in building a new risk management and 
compliance framework, guided by our 
specialist in-house team. 
Arrow Global’s approach to customer engagement 
is to use data to understand our customers’ 
individual circumstances and further enhance 
their experience. This enables us to make  
more informed decisions about the method and 
way in which we correspond with customers.
Putting the  
customer first
Ensuring colleagues put  
the customer first
>  We don’t charge interest or fees  
once a customers account is in arrears 
or defaulted.
>  We undertake extensive call quality

customers who experience financial 
difficulty for a variety of reasons 
(including health issues).
>  For all colleagues within Arrow Global

assess their understanding.
>  Across Arrow Global Group, non-
customer facing staff are also required 
to undertake call listening activity  
to help embed a customer-focused 
approach. 
>  Where appropriate, we take every 
opportunity to sign-post our  
customers to free impartial advice.
>  Monthly customer surveys are 
undertaken to ensure customer 
satisfaction.
>  Colleagues in our conduct management 
team work with our service partners  
to ensure Arrow Global best practice is 
adopted into our wider network. This 
work includes side-by-side call listening 
activity, end-to-end customer journey 
assessments, review of complaints 
handling activity and wider policy and 
procedure monitoring. At Arrow Global, we take our  
corporate social responsibilities  
as a business very seriously

Strategic report
We are committed to supporting the local 
communities in which we work, and many  
of our colleagues volunteer and assist local 
community organisations, both in and out

Corporate and  
social responsibility
Our company-sponsored Arrow Global 
Engage programme – run for and  
by employees – enables colleagues to 
spend company time throughout the 
year volunteering for charity or 
community projects.
Through the Engage programme, 
colleagues support a number of 
community-based initiatives, such as a 
budgeting workshop for young people 
and assembling Christmas care packages 
for underprivileged families, as well as 
other fundraising activities throughout 
the year. 
We further support colleagues’ 
contributions to the community  
by matching funds raised by them for  
our chosen charities.
Financial education matters
As a company that sees first hand the 
issues that problem debts can cause, we 
took the decision in 2014 to focus on  
an initiative that could help people avoid 
these types of problems in the future.  
As part of this work, we partnered with 
the Personal Finance Education Group 
(pfeg) to sponsor a secondary school in 
Manchester, Oakwood Academy, to attain 
the Personal Finance Education Group’s 
‘Centre of Excellence’ accreditation mark 
for financial education. Once attained, 
Oakwood will be a beacon of financial 
education good practice in the local 
Manchester education community and it 
will open up volunteering opportunities 
for Arrow Global staff within the school.
Free money advice
Arrow Global continues to develop and 
strengthen partnerships with those in the 
not for profit debt advice sector to ensure 
the best possible customer outcomes. 
We have direct relationships with 
StepChange Debt Charity, Citizens Advice 
Bureau and Christians Against Poverty,  
and take an active role in industry forums, 
such as the Money Advice Liaison Group.
In 2014, we sought to build on our close 
partnership with StepChange Debt Charity 
and worked with them on a number of 
initiatives designed to promote awareness 
of the charity. This included taking part  
in and publicising ‘Debt Awareness Week’ 
as well as facilitating bespoke training 
sessions run by the charity for our  
service partners.
In November 2014, we piloted a contact 
initiative with a number of customers 
who had previously sought debt advice, 
but had then disengaged from further 
contact. The aim was to introduce these 
customers to StepChange for an 
assessment of their financial circumstances 
and, if appropriate, commence a debt 
management plan. The initiative used a 
bespoke communication package of 
letters, telephony, SMS and a dedicated 
web page (www.stepchange.org/
getbackontrack). It focused on providing 
practical assistance and used some of  
the key findings from the Bristol University 
research we commissioned in 2013  
about customer engagement. StepChange 
provided assistance in designing the 
bespoke communication package 
around the initiative, which we  
then implemented in conjunction with 
one of our service partners.
Caring for the environment
The environmental impacts have been 
considered more thoroughly in the report 
of the directors on pages 46 and 47, but 
given the nature of our business as a debt 
purchaser and manager, they are 
considered to be relatively minimal. 
Following the acquisition of Capquest, 
the Group now has four sites across the 
UK and in order to reduce travel and thus 
the potential carbon footprint that 
colleagues might generate by additional 
travel between sites, a special video 
conferencing facility was established and 
went live in December 2014. 
Across the Group, we offer colleagues 
a cycle to work scheme and at appropriate 
sites, we also have car share schemes  
in place, where, people who car share are 
given preferential parking.
Human rights
The Group’s activities are carried out  
in developed countries that have strong 
legislation governing human rights. The 
Group complies with applicable legislation 
in the countries in which it operates. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 28

November 2014, further strengthened 
our existing senior leadership team,  
with Helen Ashton, Capquest’s former 
chief executive officer joining Arrow 
Global’s executive team as group chief 
operating officer.
Data assets and analytics are at the 
core of our business and this is reflected 
in our highly qualified and skilled staff. 
Across the Group, the percentage of 
colleagues in central functions with a 
degree level qualification is approximately 
48%, and approximately 33% have a 
postgraduate or professional qualification.
A new starter working in our in-house 
collections operations will receive 
approximately 150 hours of training in the

2  Diversified origination capabilities
Over the past ten years, Arrow Global has 
acquired portfolios from over 60 creditor 
clients across the UK and mainland 
Europe. Our portfolio consists of credit 
cards, personal loans, motor finance, 
retail, second liens, telecommunications, 
student loans and SME commercial loans.
Importantly, following a period of 
panel consolidation amongst sellers, we  
remain on all major bank panels. 
Following the acquisition of Capquest,  
we now offer creditor clients a wider 
range of options: debt purchase, asset 
management, place to sell and 
contingency collections.
We continue to look to diversify our 
holdings by both asset class and geography 
in a considered manner and within  
our existing risk management framework.
4  Leading data and  
analytics capabilities
Our data is key to optimising our 
collections performance, reducing risk and 
most importantly ensuring we achieve 
good customer outcomes.
We have 18.3 million records in our PCB, 
including the records for approximately 
5.4 million accounts held in our own 
database. In addition, we have purchased 
2.8 million accounts with the acquisition  
of Capquest, which we intend to integrate 
in 2015. Through our single customer view, 
we have been able to increase match 
rates to approximately 50% (i.e. the number 
of customers we can already identify 
through the data assets we hold). 
3  Disciplined underwriting
We believe we have a robust underwriting 
and risk management framework in  
place to ensure a disciplined approach  
to portfolio purchases. We have an 
established track record of achieving 
collections on purchased portfolios against 
our original underwriting projections 
across both vintages and asset classes, 
having collected 102% of our gross original 
underwriting collections forecast.

Why Arrow Global?
In Portugal we have over 
€2 billion of assets by 
face value, with the total 
number of accounts 
owned at circa 500,000 
representing 5% of  
the adult population  
of the country. 
6  A market leading position  
in high growth markets
Following the acquisition of Capquest, 
Arrow Global now has £14.8 billion of 
owned assets under management and  
a combined 120-month ERC of over  
£1 billion – we are one of only two 
companies in the sector to break through 
this significant milestone.
In its recent industry report in 
November 2014, OC&C strategy 
consultants predicted the volumes of 
debt outsourced would likely continue  
to increase across Europe. In the UK 
market, it predicted debt sold to grow  
at around 12% per annum over the next 
three to four years.
In Portugal, we have over €2 billion of 
assets by face value, with the total number 
of accounts owned at circa 500,000 
representing 5% of the adult population 
of the country. 
This year we also acquired a 15% 
interest in a French market leader, MCS.
Our unique business models  
mean we have:
5  A flexible collection model
Historically, Arrow Global has worked with 
a carefully selected panel of specialist 
third parties to manage customer accounts 
on our behalf. This panel approach seeks 
to ensure customers are with the servicer 
best placed to help them. Following  
the acquisition of Capquest, Arrow Global 
expects to manage approximately 40%  
of the Group’s UK business collections 
in-house. For the remaining 60%, Arrow 
Global will continue to work with a panel 
of third party servicers, but against  
the backdrop of a changing regulatory 
environment, and in line with other 
creditors, we are accelerating the 
rationalisation of this network to a core 
group of strategic partners. 
We believe that this flexible model  
will enable us to fully utilise what we 
believe is a high-quality customer-focused 
servicing platform. This will further 
improve our ability to oversee a smaller 
outsourced servicer panel, thereby 
improving the overall experience of  
our customers.

7  Highly cash generative business
We are highly cash generative, meaning 
that we have surplus cash available to 
grow and reinvest in our business. In 
2014, the Group had cash generated  
from operations before purchases of loan 
portfolios of £97 .2 million in 2014 (£107 .5 
million underlying).
We continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy targeting a pay-out  
ratio of between 25% and 35% of annual 
underlying net income.
8  Earning and cash flow visibility, 
supported by value embedded  
in existing assets
Our existing portfolios provide visibility 
around future earnings and cash flow 
generation. As a result, we have significant 
value and predictable future cash flows 
embedded in our existing portfolios, with 
120-month gross ERC of £1,085.4 million 
(84-month £897 .3 million).
Core collections increased to £148.5 
million in 2014 (2013: £130.3 million) with 
76% coming from assets owned on  
1 January 2014.
9  Strong balance sheet
Long-term funding is a key part of our 
business model. In 2014, as part of our 
acquisition of Capquest, we issued a  
€225 million senior secured floating rate 
note at a price which was reflective of 
Arrow Global’s increased standing amongst 
investors (a coupon of the three-month 
Euribor rate + 5.25%).
During the year, we also increased our 
revolving credit facility from £55 million 
to £100 million with the maturity extending 
from January 2018 to January 2019, on 
improved terms.
The combination of strong cash 
generation from the business and available 
funding resource means we are  
confident that we have sufficient liquidity 
and capacity to realise Arrow Global’s 
growth ambitions.
At 31 December 2014, our net debt  
to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.4x (pro 
forma 3.6x). We monitor key credit ratios 
to ensure sufficient coverage and, as  
at 31 December 2014, our cash cover was 
5.4x (pro forma 4.0x) and net debt to 
84-month ERC 49.0%.

Data driven  
business model
A data driven business model, serving everyone’s 
best interests. Ensuring the right initial customer 
contact is a core part of what we do. When we 
purchase defaulted customer accounts, they often 
comprise a high proportion of missing or 
erroneous data, also known as ‘distressed’ data. 
Depending on the credit 
originator and asset type, there 
can be a number of reasons for  
the ‘ distressed’ nature of this data 
such as:
>  Absence of a single national  
identity system.
>  Customers moving frequently.
>  Creditor IT system migrations leading  
to loss or degradation of data.
>  Poor information gathering at the point  
of origination.
>  Purposeful supply of inaccurate 
information by the customer.
These and other factors can ultimately 
give rise to incorrect customer information 
and make collection by the original 
lending institution and account owner 
difficult or unsuccessful. 
Once Arrow Global takes ownership of 
a debt portfolio, we seek to repair missing 
and erroneous customer data in order  
to find lost customers and more accurately 
assess their circumstances.
By getting the right data, we can 
ensure a better customer experience  
and reduce our own underwriting risk. 
Ultimately, improved data drives collections 
and operational efficiency and helps 
improve compliance.
Improving data
More complete understanding of customer  
and more accurate business modelling
Arrow Global combines 
multiple sources of data, 
including records from  
the Proprietary Collections  
Bureau (PCB), to improve  
overall data accuracy. This  
leads to:
>  Enhanced underwriting capability  
and pricing.
>  Reduced mistraces, and enhances 
collections efficiencies, which  
benefits both customers and creditor.
>  Improved placement strategy, which  
avoids customers being chased by  
multiple servicers on different debts and  
ensures that existing relationships  
are honoured.
> Improved overall collections performance.

PCB – Solving an important  
part of the data puzzle
Data processing restrictions in the UK 
mean that customers cannot be matched 
to a credit referencing agency database 
prior to the purchase of an account, 
therefore, many debt purchasers face 
significant data limitations. In the UK,  
this is compounded by a lack of a national 
identity system (a problem we don’t 
encounter in some of the other markets, 
in which we operate). 
Couple this lack of data and data access, 
before the purchase of a debt portfolio, 
with the drivers of distressed data above 
and you can see there is a clear need  
for a comprehensive tool which has the 
capability to remove this uncertainty.
Arrow Global’s PCB, which is the only 
one of its kind in the current market, 
provides a solution. Now with 18.3 million 
records in its data set, PCB aggregates 
information from our servicer partners,
third party debt collection managers 
(3PDMs) and information from creditors 
with our own data.
By using the PCB, we are able to 
analyse debt portfolios and their 
individual customer records both pre  
and post purchase.
Pre-acquisition, we are able to establish 
the percentage of customers in a given 
portfolio that we already have information 
for. Here, an overall ‘match rate’ across 
the portfolio can be established. Before 
PCB was developed, match rates for a 
typical financial services defaulted debt 
portfolio would be as low as 13% – because 
of PCB, for Arrow Global, this has risen  
to an industry leading 50% in many cases.
Improved match rates give us greater 
underwriting insight when buying or 
bidding for a portfolio. Once a portfolio 
has been purchased by Arrow Global, 
PCB adds to the customer experience. 
Inaccurate data can significantly increase 
the likelihood of mistraces, leading to 
frustrations among individuals wrongly 
linked to inaccurate accounts. It can  
also lead to lost income for us and the 
creditors we collect on behalf of.
The PCB is now a core part of our 
customer contact and collections strategy, 
because it captures important customer 
payment point information that is not 
contained in traditional credit bureau files. 
Without upfront co-ordination during 
the data matching process, a customer’s 
creditors might appoint multiple servicers. 
With data matching, this can be avoided. 
PCB identifies any existing customer-3PDM 
and customer-servicer relationships, 
enabling us to take a more streamlined 
and importantly, a more compliant 
approach to an account, ensuring we meet 
our obligations under the ‘Lending Code’. 
In short, collecting on an informed basis 
always outperforms collecting ‘blind’  
and is better for our customers.

During the year, we made a number of 
significant portfolio purchases in Portugal, 
another step forward in further 
developing our mainland Europe business. 
Two of the portfolios purchased were 
from domestic Portuguese banks and 
were the first time they had sold to Arrow 
Global – recognition of our growing 
reputation for excellence and European 
banks, increasing propensity to sell.
In September 2014, we announced the 
proposed acquisition of Capquest, and 
with a successful placing of €225 million 
senior secured notes with a maturity  
of 2021, and a subsequent positive 
shareholder vote, we completed the 
acquisition at the end of November 2014. 
We finished the year with entry into 
another mainland European geography, 
acquiring a 15% interest of £11.4 million  
in a French market leader, MCS.
Our strategic UK and mainland  
Europe purchases have provided 
significant opportunity and a platform  
for future growth.
Financial review
2014 was another transformational year for  
Arrow Global with a total investment of  
over £300 million, of which £242 million 
represented portfolio acquisitions.
 Portfolio acquisitions
During 2014 we organically acquired  
debt portfolios with a face value of 
£1,267.5 million for a purchase price of 
£137.7 million equating to an average 
purchase price of 10.9p. For the year to  
31 December 2014, the 120-month gross 
cash-on-cash multiple for this vintage  
was 2.2x (84-month: 1.8x) from the date 
of purchase. 
These acquisitions and the portfolios 
acquired through the purchase of 
Capquest, net of amortisation, have 
increased the balance sheet value of  
our purchased loan portfolios to  
£477.5 million as at 31 December 2014  
(2013: £273.9 million). 
As at 31 December 2014, the total face 
value acquired purchased portfolios  
of £12.7 billion (2013: £7 .2 billion) across 
8.3 million customer accounts.

 Collections
Core collections increased to £148.5 
million (2013: £130.3 million), reflecting 
the increase in our portfolio asset base. 
Collections were cumulatively 102% of our 
original underwriting forecast. During the 
year, 74% of cash collections came from 
regular small payments, with an average 
UK monthly payment of £24, reflecting 
our focus on working with customers  
to create long-term sustainable payment 
plans. Figures include December 2014 
collections for Capquest of £4.6 million, 
which was circa £0.2 million ahead of  
our initial forecast. 
Collections for the year grew by 14.0%. 
In Q4 2014 there were some factors 
inhibiting this result. In Portugal, external 
factors led to a three-month delay in 
realising some of our legal collections, 
when Portuguese courts closed in order 
to allow for an IT upgrade. This took 
longer than anticipated and they remained 
closed for September, October and 
November, leading to an associated delay 
in the processing of claims. We estimate 
this to be the equivalent of €2.4 million  
in delayed collections. Since the courts 
reopened, they have been working to 
clear this backlog and we expect to see 
collections recover during Q1 2015.
 Collection costs
We continue to use our data capabilities 
and benefits from our outsourced model 
to maintain cost collection efficiency. 
During the year, there was an increase  
in the collection cost ratio to 23.0% (2013: 
21.5%), reflecting additional collection 
related costs associated Portugal.

Strategic report
After taking account of the non-recurring 
items discussed above, underlying net 
income increased 17 .7% from £25.2 million 
to £29.6 million for the year ended  
31 December 2014. 
 Portfolio overview
Our 84-month ERC – the expected 
collections from our back book – has 
increased by £247.0 million from £564.3 
million in 2013 to £897 .3 million, a 59.0% 
increase (120-month ERC 66.9% increase 
to £1,085.4 million (2013: £650.3 million)). 
The ERC is underpinned by paying accounts 
that have a face value of £1.5 billion, 
which represents 1.7x 84-month ERC cover 
(1.4x 120-month ERC cover). As at  
31 December 2014, we estimate the amount 
we would need to invest over the next 
year to maintain our current 120-month 
ERC level is circa £68 million. 
The table below illustrates the returns 
on portfolios by vintage:
 Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is our proxy for operating 
cash flow. During the year, adjusted 
EBITDA increased by £10.1 million (11.1%) 
to £101.0 million (2013: £90.9 million). 
This was mainly driven by an increase in 
core collections net of collection costs. 
The adjusted EBITDA ratio was 68.0% 
(2013: 69.8%).
  Profit attributable to shareholders 
Profit attributable to shareholders 
increased 20.9% from £15.1 million to 
£18.3 million for the year ended  
31 December 2014. This was largely driven 
by increased operational profit of £2.2 
million and a reduction in finance income 
and costs of £1.0 million.
During the year, non-recurring items 
of £12.8 million were incurred, with  
an associated tax impact of £1.5 million. 
The main non-recurring items were  
£6.0 million arising on the Capquest 
acquisition, £1.8 million due to IPO-related 
staff costs, £2.4 million in relation to a 
historic VAT settlement and £2.0 million 
of non-recurring contract settlements, 
£1.6 million of which was due to the 
Capquest acquisition. See notes 8 and 10 on 
pages 92 and 94 for further information.

Strategic report
The gross cash-on-cash money multiple 
over all portfolios is expected to be  
2.0x on an 84-month basis from the date 
of purchase, as shown below. Recent 
vintages reflect a higher proportion of 
paying accounts and, therefore a lower 
gross cash-on-cash money multiple.
 Funding, net debt and net assets
In 2014, we successfully increased our 
RCF to £100 million, reducing the interest 
margin by 50 basis points, and extended 
the term from January 2018 to January 
2019. The RCF was drawn by £39.0 million 
as at 31 December 2014. As at 31 December 
2014, we had cash and RCF resources of 
£75.5 million available and cash cover of 
5.4x (pro forma 4.0x).
Net debt at 31 December 2014 was 
£439.7 million, being 4.4x adjusted EBITDA 
(pro forma 3.4x) and a net debt/84-month 
ERC loan to value ratio of 49 .0%, which is 
significantly below our financial covenants 
of 75%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA  
is expected to reduce in 2015, with the 
benefits of the Capquest acquisition. 
Net assets increased £16.7 million 
during the year, mostly reflecting the 
retained profit for the year. 
 Shareholder returns
Underlying basic and diluted EPS for the 
year was 17p (2013: 16p), and underlying 
ROE was 26.1% (2013: 26.5%). A final 
dividend of 3.4p is proposed, bringing the 
total dividends for the year to 5.1p. See

Regulation and compliance
Overview
It is likely that the regulatory requirements 
applicable to the consumer debt purchase 
and collection industry will continue to 
increase, reflecting the new regulatory 
framework and the fact that the FCA’s 
supervisory and enforcement powers are 
substantially greater than the OFT’s 
previous powers. The risk, governance 
and compliance frameworks that will  
be needed to satisfy FCA requirements will 
demand continued investment and 
resources in these frameworks.
Our approach
We will continue to evaluate and evolve 
risk and compliance activities to align 
with industry best practice and meet the 
expectations of the FCA.
We will also continue to operate under 
our FCA interim permissions and remain 
on track to be ready to apply for full FCA 
authorisation during our allotted FCA 
application slot of Q3 2015.
Market environment
Overview
External market forecasts suggest growth 
rates in the volume of debt outsourced 
are likely to continue to increase  
across Europe. A recent OC&C Strategy 
Consultants report, published in the 
November 2014 issue of Credit Today, 
predicted that: “…growth rates in the 
volume of debt outsourced are likely to 
continue across Europe” and that in the 
UK, the face value of debt sold would grow 
at around 12%.
In its annual UK Consumer Debt 
Collection and Debt Purchase market 
insight report, Apex Insights suggested 
that the overall market will grow at 8% 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 
from 2014-18, reaching a total revenue of 
over £2.4 billion in 2018, with debt 
purchase accounting for 79%.
Against a backdrop of changing 
capital requirements resulting from the 
introduction of IFRS 9, AQR and Basel III, 
new sellers are also expected to come to 
the market.
Our approach
We seek to maintain strong relationships 
with existing creditors, as well as  
forge relationships with those entering 
the market for the first time.
With our enhanced origination 
capabilities following the Capquest 
acquisition and our flexible business 
model, we continue to look for 
opportunities in both new asset classes 
and geographies.
With the addition of Capquest’s 
servicing capabilities, we can now also 
offer a much wider range of services  
and solutions to UK sellers.
We look to originate opportunities 
outside of the UK in mainland Europe  
and target circa half of our annual 
investments to come from this geography.
We will continue to develop our 
relationships with investment funds as they 
own significant portfolio assets and 
regularly dispose of these as part of their 
investment and disposal cycle.
We will continue to maintain a strong 
balance sheet which will provide us  
with the necessary capital for future 
acquisitions.
Business environment
There are a number of external factors which,  
we believe, will shape the coming year for our 
business and the industry as a whole:
With our enhanced 
origination capabilities 
following the Capquest 
acquisition and flexible 
business model we 
continue to look for 
opportunities in both 
new asset classes and 
geographies. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 39
Strategic report
Panel sizes
Overview
We believe that creditors will continue  
to be discriminating in their choice of 
purchaser and that for those who have 
not already reviewed their purchasing  
panels, they will inevitably look to reduce 
and consolidate.
As a result of shrinking panel sizes  
and enhanced regulatory requirements, 
the number of servicers and purchasers  
in the market will continue to consolidate, 
leaving fewer, but larger market 
participants.
Those that remain will be the purchasers 
with scale, superior data capabilities and 
a proven track record for compliance.
Our approach
We have transacted with over 60 creditors, 
and have repeatedly won business  
with a core group. Our track record and 
reputation for data analytics, compliance 
and service has enabled us to maintain 
strong relationships with existing creditor 
clients and will allow us to proactively 
build new ones.
Capquest’s reputation for being a highly 
compliant business mirrors our own 
structure and will only strengthen our 
offering to prospective sellers.
Our origination team has grown  
and now has access to a greater pool  
of prospective creditor clients with  
the addition of Capquest’s expertise and 
relationships.
We remain on the panels of all of our 
major creditors.
Pricing
Overview
We expect the supply of debt portfolios 
to increase in both the UK and mainland 
Europe, especially within the financial 
services arena, as sellers get to grips with 
regulatory, accounting and capital 
adequacy requirements.
We also expect to see some  
portfolios come to market earlier in  
the collections lifecycle.
For better performing portfolios  
and those tendered through an auction, 
we expect increased competition.
Our approach
We remain focused on a disciplined 
approach to diversification by  
asset class and with the acquisition of 
Capquest, we have added to our 
origination capabilities.
We continue to benefit from a  
high proportion of off market/bilateral 
negotiated investments (70% of  
invested capital in 2014 was off market).
In 2014, we invested in two new 
European geographies, France and 
Holland, which are expected to provide 
additional origination opportunities.
In the UK, our PCB data matching tools 
continues to improve our collections  
and pricing capabilities.
In Portugal, a market where we also 
hold considerable assets (15% of our overall 
book by face value), we have improved 
our match rates with portfolio purchases 
in 2014 containing on average circa 26% 
of matched customer records.
Entering 2015, we have a strong 
investment pipeline and expect 
portfolio purchases for the year  
to be in line with expectations, 
underpinned by a higher level of 
committed purchases of £36 
million for 2015, with a further £25 
million already in place for 2016. 
These committed purchases are 
important as they allow us to  
lock in future portfolio acquisitions 
at prices that meet our targeted 
return expectations. The integration 
of Capquest is progressing well 
and we remain on track to deliver 
£6.5 million of pre-tax cost  
savings in 2016.
We will continue to evolve our 
business model in order to meet 
new regulatory standards. We 
believe that increased regulation 
of the industry will benefit the 
leading market players and, as such, 
feel we are well placed to deliver 
continued growth.

Directors’ and committee reports
Results and going concern
The Group’s results are discussed in  
the financial highlights, chairman’s 
statement, chief executive officer’s review 
and strategic report on pages 4, 6 and 8 
respectively, which are incorporated into 
this report by reference.
Consideration of going concern  
can be seen on page 85. After making 
appropriate enquiries, the directors  
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group will be able to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, owing to the fact  
that forecasts show sufficient resources are 
available throughout the period under 
review. Thus, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the annual financial statements.
Fair, balanced and understandable
As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 Edition (‘the 
Code’), the directors confirm that they 
consider that this annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The board came to this view following 
a rigorous review process throughout  
the production schedule. The annual 
report is drafted by appropriate members 
of the reporting and leadership teams 
and is managed by the investor relations 
co-ordinator to ensure consistency. A 
series of planned reviews are undertaken 
by the reporting team, leadership team 
and directors in advance of final 
consideration by the board. The annual 
report is also reviewed by the audit and 
risk committee.
Dividends
The directors recommend the payment of 
a final dividend of 3.4p per ordinary share 
for the financial year ended 31 December 
2014 (2013: £nil) to be paid (assuming 
shareholder approval is obtained) on 9 July 
2015 to ordinary shareholders on the 
register on 12 June 2015. This together with 
the interim dividend of 1.7p per share 
(2013: nil) paid on 9 October 2014 brings 
the total dividend for the year to 5.1p  
per share (2013: nil).
Share capital
As at 31 December 2014, the Company 
had 174.4 million ordinary shares in issue, 
of one class, with a nominal value of  
1p each. On a show of hands at a general 
meeting of the Company, each member 
present in person or by proxy, and entitled 
to vote, shall have one vote and, on a 
poll, every member shall have one vote 
for every ordinary share held. There  
are no issued shares in the Company with 
special rights with regard to control of 
the Company.
The directors present their annual report on  
the affairs of the Group, together with the 
financial statements and auditor’s report, for the 
year ended 31 December 2014. The corporate 
governance report set out on page 49 forms  
part of this report. The Company’s principal 
subsidiaries are listed in note 23.
Report of the 
directors Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 45
Directors’ and committee reports
Purchase of own shares
At the 2014 annual general meeting, 
shareholders authorised the Company to 
make market purchases of up to 17 ,443,902 
ordinary shares representing 10% of the 
issued share capital at that time, and to allot 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,162,926.84. These authorities expire at 
the 2015 annual general meeting. During 
the year to 31 December 2014, no shares 
were allotted or repurchased. Resolutions 
to renew these authorities will be proposed 
at the 2015 annual general meeting.
The Company operates an independent 
employee benefit trust for future benefit 
to employees of the Group. Bedell Trustees 
Limited is the trustee of the Arrow Global 
Group PLC employee benefit trust (‘the 
Trust’). During the financial year, the Trust 
transferred shares to the Trustee of the 
Arrow Global Share Incentive Plan (‘the 
SIP’) to satisfy awards of shares to 
participating employees under the SIP.  
As at 31 December 2014, the Trust held 
154,562 ordinary shares (2013: 251,572 
shares) representing 0.1% (2013: 0.1 %)  
of the Company’s issued share capital.  
The Trust deed contains a dividend waiver 
provision in relation to these shares. 
There were no purchases of shares by the 
Trust during the year.
Transfer of securities
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of shares, limitations on the holding  
of shares or requirements to obtain prior 
approval of the Company, or of other 
holders of securities in the Company, to a 
transfer of shares, except as laid out below. 
As part of the IPO, certain directors 
agreed not to sell or dispose of any shares 
in the Company for a period of 24 months 
from the date of the IPO, save with the 
written consent of the Global co-ordinator, 
Goldman Sachs International.
The board may decline to register  
a transfer of any share which is not fully 
paid. Registration of a transfer of an 
uncertificated share may be refused in the 
circumstances set out in the uncertificated 
securities rules (as defined in the articles 
of association) and where, in the case of a 
transfer to joint holders, the number of 
joint holders to whom the uncertificated 
share is to be transferred exceeds four. 
The board may decline to register a 
transfer of a certificated share unless the 
instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped 
or certified or otherwise shown to the 
satisfaction of the board to be exempt 
from stamp duty and is accompanied  
by the relevant share certificate and such 
other evidence of the right to transfer  
as the board may reasonably require; (ii) 
is in respect of only one class of share; 
and (iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of 
not more than four such transferees. 
Further, the board may decline to register 
a transfer of a certificated share where 
the transfer is requested by a person with 
more than a 0.25% interest in the issued 
share capital of the Company (excluding 
treasury shares) if such a person has  
been served with a restriction notice after 
failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act 2006, unless the transfer  
is shown to the board to be pursuant to an 
arm’s length sale (as defined in the 
articles of association). 
The articles of association also contain 
certain restrictions on transfer which are 
designed to ensure that the assets of the 
Company are not deemed to constitute 
‘plan assets’ within the meaning of the 
Plan Asset Regulations (as defined in the 
articles of association) because the 
directors have been advised that this could 
result in the Company becoming subject 
to certain onerous obligations under US 
law. Accordingly, the articles of association 
provide that the board may refuse to 
register a transfer of shares, or compulsorily 
require the transfer of shares, where a 
transfer of shares, or continued holding 
of shares, would cause, or is likely to 
cause (i) the assets of the Company to be 
considered ‘plan assets’ under the Plan 
Asset Regulations or (ii) the Company to 
suffer any pecuniary disadvantage, 
including any excise tax, penalties or 
liabilities, under ERISA or the IR Code (each 
as defined in the articles of association).
No shares carry any special rights with 
regard to control of the Company and 
there are no restrictions on voting rights 
except that a shareholder has no right  
to vote in respect of a share unless all 
sums due in respect of that share are fully 
paid. There are no known agreements 
between holders of securities that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or voting rights and no known 
arrangements under which financial 
rights are held by a person other than the 
holders of the shares.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 3 March 2015, the following  
interests amounting to 3% or  
more in the Company’s shares had  
been notified to the Company:

Directors’ and committee reports
Report of the 
directors
Directors 
Biographical details of the directors of 
the Company during the year and to the  
date of this report can be seen on  
pages 42 and 43. Lan Tu was appointed  
as non-executive director post year end, 
with effect from 9 March 2015.
The directors are aware of the 
retirement by rotation provisions in the 
Code that apply to FTSE 350 companies 
and have adopted these provisions. Lan Tu 
offers herself for election by shareholders 
for the first time at the 2015 annual 
general meeting. All other directors will 
offer themselves for re-election at the 
2015 annual general meeting. 
Directors’ interests
The directors’ interests in the share capital 
of the Company at 31 December 2014 are 
set out on page 59.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has granted indemnities  
to all of its directors on terms consistent 
with the applicable statutory provisions. 
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
for the purposes of section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006 were accordingly in 
force during the course of the year, and 
remain in force at the date of this report.
Interim report
Current regulations permit the Company 
not to send copies of its interim reports  
to shareholders. Furthermore, the 2015 
interim results will not be sent to 
shareholders. Interim results and other 
information about the Company will  
be available on the Company’s website  
at www.arrowglobalir.net
Electronic and website 
communication with shareholders
The Company’s articles of association 
permit electronic communication with 
shareholders as provided in the Companies 
Act 2006. The Company obtained 
authority from its shareholders at the 2014 
annual general meeting to implement 
electronic communication. It is intended 
that the 2014 annual report and notice  
of annual general meeting 2015 will  
be distributed electronically and via the 
Company’s website to shareholders  
who have consented, or deemed to have 
consented. Shareholders who have 
requested shareholder information in hard 
copy form will continue to receive this.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value  
on the involvement of its employees and 
uses a number of ways to engage with 
the team on matters that impact them and 
the performance of the Group. These 
include regular Company-wide update 
meetings and email communication, use 
of the colleague council, the distribution 
of a weekly newsletter, focus group 
meetings, annual employee surveys and 
regular Company-wide business update 
meetings and workshops. Our people 
managers carry out monthly one-to-one 
meetings with their direct reports and 
the senior management team has an open 
door policy which allows all employees  
to discuss any concerns or new initiatives. 
The Group also has a whistleblowing 
policy available on the employee intranet 
and employees are made aware of this  
at induction and through regular on-going 
refresher training.
Disabled persons
The Company adopts a consistent, 
non-discriminatory approach to all 
applicants, with due regard to their skills 
and abilities. In the event of an employee 
becoming disabled, every effort is made 
to ensure that their employment within 
the Company continues and that 
appropriate training is arranged where 
necessary. It is the policy of the Company 
that training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons should,  
as far as possible, be identical to that  
of other employees.
Environmental policy
Due to the nature of its business activities, 
the Group’s environmental impact is 
considered minimal. An environmental 
policy is in place to increase employee 
awareness of environmental issues and 
complies with all relevant regulatory 
requirements. The Group’s environmental 
impacts are through resource use and 
business travel. Key areas of the policy 
addressing the business’ environmental 
impact are as follows:
�  Minimising paper usage and the  
purchase of recycled paper and 
packaging where possible.
� Energy efficient office products.
� Recycling office waste. 
�  Increased use of video and  
conference calls.
�  Supporting cycling to work through  
a cycle to work scheme.
Carbon reporting – methodology
We have followed the requirements of 
the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting  
and Reporting Standard (revised edition) 
and the Carbon Trust conversion factors 
to measure and report greenhouse gas 
emissions, as well as the disclosure 
requirements in Part 7 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. 
The financial control method, which 
captures the sources that fall within our 
consolidated financial statements, has 
been used. Although we operate an 
outsourced model working with partners, 
these partners do not work exclusively 
for the Group and therefore it is not 
deemed appropriate to include emissions 
outside of the Group consolidated 
financial statements. The reporting period 
aligns to the financial period (i.e. the  
year to 31 December 2014) and the 
Group’s carbon reporting falls under 
three scopes: Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 47
Directors’ and committee reports
Whilst we consider our carbon emissions 
to be low, the main area we can control is 
business travel and we will continue to 
make employees aware of environmental 
impacts.
Statement of disclosure of 
information to the auditor
Each of the persons who is a director  
at the date of approval of the financial 
statements confirms that:
 1.  so far as the director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and
2.  the director has taken all steps he ought 
to have taken as a director to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor 
is aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should  
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.

Directors’ and committee reports
Directors’ responsibilities 
statement
The directors are responsible for preparing  
the annual report and the financial  
statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors  
to prepare Group and parent Company 
financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements  
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted  
by the European Union (EU) and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements with UK 
Accounting Standards. Under company 
law, the directors must not approve  
the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent Company and of their profit or loss 
for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
�  select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently
�  make judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
�  state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU
�  prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent Company will continue  
in business
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a strategic report, directors’ 
report, directors’ remuneration report 
and corporate governance statement that 
complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on

Directors’ and committee reports
Corporate  
governance report
The board considers that active dialogue  
with its shareholders, bondholders and  
revolving credit facility providers to be vital  
to the success of the business.
Compliance statement
This corporate governance report, 
together with the reports of the audit and 
risk committee, nomination committee, 
disclosure committee and the directors’ 
remuneration report, provide a description 
of how the main principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published 
by the Financial Reporting Council  
(FRC) in September 2012 (‘the Code’), have 
been applied by the Company in 2014. 
The Code is available on the FRC website 
at www.frc.org.uk
FRC issued an updated version of  
the Code in September 2014, to apply to 
accounting periods beginning after  
1 October 2014. The Company is reporting 
against the 2012 edition of the Code.
During the year, the Company was  
in compliance with the relevant provisions  
of the Code and intends to continue  
to comply with the requirements of the 
Code, which sets out standards of good 
practice in relation to board leadership and 
effectiveness, remuneration, accountability 
and relations with shareholders. 
The board currently comprises seven 
members, including me, as chairman, 
three executive directors (Tom Drury, 
Rob Memmott, Zachary Lewy) and three 
independent non-executive directors  
(Sir George Mathewson, Iain Cornish and 
Robin Phipps). The board regarded me, 
as chairman, as independent upon my 
appointment, and considers that I continue 
to meet the independence criteria.  
Lan Tu joins the board on 9 March 2015 as 
an independent non-executive director 
bringing the board total to eight members.
Sir George Mathewson is the Company’s 
senior independent director (SID). The 
board is satisfied that Sir George is 
independent in character and judgment 
and with skills and experience that make 
him well suited to the role. 
Where a company is outside the FTSE 
350, the Code recommends that the 
board of directors includes at least two 
‘independent’ non-executive directors. 
The Company (being outside the FTSE 
350) currently has four independent  
non-executive directors, including me  
as chairman, and therefore complies  
with the recommendations of the Code. 
Biographical details of all the  
directors are set on pages 42 and 43. The 
board adopted the provision regarding 
the annual re-election of all directors at 
the first annual general meeting in 2014 
and intends to continue this at the 2015 
annual general meeting. Lan Tu will  
offer herself for election by shareholders 
for the first time at the 2015 annual 
general meeting.
Shareholder, bondholder  
and revolving credit facility 
provider engagement
The board considers that active dialogue 
with its shareholders, bondholders and 
revolving credit facility providers to be vital 
to the success of the business. Further 
details regarding these engagements are 
set out on page 52.

Leadership 
The board
The board is responsible to the Company’s 
shareholders for the long-term success 
of the Company, its strategy, values and 
governance. The board maintains a formal 
schedule of matters for consideration, 
which include: 
�  establishing long-term strategic objectives
�  approving annual operating and  
capital budgets
�  reviewing business performance
�  overseeing the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems
�  reviewing corporate governance 
arrangements 
�  approving shareholder return policy
�  ensuring appropriate resources are  
in place to enable the Company to meet 
its objectives
�  ensuring appropriate oversight of 
portfolio investments
Chairman and chief  
executive officer
The positions of the chairman and chief 
executive officer are held by separate 
individuals and the board has clearly 
defined their responsibilities. The 
chairman is primarily responsible for the 
effective working of the board and 
ensuring that each director, particularly 
the non-executive directors, is able to 
make an effective contribution.
The chief executive officer has 
responsibility for operational matters, 
which includes the implementation of  
the Group strategy and policies approved 
by the board.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed 
for periods of three years, subject to 
shareholder approval. Terms in excess of 
six years are subject to a more rigorous 
review. The non-executive directors 
meet periodically without the executive 
directors present. 
Recruitment of directors
Executive search firms are appointed on 
an as needed basis. JCA Group were 
retained in relation to the appointment of 
Lan Tu. This firm has no other connection 
with the Company.
Diversity
In line with proposals outlined in  
Lord Davies report ‘Women on  
Boards: February 2011’, from Lan Tu’s 
appointment on 9 March 2015, the 
company has a 12.5% female 
representation on the board (1 female 
director out of eight board members). 
Effectiveness
Time commitment 
The individual letters of appointment set 
out the expected time commitment for 
non-executive directors and are available 
for inspection at our registered office. 
Other significant commitments are 
disclosed to the board on each occasion 
that these commitments change. 
Undertakings are given that non-executive 
directors will have sufficient time to  
meet requirements of the role. Details of 
the chairman’s and other directors’ 
commitments can be seen in the director 
biographies on pages 42 and 43.

Directors’ and committee reports
Continued professional 
development undertaken  
during the year
New appointments to the board generally 
have previous experience as a director of  
a listed company. Training is offered to all 
new directors as necessary. The chairman, 
together with the chief executive officer 
and company secretary, ensure new 
directors receive a full, formal and tailored 
induction upon joining the board, 
including full briefing packs. As part of  
a tailored induction programme, new 
directors meet with key advisors and 
members of the executive team. On-going 
training was provided during the year  
for existing directors. 
Major shareholders are offered the 
opportunity to meet newly appointed 
non-executive directors should they 
express a desire to do so.
Access to independent advice
An approved procedure for all directors 
to take independent professional advice,  
at the Company’s expense, is in place. 
The committees are provided with 
sufficient resources, including the ability 
to appoint external advisors when  
they deem it appropriate to call upon  
a particular resource. 
All directors have access to the advice 
and services of the company secretary 
and are entitled to rely on the impartial and 
independent nature of such advice and 
services. The company secretary is 
responsible to the board for both the 
proper administration of procedures and 
arrangements established by the board 
for the conduct of its own business, and 
the Company’s compliance with internal 
and external rules and regulations. The 
board receives agendas and supporting 
papers well in advance of board meetings.
Evaluation of the board  
and committees
The board undertook a process of 
self-evaluation of its performance during 
the year. A questionnaire was issued to 
board members for review and completion 
and was subsequently submitted to the 
chairman, who has reviewed the responses 
and reported on the conclusions to  
the board. An internal evaluation of both  
the audit and risk and remuneration 
committees took place adopting the same 
procedure. The board has confirmed  
that its performance, as well as the 
contribution of each of the executive and 
non-executive directors, demonstrates 
commitment to their respective roles and 
that the board members’ respective  
skills complement each other and enhance 
the overall operation of the board.
Accountability
Adequacy of risk management  
and internal control systems
The board complies with this Code 
provision in line with the guidance 
published by the FRC, ‘Internal Guide: 
Guidance for Directors’ (formerly known 
as the Turnbull Guidance). In this context, 
the board undertakes a regular review  
of the Group’s systems of internal control 
(which includes financial, operational  
and compliance controls and risk 
management). The board is responsible 
for the Group’s systems of internal control. 
Risk management is designed to identify 
and mitigate risks, but it does not eliminate 
all risks. The board has approved an 
appropriate suite of policies on internal 
control, and seeks regular assurance that 
it is able to satisfy itself that the systems 
of internal control are effective in 
managing risks in the manner in which it 
has approved. During the year, the board 
carried out a review of key risks affecting 
the business, which are documented  
on pages 14 and 15 of the strategic report. 
The following activities are considered 
to cover the most critical business 
processes and associated risks:
�  A disciplined underwriting process, 
overseen by the investment committee 
(which includes the chairman and executive 
directors, and with delegated authority 
to the executive committee for certain 
smaller transactions), whose function  
is to ensure an objective, rigorous and 
consistent approach to pricing and due 
diligence. Additionally, any transactions 
greater than £20 million in investment 
value are escalated to the board for 
approval. The processes and controls  
are documented in an underwriting 
process manual.
�  A strong risk and compliance framework  
is embedded across the business via the 
audit and risk committee, executive  
and management teams and supported 
by the risk management framework  
and maintenance of the Group and 
departmental risk registers.
�  Regular monitoring of portfolio 
performance, overseen by the portfolio 
review committee, which considers actual 
versus forecast results at an individual 
portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on 
a quarterly basis, signs off the latest  
ERC forecast, assesses the carrying value 
of the portfolio assets and reviews  
revenue recognition.
�  Internal controls exist over all key processes 
of the Group that have an impact on the 
financial results. Full documentation of 
these processes is well progressed via the 
Group accounting manual and other 
departmental manuals and new processes 
are documented as business need arises. 
The committee has not identified or been 
advised of any material failing or weakness 
deemed to be significant.
Comprehensive reporting to the board 
on the above activities takes place 
throughout the year.
Non-audit services provided  
by the auditor
The provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor is monitored throughout 
the year. The audit and risk committee 
recognised that the non-audit fees were 
significant in 2013 mainly as a result of 
one-off projects, namely the issuance of 
senior secured notes in January 2013 and 
the IPO in October 2013 and a specific 
policy was developed and adopted in 2014. 
The committee was mindful that, whilst 
these were one off non-recurring items, 
the aim was to maintain a lower level of 
non-audit fees going forward.
The level of non-audit fees provided 
by the external auditor for the year is 
vastly reduced from the 2013 level as can 
be see on from note 9 on page 93. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 52
Directors’ and committee reports
Corporate  
governance report
The Chairman of the audit and risk 
committee regularly reviews the level of 
non-audit fees with all non-audit services 
requiring approval, in advance of being 
incurred. The committee has concluded 
that the provision of non-audit services 
to date has not compromised auditor 
independence and objectivity. Future 
non-audit services will be undertaken in 
line with the non-audit services policy 
approved by the committee, taking into 
account ethical guidance regarding the 
provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditors. This includes the rotation 
of senior partners and professional staff 
and the involvement of additional partners 
and specialists to carry out reviews  
of the work performed and to advise  
where necessary. 
Internal audit function
The audit and risk committee is responsible 
for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of internal audit activities. 
The audit and risk committee approved 
the appointment of an outsourced  
internal audit provider, BDO, in April 2014. 
BDO report at each meeting on their 
activities to the audit and risk committee, 
which agrees their work programme  
in advance.
Conflicts of interests
Company policy requires that if a director 
becomes aware that they have a direct or 
indirect interest in an existing or proposed 
transaction with the Company, they 
should notify the board at the next board 
meeting or by providing a written 
declaration. Directors have a continuing 
duty to update any changes in such 
interests. See also the related party 
transactions note 22. 
Approving significant transactions 
and investment decisions  
The business acquires non-performing 
loan portfolios as part of its ordinary course 
of business. The Group applies a multi-
stage approach to its underwriting and 
pricing process, with the aim of achieving 
attractive adjusted returns, based on  
the Group’s underwriting models, analytical 
processes and servicing strategies. 
The origination team reviews 
approximately 100 transactions per year, 
with circa 25 completed transactions. 
Transactions range from repeat 
transactions with creditors and asset 
classes familiar to the Group, through to 
more complex consortium trades  
with special purpose vehicle structures. 
An authority matrix sets out the 
delegated authority to the investment 
committee and executive committee. 
The board retains authority for any new 
asset classes or geography, complex 
deals over £10 million and any transaction 
over £20 million. Based upon recent 
performance, the board will be asked to 
consider circa four to five transactions 
per annum. 
Bribery Act compliance
The Company has an anti-bribery policy 
that is available on the Company’s 
intranet and website and is in line with 
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) Guidelines.  
The policy contains a gifts and hospitality 
procedure and prohibits facilitation 
payments. Adequate and regular training 
on the policy and the principles outlined 
therein is provided to staff and directors. 
The Company considers it to have 
adequate procedures within the meaning 
of the MOJ Guidelines. The chief risk 
officer has primary and day-to-day 
responsibility for implementing this policy, 
while the Company’s chief financial 
officer has ultimate responsibility to the 
board for compliance with the policy.
Remuneration
In line with the Code and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Disclosure Regulations 2013, 
details on remuneration, including the 
policy report to be approved at the annual 
general meeting and the annual report 
on remuneration, can be seen on pages  
54 to 71.
Relations with shareholders
In March 2014, RBS Special Opportunities 
Fund executed an agreement for the 
disposal of its entire shareholding in the 
Company, consisting of 41,712,397 ordinary 
shares and representing approximately 
23.9% of the Company’s issued share 
capital. This disposal was effected by  
way of a placing of shares to institutional 
investors (the ‘Placing‘), thereby 
terminating the relationship agreement.
As a result of the disposal of the  
RBS Special Opportunities Fund’s entire 
shareholding, Lindsey McMurray and  
Ian Gascoigne, directors of the Company 
appointed by the RBS Special Opportunities 
Fund, stepped down from the board of 
the Company on 19 March 2014.
Dialogue with shareholders, 
bondholders and revolving credit 
facility providers
Following meetings or telephone 
conversations with brokers, the chairman 
communicates to the entire board the 
views of shareholders, bond holders and 
revolving credit facility providers (‘key 
stakeholders’). The chief executive officer 
and the chief financial officer regularly 
speak and meet with key stakeholders. The 
chairman is available to discuss governance 
and strategy with key stakeholders. 
Non-executive directors and the SID have 
the opportunity to attend meetings  
with key stakeholders and would attend  
if requested.  Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 53
Directors’ and committee reports
Following the announcement of the 
preliminary and interim results and  
the executive directors’ presentations to 
analysts and shareholders, the board 
receives a report on institutional feedback, 
prepared by the Company’s advisors.  
The chief executive officer and the chief 
financial officer also verbally report on 
their meetings with shareholders. Copies 
of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings are 
circulated to the board.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting is an 
opportunity for all shareholders to both 
vote on resolutions put forward and ask 
the board any questions they may have. 
The notice of meeting and annual report 
will be sent out at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. Separate votes will be 
held for each proposed resolution and  
a proxy count will be given in each case. 
The proxy forms will provide a ‘vote 
withheld’ option. The chairmen of the 
audit and risk, remuneration and 
nomination committees attend and are 
available to answer questions.
Disclosure committee
The disclosure committee is made up of 
one non-executive director, Iain Cornish, 
who chairs the committee, and one 
executive director, Rob Memmott, the 
chief financial officer. The disclosure 
committee meets at such times as may 
be necessary or appropriate. 
The disclosure committee is responsible 
for monitoring, evaluating and enhancing 
disclosure controls and procedures of 
the Group. In particular, responsibilities 
set out in the terms of reference include 
identification of inside information and 
maintenance of insider lists, the design, 
implementation and evaluation of 
disclosure procedures and the resolution 
of any questions concerning the 
materiality of certain information. The 
disclosure committee is also required to 
help the Company and the Group to 
make timely and accurate disclosure of all 
information where disclosure is required 
to meet legal and regulatory obligations. 
Audit and risk committee
Details regarding the audit and risk 
committee and its responsibilities can  
be seen on pages 72 to 74.
Nomination committee
The nomination committee is 
responsible for considering and making 
recommendations to the board in respect 
of appointments to the board, the board 
committees and the chairmanship of the 
board committees. It is also responsible 
for keeping the structure, size and 
composition of the board under regular 
review, and for making recommendations 
to the board with regard to any changes 
necessary. Furthermore, the nomination 
committee is required to ensure that  
the evaluation of the board is externally 
facilitated at least every three years 
should the Company become a FTSE  
350 member. 
The work of the committee has included:
�  Reviewing the terms of reference of  
the committee.
�  Continued monitoring of the structure, 
size, composition and diversity of both  
the board and its committees.
�  The recruitment of a new non-executive 
director.
�  Making recommendations to the board 
on the re-appointment of non-executives 
directors.
�  Approaches to the 2014 board and 
committee performance evaluation review 
(details of which can be found on page 51).
Diversity, whether in terms of skill, 
knowledge, experience or gender, is 
considered by the nomination committee 
when reviewing board composition  
and making recommendations for board 
appointments.
The Code recommends that a majority 
of the members of the nomination 
committee should be independent 
non-executive directors. The committee 
should be chaired by the chairman  
of the board or an independent  
non-executive director. The nomination 
committee is chaired by the chairman, 
Jonathan Bloomer, who was regarded as 
independent on appointment, and also 
comprises an independent non-executive 
director, Iain Cornish. Lindsey McMurray, 
a representative director appointed  
by RBS Special Opportunities Fund, was  
a member of this committee until her 
resignation on 19 March 2014. Lan Tu, will 
join the committee as an independent 
non-executive director following her 
appointment to the board with effect from 
9 March 2015. The chairman will not chair 
the committee when it is dealing with the 
matter of succession to the chairmanship. 
There is compliance with the Code on 
this committee’s composition.
JCA Group was retained to assist with 
the search for a suitable candidate to  
be appointed to the role of non-executive 
director to replace Gillian Key-Vice who 
resigned in November 2014. In accordance 
with the committees’ appointment 
procedures, a number of candidates were 
identified, based on an agreed profile, 
and interviews were held. Following a 
thorough process, and taking into account 
the skills and experience required for the 
role, the board approved the committee’s 
recommendation to appoint Lan Tu as  
an independent non-executive director 
with effect from 9 March 2015.
Remuneration committee
Details on the remuneration committee 
and its responsibilities can be seen on 
pages 54 and 71.

and risk committee, remuneration 
committee and nomination committee

Company secretary
5 March 2015 Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 54
Directors’ and committee reports
Directors’ remuneration 
report
Annual statement
On behalf of the board, I am pleased  
to present our directors’ remuneration 
report for 2014, which sets out the 
amounts earned in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2014 under the 
remuneration policy for the directors of 
Arrow Global Group PLC, which was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 
annual general meeting.
The report complies with the Large 
and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008, the 2012 edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’) and the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules.
The year ended 31 December 2014  
has seen the Group make strong 
progress in a competitive environment, 
as detailed within this annual report. 
2014 incentive out-turns 
Throughout the year the remuneration 
committee has continued to apply  
the remuneration policy prudently with  
a strong alignment to shareholders.  
To encourage behaviours that facilitate 
continued profitable growth and  
future development of the business, the 
2014 annual bonus was based on profit 
before tax and the Group’s key strategic 
priorities in 2014.
As described in the business review 
section of this annual report, the Group 
has performed strongly since IPO 
delivering profitable earnings growth and 
strong progress against the Group’s key 
strategic priorities. As set out on page 80, 
the underlying profit before tax for the 
year was £37 .0 million and the strategic 
objectives were met in full, consequently 
an annual bonus of 78.125% of salary was 
awarded to the executive directors. The 
bonus earned will be delivered through 
the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) 
under which 33% of the bonus is delivered 
as shares vesting after three years with 
the balance delivered in cash on award.
The performance period for the 
long-term incentive plan (LTIP) award 
granted on 11 March 2014 is from  
1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 and 
there is therefore no vesting of the  
LTIP awards in respect of the year ended  
31 December 2014. 
Proposed changes in executive 
remuneration for 2015
After consultation with, and support 
from shareholders, the following 
changes in executive remuneration are 
proposed for 2015. These changes are 
within the remuneration policy approved 
by shareholders at the 2014 annual 
general meeting.
�  Return on equity (ROE) to be included  
as a performance metric for the 2015 LTIP 
awards to increase alignment to the 
Group’s strategy to grow the business 
whilst maintaining a strong focus on the 
underwriting discipline and portfolio 
returns. The LTIP awards made in 2014 
vest 75% based on earnings per share  
(EPS) and 25% based on relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) against the 
FTSE 350. The committee is of the view 
that whilst these metrics continue to  
be appropriate, the absence of a return 
measure does not fully support the  
strategic goals of the Group, and therefore 
does not properly align executive 
behaviour with the Group’s strategy. The 
committee is therefore introducing ROE 
as a metric for 25% of the LTIP award 
alongside EPS (50% of the award) and TSR 
against the FTSE 350 (25% of the award) 
for the 2015 LTIP awards.
�  The remuneration committee has 
determined that base salaries should be 
increased with effect from 1 March 2015 
as detailed below:
-  The base salary of our chief executive 
officer, Tom Drury, will be increased  
by 9.1% from £330,000 to £360,000 with 
effect from 1 March 2015 and it is 
intended that a further increase of 9.7% 
to £395,000 will apply from 1 March 2016.
-  The base salary of our chief financial 
officer, Rob Memmott, will be increased 
by 9 .6% from £260,000 to £285,000 with 
effect from 1 March 2015 and it is 
intended that a further increase of 8.8% 
to £310,000 will apply from 1 March 2016.
-  The base salary of our founder and 
executive director, Zachary Lewy, will be 
increased by 7.1% from £280,000 to 
£300,000 with effect from 1 March 2015.
The remuneration committee took a 
range of factors into account when 
considering these increases. In particular:
-  The increases take account of the 
overall scale and complexity of the Group 
(including the internationality of the 
business and range of asset classes) and 
also reflect the strong performance of 
the executive directors and continued 
transformation of the Group since IPO, 
including the transition to FCA regulation.
-  The committee recognises that it will 
take time to realise the full benefit of the 
Capquest acquisition and this was not 
the underlying reason for the increases. 
-  The committee is mindful of institutional 
investors’ concerns on the upward 
ratchet of base salaries and does not 
consider benchmark data in isolation. 
The remuneration policy is to set salaries 
within a market range to provide 
flexibility to take account of experience  Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 55
Directors’ and committee reports
and performance and to recognise  
the limitations of market data by not 
targeting a specific statistical point. 
However, the committee is strongly of 
the view that, in hindsight, the base 
salaries set at IPO were lower than would 
be anticipated when considering the 
scale and complexity of the business.
-  Internal relativities and the risks posed  
by uncompetitive executive remuneration 
packages were also considered 
recognising the importance of ensuring 
that salaries reflect individual skills, 
experience and scope of responsibility.
-  A responsible approach has been adopted 
by the remuneration committee such 
that these increases will be phased over 
two years and the decision to award a 
salary increase in each year will be subject 
to the continuing strength and growth 
of the enlarged group and the continued 
contribution and performance of the 
executive directors personally.
-  The committee considered whether 
some of the increase should be provided 
through variable remuneration. 
However, the committee believes that 
the balance between fixed and variable 
pay is appropriate as base salaries are 
positioned within the competitive range 
and the current annual bonus and LTIP 
opportunities reward strong business 
performance and drive the delivery of 
shareholder value whilst not seeking to 
encourage inappropriate business risks 
being taken.
�  For the avoidance of doubt, no changes 
are proposed to the maximum quantum 
of the annual bonus and LTIP for 2015 or 
2016 for the current executive directors 
(which limits the growth in the rest of  
the reward package during the two-year 
period over which these salary increases 
are being made). The maximum annual 
bonus opportunity under the binding 
remuneration policy will remain at 125% 
salary. There is also no current intention  
to increase the LTIP awards above  
the current 150% of salary. As a further 
assurance, there will be no LTIP awards  
to the current executive directors above  
the 2015 levels until 2017 at the earliest 
and, only then, if the committee considers 
there to be a strong commercial  
rationale (for example, there is a change 
in the scope of the role or increase in 
responsibility, a reduction to other 
elements of the remuneration package, 
or a significant change in the size and 
complexity of the Group).
�  In addition to the above changes, the 
minimum shareholding requirement is 
being increased from 150% to 200% of 
base salary for the chief executive officer 
and from 100% to 150% of base salary for 
the other executive directors.
Minor amendments to the 
remuneration policy
Some minor amendments are also being 
made to the remuneration policy that 
was approved by shareholders at the 
annual general meeting on 28 May 2014. 
Shareholder approval is being sought  
for these amendments to ensure that the 
remuneration policy is consistent with 
the intended operation of the share plans 
adopted at IPO. These changes:
-  permit the element of the annual  
bonus deferred into shares under the 
Company’s DSBP to be deferred on  
a gross (pre tax) as well as a net (post 
tax) basis 
-  allow the grant of part of an award 
under the LTIP to take the form of a tax 
qualifying option over shares to a  
value prescribed by the applicable tax 
legislation (currently £30,000),  
without increasing the gross value 
delivered to participants 
-  permit the making of dividend 
equivalent payments under the LTIP  
and DSBP in respect of dividends that 
would have been paid over the period 
to vesting on shares that vest
Miscellaneous
For completeness, the statement issued 
on 15 May 2014 on the company website 
confirming that the committee’s 
discretion to make payments or awards 
of variable remuneration outside the 
policy will only be used in response to 
regulatory or legislative changes and 
would not exceed the limits in the policy 
table, has been incorporated in this 
policy on page 64.
This report is prepared in accordance 
with the regulations for directors’ 
remuneration reporting and is presented 
in two sections: the annual report on 
remuneration and the directors’ 
remuneration policy. 
�  The annual report on remuneration 
provides details of the amounts earned in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 
2014 and how the directors’ remuneration 
policy will be operated for the year

to an advisory vote at the 2015 annual 
general meeting.
�  The directors’ remuneration policy will be 
tabled at the forthcoming 2015 annual

Annual report on remuneration
Remuneration philosophy
The remuneration committee is responsible to the board of directors for determining a remuneration policy for executive directors, 
together with the specific terms and conditions of employment of each individual director, and for reviewing the overall policy for 
executive remuneration. In summary, the objective of the remuneration policy is to enable the Group to offer a package of rewards 
that is aligned with the strategy for the business by:
�  Ensuring remuneration is competitive but not excessive by reference to pay levels in comparable groups.
�  Taking into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive. 
�  A substantial proportion of the remuneration is variable and linked to Group performance, in particular, to the delivery of our vision 
and our strategy and the performance of the individual.
�  To encourage behaviours that facilitate profitable and maintainable growth and the future development of the business, short-term 
performance is assessed against both profit and a balanced range of specific strategic, personal and other key Group objectives.
�  Long-term performance is measured by assessing the growth in EPS, ROE and TSR. These metrics are a key measure of the success 
of the delivery of shareholder value.
�  The committee considers the performance outcomes in the wider context of personal performance (including values and behaviours), 
risk, market and other factors.
�  Malus and clawback provisions apply under the variable incentives and the reward framework is designed to ensure an appropriate 
level of risk is maintained by the executive directors.
�  To best align the interests of executives with shareholders a significant proportion of remuneration is performance related and 
delivered in shares. The executive directors are expected to build up and retain legal share ownership equivalent to at least 150% 
of salary (200% for the chief executive officer).

As disclosed last year, on IPO, Initial Share Option Plan (ISOP) options were granted to and exercised by Mr Memmott over 1,676,562 ordinary shares in the Company. 915,266 vested and were 
sold immediately to cover his tax liability and national insurance contributions arising on exercise. The balance of 761,296 shares are restricted shares for a period of two years following the 
IPO conditional on continued employment.

Mr Memmott and Mr Lewy receive a monthly contribution from the Group into a self-invested pension plan. These contributions are circa 15% of salary. Mr Drury receives a monthly cash 
allowance in lieu of participation in a pension arrangement as salary. This amount is not included in the annual bonus or LTIP allocation.
Directors’ remuneration 
report Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 57
Directors’ and committee reports
Executive directors were eligible for an annual performance related bonus of up to 125% of salary only in circumstances where stretching 
performance targets have been satisfied. To encourage behaviours that facilitate continued profitable growth and future development 
of business the 2014 annual bonus was based on the following performance targets:
Measure Weighting Performance targets
Underlying profit before tax 75% of maximum � £35.15m – no vesting
pre exceptionals  � £35.15m 20% of this element vests
  � £37 .00m 50% of this element vests
  � £40.70m 100% of this element vests
  � Straight line vest between these points
Strategic targets 25% of maximum � Originate £120m of purchases at or above target return
  � Enter 1 new European geography
  � Acquire 1 new asset class
  � Be on track with FCA readiness plan
  � No material regulatory/compliance issues
Underlying profit before tax pre-exceptionals was £37.0 million and 50% of this element vested and all the strategic targets were 
met. Consequently an annual bonus of 78.125% of salary vested to the executive directors.
Annual bonus payments to executive directors also have the following restrictions:
�  33% of the bonus earned is deferred into shares in the Company for a period of three-years.
�  Clawback provisions are operated which give the remuneration committee the right to reduce any deferred bonus award which has 
not yet vested or clawback any vested cash bonus or vested deferred bonus in the circumstances detailed in the policy report.

Directors’ shareholdings (audited information)
As set out in the remuneration policy, the remuneration committee encourages share ownership by the executive directors in order 
to align their interests with those of shareholders. It does this by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is delivered 
in shares (as well as being subject to performance conditions).

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2015
The remuneration arrangements for 2015 will be implemented in line with the policy section of this report as follows:
Base salaries
After consultation with, and support from our major shareholders, the remuneration committee has determined that base salaries 
should be increased with effect from 1 March 2015 as detailed below.

Rob Memmott         285  260  9 .6%
Zachary Lewy         300  280  7 .1%
The remuneration committee considers the proposed salary increases are appropriate taking account of:
�  the strong performance of the executive directors and the strength of the management team
�  the continued transformation of the Group since IPO, including the transition to FCA regulation
�  the overall scale and complexity and scale of the Group (including the internationality of the business and range of assets classes) 
�  the strong view of the committee that, in hindsight, the base salaries set at IPO were lower than would be anticipated when 
considering the complexity of the business
�  internal relativities and the risks posed by uncompetitive executive remuneration packages were also considered recognising the 
importance of ensuring that salaries reflect individual skills, experience and scope of responsibility
The committee recognises that it will take time to realise the full benefit of the Capquest acquisition and this was not the underlying 
reason for the increases.

Annual bonus
The maximum opportunity will remain at 125% of base salary. 50% of the bonus will be based on underlying profit for the year 
attributable to equity shareholders and 50% of the bonus will be assessed against a balanced range of financial, strategic, personal 
and other key Group objectives.
The directors consider the targets under the annual bonus plan to be commercially sensitive because they provide the Group’s 
competitors with insight into the Group’s business plans, expectations and strategic actions. However, the committee will continue to 
disclose how the bonus pay-out delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
33% of any bonus for 2015 is proposed to be deferred into shares under the DSBP on a gross basis in line with the new remuneration policy.
LTIP
The remuneration committee is not proposing any changes to the LTIP policy for 2015 (other than the introduction of the ability  
to grant ‘qualifying LTIP awards’ as referred to on pages 55 and 66 and the introduction of ROE as a performance metric) and the 
maximum opportunity for 2015 will remain at 150%. 
To ensure that the performance metrics and targets for the LTIP are consistent with the Group’s objectives, the remuneration 
committee is introducing ROE as a performance metric alongside EPS and TSR against the FTSE 350. This will increase alignment to 
the Group’s strategy to grow the business whilst maintaining a strong focus on the underwriting discipline and portfolio returns. 
The introduction of ROE alongside the existing metrics fully supports the Group’s strategy over the medium/long-term and is an 
internal KPI fully recognised and used in the day-to-day management of the business. The weightings for each measure have been 
set to balance what the committee consider to be the direction of focus for management in its day-to-day direction of the business 
with its ultimate responsibility to shareholders.
Details of the performance targets for the 2015 LTIP awards are set out in the table below.

In each case, performance will be measured over three years with straight line vesting between each point for each performance metric.
In calculating TSR, a three-month average is used at both the start and the end of the performance period to ensure that the calculation is not 
impacted by potential volatility arising from day-to-day share price fluctuations. The TSR data and relative positioning will be independently verified.
Directors’ remuneration 
report Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 63
Directors’ and committee reports
The remuneration committee will have the discretion to reduce the level of LTIP vesting based on the committee’s assessment of 
whether vesting delivered by the formulaic output of the three performance measures reflects the underlying performance of the 
Company. The committee’s assessment of underlying performance would include, amongst other things, objective measurement 
of other financial metrics, customer satisfaction and assessment of regulatory compliance. 
Malus and clawback will apply to the LTIP with clawback continuing to apply for a three-year period after vesting and will also apply 
in the event of a significant regulatory risk failure. 
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee during the year consisted of three non-executive directors, who are each considered independent 
under the Code, namely Robin Phipps as chair, Sir George Mathewson, Jonathan Bloomer, and one non-independent non-executive, 
Lindsey McMurray. Ms McMurray resigned from the Company on 19 March 2014. Although not deemed independent within the 
meaning of the Code, Ms McMurray’s position, representing the major shareholder, provided a strong interest in challenging and 
scrutinising management. The Company complies with the recommendations of the Code concerning the number of independent 
non-executive directors that the remuneration committee should have.

Some minor amendments are proposed to the remuneration policy to ensure that it is consistent with the intended operation share 
plans adopted at IPO. These changes:
�  permit the element of the annual bonus deferred into shares under the Company’s DSBP to be deferred on a gross (pre tax) as well 
as a net (post tax) basis
�  allow the grant of part of an award under the LTIP to take the form of a tax qualifying option over shares to a value prescribed by the 
applicable tax legislation (currently £30,000), without increasing the gross value delivered to participants 
�  permit the making of dividend equivalent payments under the LTIP and DSBP in respect of dividends that would have been paid over 
the period to vesting on shares that vest
For completeness, the statement issued on 15 May 2014 on the Company website confirming that the committee’s discretion to make 
payments or awards of variable remuneration outside the policy will only be used in response to regulatory or legislative changes 
and would not exceed the limits in the policy table, has been incorporated into this policy.
The remuneration policy will, subject to shareholder approval, be binding from the date of the 2015 annual general meeting.
Consideration of remuneration of employees generally
When determining the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, the remuneration committee takes into consideration, 
as a matter of course, the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group. In particular, the remuneration committee is 
kept informed of salary increases for the general employee population, the overall spend on annual bonus and participation levels 
in the annual bonus and share plans. 
No consultation with employees takes place in relation to determining the directors’ remuneration policy, although the Group has 
various ways of engaging with its employees collectively as teams and one to one, and the board receives updates and feedback on 
employee engagement. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The remuneration committee is committed to an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on the issues of executive 
remuneration. Where appropriate, the committee will actively engage with shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, 
seeking views which may be taken into account when making any decisions about changes to directors’ remuneration policy. The 
remuneration committee chairman is available to answer questions at the annual general meeting. The remuneration committee 
chairman consulted with and received support from shareholders in respect of introduction of ROE as a performance metrics for 
the LTIP, the proposed changes to the executive directors’ base salaries and the minor changes to the remuneration policy for 2015.

Annual bonus
Reward achievement  
of annual objectives 
whilst encouraging  
a long-term focus 
through the use of 
deferred shares  
via the deferred share 
bonus plan DSBP.
� Performance targets set annually.
� Pay outs determined by remuneration committee 
following the financial year end.
� Up to 50% of the bonus earned is deferred into  
shares for up to three-years via the DSBP, subject to 
continued employment during the vesting period.
� The remuneration committee may make a  
dividend equivalent payment to reflect dividends  
that would have been paid over the period to  
vesting on shares that vest (and which may assume  
the reinvestment of the dividend equivalents).  
The payment may be in the form of additional  
shares or a cash payment equal to the value  
of those additional shares.
� Malus and clawback provisions apply (see pages  
68 and 69).
� Maximum bonus opportunity of  
125% of annual base salary.

up to three years.
� Dividend equivalent 
payments may  
be made under DSBP 
over the period to 
vesting.
LTIP awards

and aligns interests  
of executives with  
those of shareholders.

� Three-year vesting period subject to  
performance conditions.
� LTIP awards normally granted post announcement  
of preliminary/interim results.
� Where exceptional circumstances exist, the 
committee has overriding discretion.
� The remuneration committee may, at its discretion 
structure awards as qualifying LTIP awards  
consisting of both an HMRC tax qualifying option  
and an LTIP award. Qualifying LTIP awards enable  
the participant and the Company to benefit  
from tax advantaged treatment in respect of part  
of the award without increasing the pre tax  
value delivered to participants. The qualifying LTIP 
awards will be structured as a tax qualifying option  
and an LTIP award with the vesting of the LTIP  
award scaled back to take account of any gain  
made in the exercise of the tax advantaged option.
� The remuneration committee may make a  
dividend equivalent payment to reflect dividends  
that would have been paid over the period to  
vesting on shares that vest and over the period

equivalents). The payment may be in form of 
additional shares or a cash payment equal to the  
value of those additional shares.

68 and 69).
� Maximum award of 200% of annual  
base salary. For 2015 and 2016 awards  
to be 150% of annual base salary  
for current executive directors. 
Furthermore, any LTIP awards to the 
current executive directors above the 
2015 levels will only be made where  
the committee considers there to be  
a commercial rationale (for example, 
there is a change in the scope of the 
role or increase in responsibility, a 
reduction to other elements of the 
remuneration package;, or a  
significant change in the size and 
complexity of the Group).
� Tax qualifying option may be granted. 
Shares subject to a tax qualifying  
option granted as part of a qualifying 
LTIP award are not taken into account  
for the purposes of the individual  
limits because, as referred to in the 
operation column, the LTIP award  
will be scaled back to reflect the gain 
made on the exercise of the tax 
advantaged option.
� Performance targets based on  
financial measures, such as EPS  
growth, ROE and TSR.
� 25% of award vests for threshold 
performance rising to 100% for 
maximum performance.
� Where a tax advantaged option  
grant is made the same performance 
conditions apply as applies to the  
LTIP award.
� Tax advantaged 
options may be 
granted as part of  
a qualifying LTIP 
award. To enable the 
participants and the 
Company to benefit 
from tax advantaged 
treatment without 
increasing the pre-tax 
value delivered to 
participants.
� Dividend equivalent 
payments may be 
made under LTIP over 
the period to vesting.

Notes to the policy table
Salaries
Salary positioning takes into account the complexity of the role and performance of the individual, overall corporate performance, 
movements in the employment market and the general economic environment. They should be sufficiently competitive to enable 
recruitment and reward of executives of a suitable calibre for the role and duties required. Setting salaries within a range provides 
the remuneration committee with flexibility to take account of experience and performance and to recruit new hires. It also 
recognises the limitations of market data by not targeting a specific statistical point.
Base salaries are reviewed annually, though not necessarily increased, having regard to market conditions, benchmark data and other 
relevant factors, such as pay increases for the Group’s employees, internal relativities and individual performance. The committee is 
mindful of institutional investors’ concerns on the upward ratchet of base salaries and does not consider benchmark data in isolation.
Annual bonus – performance metrics
The annual bonus is assessed against both financial and a balanced range of specific strategic, personal and other key Group 
objectives determined by the remuneration committee. This incentivises executives to focus on delivering the key financial goals 
of the Company as well as specific strategic objectives which are aligned to delivering the overall business strategy and to encourage 
behaviours which facilitate profitable growth and the future development of the business.
The precise choice of measures and the weightings between them will be reviewed by the committee year-on-year. Performance 
targets will be set at the beginning of each year, and bonus pay outs are determined by the remuneration committee after the year 
end, based on performance against targets.
LTIP awards – performance metrics
Performance is based on financial performance targets, such as EPS growth, return on equity and total shareholder return measured 
over three years.
The committee will review these performance conditions when determining LTIP awards in each year, in order to reflect changes in 
the outlook of the sector and the Group, and to ensure that the targets remain challenging. 
Performance measures are set in line with the key drivers of sustainable performance. Targets are set by the committee at the start 
of the performance period, taking into account external advice on market and best practice. Performance is assessed at the end of 
the relevant period to determine the extent to which awards may vest. The committee also monitors progress against targets 
throughout the period.
The remuneration committee retains the ability to adjust/or set different performance measures if events occur (such as a change 
in strategy, a material acquisition and/or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions), which cause 
the committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their 
original purpose.
Awards may be adjusted in the event of a variation of capital in accordance with the scheme rules.
Malus and clawback 
All cash bonuses paid are subject to potential malus and clawback, at the committee’s discretion, for a period of three years from the 
date of payment where there are exceptional circumstances, such as a material misstatement of the published results of the Group, 
any error in the calculation of any performance condition linked to the calculation of a bonus, material risk failure or gross misconduct. 
The committee will also operate malus and clawback if there is a major regulatory issue including significant regulatory risk failure. In 
any of the above clawback circumstances, the committee have discretion to operate malus provisions on share based incentive plans 
(other than any HM Revenue & Customs qualifying plans) operated by the Group instead of pursuing clawback on the cash bonuses.
The LTIP and DSBP awards are subject to malus provisions such that, at the discretion of the committee, unvested awards may lapse 
where there has been a material inaccuracy or misleading results, or there has been a loss to the Group’s business which could have 
been reasonably risk managed by the participant. In addition, malus may take place where there is conduct, capability or performance 
of a participant which would make the operation of malus appropriate, or where the committee deems there to be exceptional 
circumstances which appear relevant. The committee will operate malus if there is a major regulatory issue including significant 
regulatory risk failure.
Directors’ remuneration 
report Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 69
Directors’ and committee reports
The LTIP and DSBP include a clawback facility where, at the discretion of the committee, during a three year period post vesting, 
shares acquired through vesting or where held by the participant can be transferred to the Group or the employee benefit trust 
where there has been a material inaccuracy or misleading results, or there has been a loss to the Group’s business which could 
have been reasonably risk managed by the participant. In addition, clawback may take place where there is conduct, capability or 
performance of a participant which would make such transfer appropriate, or where the committee deems there to be exceptional 
circumstances which appear relevant to such a transfer. The committee will operate clawback if there is a major regulatory issue 
including significant regulatory risk failure. In any of the above circumstances, in place of pursuing clawback on the LTIP and DSBP, 
the committee have discretion to operate malus provisions on share based incentive plans (other than any HM Revenue & Customs 
qualifying plans) operated by the Group. 
Clawback will apply to HM Revenue & Customs qualifying plans to the extent permitted by HM Revenue & Customs.
Differences between remuneration policy for executive directors and employees generally
The remuneration policy applied to the most senior executives in the Group is similar to the policy for the executive directors in that 
a significant element of remuneration is dependent on Group and individual performance. The key principles for the remuneration 
policy are applied consistently across the Group below executive director level taking into account seniority and local market practice. 
Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy. 
The chart above illustrates the total remuneration, in line with the remuneration policy, that could arise for each executive director 
under three different performance levels. 
The figures are calculated as follows:
�  Fixed pay is basic salary and pension benefits as at 1 March 2015, plus the value of benefits based on 2014 figures.
�  Annual variable remuneration is the annual bonus including any deferred bonus going forward.
�  Long-term variable remuneration represents the potential value of the LTIP going forward.
�  On target performance is the level required to deliver 50% of the maximum annual bonus (62.5% of salary) and 50% of the 
maximum LTIP (75% of salary).
�  Maximum performance would result in the maximum annual bonus (125% of salary) and full vesting of the LTIP (150% of salary).

Directors’ and committee reports
Discretion
The areas of policy where the committee has discretion are set out in this report. In addition, the committee may exercise operational 
and administrative discretions under the relevant plan rules as set out in those rules. 
The committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion 
of the committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval. 
Emergency discretion
The committee retains discretion to grant variable performance remuneration outside of the approved policy where this discretion 
is required to comply with applicable legislation or regulation. In such circumstances, the remuneration committee has confirmed 
that it will not exercise discretion in a manner that would exceed the maximum opportunity noted in the policy table and the 
committee will endeavour to consult with shareholders ahead of such exercise as well as clearly disclosing and explaining the details 
in the annual report.
Executive director service contracts
Each executive director has been appointed under a service contract which is terminable on 12 months’ notice by either the 
Company or the director. Contracts are available for inspection at our registered office. Contracts may be terminated immediately 
with payments in lieu of notice being paid in phased instalments and reduced by amounts earned from alternative remunerative 
positions obtained during the notice period.
Termination policy
Notice period/pay in lieu �Rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods.
� Payment in lieu of notice at Group discretion – monthly instalments with appropriate reductions  
for mitigation. Payment calculated by reference to base salary and the cost to Group of  
providing contractual benefits (including pension contributions/ cash in lieu of pension contributions),  
but excludes bonus.
Long-term incentives � Lapse on cessation of employment, unless ‘good leaver’ circumstances (ill health, injury, disability,  
retirement, transfer of employing company or undertaking, redundancy or at the discretion  
of the remuneration committee).
� If good leaver, generally award to vest on normal vesting date following application of performance  
targets at a pro-rata reduction for proportion of vesting period elapsed unless exceptional  
circumstances considered.
Annual bonus �No bonus payable (unless special circumstance exists) if under notice at payment date.
Deferred share bonus awards � Lapse on cessation of employment, unless good leaver.
� If good leaver, generally vest on normal vesting date unless exceptional circumstances considered.
Where deemed suitable, the committee reserves the right to agree additional exit payments where they are in the best interests of 
the Group and shareholders and reflecting the directors’ contractual and legal rights. Any discretion exercised by the committee 
would be reported to shareholders in the subsequent annual report. The Group, in any settlement agreement recording the terms 
of the termination, may include provisions as to out placement counselling, the payment of the director’s reasonable legal costs up 
to an agreed amount and other reasonable payments of a similar nature.
Non-executive directors receive no payments for loss of office.

Directors’ and committee reports
Approach to recruitment remuneration
Where a new executive director is appointed, the principles outlined above in relation to the structure, components and maximum 
opportunities of the existing executive directors’ remuneration package and service contract terms will also apply to any newly 
appointed director. Salaries for new hires will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Group’s intended pay positioning and 
the market rate for the role. Existing incentive arrangements will be used where possible and guaranteed bonuses will not be offered. 
The level of pay will be what is necessary but not excessive to recruit the new executive director.
The remuneration committee will have the discretion to determine additional remuneration which constitutes compensation for 
the forfeiture of awards under variable remuneration arrangements with any previous employer on a like-for-like basis (comparable 
time horizon, value and subject to performance conditions) and/or any additional remuneration relating to relocation or similar 
expenses. Similarly, the remuneration committee will have discretion to retain existing contractual arrangements for employees 
who are internally promoted to board level. In addition, in exceptional circumstances, the remuneration committee reserves the 
right to grant additional remuneration which it feels is appropriate, taking into account the specific circumstances of the individual 
in order to facilitate such recruitment, provided that the total variable pay (excluding any buy-out awards) for the first year will not 
exceed 400% of salary (i.e. 75% above maximum in the policy table). 
Fees for newly appointed non-executive directors will be determined in line with the policy set out below.
Components and structure of remuneration – non-executive directors
The board reviews non-executive directors’ fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the 
importance attached to the retention and attraction of high calibre individuals as non-executive directors. This table sets out the 
elements which are included in the remuneration package for non-executive directors and explains how they operate:
Element and purpose Operation and link to business strategy Maximum opportunity
Fees
To attract and retain high  
calibre non-executive directors  
by offering competitive fees.
�Per annum basis.
� Additional fees may be paid to reflect extra responsibilities  
such as committee chairman or SID.
� With the agreement of the chairman of the Group,  
non-executive directors can carry out specific project  
work for the Group on fees to be agreed.
� Non-executive directors may be eligible for benefits such  
as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other  
benefits that may be appropriate.
Reviewed periodically to comparable  
companies’ pay.
Non-executive directors’ letters of appointment
The terms of appointment of independent non-executive directors (including the chairman) are contained in letters of appointment 
rather than under service contracts. The duration of the appointment is usually three years, and it is anticipated that the period  
will be extended for a second term of three years with the agreement of the board and the non-executive director, although a 
reappointment is not automatic. 
Either party may terminate on one month’s written notice.
The reappointment of all non-executive directors is subject to election by the Group’s shareholders at the first annual general meeting, 
and re-election at any subsequent annual general meeting where they are due for re-election.

Audit and risk  
committee report
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing 
and approving the annual report remains 
with the board. The committee is also 
responsible for advising the board on the 
Company’s overall risk appetite and 
strategy.
The committee reviews the Group’s risk 
assessment processes and methodology 
and its capability for identifying and 
managing new risk, alongside advising on 
proposed transactions and reviewing 
reports on material breaches of risk limits.
The audit and risk committee normally 
meets four times a year at the appropriate 
times in the financial reporting and audit 
cycle, and at such other times as required. 
Also, as appropriate during these meetings, 
the committee will meet separately with 
representatives of the external auditor 
and the head of the internal audit function 
without any other persons present. 
The terms of reference of the committee 
cover issues such as membership and  
the frequency of meetings, together with 
the requirements of any quorum for,  
and the right to attend, meetings.  
The categories of responsibility of the 
committee covered in the terms of 
reference are: external audit, internal audit, 
financial reporting, narrative reporting, 
internal controls and risk management. 
The terms of reference also set out the 
authority of the committee to carry out 
its responsibilities. 
The Code recommends that, for 
companies outside the FTSE 350, the 
audit and risk committee comprises at 
least two members who are independent 
non-executive directors and includes 
one member with recent and relevant 
financial experience. 
For meetings held in 2014, the 
committee comprised of three members 
– Iain Cornish (chair), Sir George 
Mathewson and Gillian Key-Vice, who  
are independent non-executive directors 
and therefore satisfies the Code’s 
requirements. Iain Cornish has recent and 
relevant financial experience, having  
held senior positions at Yorkshire Building 
Society until his retirement in 2011, as  
well as a number of other non-executive 
directorships as outlined on pages 42 
and 43. Gillian Key-Vice resigned from the 
board on 27 November 2014. Lan Tu  
will join the committee as an independent 
non-executive director with effect  
from her appointment as a director on  
9 March 2015.
The committee has responsibility for the 
monitoring of the financial integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group and the involvement  
of the Group’s external auditor in that process.  
It focuses in particular on compliance with 
accounting policies and ensuring the maintenance 
of an effective system of internal financial control. 
It also monitors and reviews the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal audit function.  Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 73

Significant areas
Significant areas considered by the 
committee and discussed with the external 
auditor during the year were:
Estimation of future cash 
collections from purchased  
loan portfolios:
�  The estimation of remaining collections 
from debt portfolios is complex and 
requires management to make significant 
judgment in relation to expected life, 
probability and value of related cash flows 
for each loan. The committee considered 
the value of the loan portfolio by reference 
to cash flow models. Management’s key 
assumptions were examined carefully by 
the committee, including the profile of 
expected future cash collection based on 
the Group’s historical collection experience 
and changes in collection strategies. 
Value of purchased loan  
portfolio assets and setting  
of the EIR:
�  On acquisition of purchased loan 
portfolios, a short period of time is 
required to determine the EIR due to the 
complexity of the loan portfolios acquired. 
The committee considered the EIR of  
all portfolios and the judgments made by 
management relating to the expected  
life and related cash flows. The committee, 
together with the external auditor, 
considered the robustness of the EIRs 
which were found to be acceptable  
and agreed to incorporate the external 
auditor’s observations on improving  
the processes around model governance, 
reconciliations and data inputs. The 
portfolios are reviewed by management 
for any possible indications of impairment 
or enhancement at the balance sheet 
date in accordance with IAS 39 – Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. The committee, together 
with the external auditor, considered  
the value of the loan portfolio by reference 
to cash flow models. 
Capquest acquisition:
�  During the year the Group acquired  
the entire share capital of Capquest. 
Management used the acquisition 
method in considering the appropriate 
acquisition accounting, following the steps 
required by IFRS 3 (revised) – business 
combinations, to recognise assets 
acquired, liabilities assumed and measure 
goodwill. The committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of management’s fair 
value considerations and recognition  
of assets and liabilities on acquisition and 
approved management’s methodology.
Accounting for material 
transactions:
�  The Group is increasingly making equity 
investments in addition to purchasing 
portfolios in different asset classes and 
geographies, which can lead to new  
and sometimes complex transactions and 
accounting. The buying process is a 
multi-stage approach. The underwriting 
process includes a four-stage approval, 
or gate, process before presentation of 
the investment memorandum to the 
investment committee. The committee 
then determines whether to recommend 
the purchase to the board (when material 
or complex) in advance of submission  
of a final bid. Where accounting during 
the year was complicated, the finance 
team was brought into the process early 
and accounting papers were produced 
and disclosed for discussions with the 
external auditor and approval by the audit 
and risk committee. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 74

committee report
External auditor
The committee carried out the following 
in relation to the external auditor:
�  Recommended to the board the 
appointment of KPMG LLP as external 
auditor following a comprehensive and 
thorough competitive tender process
�  Considered and approved the proposed 
materiality and audit plan prepared.
�  Monitored the independence of the 
external auditor and the effectiveness  
of the external audit process.
�  Developed and implemented the Group’s 
policy on the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor.
Deloitte LLP resigned as auditor and KPMG 
LLP was appointed by the board in July 
2014. The reasons for the external audit 
contract tender are set out in the 2013 
Annual Report on page 61. Both the 
committee and the external auditor have 
in place safeguards to avoid any 
compromise of the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. The 
committee considers the independence 
of the external auditor annually and  
the Group has a formal policy for the 
engagement of its external auditor to 
supply non-audit services. The policy is 
designed to ensure that neither the nature 
of the service to be provided nor the 
level of reliance placed on the services 
could impact the objectivity of the 
external auditor’s opinion on the Group’s 
financial statements.
The policy precludes the appointment  
of the external auditor to provide any 
service where there is involvement in 
management functions or decision making, 
or any service on which management 
may place primary reliance in determining 
the adequacy of internal controls, financial 
systems or financial reporting. Proposed 
non-audit fees are notified to the chairman 
of the audit and risk committee for his 
approval in advance of being incurred.
Having considered KPMG LLP’s 
independence, compliance with regulatory 
and ethical standards, and assessed its 
objectivity, the committee unanimously 
recommended to the board that a 
resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG 
LLP as the Group’s external auditor be 
proposed to shareholders at the 2015 
annual general meeting.
Internal audit
Following a comprehensive and 
thorough competitive tender, BDO were 
appointed by the board in April 2014  
to provide an internal audit function to 
the Group.
During the year the committee has 
considered and approved the Group’s 
internal audit plan, which is based on an 
assessment of the key risks faced by the 
Group. It has monitored progress of the 
internal audit function against that plan, 
ensuring that the internal audit function 
has sufficient resource to carry out its 
duties effectively. Reports on internal audit 
work have been received by the committee 
and, where necessary appropriate 
actions have been recommended to the 
board. The results of this work, together 
with the committee’s engagement with 
the management information of the 
Group and the executive directors, has 
enabled them to conclude that the 
statements given on page 51 of the 
corporate governance report relating to 
the Group’s systems of internal control 
and its management of risk are appropriate.

Independent  
auditor’s report
Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Arrow Global Group PLC only.
Opinions and conclusions arising  
from our audit.
1 Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements 
of Arrow Global Group PLC for the  
year ended 31 December 2014 set out  
on pages 73 to 116. In our opinion:
�  the financial statements give a true  
and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the parent company’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
�  the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
�  the parent company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by  
the EU and as applied in accordance  
with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006; and
�  the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act  
2006 and, as regards the group  
financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above  
on the financial statements the risks of 
material misstatement that had the 
greatest effect on our audit were as follows:
Estimation of future cash 
collections from debt portfolios 
Refer to page 73 (Audit and Risk 
Committee Report), page 86 (accounting 
policy) and page 90 (financial disclosures).
The risk: In line with accounting standards, 
income from purchased loan portfolios  
is recognised using the Effective Interest 
Rate (EIR) method. The carrying value of 
assets is reassessed based on the 
Estimated Remaining Collections (‘ERCs’) 
discounted at the EIR rate which can 
result in a ‘write up’ (increase in portfolio 
carrying value) or a ‘write down’ 
(decrease in the carrying value). ERCs are 
used to calculate both the initial effective 
interest rate (‘EIR’), on which revenue is 
recognised, and the initial and ongoing 
asset carrying values for acquired credit 
impaired debt portfolios. The Group uses 
cash flow forecasting models to calculate 
the ERCs which are an estimate of future 
cash flows recoverable from debt 
portfolios. It is the key judgment area for 
our audit due to the level of subjectivity 
inherent in certain assumptions used in 
its estimation, such as the probability, 
value and timing of expected future cash 
flows. There is a risk that these judgments 
may not appropriately reflect all the facts 
which would skew the recognition of 
debt portfolio income and the carrying 
amount of the assets.  76
Independent  
auditor’s report
Our response: Our audit  
procedures included:
�  We involved our modelling specialists to 
satisfy ourselves as to the integrity of the 
models used by the Group which utilise 
the estimated cash flow forecasts and EIRs 
to determine the revenue and asset 
carrying amounts. 
�  We evaluated the application of EIR 
methodology in the models used by the 
Group. This included re-performing a 
sample of calculations for EIR and asset 
carrying values and testing the  
consistent application of formula.
�  We tested the controls designed and 
applied by the Group to provide assurance 
on accuracy and completeness of  
data inputs to these models, and agreed  
a sample of inputs and ERCs, to 
administration systems.
Accounting for the acquisition  
of Capquest Group
Refer to page 73 (Audit and Risk 
Committee Report).
The risk: During the year ended  
31 December 2014, the Group acquired 
Quest Topco Limited and its subsidiaries 
(the Capquest Group). The key judgment 
required in respect of the acquisition is 
the appropriateness of the fair value of the 
acquisition balance sheet, specifically  
the fair value of acquired debt portfolios 
and recognition and valuation of any 
identifiable intangibles.
Our response: Our audit  
procedures included:
�  We inspected the underlying sale and 
purchase agreement and other information 
produced by the Group and its advisers  
to verify the purchase price and the existing 
identifiable assets acquired.
�  We evaluated the fair values allocated  
to the acquired assets and liabilities, which 
included testing the cash flow models 
used to fair value the acquired loan 
portfolios and reconciling underlying 
model data back to administration 
systems. We assessed whether the discount 
rate used in the calculation of fair values 
aligned to market expectations based on 
our knowledge of the industry. We also 
challenged the assumptions, such as the 
benefits expected by the group, used  
to support the fair value of the acquired 
IT platform. 
�  We analysed the Group’s rationale for  
not recognising certain other acquisition 
intangibles by assessing whether items 
were both separable and identifiable under 
the relevant accounting standards and  
by inspecting the terms of the underlying 
legal and contractual documentation 
where appropriate. 
3 Our application of materiality 
and an overview of the scope  
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at 
£1.7million, determined with reference  
to a benchmark of Group adjusted profit 
before tax, of which it represents 5%.  
The statutory profit before tax balance 
has been adjusted to add back one off, 
non-recurring items. We report to the 
Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements 
exceeding £85,000, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s three reporting 
components, we subjected all three  
to audits for Group reporting purposes. 
These audits covered 100% of Group 
revenue, 100% of Group profit before tax 
and 100% of Group total assets.
Our response: Our audit 
procedures included:
�  We tested the controls designed and 
applied by the Group to provide assurance 
that the assumptions described above 
had been regularly reviewed and updated. 
Also, we tested that changes in debt 
portfolio performance was monitored and 
scrutinised by appropriate personnel  
and that the updated ERCs used had been 
appropriately approved.
�  We critically assessed the estimates  
of future cash flows and any manual 
adjustments made to the estimates 
against our understanding of the Group, 
the historical accuracy of its estimates 
and the current and past performance of 
the Group’s portfolios including recent 
cash collections. We challenged the 
appropriateness of timing and forecast 
period of cash flows, by comparing these 
to historical trends within the Group, our 
own expectations based on our knowledge 
of the Group and experience of the 
industry in which the Group operates.
Mathematical integrity and  
inputs of the EIR and NPV models
Refer to page 73 (Audit and Risk 
Committee Report), page 90  
(accounting policy).
The risk: The Group uses models to 
calculate the EIR and carrying value of 
debt portfolios. Manual inputs to the 
models lead to added risk in the calculation 
of both income and asset carrying value. 
An incorrect import of data or an error in 
the application of the EIR and estimated 
cash flows can result in the income and the 
related balance sheet carrying amounts 
being over or understated. 77
The Group audit team performed the 
audits of the key reporting components  
in accordance with the materiality levels 
used for local audits, which ranged from 
£0.2 million to £1.7 million. The work  
on all components was performed by the 
Group audit team.
4 Our opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
�  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;
�  the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements. 
5 We have nothing to report  
in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report 
by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, based on the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the 
annual report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report  
to you if:
�  we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the 
annual report and financial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the group’s performance, 
business model and strategy; or
�  the Audit Committee Report does not 
appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit 
committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
�  adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not  
visited by us; or
�  the parent company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
�  certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
�  we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review:
�  the directors’ statement, set out on page 
85, in relation to going concern; and
�  the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement on page 49 relating to  
the company’s compliance with the  
ten provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012 specified for  
our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of 
the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 54, the directors are responsible  
for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. A

1  General information
Arrow Global Group PLC is a company incorporated in England and Wales and is the ultimate parent company of the Group. The address of the 
registered office is presented on page 117. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling as the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates.
The Company’s subsidiaries and associates, both direct and indirect, at this date are listed in note 23.
Through its subsidiary companies, the Group acquires certain pools of semi-performing and/ or charged-off consumer loans pursuant to the terms of 
each specific purchase agreement. In addition, the Group enters into contractual servicing agreements with other third parties to collect the 
receivables, to administer and disburse the proceeds of the receivables.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the EU, 
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IFRS Regulation. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the current and prior periods.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement and related notes of the Company have not been presented 
in this annual report and accounts. 
2  Adoption of new and revised standards

� IAS 36 (amended) Requirement for Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
No new or revised standards and interpretations that have been endorsed but are not yet effective in these financial statements are deemed to have a 
material impact on future financial statements.
The following standard is not yet endorsed however may have a material impact and affect disclosure requirements in future periods:
� IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 will impact the measurement and disclosures for Financial Instruments. The adoption of effective interest rate is thought to be in line with 
current IFRS 9 guidance, however, additional disclosure requirements, over and above those from IFRS 7 will be required. In particular more specific 
disclosures around compliance with applicable regulation and the management of risk. Management are still assessing the impact of IFRS 9 on 
future periods.

Financial statements
3  Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
adopted by the European Union and therefore, the Group financial statements comply with EU IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than the fair value of derivative contracts 
and the amortised cost value of portfolio assets.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
made up to 31 December 2014 and comparative period. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with its investee entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee entity. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Also see the accounting policy ‘shares held in an employee benefit trust’ (EBT).
Going concern
The directors are required to make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue to trade as a going concern for the foreseeable future. The 
directors have given this matter due consideration through a review of forecast cash flow models and scenarios and current cash availability and 
have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group financial statements on a going concern basis. 
The main considerations were as follows:
The Group is highly cash generative receiving weekly cash flows and has a low fixed cost base. As at 31 December 2014, the Group had an available 
£100 million overdraft facility, drawn by £39 million. The Group also had £15 million cash balance as at 31 December 2014. The directors have reviewed 
the available headroom of the Group, and confirmed that the Group has sufficient resources to meet future obligations as they fall due. 
The principal covenants of the revolving credit facility that the Group currently has in place are loan to value (LTV) ratio of no more than 75% and a 
super senior loan to value (SSLTV) ratio of no more than 25%, both tested quarterly. 
The SSLTV ratio as at 31 December 2014 was 2.7% and the LTV ratio 49.0%. Both covenants were comfortably met throughout the year to 31 December 
2014. The directors have reviewed the Group’s financial projections covering a minimum period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of 
these financial statements and the projections show covenant compliance.
The Company had a profit for the year to 31 December 2014 of £4,360,000. With net current assets of £51,218,000, the directors deem this sufficient 
to cover a minimum period of at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements.
The Group is able to generate strong cash flows even in difficult general market conditions. The Group’s cash flow projections confirm that the 
Group will remain well within its facilities for a minimum period of at least 12 months from the data of signing these financial statements.
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) 
(Business Combinations) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or 
assets related to employee benefit arrangements that are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee 
Benefits) respectively.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances 
that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year from the date of acquisition.
Notes to the financial statements Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 86
Financial statements
3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit  
or loss.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is 
an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
The Group calculates the recoverable amount of each CGU by determining the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Certain 
assumptions are made in relation to the value in use calculation including forecast cash flows, growth rates, and an appropriate discount rate.  
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis in relation to the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On a business combination the portfolio investments are remeasured to fair value using an appropriate discount rate at the date of acquisition, 
calculated based on actual performance and forecasts at that date.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the goodwill attributable to that subsidiary is included when calculating the profit or loss on disposal.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant 
influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 to 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity or evidence through a number 
of aspects such as representation on the board of directors, participation in policy making and decisions, material transactions between the entity 
and investee, interchange of managerial personnel or provision of essential technical information. Associates are accounted for using the equity 
method and are initially recognised at cost. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income 
and equity movements of the associate from the date that significant influence commences until the date that it ceases. 
Revenue recognition and effective interest rate method (EIR)
Income from purchased loan portfolios
Income from purchased loan portfolios represents the yield from acquired portfolio investments. Purchased loan portfolios are financial instruments 
that are accounted for under IAS 39 and are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. 
The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a purchased loan portfolio and of allocating interest income over the expressed 
life of the portfolio. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 84-months of estimated future cash receipts of the purchased portfolio asset to  
the net carrying amount at initial recognition (i.e. the price paid to acquire the asset). On acquisition, there is a short period that is required to 
determine the EIR, due to the complexity of the portfolios acquired. 
Unallocated cash is held as a liability in the balance sheet until it is reconciled. Unallocated cash is held for a period of six years, only being released 
to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income at this point.
Where the Group acquires purchased loan portfolios via forward flow agreements, there is no difference in accounting treatment than described above.
Portfolio write up
Upward revaluations (‘write ups’) are increases to carrying values, discounted at the EIR rate, of the acquired debt portfolios as a result of reassessments 
to their estimated cash flows and are recognised in the portfolio write-up line within revenue, with any subsequent reversals to write ups also 
recorded in this line. 
Impairment of purchased loan portfolios
The portfolios are reviewed for indications of impairment at the balance sheet date, such as variances to historical cash curves, in accordance with 
IAS 39. This is considered on a portfolio basis. Where portfolios exhibit objective evidence of impairment, an adjustment, being the difference 
between the current carrying value and the net present value of future estimated cash flows, is recorded to the carrying value of the portfolio. 
If the forecast portfolio collections are lower than previous forecasts the revenue from any previous write-ups are reversed and this reversal is 
recognised in revenue recorded in the same line, up to the point that any reversals equal the previously recognised cumulative write-ups. If these 
reversals exceed any previously recognised cumulative write-ups then an impairment is recognised as a separate statement of comprehensive 
income line (‘write downs’).
Revenue on assets under management
In accordance with IAS 18, the Company recognises revenue on its managed services contracts when the right to receive such revenue is reasonably 
assured and can be measured reliably.

3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size and nature (i.e. outside of the normal underlying operating 
activities of the Group) to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. These are disclosed separately on the face of 
the statement of comprehensive income. Current year non-recurring items are explained in notes 8 and 10.
Interest income from secured loan notes
The Group has entered into lending arrangements with third parties to provide capital to purchase non-performing consumer debt portfolios 
(see note 16). Interest income is recognised throughout the year using the EIR, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life. 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
The Group has, for the period covered by these financial statements, only made contributions to defined contribution plans to provide pension 
benefits for employees upon retirement and, otherwise, has no residual obligation or commitments in respect of any defined benefit scheme.
Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are 
expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign 
currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise except for exchange differences on transactions entered into 
to hedge certain foreign currency risks. 
For the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year, unless 
exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are recognised in the other-comprehensive income.
Leases 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more 
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. 
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
Current tax
Current taxation, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit for the year and is provided at amounts expected to 
be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date. Taxable profit differs 
from the net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Current taxation is charged or credited in the statement  
of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the corporation taxation is also dealt  
with in equity.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, using the 
liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each reporting date. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the temporary 
timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date. The 
carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred taxation is charged or credited in the statement of 
comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in equity.

Financial statements
3  Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Share based payments transactions in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted 
for as equity-settled share based payments. 
The grant date fair value of the share based payment granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase 
in equity, over the period that the employee become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured 
using an option valuation model were required, taking into accounts the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are 
expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service 
and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share based payments with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of 
the share based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. 
Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiaries, the costs are recharged to the subsidiary in line with 
the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share based payments’. 
Shares held in an employee benefit trust (EBT)
Transactions of the Company sponsored EBT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore, reflected in these financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles 
Property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, as discussed below, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line 
method on the following basis:
Furniture � five years
Computer equipment � three years
Leasehold improvements � five years
Software licences � shorter of contractual life and useful economic life
IT platform � ten years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate 
accounted for on a prospective basis.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Acquired licences, such as software licences, are capitalised at cost and amortised over the shorter of contractual life and useful economic life.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes
The Group’s purchased loan portfolios and secured loan notes are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. Under IAS 39, such assets are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and are measured at amortised cost using the EIR 
method less any impairment. 
Purchased loan portfolios are acquired at a deep discount and as a result the estimated future cash flows reflect the likely credit losses within each 
portfolio. The portfolio investments are initially recorded at their fair value, being their acquisition price, and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method.
The portfolio asset is analysed between current and non-current in the balance sheet. The current asset is determined using the expected cash 
flows arising in the next 12 months after the balance sheet date. The residual amount is classified as non-current.
Litigation costs
As part of the Group’s litigation strategy to recover customer balances, the Group incurs recoverable upfront legal costs, which are capitalised 
and amortised in line with their expected recovery profile.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as 
a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have 
been affected.
 Notes to the financial statements Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 89
Financial statements
3  Significant accounting policies (continued)
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to 
receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or 
in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the 
financial asset.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion 
of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) 
any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in the OCI is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Any interest in transferred 
financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities, such as loan notes, or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement and in conjunction with the application of IFRS.
Financial liabilities are held at amortised cost using the EIR method. The EIR is calculated by estimating the cash flows arising from the contractual 
terms of the instrument over its expected life. Transaction costs are included within the EIR and deducted from the initial carrying value of the 
debt instrument.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts, to manage the interest rate and 
currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
All derivative financial instruments are assessed against the hedge accounting criteria set out in IAS 39. The majority of the Group’s derivatives are 
cash flow hedges of highly probably forecast transactions and meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. Derivatives are initially recognised 
at the fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at each reporting date at their fair value. Where 
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in their fair value are recognised immediately within the statement of comprehensive 
income. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and where the hedge accounting criteria are met, the effective portion of changes 
in the fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income as part of finance costs. Amounts accumulated in equity are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income when the income or expense on the hedged item is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when:
� it is evident from testing that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge;
� the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised; or,
� the underlying hedged item matures or is sold or repaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Capitalisation of legal transaction fees
Legal transaction fees associated with the purchase of portfolios are allocated to the purchase price of the portfolio and included within the EIR 
applied against the asset value. 
Operating expenses
Operating expenses relate to administration and costs associated with collection activities. All operating costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Fair value measurements
The fair value of financial instruments is determined in accordance with IFRS 13 in the manner described in note 25.
Other reserves
Other reserves include the own share reserve, the translation reserve and the merger reserve. These reserves are further explained on the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity on page 82.

4  Critical accounting judgments and estimates
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are required to make judgments, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in 
which the estimate is revised.
Critical judgments in applying accounting policies 
The following are the critical judgments that have been made in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies and that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
a) Fair value of acquisition balance sheet and carrying value of goodwill
The Group capitalises goodwill on the acquisition of entities as discussed in the significant accounting policies. Goodwill is the excess of the 
consideration paid over the fair value of its net assets. The determination of the fair value of acquired net assets requires the exercise of management 
judgment, particularly for those financial assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices, or assets such as acquired investment portfolios 
where valuations reflect estimates and timing of future cash flows. Different valuations would result in changes to the goodwill arising and to 
the post acquisition performance of the acquisition.
The fair value of assets acquired directly impacts the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for 
impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Determining whether 
goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Calculation of the value in use 
requires an estimate and timing of future cash flows expected to arise from the reduced CGU after a suitable discount rate has been applied to 
calculate present value. This inherently involves a number of judgments in that cash flow forecasts are prepared for periods that are beyond the 
normal requirement of management reporting, and the appropriate discount rate relevant to the business is an estimate.
Key sources of assumption and estimation uncertainty in applying accounting policies 
The following are the key sources of assumption and estimation uncertainty that have been made in the process of applying the entity’s accounting 
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
b) Carrying value and EIR of purchased loan portfolios
A 12-month cash flow forecast is prepared for each account, based on predictions of probability to pay and value of total payments within the 
12-month period. These predictions are generated using a bespoke statistical model (the PV model), which utilises customer and account level 
data, credit agency data and our historic experience with accounts which have similar key attributes. Management also review the model on a 
portfolio basis to take into account unforeseen external factors, which have impacted historical performance. Where necessary portfolios are 
calibrated to take into account these known factors. A separate model, using the ‘stock and flow’ method then takes the 12-month estimate and 
uses this to form an 84-month forecast of ERCs at a portfolio level. Key factors in this model are the assumptions made on the conversion of accounts 
from non-paying to paying, and vice-versa either through breakdown of the account or settlement/pay down of the balances due. Campaign 
overlays are also built into the model which allows the effect of performance improvements resulting from new initiatives to be factored into future 
cash flows. The ERCs created from the stock and flow model are regularly benchmarked at a portfolio level against actuals, which forms the 
impairment review.

5  Segmental reporting
The Group represents a single reportable segment. Its operations are all managed from the UK.
Collections information is available for the UK and Portugal operations. This is the only information analysed between the UK and Portugal received 
on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker (CODM), and does not constitute sufficient information upon which to base resource 
allocation decisions, consequently one segment was identified. In line with the business strategy we expect this to be developing in the next  
12 months. The CODM is considered to be the board of directors collectively.

10  Staff costs and other operating expenses (continued)
Non-recurring items include items that, by virtue of their size and nature (i.e. outside of the normal operating activities of the Group), are not 
considered to be representative of the on-going performance of the Group. Due to transformation changes to the Group brought about by the IPO 
and strategic acquisitions, such as the sterling senior secured notes leading onto the IPO in 2013 and the euro senior secured notes to acquire the 
Capquest Group in 2014, significant costs have been incurred in the current and comparative period, which the Group believe are not reflective of 
expected principal Group activity. The Capquest acquisition took place on 28 November 2014 and therefore there is still an element of acquisition costs 
to be incurred in 2015. 
In the year to 31 December 2014, costs incurred due to the acquisition of Capquest group amounted to £6,026,000, being fees incurred of £5,452,000 
and specific staff costs including £374,000 redundancy costs, as a direct result of the acquisition due to duplication of senior roles and £200,000 
related bonuses. £1,760,000 related to remaining IPO related share issuance charges. In other operating expenses were £4,205,000 of non-recurring 
costs, made up of £2,210,000 in relation to a historic VAT settlement and £1,995,000 of non-recurring contract settlements, £1,645,000 of which 
was directly due to the Capquest acquisition, terminating a duplicate servicing contract.
In the year to 31 December 2013, goodwill arose upon the acquisition of Arrow Global Accounts Management Limited. As the goodwill was not 
supportable, this was fully impaired. The remaining non-recurring items in the year were non-recurring restructuring costs associated with the senior 
secured notes issuance of £1,005,000 and IPO related staff and other costs of £5,286,000, the main item being £4,361,000 of share option charges.

Deferred tax
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £25,728,000 (2013: £249,000) of tax losses carried forward. The increase in 
unrecognised tax losses is due to the Capquest acquisition. These losses may be available for offset against future non-trading profits and have 
no expiry date.
The Finance Act 2013, which was substantively enacted in July 2013, included provisions to reduce the rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 21% 
with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have been calculated using a rate of 20% in these accounts.
Non-recurring tax
We have identified non-recurring items in the year amounting to £12,839,000 (2013: £12,516,000), with a £1,503,000 (2013: £2,468,000) associated 
tax impact. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 96

 Notes to the financial statements
13  Dividend
A final dividend has been proposed of 3.4 pence (£5,921,000) taking the total dividends for the year to 5.1 pence (£8,882,000), being 30% of profit 
after tax attributable to shareholder. The proposed final dividend is subject to approval at the annual general meeting and has not yet been included as 
a liability in these financial statements. The board continues to pursue a progressive dividend policy targeting a payout ratio of between 25 and 35 per 
cent of annual underlying net income as set out in the IPO prospectus. However, rather than the annual dividend being split between the interim 
and final dividend in the proportion 1/3 to 2/3 as previously anticipated, in the future, the interim dividend (from H1 2015 onwards) is expected to be 
declared at 50% of the prior year’s final dividend with the subsequent final dividend being proposed based on the underlying net income for the 
year and in accordance with the payout ratio above.

An impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2014 that resulted in the no impairment to goodwill. The goodwill was assessed to be 
appropriately stated. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to two aggregated CGUs on the basis that these represent the lowest level at which goodwill 
is monitored for internal management purposes, and are not larger than the single operating segment defined under IFRS 8 (Operating Segments). 
In relation to goodwill, the two CGU’s identified are the Capquest group, comprising of all group companies within the acquired group, which 
represent the cash flows generated principally from collections on acquired purchased loan portfolios and management of third party debt, and 
Arrow Global Receivables Management Limited, which represents the cash flows generated principally from collections on purchased loan portfolios.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding the discount rate and forecast cash collections net of direct collection costs, allowable forecast synergies and 
growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the CGUs. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGU’s are based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) 
of 7 .45%.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and 
extrapolates cash flows into perpetuity based on models and growth rates. The forecasts assume growth rates in collection activity which in turn 
drive the forecast collections and cost figures. As at 31 December 2014 the five-year forecast assumed growth of 5% per annum, which is in keeping 
with the directors’ prudent expectations of future growth of the CGUs. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the CGU’s carrying value. Based on the value in use a fall in the forecast 
cash flows of circa 20% would result in an impairment at 31 December 2014. For the Arrow Group CGU and 40% for the Arrow Global Receivable 
Management Limited CGU. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 97

18  Trade and other payables (continued)
In 2014, a European Court of Justice ruling indicated that, under the European Working Time Directive, ‘normal pay’ for the purposes of calculating 
statutory holiday pay includes contractual overtime and commission, rather than being limited to basic salary. On 4 November 2014, a UK Employment 
Tribunal, considering the implications for UK employers, under the Working Time Regulations 1998, ruled that overtime pay should be included in 
calculating holiday pay. A UK Employment Appeal Tribunal is also considering whether commission payments should be included in the calculation 
and is expected to conclude in 2015. As a result of these tribunals, there is a possibility that workers and employees may seek compensation for a 
shortfall in their holiday pay in prior years. This gives rise to a possible obligation for the Group. The directors do not consider any compensation 
required to be a material amount, particularly as any claims are likely to be capped at two years.

Summary of transactions
During the year until the end of her term as non-executive director, Gillian Key-Vice, through her company GKV Limited, charged the Group £3,401 
in relation to consultancy services provided on Group projects.
In January 2013, £1,388,027 in relation to a loan note instrument was repaid in full to Lewylang LP, a party related to Zachary Lewy. Also, remaining 
balances on loans were repaid on 29 January 2013 as part of the refinancing and issuance of senior secured notes described in note 28. 
On 6 September 2013, Shawbrook Bank Limited (which is an investment of RBS Special Opportunities Fund) committed £10 million as lender under 
the revolving credit facility. Shawbrook Bank Limited was paid customary fees by the Group in connection with this commitment (on the same 
basis as the other lenders under the revolving credit facility). RBS Special Opportunity Fund sold its remaining shares in Arrow Global Group PLC 
in March 2014, Shawbrook Bank Limited is therefore no longer considered to be a related party of the Group.

24  Risks arising from financial instruments
Risk Management
Treasury related risks
The board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations. The board delegates certain responsibilities 
to the treasury committee. The treasury committee, which is chaired by the chief financial officer, is empowered to take decisions within that 
delegated authority. Treasury activities and compliance with treasury policies are reported to the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic 
independent reviews and audits, both internal and external. Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group 
in relation to funding and liquidity risks, counterparty credit risk and market risks being interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This is to ensure 
the Group is properly funded, that financial counterparties are of appropriate credit quality and that interest rate and currency risk is managed 
within set limits. Policies also set out the specific instruments that can be used for risk management.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swap, currency swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose 
of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s underlying business operations. No transactions of 
a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options. No written options were 
entered into during 2014 (2013: £nil).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash 
or another financial asset.
The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth. The 
treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk by setting a specific policy parameter that there are sufficient committed debt 
facilities to cover forecast borrowings plus operational headroom plus appropriate stress testing for the next 18 months on a rolling basis. Further, 
the aim is to ensure that there is a balanced refinancing profile with phased maturity dates, diversification of debt funding sources and no over-
reliance on a single or small group of lenders. At 31 December 2014, the Group’s senior secured notes and revolving credit facility had an average 
period to maturity of 5.3 years (2013: 4.6 years). Total undrawn facilities as at 31 December 2014 were £61,001,000 (2013: £55,000,000).
The treasury function monitors cash through daily reporting, the management accounts and periodic review meetings. Management has well 
established models used to predict collectability of cash receipts and this represents a key performance indicator of the business. The Group  
has a low fixed cost base, is highly cash generative with weekly cash receipts and portfolio purchases are discretionary, which helps to mitigate 
liquidity risk. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 103

When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined with reference to the projected interest rates as 
illustrated by the interest rate yield curves existing at the balance sheet date. 
A maturity analysis of the Group’s current 84-month ERC and comparison to borrowing facilities as at 31 December 2014 is presented below on  
a cumulative basis:
This demonstrates the headroom on the Group’s committed funding facility repayments in comparison to the current purchased loan portfolio’s 
estimated collections over a 84-month period.
Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market risk principally comprises interest rate risk and currency risk considered further below.
Interest rate risk
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of the countries in which it operates and therefore seeks 
to limit this exposure. This is achieved by the use of techniques to fix interest rate costs, including fixed rate funding (predominantly longer-term 
bond funding), forward currency contracts used for non-functional currency funding, bank borrowing loan draw down periods and interest rate 
hedging instruments. These techniques are used to hedge the interest rate costs on a proportion of borrowings over a certain period of time. 
Most hedging is for up to three years.
If interest rates across all countries of operation increased by 50 basis points this would have the following impact:

24  Risks arising from financial instruments (continued)
This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
�  the change in market interest rates occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and/or derivative financial instruments
�  where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there is no 
impact from a change in interest rates; and
�  changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Currency risk
The Group is subject to three types of currency risk; cash flow exposure, net asset exposure and income statement exposure.
Cash flow exposure
The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency. The policy of the Group is to hedge 
a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months. Where cash flow hedges 
have been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.
Net asset exposure
A proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in Euro. The balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means that there is a risk that  
a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the net assets of the Group. The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets 
denominated in euro by funding portfolio assets with euro denominated borrowings where possible.
Income statement exposure
As with net assets, a proportion of the Group’s profit is denominated in in euro but translated into sterling for reporting purposes. The result for the 
period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate. A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rate relative to the euro will 
have an impact on the consolidated result for the period.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
If foreign exchange rates had been 10% weaker than sterling than those at the balance sheet date and all other variables were held constant, the 
Group’s net assets and net profit for each denomination of currency would increase/(decrease) as follows:

10% is considered to be a reasonable expectation of possible fluctuations in rates. The above also assumes that there is no impact on retained 
earnings or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged (where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability). 
Counterparty risks
The Group is subject to counterparty risk in respect of the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks and foreign currency and derivative 
financial instruments.
The Group only deposits cash and only undertakes currency and derivative transactions, generally with highly rated banks and sets strict limits in 
respect of amounts of exposure to any one institution. Institutions with lower credit ratings can only be used with board approval. 
No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets. The maximum exposure to counterparty risk is as follows:
           Year ended  Year ended
           31 December  31 December

           14,542  48,027
The table represents a worst case scenario of the counterparty risk that the Group is exposed to.
The key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are managed within an established risk management framework. The Group’s day-to-day 
working capital is funded by its cash and cash equivalents. The key risks identified for the Group are discussed below.
The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk that arises throughout the normal course of the Group’s business. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 107

24  Risks arising from financial instruments (continued)
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual payment 
obligations.
The risk from the concentration of customer credit risk is limited due to the high number of individual customers and the relatively low value of 
each of the individual’s debts. At 31 December 2014 the Group had 8.3 million customer accounts, with an average balance of £1,389.
Credit risk is considered upon the acquisition of a financial asset by assessing the expected return. The Group manages this risk by monitoring the 
performance of the financial asset throughout its economic life. Cash collections are continually monitored and the carrying value of the asset 
is impaired where it is deemed that, based on collections profiles, the asset is underperforming compared to the initial expected return 
determined at the acquisition date. The financial assets subjected to credit risk are portfolio assets, loan notes and derivative assets.
The maximum credit risk exposure in relation to the financial assets is disclosed below:
           Year ended  Year ended
           31 December  31 December

Other receivables           16,569  11,194
           510,002  334,821
The Group’s principal activity is the acquisition and management of underperforming consumer debt portfolios. Most portfolios by their nature 
are impaired on acquisition and the Group continually monitors cash collections and the carrying values are impaired where the underlying 
performance does not meet initial expectations. The on-going risk is managed through a portfolio valuation process including modelling current 
expectations of recoverability based on historical information on debt types. A pricing gateway process is in place which is includes at least two 
members of the executive board as well as other key members from all areas of the business. 
This process is in place to scrutinise all aspects of a portfolio acquisition from reputational and regulatory risk through to the financial assumptions 
and maximum bid price.
All purchased loan portfolios are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Impairment is assessed on a regular basis by management and is 
identified on a portfolio basis following evidence that the financial asset is impaired. 
All loan notes are measured at amortised cost. Impairment is assessed on a regular basis by management and is identified on a portfolio basis 
following evidence that the financial asset is impaired.
Capital risk management
The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. The Group is currently not 
required to hold regulatory capital.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return on 
equity to its shareholders. The Group’s long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance. 
The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2009.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity. 
Management reviews the capital structure on an on-going basis. As part of this review, management considers the cost of capital and the risks 
associated with each class of capital. The Group’s position as at the 31 December 2014 was:

Fair value estimation
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price 
quotations. For all other financial instruments, the Group determines fair values using other valuation techniques. 
For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees of 
judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument.
Valuation models
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. 
� Level 1: inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments.
�  Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices within Level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly 
observable from market data.
�  Level 3: inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on 
observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are 
valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect 
differences between the instruments. 
The objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid 
to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, using prices from observable current market transactions and 
dealer quotes for similar instruments and unobservable inputs such as historic performance data and the Proprietary Collections Bureau output. 
The purchased loan portfolios fair value is calculated using our 84-month ERC through our own in-house models. Derivative financial instruments 
are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices. 
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based 
on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Borrowings are considered to be reported at fair value as these were arm’s length transactions at prevailing market rates. The Group has not 
identified a significant change in the availability of such market rates. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value. 
Financial instruments measured at fair value – fair value hierarchy
The following table analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the 
fair value measurement is categorised. The amounts are based on the values recognised in the balance sheet. All of the Group’s financial instruments 
fall into hierarchy level 2.

The following table analyses financial instruments not measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which 
the measurement is categorised. The amounts are based on the values recognised in the balance sheet. All of the Group’s financial instruments

There have been no transfers in or out of Level 3. 
The balance sheet value of the Group’s purchased loan portfolios is derived from discounted cash flows generated by an 84-month ERC model. 
The inputs into the ERC model are historic portfolio collection performance data. This ERC is updated with the core collections experience to date 
on a monthly basis. 
Estimates of cash flows that determine the EIR are based on the Group’s collection history with respect to portfolios comprising similar attributes 
and characteristics such as date of purchase, original credit grantor, type of receivable, customer payment histories, customer location, and the 
time since the original charge off.
Management consider that the valuing of the purchased loan portfolios at amortised cost is comparable to the fair value.
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of purchased loan portfolio values. This includes regular 
monitoring of portfolio performance overseen by the portfolio review committee, which considers actual versus forecast results at an individual 
portfolio level, re-forecasts cash flows on a quarterly basis, reviews actual against forecast gross cash on cash money multiples, signs off the latest 
ERC forecast and assesses the carrying value of the portfolio assets and reviews revenue recognition.
A reconciliation of the opening to closing balances for the period of the purchased loan portfolios can be seen in note 16. 
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses foreign currency contracts (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge foreign currency cash flows that are highly probable to occur within  
12 months of the balance sheet date and interest rate swaps (‘cash flow hedges’) to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected to occur 
during the period to November 2017. The effect on the statement of comprehensive income will also be within these periods. An amount of 
£859,000 has been charges to equity for the Group in the period in respect of cash flow hedges (2013: £nil). No charge has been made to the 
Company’s equity.
Interest rate swaps
The Group has interest rate swaps in place for a notional amount of £176,070,000 (2013: £66,667,000). In 2014, these interest rate swaps cover 
current borrowings relating to the floating rate euro notes.
Interest rate swaps in place at the balance sheet date are designated, and are effective under IAS39, as cash flow hedges, and the fair value thereof 
has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve. A credit of £443,000 (2013: £894,000 charge) has been made to the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts and exposure 
to currency rate fluctuations.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2014 is £143,145,000 (2013: 
£6,145,000). These comprise:
�  foreign currency contracts to sell sterling for a total notional of £141,580,000 (2013: £nil). These contracts have maturity dates to June 2015. These 
contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been deferred in 
equity; and
�  foreign currency contracts to sell euro for a total notional of £1,565,000 (2013: £6,145,000). These contracts have maturity dates to May 2015. These 
contracts are not designated as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and, accordingly, the fair value thereof has been taken to the statement of 
comprehensive income. As at 31 December 2014 the aggregate amount of net gain/loss under forward foreign exchange contracts that have been 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to the exposure on these anticipated future transactions is 
£64,000 gain (2013: £79,000 loss).

The carrying value of the bank borrowings is deemed to be a good approximation of their fair value. Bank borrowings can be repaid within six months 
if the Group decides not to roll over for further periods up to the contractual repayment date. The impact of discounting is therefore negligible.
The fair value of the bonds has been calculated with reference to their market value. 
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value, which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a results of the derivative transaction. 
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
27  Share based payments – group and company
Share incentive plan scheme (SIP)
On 30 December 2014, the Group provided eligible employees with a free share award worth £500, with a grant date price per share of £2.29 as part 
of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The free shares vest at the end of three years, with employees required to stay in employment to receive the shares.
In April 2014, the Group offered to all employees the opportunity to participate in the above SIP, where the Company gives the participating employees 
one matching share for each partnership share acquired on behalf of the employee using the participating employees’ gross salaries. The shares 
vest at the end of three years on a rolling basis as they are purchased, with employees required to stay in employment to receive the shares.
Upon listing in October 2013, the Group provided eligible employees with a one off award of free shares worth up to £3,000, with a grant price per 
share of £2.425, as part of the Arrow Global Group SIP. The value of SIP shares awarded was dependent on a linear scale of length of service. The free 
shares vest at the end of three years, with employees required to stay in employment to receive the shares. 
Initial share option plan (ISOP)
On 7 October 2013, and 21 October 2013, 3,566,000 ISOP options were granted to employees of the Group. These ISOP options were exercisable 
conditional upon, and with effect from IPO for those granted on 7 October 2013 and from the grant date for those granted on 21 October 2013. 
1,934,000 vested immediately with the remaining to vest in two years from the date they take effect, with employees required to stay in employment 
to receive the shares.
Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)
On 11 March 2014, nil cost share options were granted to eligible employees based on a maximum of 150% of base salary. The LTIP awards vest at 
the end of three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions. 
For each eligible employee, 75% of the LTIP awards are subject to EPS growth criteria, and vests as follows:
Performance condition Percentage vesting
Less than 10% EPS growth per annum 0%
10% EPS growth per annum over the vesting period (‘threshold performance’) 25%

Senior secured notes
On 4 November 2014, the Group issued €225 million floating rate senior secured notes (‘the euro senior notes’) at a margin of 5.25% over three-month 
EURIBOR, although derivative contracts have been used to fixed the borrowing costs for the period through to November 2017. Interest is paid 
quarterly. The euro senior notes can be redeemed in full or in part on or after 1 November 2017 at the Group’s option. Prior to 1 November 2017, 
the Group may redeem, at its option, some or all of the euro senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, 
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus an applicable make-whole premium. 
On 29 January 2013, the Group issued £220 million senior secured notes at a fixed rate of 7.875% due 2020 (the ‘sterling senior notes’). Interest is 
paid bi-annually. The sterling senior notes can be redeemed in full or in part on or after 1 March 2016 at the Group’s option. Prior to 1 March 2016, 
the Group may redeem, at its option, some or all of the sterling senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, 
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus an applicable make-whole premium.
The euro senior notes and sterling senior notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Group. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 114

Revolving credit facility
On 16 September 2014, the Group amended its revolving credit facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC acting as security agent for a syndicate of 
participating financial institutions. The commitments under the facility were increased from £55 million to £82.5 million and the facility was 
extended to January 2019. In addition the margin on the facility was reduced by 0.5% to 3.75% per annum over the relevant reference rate, subject 
to a margin ratchet based on the loan-to-value ratio at each quarter end. The commitments under the revolving credit facility were further increased 
to £100 million on completion of the Capquest group acquisition on 28 November 2014.
The Group is required to pay a commitment fee at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin per annum on the undrawn portion of each lender’s 
commitment. The revolving credit facility is secured by the same assets as the euro and sterling senior notes and ranks supersenior to these. The 
assets that are secured are those of the Arrow Global Guernsey Holdings Limited group.

30  Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking
On 28 November 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the ordinary share capital of Quest Topco Limited and settled secured loan notes at the point 
of acquisition for £104,574,000, satisfied with cash and a deferred payment, with the additional requirement to repay outstanding loans and other 
costs post acquisition of £55,000,000. The deferred payment has subsequently been paid in full. Quest Topco Limited and subsidiaries, ‘the Capquest 
group’, have a similar principal activity as the Group being the acquisition and management of an underperforming portfolio of loans and servicing 
of debt in relation to third party contracts.
Goodwill of £45,655,000 was created as part of this acquisition. The primary reasons for the acquisition, which make up the goodwill, were to 
strengthen market position, reinforce the business model, diversify origination sources, enhance data capabilities, achieve strong synergies and 
the deal was considered financially attractive for shareholders. Synergies arise from overhead cost savings through removal of overlapping and 
duplicated activities, operating cost savings through better management of collection resources and greater customer insight from collections 
operations expected. Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets including the anticipated impact of the primary reasons for the acquisition 
above that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
In the one month from acquisition to 31 December 2014, the Capquest group contributed revenue of £2,514,000 and operating profit of £738,000 
to the consolidated results for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 1 January 2014, Group total revenue would have been an 
estimated £137 ,122,000 and operating profit would have been an estimated £41,900,000. In determining these amounts, management has assumed 
that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2014. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 115

Deferred consideration             1,600
             104,574
The fair value adjustment on the portfolio asset acquired arises from a difference between carrying value and management’s assessment of fair value. 
Goodwill previously recognised in the acquired Group is not an identifiable asset when applying acquisition accounting and therefore, has been 
written off through the fair value adjustments accordingly. 
The Capquest Group undertook a review of plant, property and equipment on 28 November 2014, and £131,000 of assets were written off  
post acquisition.
Other receivables in the acquired entities comprise gross contracted amounts of £1,670,000. There is doubt over the collectability of £237,000 of 
this amount, being those in excess of 90 days outstanding.
A VAT provision was included of £2,395,000 after post acquisition discussions with HRMC, which is still on-going.
The fair value adjustments created a deferred tax liability of £213,000. The Company previously adjusted its numbers on 1 April 2012 from UK GAAP 
to EU IFRS and a deferred tax liability arising on the difference to the fair value of the portfolio assets at this point was not recorded, this amounted to 
£1,088,000 at acquisition and has been included in the fair value adjustments above. Also, a deferred tax asset of £558,000 in relation to losses not 
previously recognised has been included.
Acquisition expenses
The Group incurred acquisition expenses of £5,402,000 in relation to the acquisition, which has been charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income and included within other operating expenses.
Measurement period
Whilst the Group believes the acquisition accounting fair value adjustments to be complete, IFRS 3 allows a measurement period of up to one year 
after acquisition to reflect any new information obtained about facts and circumstances that were not in existence at the acquisition date. If any 
additional material changes are required within this measurement period, these will be reflected in the 2015 half-year results of the Group. Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 116

 ‘Adjusted EBITDA ratio’ represents the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to core collections.
 ‘CGU’ means cash generating unit.
 ‘Collection activity costs’ represent the direct costs of external collections related to the Group’s purchased loan portfolios, such as commissions 
paid to third party outsourced providers, credit bureau data costs and legal costs associated with collections.
 ‘Core collections’ or ‘core cash collections’ mean cash collections on the Group’s existing portfolios including ordinary course portfolio sales 
and put backs.
 ‘Cost-to-collect ratio’ is the ratio of collection activity costs to core collections.
 ‘Creditors’ means financial institutions or other initial credit providers to consumers, certain of which entities choose to sell paying accounts or 
non-paying accounts receivables related thereto to debt purchasers (such as the Group).
 ‘CSA’ means Credit Services Association.
 ‘Customers’ means consumers whose unsecured loan obligation is owed to the Group as a result of a portfolio purchase made by the Group.
 ‘Defaulted debt’ means a debt where a customer has breached the repayment terms governing that debt such that it is unlikely to be paid. Under 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974 there are specific legal obligations which require a customer to be sent the relevant statutory default notice(s) 
after which the customer’s agreement may ultimately be terminated. Other types of debts may also be defined as defaulted in the event that they 
remain unpaid for a period of 90 days or more, if there is not an acceptable arrangement in place to bring the account back up to date, in which 
case the creditor or lender may reasonably believe that the relationship has broken down. Under the Data Protection Act 1990 it is a requirement 
that any organisation seeking to register a default with a credit reference agency must also send a notice of intention to file a default, this notice is 
very similar in nature to that required under the Consumer Credit Act both of which give the debtor 28 days to bring the account back up to date 
before action is taken.
 ‘DSBP’ means the Arrow Global deferred share bonus plan.
 ‘EBITDA’ means earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.
 ‘EBT’ means employee benefit trust.
 ‘EIR’ means effective interest rate (which is based on the loan portfolio’s gross internal rate of return) calculated using the loan portfolio purchase 
price and forecast 84-month gross ERC at the date of purchase. On acquisition, there is a short period that is required to determine the EIR, due to 
the complexity of the portfolios acquired.
 ‘84-month ERC’ and ‘120-month ERC’ (together ‘gross ERC’), mean the Group’s estimated remaining collections on purchased loan portfolios 
over an 84-month or 120-month period, respectively, representing the expected future core collections on purchased loan portfolios over an 
84-month or 120-month period (calculated at the end of each month, based on the Group’s proprietary ERC forecasting model, as amended 
from time to time).
 ‘EPS’ means earnings per share.
 ‘Existing portfolios’ or ‘purchased loan portfolios’ are on the Group’s balance sheet and represent all debt portfolios that the Group owns at the 
relevant point in time.
 ‘FCA’ means the Financial Conduct Authority.

 ‘Net cash-on-cash multiple’ means collections to date plus the 84-month ERC or 120-month ERC, as applicable, net of collection activity costs,  
all divided by the purchase price for each portfolio.
 ‘Net core collections’ are core collections less collection activity costs. The Group presents net core collections in order to calculate its net IRR.
 ‘Net debt’ means the sum of the senior secured notes, interest thereon, and amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility, less cash and 
cash equivalents. Net debt is presented because it indicates the level of debt after taking out of the Group’s assets that can be used to pay down 
outstanding borrowings, and because it is a component of the maintenance covenants in the revolving credit facility. The breakdown of net debt 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 is as follows:
             £000
Cash and cash equivalents             (14,542 )
Senior secured notes (pre transaction fees net off)           396,070

Deferred consideration             11,928
Net debt             439,744

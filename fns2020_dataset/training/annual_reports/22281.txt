Our vision is to become the UK’s leading 
wealth manager by 2020. 
We define leading in terms of quality rather 
than quantity; we do not seek necessarily 
to become the biggest, but rather the best 
wealth manager in the UK. 
Focusing on client satisfaction as well as 
staff engagement and equity market rating, 
we will measure our progress against targets 
year-on-year.
The strategy to deliver our vision is simple – 
we always work in our clients’ best interests, 
offering a truly personal service with a 
commitment to holistic wealth management, 
delivered through four business divisions: 
Investment Management Services, 
Asset Management, Financial Planning 
and Charles Stanley Direct.

Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
Our results for the year reflect the lower levels of activity 
which have been experienced across the market in general 
over recent months. This, together with the disposal of 
non-core businesses, which I flagged in my statement 
last year, has led to a decline in our reported revenue from 
£149.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2015 to £141.6 
million for the 2016 financial year. Our tight control of costs 
helped mitigate the impact of this, with the adjusted profit 
before tax from our Core Business holding up well at 
£4.2 million compared with £4.4 million in financial year 2015 
and the reported loss before tax improving from £6.1 million 
incurred in the previous financial year to £0.3 million this year.
Clients’ Funds under Management and Administration 
(FuMA) were impacted by the market downturn, ending 
the year at £20.5 billion compared with £21.3 billion the 
year before. This represents a decline of 3.8% compared 
with the decline in our principal comparator, the WMA 
Balanced Index, of 3.5%, and of 8.8% in the FTSE 100 Index. 
Within these figures the level of managed funds fell by 
rather less, 2.4%, from £12.3 billion as at 31 March 2015 to 
£12.0 billion at the end of March 2016.
As I reported in my statement last year, we carried out a 
fund-raising exercise in April 2015 to strengthen the Group’s 
balance sheet. This was well supported by shareholders. 
We raised £15.8 million net of transaction expenses. As at  
31 March 2016, our cash balances were nearly £20 million 
higher at £48.1 million compared to the previous year 
(31 March 2015: £28.5 million).
This has been a year of significant strategic development 
and implementation, and our Chief Executive Officer, 
Paul Abberley, addresses this in detail in the Our strategy 
report on pages 18 and 19.
Sir David Howard
Chairman
During the year ended 31 March 2016, 
we have driven forward our 
transformation programme in the 
face of market headwinds. There is 
much to do still, and our sights remain 
resolutely fixed on our ambition to be 
the leading wealth manager in the UK 
in terms of the quality of what we do 
and how we serve our valued clients. 
Our strategy remains strongly focused 
on broadening our core investment 
management offering into a holistic 
wealth management business 
incorporating financial planning, 
asset management and digital 
platform enterprises.
Focusing on Culture
In order to uphold company law and meet regulatory 
expectations, Charles Stanley has completed its 
journey from a culture in which responsibility is 
shared by the partners to a culture in which individual 
accountability plays a significant role. Our values 
revolve at all times around the best interests of the 
client and, indeed, the Board proactively seeks to 
promote and embed the culture.

Activities of the Board
Over the past year, whilst continuing with its general 
oversight and challenge responsibilities, the Board has 
been particularly focused on a number of key areas:
• Review of the structure of the Group’s key management 
committees and reporting hierarchy to improve their 
quality and effectiveness
• Development of the detailed strategic implementation 
plans for each of our core operating divisions
• Changes to the Board membership itself and of other 
senior appointments
• The completion of the implementation of the Group’s 
revised client suitability processes
• Oversight of the design of revised variable remuneration 
arrangements which have been consulted on with the 
Group’s investment managers.
The common themes of these activities have been to 
ensure that the Group is both equipped to deliver on its 
transformation programme and that not only are clients’ 
interests embedded front and centre throughout our 
culture, which I firmly believe they are, but also that there 
is tangible demonstration of this.
Reporting structures
Over a number of years we have developed from having a 
very flat reporting structure to one where we have quite a 
large number of subcommittees, both of the Board itself 
and of the Executive Committee.
The main challenge posed by the range of committees 
required is how to ensure they operate effectively to enable 
good and timely decision-making. During the year the 
Board has challenged a number of aspects of the structure, 
including the terms of reference, membership, reporting 
hierarchy and management information produced. 
Much progress has been made. However there is further 
to go and we anticipate this will continue to be a main 
area of focus during the 2017 financial year.
Development of strategy
Strategy is naturally an evolving canvas and, having laid out 
the broad tenets of how Charles Stanley was intended to 
develop a year ago, a key task for the Executive Committee 
has been to complete the strategy review and then develop 
the detailed implementation plans to put this into effect. 
The role of the Board and of the Non-executive Directors 
in particular during the year has been to challenge these 
plans to ensure they are robust both from shareholders’ 
and clients’ perspectives. We have had many healthy 
debates and refinement along the way so I am confident 
that what is emerging and being put into effect will help 
us achieve our goals.

Team
It is now more than a year since Paul Abberley agreed 
to succeed me as Chief Executive Officer, and the 2016 
year-end results mark his first full year in this role. It has 
been an extremely busy year for Paul and I should like to 
pay tribute to him for his energy and his vision. In the midst 
of a major transformation of our business and in difficult 
market conditions, he has taken the Group forward strongly.
Paul has been more than ably assisted by our new Chief 
Financial Officer, Ben Money-Coutts, who was appointed 
to this role in June 2015. Ben has restructured our Finance 
department and plays a leading role in our Executive 
Committee, chaired by Paul Abberley.
Regrettably, Anthony Scott, the Director co-heading our 
Investment Management Services division alongside Gary 
Teper, decided to step down in April 2016 for personal 
reasons. Anthony was central to developing our new and 
enhanced proposition to our private clients, and I thank him 
warmly for his contribution. The Investment Management 
Services division remains under Gary’s capable leadership.
We decided in 2015 that the Company would benefit from 
having a fourth Non-executive Director, in addition to David 
Pusinelli, Bridget Guerin and myself. With the help of external 
consultants we identified Andrew Didham as a particularly 
well-qualified candidate to take on the chairmanship of the 
Risk Committee.
Amongst other key changes in personnel during the year 
I should mention that we have reorganised our Risk and 
Compliance teams under the oversight of Peter Kelk, our 
Chief Risk Officer. Peter has already made good progress 
and I should like to thank him for his considerable input to 
this area.
The 2016 financial year was a busy and demanding year for 
all of my fellow Non-executive Directors, who, between them, 
chair our Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees and I 
should like to thank them for their support to the Group.
It has also been another challenging year of change for 
everyone in the Company – Directors, managers, investment 
managers and so many others – and this is my opportunity 
to say thank you to them all on behalf of the shareholders, 
for coping with all the demands in making Charles Stanley 
the fine Company that it is.
Suitability processes
I commented in my statement last year on the suitability 
review programme that required most of the Group’s staff 
involvement. The initial process was completed to timetable 
at the end of June 2015 after considerable effort by all of 
our investment management teams, Compliance, IT and 
Operations departments, as well as with the great 
forbearance of our clients. Of course it is an ongoing 
programme to ensure we keep an up-to-date profile 
of our clients’ investment objectives, financial position, 
attitude to risk and capacity for loss. Accordingly, the Board 
has continued to pay close attention to the embedding of 
this approach in our business as usual processes.
Remuneration structures
We have for some time been in consultation with our 
investment management teams about their variable 
remuneration arrangements, both because it is a key 
component in helping to improve the Group’s profitability 
and because it is seen as a key driver of delivering good 
client outcomes. Ordinarily such a review might be overseen 
by the Remuneration Committee, but such is the import of 
these discussions that the full Board has played an active 
oversight role. We have agreed interim arrangements which 
subsist for the financial year ending 31 March 2017 and we 
believe we are close to reaching a long-term agreement. 
I would like to thank all concerned for the constructive way 
in which they have entered into the dialogue and know that 
everyone is looking forward to finalising terms.
Chairman’s statement
We are moving steadily along 
a transformational path from being 
a traditional stockbroking business 
to a full-scale holistic wealth manager . 
Much has been achieved already.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 07
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Dividend
This time last year we re-based our recommendation for the 
final dividend for financial year 2015 at 2 pence per share. 
Together with the interim dividend of 3 pence per share paid 
in November 2014, this resulted in a total dividend of 5 pence 
per share for the year. In January 2016 an interim dividend of 
1.5 pence per share was paid in respect of the 2016 financial 
year. The Board is now recommending a final dividend of 
3.5 pence per share thus maintaining the total dividend for 
the financial year at 5 pence per share. As indicated last 
year, it is the Company’s intention that, as profitability starts 
to improve significantly, we will return over a period of time 
to our previous pattern of steadily increasing dividends.
Outlook
The new management team has now been in place for over 
a year and we are moving steadily along a transformational 
path from being a traditional stockbroking business to a 
full-scale holistic wealth manager. Much has been achieved 
already and there is much still to be done.
The market backdrop to all this remains problematic. 
Since this time last year growth in most of the developed 
economies has ticked up a little, but the commodity-based 
economies are in a state of turmoil which threatens wider 
global markets. Now the issues are less the state of the Euro 
and the Greek economy – though these are not far away 
– but the ramifications of the referendum on Britain’s 
membership of the EU, and the choice facing the American 
electorate in November this year. Either has potentially huge 
implications for the market, and could swing share price 
levels and trading volume either way.
I believe that Charles Stanley is on track with its programme 
of change and development. The background conditions 
were equally worrying last year when I suggested a slightly 
higher degree of optimism for the year ahead. This has 
proved to be justified, and I think it is fair to suggest a similar 
degree of gentle optimism for the financial year ending 
31 March 2017.

Financial performance
The Group’s losses were significantly reduced during the 
year, with stabilisation in both the reported and the Core 
Business results. Nevertheless, difficult financial markets in 
the second half of the financial year did prove challenging. 
While overall costs were reduced by £15.1 million, 
these savings were partially offset by an £8.1 million 
decline in revenues as weaker markets both reduced 
fee income and led to lower commissions. Across the 
four operating divisions combined, after tax performance 
marginally improved.
Good progress was made in addressing the financial 
performance of our smaller divisions, namely Asset 
Management, Financial Planning and most notably, 
Charles Stanley Direct.
We are grateful to our shareholders for a successful capital 
raising which re-established a strong balance sheet in 
excess of the Board’s preferred buffer above the regulatory 
capital requirement. These funds were earmarked for 
reserves and have remained untouched.
Total Funds under Management and Administration fell 
by £0.8 billion during the financial year to £20.5 billion. 
During the same period the FTSE 100 Index and WMA 
Balanced Index fell by 8.8% and 3.5% respectively. The 
business mix continues to move in favour of managed 
accounts at the expense of Advisory business.
Strategy implementation
Our strategic review reaffirmed that we remain an 
investment-led Group and retain our commitment to 
providing genuinely personalised wealth management 
delivered by investment professionals. Our private client 
offering will remain full service, extending to Advisory and 
Execution-only services in addition to the core Discretionary 
portfolio management. The review also affirmed a strategic 
commitment to provide holistic wealth management, 
offering financial planning, asset management and digital 
services. Finally, as flagged in our Interim report and 
accounts for the period ended 30 September 2015, we have 
disposed of non-core assets, underlining our 100% focus 
on the UK wealth management market. 
Paul Abberley
Chief Executive Officer
Our three-fold priorities for the 
year were to arrest the decline in 
profitability, determine and begin 
to implement the strategic direction 
for Charles Stanley and build the 
foundations upon which we 
can drive sustainable growth. 
Solid progress was achieved 
in each. We have reduced our 
losses by £5.8 million, refocused 
on core activities that will allow 
us to deliver high levels of customer 
satisfaction, and made significant 
progress in terms of making the 
Group more efficient over the 
long term. We look forward to 
another year of progress as we 
pursue our aim of becoming the 
UK’s leading wealth manager. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 09
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Mobilisation represents the first stage in our strategy 
implementation and this is largely complete. An overhaul 
of management information, governance and controls is 
creating a platform from which strategic change can be 
delivered with greater pace and precision. Two new 
divisions, Financial Planning and Asset Management, have 
been created from legacy businesses and capabilities. 
Together with the Investment Management Services division 
and Charles Stanley Direct, these four profit centres enable 
the flexible delivery of the range of services increasingly 
sought by our clients.
The year ahead
While retaining a primary focus on client service, the year 
ending 31 March 2017 will be another year of significant 
and sometimes challenging change as we accelerate the 
detailed implementation of our strategy in each of our four 
key operating divisions while re-engineering our operational 
and support functions.
The impact on near-term revenues from the current 
challenging market environment presents trade-offs 
between recording short-term improvements in profitability 
and investing in the full implementation of the long-term 
strategy. This might lead to an extension of the time frames 
originally envisaged. Achievement of a 15% operating margin 
is still regarded as attainable but is likely to take 12 to 18 
months longer than originally anticipated in the absence 
of a significant market rally. We will proceed prudently.
In summary, while I believe that much has been achieved, 
considerable work lies ahead. With skilled execution 
and sensible stewardship, our vision of becoming the 
UK’s leading wealth manager by 2020 is still firmly within 
our sights.

Three strategic measures
The delivery of our strategy will be independently measured against 
targets over three strategic measures: client satisfaction, staff engagement 
and equity market rating.
Our client satisfaction surveys are being 
remodelled to allow benchmarking 
within the wealth management industry 
and to ensure clients’ feedback is 
adequately captured and monitored.
We hold annual staff engagement 
surveys benchmarked within the wealth 
management sector and ensure staff 
feedback is actively acted upon.
We compare the Group’s three 
year total shareholder return 
to a basket of peer group 
listed companies.

Our objective 
Staff engagement is viewed as 
being fundamental to our success. 
In November 2015 we ran our first annual 
staff engagement survey. There was a
76%
response rate and a  
56%
overall engagement score just above the 
stated average for wealth managers in the UK.
Any issues raised via the survey were discussed 
at the Group staff conference held in January 
2016 with dedicated workstreams.
Staff engagement will continue to be assessed 
on an annual basis.

Our business
The core pillar of Charles Stanley was, is and shall remain 
the provision of investment management services to 
an affluent private client base. Within the Investment 
Management Services division, the most important theme 
since the millennium has been the transformation from 
a stockbroking business, which generates revenues from 
commission, to a discretionary managed investment 
service, which generates revenues from fees. To exemplify, 
in 2000, Discretionary managed funds accounted for 9% of 
our total Funds under Management and Administration, 
but that figure now stands at 46%. 
Shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the investment 
management business is our Asset Management division. 
This provides pooled solutions and model portfolios 
to a range of clients, from institutional investors with 
multi-million pound portfolios to valued retail clients 
with smaller portfolios. The division also houses Charles 
Stanley’s investment research capability, covering asset 
allocation, stock selection and collective vehicle selection. 
As such, the division both enhances our private client 
investment management business and provides an 
excellent growth opportunity. 
Notwithstanding Charles Stanley’s expertise and 
experience in managing investments, we believe strongly 
that self-directed investors should also be able to utilise our 
dealing, settlement and custody platform. Therefore, we are 
fully committed to our Advisory and Execution-only services. 
Indeed, the increased polarisation of investment mandates 
makes our digital execution platform, Charles Stanley Direct, 
one of the most exciting areas of our business, enjoying 
impressive client acquisition rates.
Dovetailing our investment management business is a 
financial planning offering. Under the new leadership, 
we are confident that the business will, over the longer 
term, become a significant contributor to Group revenue 
following an integration programme with the investment 
management business and a sales and marketing advance 
on third parties. 
Taken together, the four divisions play to Charles Stanley’s 
natural competitive advantage which, correctly leveraged, 
offers a set of differentiated and complementary services 
to clients. In isolation, each has the capacity to develop 
further as well as to contribute to the overarching vision 
of turning Charles Stanley into the UK’s leading wealth 
manager by 2020.
Charles Stanley is one of the UK’s 
leading independently-owned 
private client wealth managers. 
We have a rich heritage dating 
back to 1792 and have been 
members of the London Stock 
Exchange since 1852. We manage 
and administer £20.5 billion of assets 
as at 31 March 2016. The large 
number of our clients entrusting 
us with the management of their 
portfolios across generations is 
testament to the quality of the 
service provided by our dedicated 
investment professionals.

Going forward, we aim to build on our strong foundations 
to create a wealth management enterprise fit for the next 
century. To that end, we have initiated a modernisation 
programme which, when complete, will see our business 
optimised to meet the evolving needs of our clients, our 
regulator and our marketplace. 
The process started in 2015. The senior management team 
was refreshed. A strategic review was launched by our Chief 
Executive Officer, and the groundwork was laid out for us 
to achieve our overall vision of becoming the UK’s leading 
wealth manager by 2020, as judged by being top quartile, 
independently assessed, across three key areas: Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Our markets
The wealth management industry has 
always been attractive to investors. 
Its constituents benefit from nominal 
growth in their underlying assets 
of between 3% and 7% per annum. 
It also enjoys predictable fee-based 
earnings delivered by loyal client 
bases with low volatility portfolios. 
These positive characteristics are now being bolstered by a 
strong set of structural dynamics. The most important is the 
shift in pensions. These products have evolved from defined 
benefit schemes managed by asset managers on behalf of 
corporates to defined contribution schemes managed by 
wealth managers on behalf of the public. Some analysts 
believe that the approximately £1,110 billion in defined 
benefit schemes will morph into defined contribution 
assets within a generation, thus providing a strong 
source of business for the wealth management industry 
for years to come.
Beyond pensions, the wealth management industry 
is helped by the fact that the UK population is ageing. 
To exemplify, the Office for National Statistics estimates  
that the number of people aged over 65 in the UK was 
11.4 million in 2014, but that this figure will rise to 15.8 million 
in 2031. Given age and wealth are correlated – because the 
older you are, the more time you have to save – we are 
confident that the wealth management industry will benefit 
greatly from the demographic trend going forwards.
The next growth driver for the wealth management 
industry is the savings rate in the UK. In the run-up to 
the credit crunch, the proportion of income which people 
saved fell significantly from the long-run average of 10% 
to 6%. Since then, it has improved and then fallen off again. 
This has led experts to predict another much-needed bout 
of savings which will inherently advantage the wealth 
management industry.
Last but not least, the uptick in regulatory initiatives is a 
growth driver in disguise. Although directives like the Retail 
Distribution Review look like mandatory cost increases, 
they have also forced many financial advisors to outsource 
their investment management. As the 180 wealth 
management firms consolidate, the trend provides 
an excellent source of fund flow and promises a bright 
future for firms and clients alike. 
It is important to note that the increased cost and complexity 
of delivery is having tertiary effects. Specifically, a number 
of firms have increased their minimum portfolio sizes, 
which means that an ever-enlarging numbers of clients 
are being disenfranchised. To meet the needs of these 
clients within the confines of cost, a new breed of firms 
is springing up offering automated advice. To date, 
there is little evidence that these models are economic. 
But there is no doubt that the digital world has the potential 
to be highly disruptive in redefining the way that we 
communicate, invest and charge.

Our strategy
Achieving our vision to become the 
UK’s leading wealth manager by 2020 
will require a transformation of 
various aspects of the Group without 
compromising the long-standing 
focus on client service.
The process is three-pronged:
Strategic review
Strategy implementation
Sustainable growth
The first step, which has been completed, was the 
delivery of a strategic review and, from that, the 
development of strategic implementation plans 
for all areas of the Group
The second step, now underway, is the 
implementation of those strategy plans
As the strategy becomes embedded, we will then 
improve the delivery of sustainable long-term 
growth for our stakeholders.
Strategic review
2015 2016 2017
Strategic review
Our review confirmed three principal strategic objectives:
• Charles Stanley will focus exclusively on wealth 
management
• We will provide holistic wealth management services 
delivered through four divisions: Investment Management 
Services, Asset Management, Financial Planning and 
Charles Stanley Direct
• Our core Investment Management Services division will 
continue to provide a full service offering, delivered by 
empowered investment professionals.
Milestones achieved during the year ended 31 March 2016 
have been to lay the foundations for the strategic 
transformation to come. We have:
• Disposed of non-core activities, namely Charles Stanley 
Securities and Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited 
• Restructured the divisional organisation, the divisional 
management teams and the reporting lines to streamline 
process and accelerate the change programme
• Developed detailed strategic implementation plans for 
each division of the Group so that we have a clear 
roadmap and can prioritise resource allocation
• Substantially stemmed the trading losses of the Asset 
Management division and Charles Stanley Direct and 
put them on a clear path to profitability.
Strategy implementation 
2016 2017 2018
Strategy implementation
Having completed the strategic review, we are now moving 
into the critical implementation phase. Our focus during 
financial year 2017 for each division and our support 
functions is summarised on the following page.
Strategic report / Our strategy Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk
Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Investment Management Services
The highest priority is to agree a revised basis for the 
remuneration packages of our private client investment 
managers to ensure they are fully aligned with the best 
interests alike of clients, shareholders and the investment 
managers themselves. Detailed conversations throughout 
the year have brought a long-term solution closer and have 
resulted in an interim arrangement being agreed for the 
2017 financial year. We are confident that this will be 
finalised in summer 2016 with the new arrangements 
effective from April 2017 as the interim arrangement expires. 
Simultaneously, we intend to renew our three core drivers:
• The first is the continuing focus on increasing our 
discretionary book of business
• The second is to continue the phased implementation of 
our revised rate card to improve our return on assets in 
line with the market pricing
• The third is to invigorate our distribution and marketing 
channels, including via intermediary networks, to improve 
our organic rate of growth.
Asset Management
We are in the advanced stages of restructuring the 
division to drive operating efficiencies and support growth. 
The division has two key responsibilities. The first is to 
provide our private client investment managers with first- 
class investment advice. The second is to provide model 
and pooled portfolio solutions for clients together with 
segregated portfolio management for selected client 
groups. The division is also responsible for a crucial change 
initiative in the form of recrafting Charles Stanley’s fund 
range into a risk-rated multi-asset class solution fit for 
smaller investment management clients.
Financial Planning
The Financial Planning division’s first task is a review of the 
operating and pricing models. Once complete, a strategic 
programme will be launched to increase integration with 
the Investment Management Services division in order to 
offer these services to current clients. We will also launch 
a marketing programme in order to attract new clients.
Charles Stanley Direct
In the autumn a new website will be released carrying 
streamlined onboarding procedures and better search 
visibility on Google. Thereafter, we can tailor our digital 
marketing and drive client acquisition. We are also 
reviewing our pricing policy. Moreover, we are investigating 
ways of making our revised Open-ended Investment 
Company range available to retail clients, and we are 
considering revisions to our rate card in order to target 
underserved areas of the retail market.
Support functions
We have four priorities for our support functions during the 
2017 financial year:
• The first, working in conjunction with all front office areas, 
is to begin streamlining and standardising processes to 
generate operating efficiencies and bring improved 
scalability into our cost structure. If successfully 
implemented it is anticipated this will enable our 
investment managers to spend more time directly on 
client matters and less on administration. This will be 
a multi-year project
• The second priority is to strengthen further our governance 
and management information framework to improve the 
speed and quality of decision-making and execution
• Our third priority, facilitated by our Human Resources 
department, is to mobilise the entire workforce to 
contribute to the detailed strategy implementation 
programme. This process has already begun with the 
formation of seven internal working parties drawn from 
across the Group focusing on subjects such as improving 
the client experience, growing assets and streamlining 
processes and systems
• The fourth priority will be the rationalisation of our London 
office space. London staff are currently split across four 
sites and we will rationalise this to at most two by the end 
of the 2017 financial year. We have entered into a new office 
lease at 55 Bishopsgate, London, which will allow us to 
move all our front office and front office support functions 
into one building, whilst at the same time enabling us to 
vacate two of our other properties. One of these offices is 
on a long leasehold and we are expecting that the proceeds 
from the sale of this lease will substantially cover the costs 
of the move.
Summary
Combined, the change programme for financial year 
2017, aims to provide an unparalleled service for 
clients. It is also designed to improve the level of the 
Group’s profitability so that we have the resources to 
reinvest in the business as well as provide appropriate 
returns to our shareholders. As we commented in 
the 2015 Annual report and accounts, there is a 
substantial programme of work ahead of us that will 
take three to five years to complete. We are making 
good progress and the benefits will begin to feed 
through in the 2017 financial year. Strategic report / Review of the year
Review of the year
Funds under Management and Administration
Charles Stanley’s revenue is substantively driven by the 
level of its Funds under Management and Administration 
(FuMA). These decreased 3.8% during the year from 
£21.3 billion at 31 March 2015 to £20.5 billion at 31 March 2016. 
This decrease was broadly in line with the decrease in the 
WMA Balanced Index over the same period, down 3.5%, 
and compared favourably to the decline of the FTSE 100 
Index, down 8.8%. 
Ben Money-Coutts 
Chief Financial Officer
After reporting a significant loss for 
the financial year ended 31 March 2015, 
the task for the 2016 financial year was 
to stabilise performance, dispose of 
non-core activities and begin to lay 
the foundations for long-term growth. 
While progress was made in each of 
these areas, the financial performance 
of the Group during the year ended 
31 March 2016 suffered from the 
headwind of declining markets.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Discretionary funds increased 1.1%. Other investment categories suffered a reduction, in part owing to transfers between

(£0.3 billion). The Execution-only funds on the Charles Stanley Direct platform increased by 9.7%. 
Net fund infl ows of £1.1 billion were fully accounted for by Discretionary (£0.6 billion) and Execution-only (£0.5 billion) 
services. However, these were offset by negative market performance of £0.7 billion and accounts closed during the year
of £1.2 billion, resulting in overall FuMA at the year-end of £20.5 billion.

Overview of financial performance
The Group made pre-tax profits from its Core Business (comprising the Investment Management Services, Asset 
Management, Financial Planning and Charles Stanley Direct divisions of £4.2 million (2015: £4.4 million). The decline 
reflects the fall in FuMA over the period and consequential 3.3% reduction in revenues of the Core Business.
Losses before tax from the held for sale activities (Charles Stanley Securities and Charles Stanley Financial Solutions 
Limited) were reduced to £0.6 million (2015: £1.9 million), and one-off adjusting items, were significantly lower at 
£4.0 million (2015: £8.6 million). 
The Group’s overall reported loss after tax improved from £6.1 million in 2015 to £0.3 million in 2016.
The total of the Core Business, held for sale activities and adjusting items represents the overall results for the Group as

Core Business revenues
Overall, revenues from the Core Business declined 3.3% from £141.0 million in 2015 to £136.3 million in 2016. This was 
attributable to a 4.3% decline in the revenues of the Investment Management Services division. The Asset Management
and Financial Planning divisional revenues showed better progress, increasing by 7.8% and 5.3% respectively.
Charles Stanley Direct’s revenues have remained stable over the prior year at £4.8 million.
 
Core Business expenses
Expenses within the Core Business reduced 3.4% to £132.3 million (2015: £136.9 million). Savings were achieved
most notably by the Investment Management Services, Asset Management and Charles Stanley Direct divisions,
down £3.4 million, £0.7 million and £1.1 million respectively. These savings were partially offset by £0.6 million higher 
spending within the Financial Planning division. 
As illustrated in the chart below, the bulk of the cost savings within the Core Business were achieved by reduced 
remuneration costs, down £3.9 million, driven by a 7.2% reduction in headcount to 976 employees (2015: 1,052 employees). 
Administration costs were reduced by £2.2 million as revenue sharing payments to third parties fell by £1.3 million and an 
increase in the VAT recovery rate resulted in a £0.7 million improvement year-on-year.

Core Business pre-tax profit margin
The Core Business pre-tax profit margin was flat at 3.1% (2015: 3.1%). This was because improvements in the operating 
performance of the Asset Management and the Charles Stanley Direct divisions were more than offset by a deterioration of 
the much larger Investment Management Services division and, to a lesser extent, the Financial Planning division. The decline 
in the Investment Management Services division reflects the operational gearing these activities have to market levels since 
the overhead cost, with the exception of variable remuneration, is semi-fixed. Considerable efforts are being made to 
address this matter just as more focused sales and marketing initiatives to grow assets under management and revenues 
are now underway. 
Held for sale
The revenues of the held for sale activities declined 39.1% from £8.7 million in 2015 to £5.3 million in 2016. This was due to 
the sale of Charles Stanley Securities in July 2015, reducing revenue by £2.4 million year-on-year, and a reduction in the 
revenue generated by Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited of £0.9 million. Expenses within the held for sale activities 
fell 43.8% to £5.9 million (2015: £10.5 million) almost entirely due to the sale of Charles Stanley Securities. Overall there was a 
£1.4 million reduction in losses incurred by the held for sale activities.

Payments made for the introduction of customer relationships that are deemed to be intangible assets are capitalised and 
amortised over their useful life, which has been assessed to be 10 years. This amortisation charge has been excluded from 
the Core Business profit since it is a significant non-cash item. 
Transition bonus accrual: (£1.4 million)
In March 2016, the Board agreed revised interim remuneration arrangements with the Group’s investment managers in 
relation to their variable compensation. Part of this agreement involved moving the basis of the bonus calculation from 
being based on billed revenue to earned revenue. This has resulted in the Group bringing forward the recognition of 
bonuses on revenues that were accrued but not yet billed as at 31 March 2016.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Dilapidations: (£0.8 million)
On 25 April 2016 the Group entered into a lease agreement for 47,000 sq ft of office space at 55 Bishopsgate, London. 
The new offices will allow the Group to consolidate a number of its London office locations, including staff currently based 
at 131 Finsbury Pavement, London, into a central site, and decommission peripheral London offices nearing the end of their 
existing leases. As a consequence, a review was carried out of the dilapidations payments due under the existing leases 
in London which might otherwise have been extended, resulting in an accelerated charge of £0.8 million recognised in 
the year. 
Exceptional professional fees: (£0.8 million)
The Group incurred professional fees of £0.5 million on the £16.3 million placing for cash undertaken in April 2015 and of 
£0.3 million in relation to the disposal of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited. Since both of these transactions were 
one-off in nature, their costs have been excluded from the Core Business profit. 
Impairment of intangibles: (£0.4 million)
Further to the exchange of contracts for the disposal of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions, which completed on 1 April 2016, 
the Board reviewed and impaired the goodwill associated with this company by £0.4 million. 
Profit on disposal of Matterley Undervalued Assets Fund: £0.2 million
In December 2015 the Group received further and final deferred consideration of £0.2 million in relation to the sale of the 
Matterley Undervalued Assets Fund to Miton Group which had completed in September 2014. 
Defined benefit pension scheme credit: £0.8 million
During the year, the Group changed the basis of calculating the future benefits augmentation allowance on its defined 
benefit pension scheme from that aligned to the Retail Price Index (RPI) to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This change 
was done so as to bring the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme in accordance with recently introduced government 
legislation and in line with industry best practice. The switch to using CPI when indexing future pension payments at the 
balance sheet date resulted in a one-off credit of £1.7 million recognised in the profit and loss account. This credit was 
partially offset by a loss on curtailment of £0.9 million arising from closing the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme 
to future service accruals during the year. Accordingly, the net credit to the profit and loss account of £0.8 million arising 
from these one-off events is being added back to arrive at a normalised pension service cost run rate.
Taxation
The Group reported a loss before tax of £0.3 million during the year which resulted in a negligible tax credit being recognised.  
A full reconciliation of the tax charge on continuing activities is provided in note 13 of the financial statements.
Earnings/(loss) per share
The reported loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2016 was 0.61 pence compared with a loss of 13.46 pence for 2015. 
The Core Business earnings per share increased by 22.6% to 6.90 pence (2015: 5.63p).
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 3.5 pence per share. Taken together with the interim dividend paid of 1.5 pence 
per share, this results in a total dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016 of 5.0 pence per share (2015: 5.0 pence per share) 
or £2.5 million (2015: £2.3 million). The recommended final dividend of 3.5 pence per share is subject to shareholders’ 
approval, which will be sought at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 29 July 2016. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016

Divisional review
The Group’s wealth management services are provided through the four Core Business divisions: Investment Management 
Services, Asset Management, Financial Planning and Charles Stanley Direct. The services provided by each division are set 
out on page 11.
Charles Stanley Securities, the Group’s corporate broking business, and Charles Stanley Financial Solutions, which provided 
employee benefits services, were both held for sale during the year. The sale of Charles Stanley Securities was completed in 
July 2015 to Panmure Gordon and Charles Stanley Financial Solutions was sold to its management team in April 2016.

Investment Management Services
The financial performance of the Investment Management Services division is largely driven by the value and mix of FuMA, 
the revenue margin earned on these assets (which is expressed as a basis point return) and the operating costs associated 
with managing them which comprise both variable and fixed costs. Changes in key performance indicators for the division 
are shown below.

The fi rst table on the previous page shows the change in the division’s FuMA for the fi nancial year. The main reason for
the overall decline was negative investment performance, which was broadly in line with the fall in the market of 3.5%
as measured by the WMA Balanced Index. Another reason for the decrease has been low levels of net organic new infl ows 
and the lack of acquisitions (of companies or of new investment managers) during the year, historically an important 
engine of growth. During the past 24 months we have also closed and consolidated a number of regional offi ces,
leading to some reductions in FuMA. 
Measures are being taken to bring greater focus on to attracting new infl ows. In particular, the Group has restructured
the sales and marketing team with the aim of encouraging new clients. The Intermediary Sales team has been reformed
in order to market the Group’s full range of services to independent fi nancial advisers. In addition, the Group’s branding 
and marketing materials have been modernised. 
It has been inappropriate to make any acquisitions while Management has been focused on stabilising the existing 
business. Furthermore, because the Group has been in extensive discussions with its investment management teams
about the basis of their variable remuneration, it has not been possible to provide certainty to teams who might otherwise 
be attracted to join Charles Stanley. It is expected that this will be resolved shortly and that the Group’s autonomous 
investment manager model will, over the longer term, continue to attract high quality investment management teams
to the Group.

The preceding two charts show the five-year trend of client account numbers and FuMA. The long-term trend for the 
Investment Management Services division’s FuMA has been the growth of Managed services, especially Discretionary, 
while Advisory Dealing and, to a lesser extent Execution-only services, have reduced. In the latter instance, some of these 
accounts have moved to the Group’s online service, Charles Stanley Direct.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2016, while the number of Discretionary managed accounts continued to increase 
and funds were able to show some modest growth when compared to the market, all other areas suffered declines. 
The principal reduction was for the Advisory Dealing service where, following completion of a suitability review of all 
client accounts, a number of Advisory Dealing accounts were either closed or had their service reclassified as Execution-only.

Investment Management Services – revenues
The revenues of the Investment Management Services division comprise investment management fees, trading commissions 
and interest earned on client cash balances. Overall revenues decreased 4.3% to £120.0 million in 2016 (2015: £125.4 million). 
This can mainly be attributed to declines in commission income and interest earned. Although fees also decreased, this was 
due to the loss of trail, which fell by £1.2 million compared to 2015, after we completed the conversion of all clients’ fund 
holdings into clean classes during the year.

In December 2015 a new rate card was introduced both to rationalise pre-existing tariffs and to ensure that the division 
charges appropriately for its services. This rate card is being applied to all new clients and is being gradually phased in 
with existing clients. It is expected that this will lead to a steady but gradual improvement of the revenue margin over the 
next 36 months.
Investment Management Services – operating costs
Investment Management Services’ costs declined 2.9% during the year from £115.8 million to £112.4 million. The composition 
of these costs is shown in the table below.

The reduction in costs was mainly due to lower staff costs. An 8.1% reduction in headcount helped to drive a 4.7% reduction 
in fixed staff costs. Variable staff costs were also lower, reflecting the lower levels of income generated and the profitability 
of the division. Other direct expenses, which mainly comprise establishment, IT and communications, and professional fees 
(including the FSCS levy), fell by 11.5%. Allocated costs, which comprise central operational services such as dealing and 
custody operations, support and research, as well as central Management costs, grew 5.7%.
EBS Management PLC (EBS)
EBS, the Group’s pension administration business, is incorporated within the Investment Management Services division 
alongside the Group’s other administration, custody and ISA services. EBS had another successful year, growing the number 
of schemes it administers from 10,220 to 12,737 and revenues by 20.8% to £2.9 million (2015: £2.4 million).
Outlook for the Investment Management Services division
As has been previously mentioned, the Group has been in prolonged discussions with its investment management teams 
about the method of computation and scale of their variable remuneration arrangements. Resolving this is viewed by the 
Board as a key component to improving the Group’s profitability, along with growing Funds under Management and 
streamlining other costs. Although a long-term agreement has not yet been finalised, interim arrangements were agreed 
with the majority of investment managers during March 2016 and took effect from 1 April 2016. These are expected to lead 
to a reduction in variable compensation as a proportion of revenue in the 2017 financial period. As part of this interim 
agreement, variable remuneration is now being paid on the basis of revenues and profits when they arise rather than when 
they are billed. This led to a one-off exceptional charge of £1.4 million being taken in the financial year ended 31 March 2016, 
representing the acceleration of the timing of recognition of variable remuneration payable.
In addition to resolving the reward arrangements for the long term, a key challenge the Group faces is how to create 
efficiencies and streamline its front office support and mid and back office processes, both to be able to reduce the 
cost base and to introduce a greater degree of variability to it. The Group has a number of workstreams focused on 
trying to achieve this and a target of reducing non-payroll costs as a proportion of revenues by 7.5% over the next 
three years.
Asset Management
The Asset Management division was formed during the year to bring together a number of complementary specialist 
Investment Management Services that had previously operated independent of one another within the Group. These 
activities include investment research covering asset allocation, active and passive fund selection, equities and bonds; 
the management of active and passive Open-ended Investment Companies, model portfolios and centralised investment 
portfolios; and Inheritance Tax services. 
Asset Management’s performance is driven by Funds under Management and the revenue margin earned on these assets.
Year-on-year changes in key performance indicators for the division are shown below.

Asset Management – fi nancial performance
The fi nancial performance of the Asset Management division is detailed in the table below. The division made strong 
progress during the year growing both Funds under Management and revenues whilst controlling costs in the process, 
reducing its operating loss signifi cantly to £1.0 million (2015: £2.1 million). In addition the division generated an exceptional 
profi t on sale of £0.2 million, being the fi nal deferred consideration received from the sale of the FP Matterley Undervalued
Asset Fund.

Asset Management’s overall costs were reduced by 9.7% during the year, although its direct costs before allocations, 
increased marginally by 3.0%. The positive movement in allocated costs is due to a full recharge of investment research 
services to the rest of the Group as compared to a partial one within the prior year.

During the year, the decision was taken to close the FP Matterley Bond Fund which was launched in May 2015 but never 
gained critical mass. The division’s costs for the year include approximately £0.5 million relating to that fund which will 
not be incurred going forward. 
Outlook for the Asset Management division
In order to rationalise and simplify our offering for all Charles Stanley clients, the Asset Management division will gradually 
phase out the various sub-brands currently used, such as Matterley, Pan Asset and the Collective Portfolio Service. This will 
take place over the next 24 months and be phased to coincide with a rationalisation of service providers and regulatory 
notice requirements.
Other initiatives being undertaken by the Asset Management division include reviewing the possibility of introducing a 
range of multi-asset OEIC funds to provide a cost- and tax-efficient service to smaller clients; escalating the marketing 
efforts behind the division’s market-leading fiduciary management solution for smaller defined benefit pension schemes; 
and a continued focus on cost control as the consolidation of the various activities which now form the Asset Management 
division is still at a relatively early stage. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016

Financial Planning
The Financial Planning division was also reorganised out of what had been the Financial Services division. Additionally, 
the management team was reformed and all the financial planners within the Group were brought under its leadership 
and direction. The objective of these changes has been to give the division its own focus, introduce common reporting, 
standardise processes and improve control.
The division provides financial planning and advice and its financial performance is driven by the number of financial 
planners it has and their revenues per capita. Year-on-year changes in key performance indicators for the division are 
shown below.

The financial performance of the Financial Planning division is detailed in the table below. The division grew revenues by 
5.3%, predominantly through the increase of financial planning and investment management fees by 27.9% and 18.8% 
respectively, which more than offset the cessation of historical trail commission arrangements.

The increase in direct costs arose due to employment costs increasing 9.4% to £4.0 million (2015: £3.6 million), while the 
main contributors to the increase in allocated costs were Compliance, Marketing and Management charges. 
Outlook for the Financial Planning division
It is intended to establish Financial Planning as a core element of the Group’s wealth management services and to increase 
materially the instances in which both financial planning and investment management services are provided to a client. 
The new management team is already implementing strategies to drive business development within the division, 
including the recruitment of additional financial planners while improving productivity via enhancements made to 
operating processes utilised to transact and process business. It is anticipated that the benefit of these strategies will 
positively impact the results of the division. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Charles Stanley Direct
Charles Stanley Direct provides direct-to-client online share and fund dealing services and, up until February 2016, provided 
equity trading platform services to the Fidelity fund network. Following termination of these arrangements, many of these 
Fidelity clients were successfully migrated on to the Charles Stanley Direct platform in consideration for a two year revenue 
share agreement with Fidelity. 
The division also encompasses the business of Garrison Investment Analysis, based in Beverley, Yorkshire, providing 
Execution-only services for an extensive range of products including ISAs, Unit Trusts, Pensions and Venture Capital Trusts.
Charles Stanley Direct’s financial performance is driven by the value of fund assets on which a platform fee is charged and 
by the number of commission-earning bargains undertaken by clients, which in turn tend to be correlated to the value of 
non-fund holdings on the platform. Year-on-year changes in key performance indicators for the division are shown below:

Fees increased 1.6% to £3.3 million (2015: £3.2 million) despite the loss of £0.3 million of trail. Dealing commission was flat at 
£0.9 million (2015: £0.9 million) and interest turn declined, down 20.7% to £0.6 million (2015: £0.8 million). 
Although it did not impact the 2016 numbers materially, the Fidelity contract ended in February. While many of these assets 
have been transferred on to the Charles Stanley Direct platform, we do not expect to earn the same level of revenue from 
these going forward.
The main story during 2016 was the division’s management team addressing the cost base. Direct costs were reduced from 
£4.8 million to £2.8 million, achieved by reducing employment costs by £0.7 million, marketing by £0.4 million, professional 
fees by £0.1 million, and IT, communications and market data by £0.3 million. Cost allocations increased from £2.5 million to 
£3.4 million leading to overall costs reducing 15.0% to £6.2 million.
Outlook for Charles Stanley Direct
Charles Stanley Direct’s management’s immediate focus is on delivering an enhanced mobile-optimised website and APP 
while streamlining back-end functionality, with the goal of increased efficiencies around the division as well as driving 
top-line growth through more targeted and diverse digital marketing. Simultaneously, the management team is 
investigating ways of making the revised OEIC range available to retail clients, and is considering revisions to the current 
rate card in order to target underserved areas of the retail market. 
Financial position
Charles Stanley & Co. Limited (CSC), the Group’s main operating subsidiary, is an IFPRU 125K Limited Licence firm regulated 
by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The consolidated regulatory capital position is shown as though the Group was 
subject to the same regime.
At 31 March 2016, the Group had regulatory capital resources of £56.9 million as shown in the table below: 
 
Group – capital adequacy
2016
£000
2015
£000
Total tier 1 capital resources 56,963 37,730
FCA capital requirement 37,710 35,292
Capital adequacy ratio 151% 107%
The Group monitors a range of capital and liquidity statistics on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
The Group’s internal risk appetite is to maintain capital levels of at least 125% of the regulatory capital requirement. 
The Group’s capital position was strengthened following the capital-raising in April 2015, and the Group continues 
to monitor capital levels carefully. The Group maintained a surplus of regulatory capital at all times during the financial 
year ended 31 March 2016. 
As required under FCA rules, the Group maintains an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which includes 
performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group 
needs to hold. The last review of the ICAAP conducted and signed off by the Board was in October 2015. Capital forecasts 
are performed monthly and take into account expected dividends and intangible asset acquisitions and disposals as well 
as expected trading results.
The Group’s Pillar III disclosures are published annually on the Group’s website (charles-stanley.co.uk) and provide further 
details about regulatory capital resources and requirements. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Intangible assets
Intangible assets arise principally from acquired Funds under Management and are categorised as client relationships. 
Goodwill arises on consolidation. At 31 March 2016, the total carrying value of intangible assets was £26.5 million 
(2015: £29.2 million). This figure includes £1.1 million (2015: £3.0 million) disclosed as held for sale assets. During the year 
£0.6 million in customer relationships and £1.9 million of internally generated software were capitalised. No goodwill was 
acquired during the year nor in 2015.
Client relationship intangibles are amortised over the estimated useful life of the client relationship – 10 years. Goodwill 
arising from business combinations is not amortised, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Following this review 
impairment charges have been allocated against goodwill, including £0.4 million in respect of Charles Stanley Financial 
Solutions Limited. Further details on the Group’s intangibles are provided in note 15 of the financial statements.
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which has been closed to new members for several years and which 
closed to future accruals on 31 March 2016. Each year actuarial valuations are carried out based on the position at 31 March. 
During the year, the scheme deficit fell to £10.1 million at 31 March 2016 (2015: £13.1 million). The valuation takes into account 
more prudent longevity assumptions and, following formal communication to the members, the basis of benefit 
augmentation has been changed from being aligned to the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index. 
Further details on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme and the assumptions underpinning the valuation are 
provided in note 10 of the financial statements.
Cash at bank
In April 2015, the Group raised £16.3 million (£15.8 million net of expenses) through a placing for cash to strengthen the 
Group’s regulatory capital resources. This primarily accounted for the increase in the Group’s cash resources to £48.1 million 
at 31 March 2016 (2015: £28.5 million). During the year, the Group repaid in full the £1.9 million mortgage it had outstanding 
against its disaster recovery centre in Chelmsford.
Risk targets have been set to help the Group monitor its bank balances as noted in the Risk management and principal 
risks section.  Strategic report / Risk management and principal risks
Risk management and principal risks
Charles Stanley’s approach to risk management is 
documented in the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), 
which is reviewed, challenged and approved by the 
Board on an annual basis. The RAS is a core component 
of the Group’s risk management framework and was 
developed taking into consideration the Group’s strategic 
objectives, strategy and business plans. This new level of 
RAS articulation is driving the implementation of more 
robust risk monitoring and risk reporting processes, 
which continue to evolve.
As the Group implements these processes, the Board will 
periodically review the RAS to ensure that it continues to 
reflect the risk appetite of the Group.
The RAS sets out the Group’s tolerance to various types 
of risk and includes both quantitative and qualitative 
measures against which management and the Board 
monitor risk on a periodic basis.
Set out below is the Directors’ viability statement covering 
the three years to 31 March 2019, which is then followed with 
an assessment of the principal risks relevant to the Group’s 
long-term performance.
Viability statement
In accordance with the revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the 
Group over the three-year period from 31 March 2016 to 
31 March 2019. The assessment of the Group’s viability 
over a three-year time period is in alignment with the 
Group’s strategy, budgeting process and the scenarios 
set out in the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP). 
Over the past 18 months the Group began to undertake 
a significant business restructure as described in the 
Our strategy report. The Directors consider a three-year 
time horizon appropriate as it is most meaningful in 
planning the Group’s new long-term strategy, as a five-year 
horizon stretches forecasting inputs and assumptions 
beyond a realistic threshold. 
Peter Kelk
Chief Risk Officer
The Group’s risk management 
framework is a fundamental 
component of the Group’s operating 
model and embedded across all 
processes and controls. The Chief 
Risk Officer, under the supervision 
of the Risk Committee, has the 
principal responsibility for risk 
awareness, monitoring and 
management across all areas 
of the business.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 39
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The Board is responsible for the oversight and management 
of the principal risks to which the Group is exposed. It manages 
these risks by: 
• Overseeing the processes and procedures to monitor and 
mitigate the principal risks
• Reviewing high level monthly management information 
from key departments which monitor whether the Group 
is operating within the parameters set out in the risk 
appetite Statement linked to the principal risks
• Deciding the appropriate actions if any of the Group’s risk 
appetites are breached. 
On a detailed level, extensive management information is 
analysed by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee 
(ERM) which meets monthly and oversees operational risk 
across the Group by:
• Monitoring quantitative and qualitative management 
information across the Group to highlight areas of risk 
which require enhanced or additional controls
• Delegating to the appropriate Committees any issues 
raised as part of the management information which 
require further action
• Carrying out annual ‘deep dive’ risk analysis of key 
departments which are discussed by the Committee 
and the department heads
• Reviewing the reports of the internal and external auditors 
concerning systems and controls, reviewing the resolution 
of proposed control enhancements and monitoring any 
remaining open issues.
The Board’s Risk Committee has oversight of the above 
processes, ensuring that the monitoring and escalation 
procedures are operating effectively and completed 
in a timely manner. 
The Board reviews and challenges the Group’s three-year 
strategic plan against the principal risks at least annually, 
stress testing the base case projections by applying multiple 
shock events. These stresses have been derived from 
workshops attended by senior management with the use 
of external events to substantiate the Board’s assessment 
that the shock events are sufficiently severe and appropriate.
Based on the results of the latest stress test the Board 
believes that, by taking the projected management actions 
to reduce expenditure and dividends, the Group’s business 
model is resilient and it holds sufficient capital to survive a 
range of severe but plausible stressed situations. As required 
by the FCA, events significantly more severe than the 
stresses used in this assessment are modelled in the Group’s 
wind-down scenarios and are included in the Group’s 
assessment of its capital adequacy.
As the regulatory environment remains subject to 
ongoing change and enhancements, the Group holds a 
significant amount of capital above the FCA regulatory 
requirement calculated in the Group’s ICAAP which is 
owned by the Board. 
Given the extensive controls and procedures in place, 
the Directors are of the opinion that it is reasonable to 
conclude that the Group has sufficient resources to meet 
its obligations and continue business operations over the 
assessed three-year period. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016

Financial
Financial risk
Failing to maintain financial strength in order to support 
business objectives, meet regulatory capital requirements, 
and provide shareholders with an acceptable return.
To achieve our financial goals the following limits have 
been set:
• Return on equity – 4%
• Cash balances – £25m
• Regulatory capital – 125% of the requirement 
and pension risk
• Dividend cover – 2x earnings per ordinary share. 
These are monitored by the Board on a regular basis.
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements 
directly through its variable rate assets and liabilities. 
This is tracked by reporting on exposure levels at the 
Treasury Committee, which also considers levels of fixed 
rate assets and liabilities.
Credit and counterparty risk
The potential failure of clients or counterparties to fulfil 
their contractual obligations. 
The Group’s Treasury Committee is responsible for the initial 
assessment and ongoing monitoring of deposit-taking 
counterparties. The following criteria govern how the 
Group’s credit and counterparty risk is managed:
• Assets will only be placed and maintained with 
counterparties deemed to be financially sound
• Client and Group cash held at any individual counterparty 
should not exceed its respective limit set by the Treasury 
Committee unless written approval has been provided
• Counterparty limits for the purpose of trading are set by 
the Market Exposure Committee (MEC)
• Counterparties with no set trading limits should be 
assessed on an individual basis at the time of the trade 
by the MEC
• Breaches of any counterparty trading limits without 
approval must be escalated immediately to the MEC. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Market risk
Risk of losses arising as a result of exposure to market 
movements, including foreign exchange and interest rates.
• Charles Stanley does not undertake any proprietary 
trading other than that arising from incidental dealing 
errors and therefore takes minimal market risk. 
Losses in relation to dealing errors are captured 
as operational losses 
• A majority of the Group’s cash is kept in GBP across a 
number of banks. Limited foreign currency is only held 
to facilitate settlement and dealing activity on behalf of 
clients. The Treasury Committee manages the Group’s 
account balances both in GBP and foreign currencies to 
our requirements and limits exposures to the Group’s 
operational needs.
Pension risk
Risk of pension obligations exceeding the assets set 
aside to cover them.
Charles Stanley continues to support a defined benefit 
pension scheme which accordingly exposes the Group 
to pension risk. The scheme is closed to new members 
and is regularly reviewed for viability. Deficit levels 
are monitored regularly and stand at £10.1 million  
at 31 March 2016. During the course of the 2016 financial 
year the scheme was closed to future accruals. The Group 
is working closely with the trustees of the scheme to 
reduce the deficit and, where possible, match investments 
with future liabilities.
Liquidity
The risk that the Group, although solvent, does not have 
available sufficient financial resources to enable it to meet 
its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure such 
resources at excessive cost.
The Group’s liquidity risk is overwhelmingly short-term in 
nature and arises predominantly from the settlement of 
trades within the stockbroking business. The Treasury 
Committee operates within strict policies and procedures 
approved by the Board to manage the Group’s risk. 
These include:
• The Group ensuring that all legal entities have 
sufficient funds to meet their liabilities as they fall due, 
with surplus cash transferred on a monthly basis to 
Charles Stanley & Co. Ltd. The Group will ensure that 
it has overdraft or standby facilities if the Committee 
considers them necessary to meet liabilities
• Utilising financial instruments. These include 
borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various 
items including trade debtors and trade creditors that 
arise directly from its operations. The credit quality of 
counterparties is reviewed frequently and we limit 
aggregate credit exposures accordingly. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016

Operational
Operational risk 
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and 
systems or from external events. The Group operates 
in a business environment that is subject to significant 
technological, regulatory, and economic changes. 
Insurance cover is in place and is reviewed on an annual 
basis to ensure there is an appropriate amount of cover 
to manage the impact of operational losses against our 
capital reserves. The Group records and monitors 
operational losses and near misses. Management is 
required to notify the Board of all individual operational 
incidents leading to an operational loss greater than 
£10,000. Furthermore, while accepting that operational 
losses are inevitable, management regularly report to the 
Board in relation to the total dealing and trading losses.
These should not exceed £100,000 in any 12-month rolling 
period, while the volume of these errors should not exceed 
0.5% of total bargains placed in any given month.
Fraud risk
Fraud includes, but is not limited to, incidents such as 
the following: external cyber-attacks, identity fraud 
and broker fraud. 
The Group operates a number of IT platforms with 
controls in place designed to prevent cyber-attacks, 
phishing or similar malware attacks. While the Group has 
no appetite for any fraud-related incident, it recognises 
that certain attempts at fraud (that is, those relating to 
external fraud) may be outside of its control. Consequently, 
specific risk parameters in relation to fraud are in place 
which drive monitoring and reporting to the Board:
• The Board should be made aware of all instances of 
internal fraud attempts (whether successful or not) 
and any incidents
• The Board should be made aware of any unusual 
(but unsuccessful) external fraud attempts, as well 
as all successful attempts.
Charles Stanley is part of a cross-industry effort to combat 
fraudulent activity. Data-sharing initiatives have provided 
us with valuable intelligence to assist us in protecting our 
franchise and our clients. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Financial crime risk
Financial crime risk is the risk of reduction in earnings 
and/or value through the financial or reputational loss 
associated with financial crime and failure to comply with 
related regulatory obligations. These losses may include 
censure, fines or the cost of litigation. This includes risks 
associated with money laundering, market abuse, 
sanctions breaches, fraud, bribery and adverse media 
through monitoring of the client base.
The Compliance Committee serves as the principal 
forum for reviewing and challenging the management 
of financial crime risk, including overall strategy and 
performance, as well as engagement with financial crime 
authorities. The Committee is accountable for ensuring 
that, at Group level, financial crime risks are effectively 
identified and managed within risk appetite, and that 
strategies for financial crime prevention are effectively 
coordinated and implemented across the CS Group.
People risk
The risk that the loss of personnel can have a significant 
impact on the Group from an operational, reputational, 
and financial perspective.
The Group recognises that its reputation and financial 
success is dependent on the performance of its people. 
Charles Stanley personnel establish and maintain close 
relationships with our clients, hence the loss of key 
personnel can have a significant impact on the Group.
Historically Charles Stanley has had low levels of staff 
turnover, but key departures may be symptomatic of 
more fundamental issues within the organisation that 
require attention. These would consequently trigger a 
formal exit review assessment.
Reputational risk
Reputational damage could lead to a loss of existing client 
base, possibly resulting in financial loss.
The Group has built a reputation as a high quality 
provider of wealth management services. This has been 
carefully developed over many years and as such there 
is an emphasis on maintaining this status. The risk is 
monitored and managed by our emphasis on compliance 
with all aspects of relevant regulations, including those of 
the FCA. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016

Compliance
Customer outcome risk
Risk of treating customers unfairly or achieving an 
undesirable outcome. 
All clients are risk profiled to ensure we clearly define, 
agree and manage our clients’ portfolios in accordance 
with these risk profiles and investment objectives.
Suitability is a major focus for the Group which has quality 
assurance processes in place to assess suitability reviews 
performed by our investment managers. Careful monitoring 
of investment decision-making against the risk profile 
helps to ensure we achieve appropriate and suitable 
outcomes. We measure these outcomes in a number 
of ways including: 
• Number and nature of complaints
• Internal client suitability file reviews 
• Customer surveys.
Regulatory risk
The risk of breaching, or non-compliance with, regulations 
and restrictions enforced on the industry and the Group, 
resulting in regulatory censure and/or fines.
Charles Stanley operates in the heavily-regulated financial 
services sector and compliance with regulations is 
paramount to the Group. Management monitors 
developments in regulation, assesses the impact on 
the business, and implements changes required to meet 
those requirements and ensure that the Group’s capital 
levels meet or exceed regulatory requirements. Periodic 
reviews are conducted internally to reduce the likelihood 
of significant regulatory breaches which could result in 
regulatory censure or fines.
Conduct risk
Employees and associates whose conduct is 
contrary to the Group’s standards, resulting in 
losses due to, but not limited to, regulatory fines 
and reputational damage. 
The Group’s conduct starts with the ‘tone at the top’ 
which is reflected in the standard of conduct which 
employees and associates hold themselves to. Conduct 
risk has been a major theme across the financial services 
industry and drives to the heart of everything we do.
In order to evidence good conduct, the Board has 
established a governance framework flowing down to 
the Board Committees and management processes which 
are designed to ensure that appropriate controls, checks, 
and balances are in place, with safety valves where 
decisions and processes can be challenged.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk

Strategic
Acquisition/Divestment risk
The risk that Acquisitions/Divestments bring about 
unexpected losses, or threaten the Group’s current 
financial or reputational position.
Although Charles Stanley currently has no acquisition 
plans, the Group may be subject to acquisition-related 
risks in the future. As the Group restructures around its 
core wealth management strategy, certain peripheral 
activities and teams may be divested. 
Proposed acquisitions should offer immediate and 
sustainable increases in the Group’s market share in 
local or national markets, have acceptable execution 
risks associated with them, and allow the Group to 
maintain prudent levels of liquidity and capital. A number 
of specific quantitative and qualitative parameters are 
used to assess the appropriateness of potential new 
acquisitions and divestments:
• Target operational cash break-even point should not 
be expected to exceed 18 months 
• The number of ‘significant’ acquisitions should generally 
not exceed three deals per 18 months
• The target company should not be involved in any 
potential, or existing, litigation which Charles Stanley 
management consider to be unmanageable or which 
could impact on the Charles Stanley reputation and/or 
acquisition criteria
• Divestments should fit the Group’s strategy and aim to 
maximise the P&L impact while reducing the Group’s 
capital requirements. In particular, attention should be 
paid to any long-term risks and liabilities which might 
remain after the divestment. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 46

Corporate social responsibility report
As a financial services organisation, our primary 
responsibility is to maximise investment returns to 
our clients in accordance with our contractual relationships.
However, we continue to recognise the non-financial 
considerations that are taken into account in the running 
of our business and the wider network of stakeholders 
to whom the Group has a responsibility. For this reason, 
the Directors and senior managers within the Group 
are committed to ensuring the Group interacts 
responsibly with its employees, clients, shareholders 
and the wider environment.
Each year we report on our aim to develop our CSR Policy 
and practices in our four key areas: business integrity, 
our people, the community and the environment. The CSR 
Committee meets biannually to review and develop policy 
in each of these areas.
This is the tenth annual corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) report 
for the Group. The implementation 
and management of the CSR Policy 
is recognised as a Group-wide 
responsibility and this report, 
made over the last 12 months,

Corporate governance
We follow the corporate governance guidelines contained in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council and annexed to the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
We ensure that, where practical, the Group complies with 
the Code or, where it has not done so, explains why this is 
the case. We compete fairly in the markets in which we 
operate and believe in the concept of business transparency 
and ethical behaviour. More details can be found in the 
Corporate Governance report on page 58.
The Group is an inaugural corporate member of the 
Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment (CISI)

Fairly, from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
We work with our clients to ensure our relationships deliver 
investment performance, protection from inappropriate risk 
and communications that are clear, fair and not misleading.
Disclosure
All Charles Stanley staff are expected to conduct business 
in such a way as to enhance the Group’s reputation and to 
safeguard against unfair or unethical business practices. 
Our disclosure policy (concerning instances of whistleblowing) 
is monitored and enforced where necessary. Conscious of 
our obligations under the Bribery Act 2010 and other 
associated rules and Regulations, we take a zero tolerance 
approach to bribery and corruption. We carry out periodic 
risk assessments to determine exposure to the possibility of 
these risks and update our policies and procedures to 
mitigate them. We have strict Anti-Bribery and Gifts and 
Hospitality policies in place, which are reviewed regularly, 
as well as High Level Principles for Procurement. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 48

People
The Group acknowledges that the reputation and success 
of Charles Stanley is due to the services provided to clients 
by highly qualified and committed staff. Our staff are one 
of the key assets of the organisation and it is our policy 
to attract and retain the best people from diverse 
backgrounds and cultures, to create a vibrant working 
environment that thrives on new ideas and creative thinking.
Employee involvement
Charles Stanley recognises the importance of ensuring that 
staff are kept informed of the latest developments within the 
business and our internal public relations team provides 
regular email updates on all major events or initiatives.
Our interactive intranet site is constantly updated and 
staff have the opportunity to make suggestions via the 
‘suggestion box’ feature. We try to consult with staff on 
any occasion where we feel that their interests may be 
affected and we arrange forums for discussion between 
staff and senior management. All staff must participate  
in the appraisal system and dialogue with line managers 
is actively encouraged.
To enable staff to become involved in the financial 
performance of the Group, participation in the Charles 
Stanley Save As You Earn Scheme (SAYE Scheme) and/or 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP) is encouraged. These schemes 
are open to all employees (with the exception of Sir David 
Howard, Bridget Guerin, David Pusinelli and Andrew Didham) 
with good take-up for both schemes. SIP membership for 
2016 was 23.8% (2015: 22.5%). A new SAYE Scheme is 
launched each year, and 34.5% of all eligible staff now 
participate in at least one SAYE scheme.
Training
The Group continues to meet its business objectives 
by having a highly trained and professional workforce. 
We have a dedicated learning and development 
department to ensure that our training policy, 
designed to invest in staff, provides for career 
development and allows for succession planning.
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is recognised as 
an important part of staff development. All FCA-authorised 
staff who provide retail advice to clients hold a Statement of 
Professional Standing (SPS) in line with the FCA’s requirements. 
This means they adhere to the CISI Code of Conduct and, 
FCA Statements of Principle and Code of Practice for 
Approved Persons (APER) requirement and must achieve 
their CPD requirement each year.
Similarly, staff who are not FCA-authorised are encouraged 
to gain appropriate professional qualifications for their roles 
and are required to undertake sufficient and relevant 
continuing professional development to ensure that 
their skills are up to date. Our interactive learning and 
development website provides great access to materials 
and resources, enabling career progression.
Benefits
The flexible benefits system called ‘Choice’ continues to be 
a success. Choice is an intranet access application which 
allows staff to self-select benefits which match their lifestyle. 
The Choice system has proved popular, with 59% (2015: 79%) 
of all employees participating in one or more flexible benefits.
The benefits currently included in the Choice system 
are smart pension exchange, Denplan, charitable 
give-as-you-earn, extra death in service life cover, childcare 
vouchers, the ability to acquire additional annual leave, 
a mobile phone scheme and cancer screening. We have 
also introduced some new benefits for 2016 including a 
will writing scheme and additional discount cards. All these 
benefits offer savings through salary sacrifice. The Choice 
benefits are in addition to the standard benefits we provide 
for all our employees including interest-free season 
ticket loans, above average contributions to pensions, 
private medical insurance, permanent health insurance 
and death in service benefits.
To ensure the health and wellbeing of our workforce we 
also provide subsidised gym membership in London and 
a Ride-2-Work Scheme that allows employees to purchase 
bicycles at a reduced cost for the purpose of commuting.
The Group provides an employee assistance programme, 
First Assist, which offers a confidential helpline providing 
advice on a wide range of health and wellbeing issues.
We also provide access to dedicated medical facilities in 
the London offices including health screening. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 49

Disabled employees
Applications for employment made by disabled persons 
are given full and fair consideration, having regard to the 
particular aptitudes and abilities of the applicant. In the 
event of employees becoming disabled, the Group 
makes every effort to ensure the individuals’ continuing 
employment within the Group through the provision of 
suitable equipment and arranging appropriate training 
as necessary. The Group ensures that, so far as is possible, 
the training, career development and promotion of disabled 
employees are identical to that of other staff members.
Ethos
Charles Stanley believes in supporting the work/life balance of 
all of our employees. We do not expect our employees to work 
excessive or unnecessary hours and we provide childcare 
vouchers and the possibility of flexible working hours.
In addition to the above we also have policies in place 
to ensure that all employees can expect a working 
environment free from discrimination and harassment. 
We believe in informing and involving our employees and 
we consistently strive to improve our staff retention rates. 
Staff losses were 19.12% (2015: 11.35%), with gains of 13.68% 
(2015: 17.52%).
The Company is a Living Wage employer, having made 
a commitment to meet the living wage for all staff and 
principal contractors who work on the premises.
Diversity policy
Equality of respect and recognition is central to how we 
treat each other at Charles Stanley and to how we treat 
all of those with whom we do business. The Group 
recognises the value of a diverse and skilled workforce 
and of maintaining an inclusive and collaborative 
workplace culture that will engender sustainability 
and excellence of service to our clients.
The Group has a clearly defined diversity policy which is 
reflected in our recruitment processes, flexible working 
options and equal opportunities policy. The Group has 
a strong commitment to ensuring that all our staff meet 
our high standards; a key factor in this is making sure 
that employees are selected from the widest pool of 
talent possible.
Currently approximately 33.33% of our trainees are 
female and, while not imposing any form of discrimination, 
we continued to try to raise this proportion over the year 
to 40%.
The Group is aware of the European Commission 
recommendations on gender diversity and acknowledges 
that Boards perform better when they include people 
of different backgrounds, skill sets and perspectives. 
On 31 March 2016, women make up 40.6% of all Charles 
Stanley employees, 11% of the Board is female and 25% 
of the Non-executive Directors are female (above the 
European Commission’s recommendation).
While we believe that we are successful in implementing 
our diversity policy, we acknowledge that the diversity 
of our workforce can always improve and we are embarking 
on new initiatives to encourage it.
Our staff are one of the key assets 
of the organisation and it is our 
policy to attract and retain the best 
people from diverse backgrounds 
and cultures, to create a vibrant 
working environment that thrives 
on new ideas and creative thinking. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 50
Strategic report / Corporate social responsibility report
Community
The Group continues to foster strong relationships with the 
communities in which we are based and we have links with 
local businesses, primary schools and charities. We are a 
socially responsible employer and aim to make a positive 
contribution, both locally and nationally, as a sustainable 
and responsible business leader.
Schools
One of our stronger community links continues to be with 
Lawdale Primary School which is co-ordinated by the 
Tower Hamlets Business Education Partnership. Since 2007 
a group of London-based employees volunteer to visit the 
school on a weekly basis to assist the children with their 
reading. The school has confirmed that the pupils on the 
scheme improved their reading and comprehension at 
double the rate of those who are not part of any scheme. 
Charles Stanley is keen to have a positive impact on the 
local community and continues to develop initiatives for 
local involvement.
Charities
Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity was chosen 
by a staff vote to be the Charles Stanley Charity of the Year 
for 2015/16. This charity raises money to provide world-class 
care for the hospital’s young patients and their families by 
contributing to the rebuilding and refurbishment of the 
hospital, supporting groundbreaking research and 
providing accommodation for parents.
Through the hard work and generosity of Charles Stanley’s 
staff, £38,904.75 was raised for this charity. Some of the 
money raised was used to buy a ventilator and the 
remaining money donated to help fund everyday needs 
of Great Ormond Street Hospital. 
Our Charity of the Year for 2016/17, again chosen by popular 
vote, is The Head and Neck Cancer Foundation (HNCF). 
HNCF is a young, independent British charity, which is small 
compared to the usual cancer charity giants. It is run by 
an active board of trustees that include world-renowned 
surgeons. They target fundraising carefully so that money 
can be spent where it is needed most: on patient treatment. 
We anticipate another successful year of fundraising.
In addition to our Charity of the Year, the Group is committed 
to sponsoring individual staff members who are taking part 
in fundraising for charity. There are also various charity 
events held throughout the year across our branch network.
The Group also offers employees the facility to 
give-as-you-earn in a tax efficient manner via the 
Charities Aid Foundation.
Environment
The Group continues to recognise its impact on the 
environment and takes steps to minimise it. Although 
our activities have only a comparatively small impact, 
Charles Stanley is aware that environmental risks and 
uncertainties impact to some extent on all companies.
Health and safety
The Group is committed to providing a working 
environment that meets and exceeds the required health 
and safety standards. All our staff have access to and are 
encouraged to practise the Health and Safety Policy. The 
Policy is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis, taking 
into account any changes in the law, and staff are notified 
of any changes that are made. In the past year, the Group 
has introduced an interactive health and safety training 
portal, which ensures staff are inducted in, and are regularly 
reminded of, current Health and Safety Regulations and  
our Policy.
Greenhouse gas emission report
This report details Charles Stanley’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions for the 12 months ending 31 March 2016.
Using an operational approach the Group identified all of 
the activities and facilities for which it is responsible that 
generate carbon emissions and reported on the material 
GHG emissions. Scopes 1 and 2 activity data were identified 
and collected and provided to independent consultant, 
EnStrat (UK) Ltd. The validity and completeness of the data 
were checked both in-house and by Enstrat (UK) Ltd and 
were used to calculate the GHG emissions for the Group. 
The calculations performed follow the ISO-14064-1:2006 
standard and give absolute and intensity factors for the 
Group’s emissions.
The results show that total gross GHG emissions in the 
period comprised the following:
• Direct Emissions (Scope 1) amounted to 137.8 tonnes of 
CO2e or 7% of Charles Stanley’s total GHG emissions 
(2015: 79.4 tonnes)
• Indirect Emissions (Scope 2) amounted to 1,801.0 tonnes 
of CO2e or 93% of Charles Stanley’s total GHG emissions 
(2015: 2,172.2 tonnes). Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk
Strategic report Governance Financial statements

GHG emissions have been reduced in absolute terms by 14% 
during the year in comparison to 2015. The reduction in 
emissions has been achieved as a result of the ongoing 
focus on reducing energy consumption. At the sites which 
have half hourly electricity reporting, analysis has been 
carried out on the consumption profiles and running times 
ensuring that plant settings have been optimised. Most sites 
also benefit from motion sensor controls to lighting and 
during refurbishments LED light fittings are being introduced 
to further reduce consumption. 
Charles Stanley was classified as a ‘large undertaking’ 
under the Government Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme 
(ESOS) and as such undertook a full review of the Group’s 
energy consumption. The ESOS report firstly confirmed the 
benefit of previous energy saving actions and secondly 
highlighted further opportunities, particularly around the 
energy consumption of data rooms and associated cooling. 
It is estimated that this accounts for approximately 80% of 
all electricity consumption. 
The Group continues to procure all of its electricity from 
‘green’ renewable energy sources.  
Environmental initiatives
The properties with half-hourly reporting electricity meters 
have been monitored and plant running times reduced, 
or plant shut down when not essential, to reduce energy 
consumption and operating energy cost. We assess the 
environmental policy of our principal contractors and aim 
to source products from sustainable suppliers. All our 
marketing and publicity documentation is made from 
sustainably sourced paper and we recycle almost 60% 
of all waste produced in our London offices. We also 
organise specialist recycling of light tubes and batteries. 
Our offices benefit from motion sensor lights which help to 
save energy consumption and operate an automated 
shutdown process which ensures all monitors are switched 
off overnight.
We utilise a software application which allows Board 
and Committee papers to be distributed electronically, 
eliminating the need for printing lengthy Board packs and 
thus saving resources. Our printers include the pull printing 
feature which requires user authentication at the printer 
station in order to retrieve documents. Research shows that 
this methodology significantly reduces the amount of paper 
wasted by unwanted printing, while also increasing security 
and efficiency. Charles Stanley remains committed to 
seeking out new and innovative ways to reduce our 
environmental impact.
Commitment
Charles Stanley continues to run a Ride-2-Work Scheme on 
an annual basis. This not only promotes a healthier lifestyle 
for our employees, but also reduces the environmental 
impact of the journey to work for those employees who take 
part in the scheme. This scheme has been changed so that 
employees can enter at any point during the year. We have 
continued to see a good take-up rate throughout the year.
Charles Stanley continues to build on its efforts to encourage 
recycling at all of our offices, by encouraging all staff to 
separate recyclable waste from general waste. This has 
resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of waste 
being sent to landfill. We recognise that the business saves 
costs and increases efficiency through reducing and 
managing resource use, and that we have a responsibility 
to promote environmentally friendly business practices as 
part of our commitment to the local community and our 
wider network of stakeholders. Ultimately, we aim to ensure 
that a responsible environmental policy is implemented 
consistently across our entire branch network.
Investment
Finally, while the overall investment policy of the Group is 
concerned solely with obtaining the best return for clients, 
in addition to the financial analysis that occurs as part of 
normal investment procedures, we also offer our clients a 
completely personal, socially responsible investment service 
which takes into account their personal preferences in 
relation to environmental and ethical matters.
The Group continues to recognise 
its impact on the environment 
and takes steps to minimise it.  
It is also committed to providing 
a working environment that meets 
and exceeds the required health and 
safety standards. Governance / Chairman’s introduction

The biographies of the Board of Directors and leadership 
team are set out on pages 54 to 57.
Charles Stanley operates in a highly and constantly 
developing regulatory environment. Therefore a great deal 
of time has been dedicated by the Board and subcommittees 
to regulatory matters to ensure that a robust compliance 
framework is appropriately embedded within the Group’s 
day-to-day activities. Our values revolve at all times around 
the best interests of the client and, the Board proactively 
seeks to promote and embed that in our culture.
Sir David Howard 
Chairman
We have successfully moved from 
having a flat reporting structure 
to a robust governance framework 
consisting of a number of Board 
subcommittees and leadership 
teams. The established governance 
framework enables us to deliver on 
our strategy and support our 
business model.

Compliance with the code
The Directors recognise the benefits of good corporate 
governance and this report describes how the Company 
has complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (the Code). The Directors ensure 
that the Company keeps up to date with all corporate 
governance developments and best practice wherever 
practical. A copy of the Code may be viewed at frc.org.uk.
The Code governs the relationship between the constituent 
parts of the Company, namely the Board and its committees; 
relations with shareholders, and accountability and audit. 
The current position of the Group in each of these areas is 
explained in this Governance section, together with the 
Directors’ report (pages 89 to 91), and the Strategic report 
(pages 8 to 51).
Leadership
The Group has a two-tier management structure which 
comprises the Board of the Parent Company, Charles Stanley 
Group PLC (the ‘Board’) and the Executive Committee which 
meets weekly to manage the day-to-day running of the 
Company. The Executive Committee consists of the Executive 
Directors, the Chief Risk Officer, the Head of Asset Management 
and the Chief Operating Officer. Details of their experience are 
given in their biographies on pages 54 to 57. 
Board composition
As at 31 March 2016 the Board comprises nine Directors, 
including the Chairman, three independent Non-executive 
and five Executive Directors. Ben Money-Coutts’ appointment 
as Chief Financial Officer and a Director of the Company 
was approved by the FCA on 10 June 2015. Andrew Didham 
was appointed the third independent Non-executive 
Director following FCA approval on 18 September 2015. 
Anthony Scott resigned from the Board on 18 April 2016. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate 
and clearly defined and have been approved by the Board. 
Sir David Howard, the Company’s Non-executive Chairman, 
is responsible for the leadership of the Board and for 
ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of the role. The Chief 
Executive, Paul Abberley, has responsibility for the day-to- 
day management of the Group and chairs the Executive 
Committee. David Pusinelli continues as the Senior 
Independent Director. Further information regarding the 
Directors and their experience is given in their biographies 
on pages 54 to 57. 
The Group is committed to extending the proportion of 
female employment and representation. 11% of the Board 
is female. Further details about diversity in the Company 
are contained in the Corporate Social Responsibility report 
on pages 46 to 51.
Independence
Andrew Didham, Bridget Guerin and David Pusinelli 
have been determined by the Board to be independent. 
The Non-executive Directors provide a robust, independent 
element on the Board and they constructively challenge 
and examine the performance of management. They bring 
well-considered and constructive opinions, skill and 
knowledge to Board discussions. Sir David Howard, because 
of his previous role as Chief Executive and his shareholding 
in the Company, is not considered to be independent.
Board effectiveness
The Board met thirteen times during the year to review 
financial performance and strategy and to follow a 
schedule of matters reserved for the Board. Details 
of these matters can be found on the Group’s website 
charles-stanley.co.uk. The Board also held a strategy 
meeting in May at which members of the Executive 
Committee presented their proposals for the strategy 
as set out in Our strategy on pages 18 to 19.
The objectives having been set and prioritised, 
there followed a significant programme of debate 
and engagement among Directors and senior managers 
to develop and articulate the Group’s strategic priorities 
in more extensive detail. This has been followed up with 
regular presentations to, and debate at, the Board 
throughout the year concerning strategy.
Board initiatives during the year include:
• Consideration and approval of the Company Strategy
• Changes to the Board membership itself and of other 
senior appointments
• Review of the structure of the Group’s key management 
committees and reporting hierarchy to improve their 
quality and effectiveness
• The completion of the implementation of the Group’s 
revised client suitability processes
• Oversight of the design of revised variable remuneration 
arrangements which have been consulted on with the 
Group’s investment managers
• Development of the detailed strategic implementation 
plans for each of our core operating divisions.
In line with the Company’s strategy of focusing on its 
core private client wealth management activities, 
completion of the sale of Charles Stanley Securities to 
Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited took place on 15 July 2015, 
and the sale of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited 
to its management on 1 April 2016.

Appointment of Directors
The appointment of Directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and other 
applicable Regulations and policies, and is the responsibility 
of the Nomination Committee. 
The appointment of Andrew Didham as a Non-executive 
Director was managed by the Nomination Committee 
using an external search agency, Ravenshurst Partners LLP, 
which has no other connection to the Company.
The Directors’ service agreements or letters of appointment 
are available from the Company Secretary for inspection. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Directors 
are elected by the shareholders of the Company at a 
general meeting, or, if appointed by the Board between 
general meetings, confirmed by the shareholders at the 
subsequent general meeting. Although the Code does not 
provide that Directors of smaller companies need submit 
themselves for re-election annually, the Company’s Articles 
of Association does, and accordingly eight Directors seek 
the support of shareholders for their re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Being the first 
Annual General Meeting since his formal appointment, 
Andrew Didham will offer himself for election. 
Biographies of each of the Directors are set out on pages  
54 to 57. The number of meetings of the Board and of its 
Committees attended by each of the Directors during the 
year is detailed on the previous page. After due consideration, 
the Directors confirm that in their view all the Directors 
continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment 
to the role, and that it is recommended that all Directors be 
re-elected by shareholders.
Training and induction
Taking into account any previous experience they may 
already have as Directors of a public limited company, 
appropriate training and induction is made available 
to newly appointed Directors. The induction process 
includes meeting with Executive Directors, the members 
of the Executive Committee, relevant business heads and 
other senior executives. New Directors will also receive 
information from past meetings. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for facilitating the induction programme, 
and ensuring good information flow between the Board, 
its Committees and management. 
To assist with Directors’ continuing professional 
development needs, training sessions are undertaken 
for the entire Board and individually as appropriate to 
ensure on an ongoing basis that each Director is able to 
allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively.
Conflicts of interest
The Board has a policy and effective procedures for 
managing and, where appropriate, approving conflicts 
or potential conflicts of interest. Directors are invited 
periodically to confirm or amend any conflicts of interest 
and are encouraged to report these as and when they arise. 
A Register of Conflicts is held by the Company Secretary 
and a log of all conflicts raised is maintained and 
updated accordingly. All Directors are aware that it 
is their responsibility to raise and update any conflicts 
of interest they may have.
Board evaluation
In January 2016 the Board undertook a formal internal 
evaluation of its performance and Committees in the form 
of a Board Evaluation Questionnaire and a Board Skills 
Assessment. This exercise was led by the Nomination 
Committee. It took the form of two questionnaires 
completed by all members of the Board. The results were 
discussed by the Board and the Nomination Committee. 
Following a review of the results, the Nomination Committee 
confirmed that the performance of the Board and its 
Directors was considered to be satisfactory but 
recommended the formulation of plans to make 
improvements in certain areas. For the Board skills, 
the Committee was satisfied that skills which it had 
determined to be most important to be held by the Board 
were the predominant skills exhibited by the Directors.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors met on a 
number of occasions throughout the year without the 
Executive Directors present; this enabled the Executive 
Directors’ performance to be discussed.
Led by the Senior Independent Director, David Pusinelli, 
the Non-executive Directors also met without the Chairman 
present to discuss the evaluation of his performance, 
having taken into consideration separate consultation 
with the Chief Executive Officer. The effectiveness of the 
Chairman was confirmed and feedback on the appraisal 
will be given to the Chairman.

Compliance with the provisions and principles 
of the Code
The Board carries out a review of its compliance with 
the relevant provisions of the Code throughout the year. 
After its review, the Board confirmed that the Company 
has complied with all relevant provisions of the Code during 
the year.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the 
Board on all corporate governance matters as well as 
ensuring good information flows within the Board and 
its Committees. All Directors have access to the services 
of the Company Secretary and may take, if necessary, 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
All the Committees are able to call on independent 
professional advisers if they consider it necessary.
Relationship with shareholders
The Company places great importance on communication 
with shareholders and aims to keep shareholders informed 
by regular communication. Directors meet regularly with the 
Company’s institutional investors, analysts and financial 
press. The Company’s website is kept up to date with 
investor relations material, including annual and interim 
reports, and these are also distributed to anyone expressing 
an interest in the Company. The channel of communication 
between the Board and shareholders is open and active. 
Executive Directors meet with shareholders and analysts 
after the annual and half-yearly results are announced. 
David Pusinelli, as Senior Independent Director, contacts 
the institutional shareholders to arrange a meeting or 
confirm that the shareholders have no matters to raise. 
The Company welcomes all shareholders to its AGM, with 
the opportunity to ask questions formally at the meeting or 
more informally with all members of the Board afterwards. 
The Board is provided with regular feedback following 
meetings with shareholders, which assists in the Directors 
developing an understanding of the views of the Company’s 
shareholders. It is the Company’s policy to announce at the 
AGM the number of proxy votes cast on resolutions.
Insurance and indemnity
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover in 
respect of litigation against the Directors.
The Company has granted indemnities to all of its Directors 
(and Directors of subsidiary companies) on terms consistent 
with the applicable statutory provisions. Qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions for the purposes of section 234 
of the Companies Act 2006 were accordingly in force from 
April 2016 and remain so at the date of this report.
Regulation
As at 31 March 2016, there were four companies 
within the Group regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA).

 Andrew Didham was appointed as a Director on 18 September 2015
The new structure of the Compliance, Risk and Finance 
Departments has successfully been implemented during 
the year. The Audit Committee has played an active part 
in ensuring these changes have taken place in a measured 
way to ensure that Charles Stanley’s overall control 
environment is strengthened, its risk framework better 
assessed and progress rigorously monitored.
Role, responsibilities and membership of 
the Committee
The role and responsibilities of the Committee are set 
out in terms of reference which are reviewed annually 
and approved by the Board.
All members of the Committee are independent 
Non-executive Directors with recent and relevant financial 
experience. In September, we welcomed Andrew Didham 
on to the Committee following his appointment as an 
independent Non-executive Director. The Committee met 
on six occasions during the year.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer, the internal audit partner and the external audit 
partner attend most meetings by invitation. The Chief Risk 
Officer, who oversees the Compliance and Risk departments, 
attends when required.
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year
The Committee has established an annual cycle of work 
to ensure all responsibilities are met over a calendar year. 
The agenda items covered in the Committee’s meetings 
include standing items, plus additional agenda items 
including, for example, all reports issued by the external and 
internal auditors since the previous meeting of the Committee.
The work we have undertaken within the Committee 
during the year ended 31 March 2016 principally fell into 
three main areas:
1. Internal controls
• Reviewed and agreed the scope of the risk-based audit 
plan as proposed by internal audit
• Considered reports from the internal auditors and their 
assessment of relevant mitigating controls
• Monitored progress in resolving audit issues raised in 
audit reports
• Reviewed the resources of the internal audit function and 
agreed the costs
• Considered the effectiveness of the Audit Committee.

Governance / Audit Committee report Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 63
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
2. External audit
• Considered and approved the audit approach, and scope 
of the audit work
• Reviewed reports on audit findings
• Reviewed and approved the policy on the independence 
of the external auditors
• Considered the independence of the auditors, with 
particular focus on the nature of non-audit work as 
well as the mix of audit and non-audit fees
• Considered the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code regarding external audit
• Considered letters of representation given to the external 
auditors by Management.
3. Accounting, tax and financial reporting
• Reviewed the annual financial statements
• Considered all significant financial reporting judgements
• Considered the appropriateness of preparing the annual 
financial statements on a going concern basis
• Reviewed principal disclosures in the financial statements 
with particular regard to those areas subject to significant 
financial reporting judgements.
Internal audit
The provision of internal audit activities has been 
outsourced to Grant Thornton. Grant Thornton has 
a deep pool of resources with substantial experience 
and qualifications in the activity of internal audit within 
the financial services sector. This means that they are able 
to bring in specialists relevant to the areas being reviewed 
and also that they possess up-to-date experience of 
industry best practice which acts as a useful benchmark 
for the Group. The internal audit function reports directly 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The audit plan for the upcoming year is approved in 
advance by the Committee on an annual basis. A rolling 
three-year plan is maintained to ensure all critical areas of 
the business are covered over this period. We then overlay a 
risk assessment to determine the prioritisation of the internal 
audit plan for the coming year.
The annual budget for the internal audit activities is agreed 
between the Chairman of the Committee and the Chief 
Financial Officer, having regard to the planned scope 
of work of the internal audit function during the period. 
The cost of any ad hoc or additional work required over 
the course of the year is also reviewed and agreed by the 
Committee and the Chief Financial Officer as it arises.
The Committee reviews all internal audit reports in order to 
assess the effectiveness of mitigating controls and proposed 
actions by management to address any issues found. 
Particular attention has been paid during the year to 
ensuring that all management actions arising are tracked 
to completion on a timely basis. Exceptionally, operational 
and line management may be required to attend the 
Committee to report on progress.
A total of 16 reports were undertaken by internal audit and 
reviewed by the Committee during the year. The internal 
audit fees incurred during the year for this work amounted 
to £324,019 (31 December 2015: £379,384).
External auditors
Performance and effectiveness of our external auditor
During the year we reviewed the effectiveness of KPMG, 
the Group’s external auditors. While this process highlighted 
several ways of improving communication between the 
Group and KPMG during the audit process, we remain very 
satisfied with the performance and effectiveness of the 
external audit services received.
Non-audit services
We have reviewed the independence and the nature of 
non-audit services supplied by KPMG and non-audit fee 
levels relative to the audit fee. Our prior approval is required 
where the fee for an individual non-audit service is expected 
to exceed £50,000. Fees for non-audit services paid to the 
auditors should not, in aggregate, exceed 100% of the audit 
fee in any year without the Committee’s prior written approval.
We recognise that, given their knowledge of the business, 
there are often advantages in using KPMG to provide certain 
non-audit services. Fees other than for audit or assurance 
payable to the auditors during the year ended 31 March 2016 
were £90,053 (31 March 2015: £85,975).
We have reviewed the safeguards to independence that 
have been put in place by KPMG in undertaking the 
non-audit engagements throughout the year and are 
satisfied that these are appropriate. The safeguards and 
terms of engagement were reviewed and approved by us 
prior to KPMG commencing their work.
We agreed the external audit fees and reviewed the audit 
engagement letter. We also had discussions with the 
external auditors with no management present to provide 
an opportunity for any concerns to be aired.
Audit tender
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that 
audits should be subject to tender at least once every 
ten years. KPMG was appointed as the Group auditors for 
the 2011 year-end as a result of a competitive tender process.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 64
The Committee intends to conduct an audit tender process 
again before the tenth anniversary of their appointment.
Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee
Following discussions with both Management and KPMG, 
the Committee has determined that the following areas 
form the key areas of judgement in the preparation of the 
annual financial statements:
• Impairment of goodwill
• Impairment of intangible and other non-financial assets
• Available for sale financial assets
• Pension deficit
• Dilapidations
• Transition bonus accrual
• Discontinued operations
• Assets held for sale and post balance sheet events.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill has arisen in prior years principally from the 
acquisition of subsidiaries and typically represents 
the difference between the total cost of acquisition 
and the fair values of the assets of the acquired business.
Goodwill is shown at a value of £16.0 million (31 March 2015: 
£16.0 million) on the balance sheet and is detailed in note 15.
We have considered the review of goodwill which is performed 
by Management annually or earlier if an erosion of goodwill 
is suspected. The review requires that impairment is made 
if the recoverable amount is less than that of its carrying 
value. The approach adopted is first, to calculate fair value 
less cost to sell, and to consider value in use only if the 
carrying value fails this first test. The majority of the goodwill, 
£10.7 million (31 March 2015: £10.7 million), relates to private 
client investment management businesses acquired and no 
impairment is considered necessary in relation to these.
Charles Stanley Direct represents £5.2 million (31 March 2015: 
£5.2 million) of the total goodwill balance. This business 
comprises our online investment service and includes the 
former direct businesses known as Garrison and Fastrade 
which have been subsumed into the Charles Stanley Direct 
cash generating unit.
Charles Stanley Direct is an award-winning platform and 
continues to grow its core assets and revenues at a stable rate, 
resulting in profitable forecasts in the medium to long term. 
Accordingly, while regarding it as an area of considerable 
judgement, the Committee concludes that the fair value of the 
goodwill is supported by the future profitability of the platform.
The goodwill held on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2015 
for Charles Stanley Securities was realised following the sale 
of the business on 15 July 2015. Charles Stanley Financial 
Solutions Limited, the employee benefit business, was sold 
in a management buy-out on 1 April 2016. The goodwill held 
in respect of this business has been written down during the 
year by £0.4 million to £1.1 million to reflect the net value 
arising from the transaction.
Impairment of intangible and other non-financial assets
The Committee considers that client lists provide the 
principal area for review for impairment. These were 
valued at £6.3 million as at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: 
£7.3 million). The hiring of individual or teams of senior 
investment managers requires a value to be attributed to 
the client lists that they bring to the Group. These intangible 
assets are amortised over their useful life, generally a period 
of ten years, which the Committee considers appropriate.
The Committee has looked for evidence of impairment 
arising from the loss of any senior investment managers 
during the year that may indicate the risk of outflow 
of clients and associated Funds under Management. 
The Committee has also reviewed analysis of the underlying 
rate of loss of clients to look for any other cause of possible 
outflows. During the year, the closure of client accounts 
stayed low and the main cause of lost clients remained 
death which the Committee recognises tends to claim 3% 
to 4% of the client base each year. The Committee has not 
found reason for management to reflect any impairment in 
the carrying value of these intangible assets. 
Available for sale financial assets
Management has appraised its investment in Euroclear Plc 
by reference to its dividend yield and a recent tender 
process from Euroclear Plc’s share buyback scheme. 
The Committee has noted the results of the valuation 
exercise and concludes that its carrying value is appropriate.
The Group also assessed the recoverability of its loan to 
Runpath Digital Ltd (previously known as Masterlist Limited), 
which is repayable in 2017 and which has previously 
been written down by 50%; and also the value of its equity 
investment in Runpath Digital Ltd which has been fully 
provided for. The Group believes that Runpath Digital Ltd 
has sufficient access to liquid funds. The discounted cash 
flow calculation based on the effective interest on the loan 
exceeds its carrying value and the Committee considers no 
further impairment is needed at this time.
Governance / Audit Committee report Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 65
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Since the year-end, the Group entered into an agreement to 
convert the loan in full into 119,154 ordinary shares and sell 
25% of its enlarged equity holding. The Committee has 
assessed the terms of the transaction and the events arising 
and considers this to be a non-adjusting post balance sheet 
event. Appropriate disclosure has been included in note 32 
of the financial statements.
Pension
The Group’s defined benefit scheme was closed to future 
service accruals as at 31 March 2016. Based on the latest 
International Accounting Standard 19 (IAS 19) actuarial 
valuation, the pension fund shows a deficit position of 
£10.1 million at 31 March 2016 (31 March 2015: £13.1 million) 
and this is further detailed in note 10. The IAS 19 actuarial 
valuation has been updated for the full triennial valuation 
as at 31 March 2014 and takes into account more prudent 
longevity assumptions. Moreover, following formal 
communication to the pension trustees, the basis of benefit 
augmentation has been changed to CPI rather than RPI. 
The Committee has reviewed the actuarial valuation report 
and noted the conclusions of KPMG on the nature of the 
assumptions used by the actuaries and is in agreement 
with the year-end deficit position.
Dilapidations
The Group has undertaken a review of the leasehold 
buildings it occupies in London. As a result of which it has 
entered into a lease for office space at 55 Bishopsgate, 
London which will enable front office and front office 
support staff to be relocated to the new site and thus 
vacate a number of its existing London properties 
including 131 Finsbury Pavement, Paul Street and Luke Street. 
As a consequence, a review of the dilapidation payments 
likely to have to be paid under the existing leases has 
been carried out, resulting in an accelerated charge of 
£0.8 million recognised in the income statement during 
the year. The Committee has reviewed the basis of charge, 
taking into account the terms of the relevant leases and 
historic experience of dilapidation costs incurred per square 
footage. The Committee believes that the charge incurred 
reasonably reflects the likely final cost of making good any 
dilapidations or settlement with the landlord.
Transition bonus accrual
During the year, the Board agreed revised interim 
remuneration arrangements with the Group’s investment 
managers in relation to their variable compensation. 
Part of this agreement involved moving the basis of the 
bonus calculation from being based on billed revenue to 
earned revenue. This has resulted in the Group bringing 
forward the recognition of bonuses on revenues that 
were accrued but not yet billed as at 31 March 2016. 
The additional amount recognised in the income statement 
in the year was £1.4 million. The Committee has assessed 
the transitional arrangement terms and considers the 
amount recognised as appropriate to cover the accelerated 
bonus portion.
Discontinued operations
The Committee assessed the level of deferred consideration 
recognised in the year in respect of the disposal of Charles 
Stanley Securities sold in July 2015 and found this to be 
prudent. The deferred income has been disclosed in the 
consolidated income statement as discontinued operations 
since, in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), this was a separately identifiable line 
of business.
Assets held for sale and post balance sheet events
The sale of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited was 
completed on 1 April 2016 and, as a result, the Committee 
considers it appropriate to treat the business as an asset 
held for sale and recognised on the Group balance sheet 
at 31 March 2016.

Main activities during the year
The Committee focuses on ensuring that the Board has 
strong and responsible leadership, together with a wide 
range of skills, knowledge and experience, which are critical 
to creating long-term value and success. 
More specifically during the year the Committee:
• Undertook a review of the composition of the Board and 
Committees to assess the range of skills covered 
• Led the annual Board evaluation process, in accordance 
with the main principles of the Corporate Governance Code
• Recommended the appointment of Andrew Didham as 
Non-executive Director to the Board and Board Committees, 
after concluding that, given his knowledge and 
experience, the appointment would complement the 
composition of the Board 
• Managed the transfer of Committee chairmanship from 
David Pusinelli to Sir David Howard in July 2015
• Reviewed the Terms of Reference and proposed the 
necessary amendments to facilitate the appointment 
of Sir David Howard as Chairman of the Committee
• Reviewed the Conflict of Interests Register
• Reviewed the ongoing training requirements of Directors 
in the light of the results of the Board Evaluation report
• Discussed succession planning requirements for the 
appointment of Executive and Non-executive Directors 
to the Board. 
An external search agency, Ravenshurst Partners LLP, 
was appointed to assist with the process for selecting a 
new Non-executive Director, which led to the appointment 
of Andrew Didham. Ravenshurst Partners LLP has no other 
connection with the Group. 
The Nomination Committee supports the Company’s aim to 
have the appropriate level of diversity in the boardroom in 
order to provide a broader perspective to decision-making, 
whilst remaining committed to ensuring appointments 
are ultimately made on merit. Currently, 11% of the Board 
is female. Further details about diversity are included in the 
Corporate social responsibility report on pages 46 to 51.

Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
 
Building on the work done last year to align the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration policy with Group strategy,  
the Committee has:
• Granted the second tranche of awards under the Charles 
Stanley Performance Scheme Plan (PSP). It was agreed 
that the Chief Executive Officer should receive an award 
over shares worth approximately 80% of salary, with the 
other Executive Directors receiving awards between 40% 
and 75% of salary. These awards vest based on a blend 
of Earnings Per Share (EPS) and margin targets described 
in last year’s report which will be tested based on 
performance delivered in the financial year ending 
31 March 2018 and which are explained more fully in 
this report
• Determined the outturn for financial year 2016 under the 
main Executive Director bonus plan – annual bonus was 
based on adjusted Profit Before Tax (PBT) performance. 
No annual bonuses were paid to the Executive Directors 
for the year under this plan
• Determined the base salaries for the 2017 financial year. 
No increases to base salaries have been agreed by the 
Remuneration Committee
• Carried out significant work this year to standardise and 
amend the remuneration of the investment managers 
to ensure that their remuneration promotes good 
customer outcomes and is in line with shareholders’ 
interests. The Remuneration Committee has had an 
oversight role during the process of consultation and 
implementation, which has not yet concluded.
As I mention above, shareholders approved our remuneration 
policy at the last AGM. For ease of reference, the main policy 
tables from the Directors’ remuneration policy approved at 
the 2015 AGM are also set out in the report. The implementation 
section of the report will be voted on at the forthcoming AGM.
I hope you find this report clear and will support the 
approach taken by the Committee. However, as always, 
I would welcome any comments you may have.

Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Remuneration report for the 
financial year ended 31 March 2016 for your approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 29 July 2016.
The Remuneration Committee aims that our Directors’ 
remuneration should:
• Be aligned with the interests of shareholders, with a 
significant proportion of Executive Director remuneration 
being performance-related to areas which impact 
shareholder value
• Be competitive, but not excessive in relation to other 
relevant peer companies
• Take into account Group-wide pay and employment 
conditions
• Not encourage the taking of risks which fall outside the 
Board’s risk appetite.
At last year’s AGM, reflecting the recent Board changes 
(such as Sir David Howard becoming the Non-executive 
Chairman) and to provide more general flexibility, we tabled 
a revised remuneration policy for shareholder approval. 
We were very pleased to receive strong support for this 
policy (with in excess of 99% voting in favour of approval). 
The implementation section of the report was also 
subject to shareholder approval and received over 
99.9% votes in favour.
During the year we welcomed Ben Money-Coutts to the 
Board as Director and Chief Financial Officer on 10 June 2015 
following the FCA granting approval. We were also pleased 
to announce the appointment of Andrew Didham as 
Non-executive Director and member of the Remuneration 
Committee on 18 September 2015.
As announced on 18 April 2016, Anthony Scott resigned as a 
Director with immediate effect and is expected to continue 
in the Company’s employment until 15 October 2016. 
We have included the remuneration details relating to his 
departure (which reflect the terms of his service contract 
and the incentive plan rules) in the implementation section 
of this report. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 69

 Andrew Didham was appointed as a Director on 18 September 2015
The report also describes how the Board has complied with 
the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
relating to remuneration matters. 
At our 2016 AGM we will be holding a vote on the 
implementation section of this report. The auditors have 
reported on certain parts of this report and stated whether, 
in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Those sections of the report which have been subject to 
audit are clearly indicated.
Directors’ remuneration policy
Key features of the policy
The Directors’ remuneration policy as summarised in this 
section of the report took effect for all payments made 
to Directors from the date of the 2015 AGM on 31 July 2015. 
For information and ease of reference the remuneration 
policy for Executive Directors is summarised in the table 
on pages 70 to 73, along with the policy regarding 
Non-executive Directors’ fees. The column ‘Implementation 
of Policy’ has, however, been updated to reflect current 
salaries and other relevant changes.
How the Committee takes account of wider pay issues 
when setting the policy
When setting Executive Director remuneration, the Committee 
takes into account Group-wide pay and employment 
conditions, along with market and commercial factors 
(although, reflecting prevailing commercial practice, 
the Committee does not consult with employees in 
preparing the policy or its implementation). For example, 
when determining any base salary increases for Executive 
Directors, the Committee reviews the average Group-wide 
increase. The annual bonus opportunity of the Executive 
Directors is similar in a number of respects to the 
‘discretionary’ bonus opportunity of a significant 
number of other Group staff in that both personal 
performance and overall Group profitability shape payouts. 
However, only the Executive Directors’ bonuses are subject 
to individual caps, mandatory share deferral and clawback/
malus. Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 
full range of Group benefits offered to employees.
In addition, they are eligible for certain remuneration to 
which other employees are not eligible. For example, 
Executive Directors may receive a salary supplement in lieu 
of pension, which is not available to all other employees. 
Also, Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the 
Charles Stanley Performance Share Plan (PSP), participation 
in which is not intended to be extended widely. However, 
all employees are eligible to participate in the all-employee 
share schemes described in the table on pages 72 to 73.
How shareholders’ views are taken into account when 
setting the policy
Each year the Committee will take into account the approval 
levels of remuneration-related resolutions at the previous 
AGM when reviewing the current policy. More generally,  
the Committee will also seek to build an active and productive 
dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration 
aspects of corporate governance and any changes to the 
Group’s executive pay arrangements. In addition, in line with 
the Investment Association’s guidelines on responsible 
investment disclosure, the Committee is comfortable that the 
incentive structure for Executive Directors does not raise any 
environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The Group policy and the FCA Remuneration Code
The Committee will regularly review its remuneration 
policies to ensure compliance with the principles of the 
Remuneration Code of the UK financial services regulator, 
as applicable to Charles Stanley. The remuneration policy 
is designed to be consistent with the conservative 
management of risk and the sustained, long-term 
performance of the Group. The Committee believes that 
the remuneration policies neither encourage, nor reward, 
inappropriate risk-taking.

Base salary
This is the core element of pay and 
reflects the individual’s role and 
position within the Group, with 
some adjustment to reflect their 
capability and contribution.
Base salaries are considered with account taken of 
levels paid by companies of similar size and complexity. 
However, the Committee does not strictly follow 
benchmark data but instead uses it as a reference point 
in considering, in its judgement, the appropriate level 
having regard to other relevant factors including 
corporate and individual performance and any changes 
in an individual’s role and responsibilities. Base salary is 
paid monthly in cash.
Base salary levels will be formally reviewed 
at such times as the Committee considers 
appropriate. If any increases are made, it is 
expected that they will be in line with general 
workforce increases (save where a higher 
increase is necessary to reflect a significant 
change in role and/or responsibilities). Any 
base salary increases normally take effect 
from 1 October.
n/a No increases to base salaries were made in 2016 and none are proposed for 2017.
Current base salaries for Executive Directors are as follows:
Benefits
To provide other benefits valued 
by recipient.
Provide market-competitive benefits in kind. Details of the current benefits provided can 
be found to the right. The Committee 
reserves discretion to introduce new benefits 
where it concludes that it is in the interests of 
the Group to do so, having regard to the 
particular circumstances and to market 
practice. The Committee will monitor 
overall benefit costs and will ensure that 
they do not increase by more than the 
Committee considers to be appropriate 
in all the circumstances.
n/a The benefits received by Executive Directors comprise a car allowance, private medical cover and 
telephone. No changes were made to this element of remuneration in 2016 and none are proposed 
for 2017.
Pension
To aid retention and remain 
competitive within the marketplace.
Provide a competitive level of post-retirement benefits.
The Executive Directors participate in money purchase 
arrangements. Contributions have been made into a 
SIPP for Anthony Scott and are taken as a salary 
supplement by other Directors.
Contributions to the pension arrangements 
may be reviewed when considered 
appropriate by the Committee.
n/a No changes were made to pension arrangements in 2016 and none are anticipated for 2017.
Executive Directors receive the following payments:
Paul Abberley – 20% of base salary
Michael Lilwall – 25% of base salary
Ben Money-Coutts – 20% of base salary 
Anthony Scott – 20% of base salary 
Gary Teper – 20% of base salary
Annual bonus
To incentivise Executive Directors 
to deliver against annual 
performance targets.
Annual bonus levels and the appropriateness of 
measures are reviewed annually to ensure they continue 
to support the Group’s strategic goals.
Bonus outcomes are paid in one tranche (less any 
deferred share award) following the year-end.
Any bonus earned in excess of 50% of salary under the 
main bonus plan is to be deferred into shares for a 
period of three years.
During the period until vesting of deferred share 
awards, the numbers of shares awarded are increased 
by the value of dividends notionally payable in respect 
of the vesting shares.
Malus/clawback provisions apply to amounts deferred 
which can be reduced in later years in exceptional 
circumstances such as (i) material misstatement of 
accounts, (ii) action that causes material reputational 
damage to the Group, and/or (iii) in the event of 
material regulatory censure.
To reflect the Group’s strategic objective 
of driving growth and improved quality 
of profits, the core annual bonus plan is 
structured as a ‘profit pool’ under which 
an agreed percentage of adjusted profit 
before tax (PBT) can be distributed to the 
Executive Directors, with a portion of this 
distribution based upon performance 
against individual targets. There is a cap 
of 6% of adjusted PBT that can be allocated 
to the pool. In addition, no Executive Director 
may receive a bonus in excess of 100% of 
their salary under this plan.
Due to the profit pool nature of the bonus, 
there is no prescribed amount of bonus 
that is payable for any particular level 
of performance.
Adjusted PBT is defined as PBT adding back 
bonus pool accrual, the FSCS (or similar) 
levy and, in exceptional circumstances, 
any other items the Committee considers 
appropriate to reflect the underlying 
financial performance of the Group.
The performance measures applied 
may be financial or non-financial and 
corporate, divisional or individual.
The annual bonus remains a 
discretionary arrangement and the 
Committee reserves discretion to 
adjust the outturn should it consider 
that to be appropriate (albeit within 
the limits set out in this policy table).
2016 Annual Bonus
At the start of the year the Remuneration Committee determined that the overall size of the bonus 
pool available for distribution under this plan to Executive Directors was to be between 3% and 6% 
of adjusted PBT.
50% of this bonus pool was to be allocated across all Executive Directors on an equal basis. 
The remaining 50% of the bonus pool (or such lesser amount as the Committee considered 
appropriate) was to be allocated to each Executive Director based upon their performance 
against pre-set individual performance objectives.
As there was only a small adjusted profit, the Remuneration Committee determined that no annual 
bonus pool was to be accrued or paid for 2016 under this plan. For information, the objectives 
against which the Directors were individually measured included their contributions to delivering 
the targeted improvement in profitability and the delivery of the detailed plans built to guide the 
implementation of the corporate strategy.
In addition to the above, and reflective of the Company’s policy on internal recruits, Anthony Scott 
was entitled to participate in a legacy profit sharing arrangement relating to his previous role as an 
active investment manager prior to joining the Board and reflecting his continuing client relationship 
management responsibilities. He received a payment under this legacy arrangement which is 
described more fully on pages 80 to 81.
2017 Annual Bonus
The bonus will be operated in a similar manner to 2016 (that is, a profit pool will be created worth up 
to 6% of adjusted profit which will be distributed based, in part, on performance against individual 
objectives). Given the nature of the individual objectives, they are considered commercially sensitive 
and are accordingly not disclosed in this report (although they will relate to their contributions to 
delivering the targeted improvement in profitability and the delivery of the detailed plans built to guide 
the implementation of the corporate strategy). Further information regarding these targets will be 
included in next year’s report. Anthony Scott will also continue to participate in his legacy profit 
sharing arrangement for 2017 (albeit at reduced levels of entitlement). Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Long-term incentives
To incentivise delivery of sustained 
performance over the long term, 
the Company operates the 
‘Charles Stanley Performance 
Share Plan’ (PSP).
Awards under the PSP may be in the form of nil-cost 
options, conditional awards (rights to receive shares 
for nil-cost) or cash-based ‘phantom’ awards.
During the period until vesting of awards, the 
numbers of shares awarded are increased by 
the value of dividends notionally payable in respect 
of the vesting shares.
Awards previously granted but not yet vested, and 
shares received following vesting, can be reduced/
reclaimed in exceptional circumstances such as 
(i) material misstatement of accounts, (ii) actions 
that cause material reputational damage to the Group, 
and/or (iii) in the event of material regulatory censure.
The formal limit under the PSP is 100% of 
salary (and 200% in exceptional cases).
The Committee expressly reserves discretion 
to make such awards as it considers 
appropriate within these limits. Actual grant 
levels may be determined by reference to 
individual performance in the prior year, 
with vesting then based upon performance 
against three-year targets.
At a threshold level of performance against 
these three-year targets, 20% of an award is 
capable of vesting.
The Committee will set performance 
conditions for each annual PSP award 
which may relate to financial and/or 
share price performance and which will 
have the underlying aim of encouraging 
and rewarding the generation of 
sustainable returns to shareholders.
2016 Awards
Awards were made over shares worth up to approximately 80% of salary under the PSP to Paul 
Abberley, with Messrs Lilwall, Money-Coutts, Scott and Teper receiving awards between 40% and 
75% of salary.
50% of each award will vest subject to adjusted EPS targets, with 50% subject to operating margin 
targets, each measured over a three-year period to 31 March 2018.
Further details of the targets that applied to the awards are set out in the implementation report.
2017 Awards
Awards will be made with similar targets to the 2016 Awards. Further details of the targets that will 
apply to the awards are set out in the implementation report.
Shareholding guidelines
To encourage share ownership by the 
Executive Directors and ensure their 
interests are aligned with investors. 
Executive Directors are required to retain 50% of shares 
(net of tax) which vest under the PSP or bonus deferral 
until such time that they hold a specified value of shares 
as shown in the Opportunity column.
Once the shareholding guideline has been met, 
individuals are expected to retain these levels as 
a minimum. The Committee will review shareholding 
annually in this context.

other Group employees.
Sharesave – individuals may save up to a 
maximum of £250 (or such amount permitted 
by the HMRC approved limit) each month for 
a fixed period of three or five years. At the end

currently capped at 15% (although the rules 
permit 20%) of the market price set at the 
launch of each scheme.
Share Incentive Plan – individuals may 
purchase, out of their pre-tax salary, shares 
in the Company up to a value of £150 per 
month (or such amount permitted by the 
HMRC approved limit). Free shares worth up 
to £3,000 (or such amount permitted by the 
HMRC approved limit) can also be granted 
each year. Also, the rules of the Plan allow 
matching shares to be granted based on the 
number of shares purchased (although the 
Company does not currently operate the free 
share and matching elements of the Plan).
Consistent with normal practice, 
these awards are not subject to 
performance conditions.

Non-executive 
Director fees
The fees paid to the Non-executive Directors aim to be 
competitive with other fully listed companies which the 
Board consider to be of equivalent size and complexity.
Fee levels are periodically reviewed by the Board. 
However, the Company does not adopt a quantitative 
approach to pay positioning and exercises judgement 
as to what it considers to be reasonable in all the 
circumstances as regards quantum.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive Directors 
who chair a Board Committee or who have other 
additional responsibilities (such as being Senior 
Independent Director).
Non-executive Directors do not participate in the annual 
bonus or share incentive arrangements.
Non-executive Directors may also receive benefits within 
prescribed limits as to value.
Fees are paid monthly in cash. Fee levels 
for Non-executive Directors are reviewed 
annually and are only expected to increase 
in line with market norms and to take 
account of additional time commitments 
and responsibilities.
The annual limit on benefits is £25,000.
The cap on fees payable to Non-executive 
Directors for their services is £0.45 million 
p.a. 
n/a Sir David Howard receives an annual fee of £125,000 as Non-executive Chairman. Sir David

Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
How the policy shapes actual Executive Directors’ pay
Our remuneration policy results in a signifi cant portion of the Executive Directors’ pay being dependent on performance. 
The chart below demonstrates this, showing how their pay will vary based on different levels of performance (with increases 
in share price and dividend re-investment ignored for these purposes), that is:
• ‘Minimum performance’ – this assumes that performance is such that no annual bonus is warranted (due to no profi t 
being generated in a particular year) and no PSP awards vest (due to the minimum performance threshold not being 
reached). Therefore, Executive Directors only receive their fi xed pay (that is, salary, benefi ts and pension)
• ‘On target performance’ – this assumes a ‘target’ level of performance, resulting in threshold vesting of PSP
awards (that is, 20% of the proposed 2017 award level). As the annual bonus is based on a profi t pool and,
therefore, has no prescribed ‘on target’ opportunity, to refl ect the approach adopted last year we have valued
the bonus based on the actual payment under the plan for the prior year (that is, zero). Fixed pay remains unchanged
• ‘Maximum performance’ – this assumes a very strong level of performance, resulting in full vesting of PSP awards at
the proposed 2017 level and a maximum bonus payout of 100% of salary. Fixed pay also remains unchanged.

Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules and subject to the
limits/other provisions set out in the policy table on pages 70 to 73. The Committee retains discretion, consistent
with market practice, in a limited number of respects, in relation to the operation and administration of these plans.
These discretions include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Selection of participants
• Timing of grant of an award/bonus opportunity Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 75
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
• Size of an award/bonus opportunity (subject to the overall plan limits set out in the policy table)
• Setting of PSP and bonus performance targets and the determination of performance against such targets and resultant 
vesting/bonus payouts
• Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group
• Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plans and the appropriate treatment chosen 
(as summarised in the table on page 77)
• Adjustments required in certain circumstances (such as rights issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends).
Under the rules of both the PSP and annual bonus plan, and reflecting general market practice, the Committee retains the 
ability to adjust the targets and/or set different measures if events occur (such as material acquisition, share issue and/or 
divestment of a Group business) which cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and the 
amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy. 
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the annual report on Remuneration and may, 
as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
The Directors’ service contracts
Executive Directors
Paul Abberley, Ben Money-Coutts, Anthony Scott and Gary Teper have service contracts containing a notice period of 
six months and a payment in lieu of notice clause limited to base salary only. Michael Lilwall has a service contract 
containing a notice period of 12 months and a payment in lieu of notice clause limited to base salary only. There are 
no other special provisions in these contracts relating to compensation for loss of office, nor are there any clauses in 
contracts amending employment terms and conditions on a change of control.
In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being terminated, the Committee will pay due regard to 
(i) best practice, (ii) the circumstances surrounding the termination, and (iii) the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate 
his/her loss, while also adhering to the relevant contractual terms.
All Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election. Executive Directors may take on external appointments, subject to 
prior approval by the Board. The fees from such appointments (where relevant) are retained by the Director concerned.
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, but instead have Letters of Appointment for an initial three-year 
term, subject to annual re-election by the Company’s shareholders. Either party can terminate the Letter of Appointment on 
giving three months’ written notice. There are no special provisions in the Letters of Appointment for compensation in the 
event of loss of office.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments 
entered into with current or former Directors. Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the relevant 
report going forward as required by the Regulations.
Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider these form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, we have been advised 
that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or another) and business travel for Directors (and occasionally 
their families) may technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the 
Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 76
Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
Our approach to remuneration on recruitment
The Group’s recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment 
and promotion of high-calibre executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets required to deliver 
our strategic aims.
The following represents guidelines considered reasonable by the Committee in relation to securing an appropriate 
candidate whose appointment would be in shareholders’ best interests:
• In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be 
to look to the general policy for Executive Directors as set out in the policy table on pages 70 to 73 and structure a 
package in accordance with that policy
• Base salaries will be set based on the individual’s role and experience, with consideration given to internal relativities
• Benefits will be provided in line with those offered to other employees at a similar level. In the case of new Executive 
Directors, individuals will be given a choice of either participation in a defined contribution pension or a cash allowance 
in lieu of pension
• Ignoring any special recruitment buy-out arrangements which may prove to be necessary, the annual bonus or long-term 
incentive arrangements will operate (including the maximum award levels) as detailed in the policy table in relation to any 
newly appointed Director
• For an internal appointment, any variable pay element or arrangement that exists in respect of the prior role may either 
continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate. For external and internal 
appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers 
appropriate and/or make a contribution towards legal fees in connection with agreeing employment terms
• A new Executive Director will not, save in exceptional circumstances, be offered a service contract with a notice period in 
excess of one year
• Where it is necessary to make a special recruitment-related buy-out award to an external candidate, the Company will 
not pay more than is, in the view of the Committee, necessary and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, to deliver any 
such buy-out awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay structure as outlined in the policy table. It may, 
however, be necessary in some cases to make such special buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the 
existing incentive plans in order to secure a candidate, which may require reliance upon Listing Rule 9.4.2. All such special 
buy-out awards will be appropriately disclosed and will take account of all relevant factors. For example, the commercial 
value of the buy-out award will reflect the commercial value of the amount forfeited from the previous employer, with the 
performance conditions and the potential timing of vesting also taken into account
• For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amounts for incentive pay as stated in the policy will not apply to special 
buy-out awards. The Committee has not placed a maximum limit on any such buy-out awards as it is not considered 
to be in shareholders’ interests to set any expectations for prospective candidates regarding such awards. However, 
as stated above, the commercial value of the amount forfeited from the previous employer will be reflected in the 
quantum of such award.
Our policy on Executive Directors leaving Charles Stanley
In practice, the facts surrounding any termination do not always fit neatly into defined categories for ‘good’ or ‘bad’ 
leavers. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Committee to consider the suitable treatment on a termination having regard 
to all of the relevant facts and circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to 
notice periods on a termination and to any treatment which the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions 
available to it under the terms of any incentive plans. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are 
summarised in the table on the following page. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 77

The Company has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential 
legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, on termination of an Executive Director’s employment, 
the Company may pay a contribution towards the individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part 
of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. Should it 
become necessary to make additional payments in respect of such professional fees that were not ascertained at the time 
of reporting, the Company may do so up to a level of a further £10,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not 
include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
Implementation report – unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee’s main responsibilities during the year
The Terms of Reference of the Committee (chaired by Bridget Guerin, with David Pusinelli and Andrew Didham being the 
other members) are available at charles-stanley.co.uk. During the financial year 2016 the Committee’s main responsibilities 
were to:
• Monitor the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors
• Monitor Executive Directors’ performance and to recommend PSP awards based on this performance to the Board
• Determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration policy and the approval of all elements of pay for the 
Chairman of the Board and the other Executive Directors 
• Be responsible for the Charles Stanley remuneration policy as documented and proposed by the Executive Committee
• Prepare this Directors’ remuneration report. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 78
Governance / Directors’ remuneration report
The Committee meets twice a year but more frequently if required. During 2016, seven Committee meetings were held and 
details on attendance at meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 59. None of the Committee 
members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. 
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
How the Remuneration Committee sought advice
The Committee received independent remuneration advice during the year from its appointed advisers, FIT Remuneration 
Consultants LLP (FIT). FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group (the professional body for such consultants) 
and adheres to its code of conduct. FIT provided no other services to the Group, and accordingly the Committee was 
satisfied that the advice provided by FIT was objective and independent. FIT’s fees in respect of 2016 were £13,200 
(2015: £32,997) (exclusive of VAT). FIT’s fees were charged on the basis of the Group’s standard terms of business for 
advice provided. The Committee also consulted with Sir David Howard and Paul Abberley (save in respect of matters 
relating directly to their own remuneration) and the Group’s HR function.
How remuneration compares to other payments
The table below shows the total pay for all of Charles Stanley’s employees compared to other key distributions made by 
the Company:
2016 2015 % Change
Employee costs £56,633,000 £67,504,000 (16.1)
Dividends £2,533,810 £2,289,308 10.7 
1
 
1
  The total dividend per share for 2016 was of 5 pence per share, same as for 2015. The increase in the total dividend payout is higher compared to 2015 due to an increase in 
the issued share capital at the end of the year following the private placing in April 2015
Review of past performance

on 31 March 2009 compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding investment trusts).

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The table below shows the total remuneration figure for Sir David Howard and Paul Abberley over the same seven-year 
period. The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus paid in each of these years. The Regulations require this 
table to state the proportion of annual bonus paid and long-term incentive vesting in each relevant year as a percentage 
of the maximum available. However:
• The Group did not operate with a maximum bonus opportunity until 2015
• No long-term incentive plan vested during these years.
Consequently, we have simply included the total remuneration in each of the relevant years, while also setting out details of 
the bonus each actually received based on performance in these years (the bonus level for 2016 being £nil).

These amounts are calculated using the same methodology as that used to produce the single figure table. This includes a

of the variance across the six-year period for Sir David Howard.
How any change in pay of the Chief Executive Officer between 2015 and 2016 compared to the wider workforce
In accordance with the Regulations, we must disclose the percentage change in the certain elements of the Chief Executive 
Officer’s pay (namely salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus) compared to the average percentage change in the same 
pay elements for all employees.

Benefits
An explanation of the benefits received by the Executive Directors can be found in the policy table on pages 70 to 71. In 
summary, the benefits received by Executive Directors comprise a car allowance, private medical cover and telephone.
For the Non-executive Directors amounts reported relate to expenses such as travel and accommodation expenditure 
incurred on Group business. While these payments are the reimbursement of expenses and not benefits per se, they are 
included as being a payment which is subject to tax. Sir David Howard also receives benefits relating to provision of a car.
Annual bonus outcomes for 2016
As there was only a small adjusted profit before tax, the Remuneration Committee determined that no annual bonuses 
were to be paid to the Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 March 2016.
As described above, Anthony Scott received a payment pursuant to a legacy profit sharing arrangement relating to his 
prior role as an active investment manager before joining the Board; this reflected his continuing client relationship 
management responsibilities. The precise terms of this arrangement are commercially sensitive and therefore will not 
be disclosed.
Pensions
The current Executive Directors participate in money purchase arrangements. Contributions have been made into a SIPP for 
Anthony Scott and are taken as a salary supplement by the other Directors. Details of the levels of pension arrangements 
can be found in the summary policy table on pages 70 to 71.
Sir David Howard is a member of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme which provides for a pension equal to 1/60th 
of final salary (as defined) for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 40/60ths. The scheme has a normal 
retirement age of 65.
Sir David has now passed the age of 65 but is not drawing a pension from it. Instead his pension entitlement is 
accumulating by a figure determined in each case in accordance with the rules of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension scheme. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 82

a)  The accrued pension entitlement shown is that which would have been paid annually on retirement based upon pensionable 
service to the end of the financial year (or date of leaving the pension scheme if earlier), excluding any future statutory 
entitlement to increases prior to retirement which would be due after the financial year.
b)  Sir David Howard is above his normal retirement date, therefore, the accrued pension entitlement shown as at 
31 March 2016 is that at his age on 31 March 2016 and not at his normal retirement date. The increase in the accrued 
pension entitlement over the period is due to late retirement factors being applied to his benefits.
c)  E Michael Clark transferred out of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme during the year. The cash transfer value of 
his pension amounted to £4,149,000.
Share awards
Save As You Earn
In 2016, the Company operated three Save As You Earn schemes, which were open to all employees and Executive 
Directors once they met the necessary service requirements. Options were offered at a discount of 15% to the average 
of the mid-market closing price for the three days prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months 
commencing three years after the saving contract commencement date. In common with similar schemes, the exercise 
of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions.

true underlying financial performance is being measured. The Committee approved these performance measures as they 
are directly linked to the objectives of driving growth and improved quality of profits, thereby enhancing shareholder value 
and providing a clear ‘line of sight’ for participants between performance and reward. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 85
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The performance conditions applying to the 2017 awards will also relate to (1) adjusted EPS targets for 50% of the award, 
and (2) margin targets for the other 50% of the award, both measured based on performance in 2018/19. The details of 
these targets are shown in the tables below:
Adjusted EPS to 31 March 2019 Portion of award vesting
Above 25p 100%
Between 20p–25p Prorata on straight line basis between 20% and 100%
20p 20%
Below 20p 0%
Margin to 31 March 2019 Portion of award vesting
Above 15% 100%
Between 10%–15% Prorata on straight line basis between 20% and 100%
10% 20%
Below 10% 0%
 
Directors’ interests
As explained in the Directors’ remuneration policy, the Executive Directors are subject to Share Ownership Guidelines and 
they are required to retain 50% of shares (net of tax) which vest under the PSP or bonus deferral arrangement until such 
time as they hold shares worth 100% of salary. There is no requirement for Non-executive Directors to hold shares in the 
Company. The shareholdings of each Director, together with whether they would have achieved the guideline requirements 
by 31 March 2016 (only including shares beneficially owned, that is excluding unvested share awards and shares ‘otherwise 
held’), are as follows:
Beneficially held 
as at 31 March 2015 
or appointment if earlier
Beneficially held

Risk management framework
Risk governance
A detailed description of the Board and its Committees 
can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the 
Annual report and accounts. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for management 
of the risks to which the Group is exposed and ensuring 
appropriate control systems are in place.
Whilst not a Committee of the Board, the Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) Committee has an important role in the 
risk governance framework. This Committee meets monthly 
and is attended by the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Executive 
Officer and internal audit. The Committee operates a 
thematic process whereby all departments across the 
Group are invited to talk about the key risks and control 
environment in their respective areas. The Committee 
members also review metrics prepared by the Risk 
department and where appropriate, any issues raised 
in this forum are escalated to the Executive Committee, 
Risk Committee or the Board.
Risk appetite
The Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) is fundamental to the 
Group’s risk management process and helps drive the 
risk identification, measurement and monitoring/reporting 
processes. The RAS sets out a number of quantitative 
and qualitative measures used to measure and monitor 
current risk levels against the agreed level of risk the 
Group is prepared to accept in order to achieve its 
business objectives. 
Risk identification and assessment 
The Group uses a number of tools to identify and assess the 
risks to which it is or may be exposed, including deep dive 
business reviews with all business and support areas across 
the Group and scenario workshops.
Risk measurement and monitoring
The Risk function provides management information on 
our key risks to the ERM Committee, the Risk Committee 
and the Board.
Control and risk assurance
Charles Stanley is committed to propagating a culture of 
risk awareness and ensuring all staff are responsible for 
managing and mitigating risk in their day-to-day roles 
through the three lines of defence model.
During the year, internal audit performed a review of the 
Risk function. The Risk Committee endorsed all of its 
recommendations which will be implemented.

Directors’ report
Change of control
The Company does not have agreements with any Director 
or Officer that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a change of control following 
a takeover bid, except that the provisions of the Company’s 
share plans may cause options and awards granted under 
such schemes to vest on a takeover.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and 
awards would normally vest and become exercisable for 
a limited period of time upon change of control following 
a takeover, reconstruction or winding up of the Company 
(not being an internal reorganisation), subject at that time 
to rules concerning the satisfaction of any conditions.
Share capital
As at 31 March 2016, 50,723,212 fully paid ordinary shares 
of 25 pence each were in issue and listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. The rights and obligations attaching to 
the Company’s ordinary shares are as follows:
• In terms of voting, every member who is present in person 
or by proxy at a general meeting of the Company should

Governance / Directors’ report
Controlling shareholder
As Sir David Howard, his family and connected interests 
are able to exercise votes over more than 30% of the total 
issued capital, they are deemed to be a controlling 
shareholder under the Listing Rules (LR) of the Financial 
Conduct Authority. In accordance with the requirements 
of the LR the Board confirms that:
1.  the Company has entered into a Relationship Agreement 
as required by LR 9.2.2AR (2)(a) (the Agreement)
2. (i)  the Company has complied with the independence 
provisions included in the Agreement during the 
period under review
 (ii)  so far as the Company is aware, the independence 
provisions included in the Agreement have been

controlling shareholder and/or any of its associates
 (iii)  so far as the Company is aware, the procurement 
obligation included in the Agreement has been 
complied with during the period under review by 
the controlling shareholder.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. Each of the 
Company’s Executive Directors has options as detailed 
in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 82 to 83, 
which are exercisable from January 2018 should the options 
vest subject to the performance conditions pursuant to the 
Long Term Incentive Scheme. With regard to the appointment 
and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed 
by its Articles of Association, the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. 
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended 
by a special resolution of the Company’s shareholders. 
Copies of the Articles of Association can be obtained from 
Companies House or by writing to the Company Secretary.
The Directors propose to renew the authority granted to 
them at the Annual General Meeting held in 2015 to allot 
equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of 
£4,226,934 (the ‘section 551 authority’). If approved at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the authority will 
expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the 
resolution is passed, or at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting to be held in 2017, whichever is the earlier.

Governance / Company information Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 93
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and Regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Parent Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under the law the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the 
Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and appropriate
• State whether they have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and Regulations, the Directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ 
report, Directors’ remuneration report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that comply with that law and 
those Regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and responsibilities 
are listed in the Corporate Governance report, confirm that, 
to the best of their knowledge:
• The Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole
• The annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy
• The Strategic report and financial statements include 
a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Charles Stanley 
Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2016 set out on 
pages 98 to 156. In our opinion: 
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2016 and of the Group’s loss for the year 
then ended
• The Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRSs as adopted by the EU) 
• The Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006
• The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion on the financial statements 
the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of significance, 
were as follows: 
Carrying amount of goodwill: £16.0 million 
(2015 £16.0 million): No change in risk profile
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee report), 
page 106 (accounting policy) and pages 127 to 129 
(financial disclosures).
The risk
The consolidated statement of financial position includes 
a significant goodwill balance. The carrying amount of 
goodwill could be materially misstated if inappropriate 
judgements and estimates were used by the Directors in 
calculating the recoverable amount for each cash 
generating unit (‘CGU’) as part of their impairment 
assessment. The Charles Stanley Direct CGU represents 
the most significant singular element of the goodwill 
balance whilst goodwill associated with different 
investment management teams’ accounts for the 
majority of the remaining balance.
Charles Stanley Direct remains at an early development 
stage. Forecasting future revenues and associated costs 
is inherently judgemental and accordingly there is an 
increased risk that there could be a material difference 
between the revenues and costs used to ascertain the 
recoverable amount and the actual revenues and costs. 
The directors have considered the forecast cash flows of this 
CGU in adopting a value-in-use approach to assess whether 
the current recoverable value supports the goodwill balance 
of £5.2 million.
Our response
Our audit procedures in relation to Charles Stanley 
Direct included testing the Group’s assessment of the 
recoverable amount by comparing the Group’s assumptions, 
including revenue and cost growth rates, and discount 
rates, to externally derived data such as publically available 
financial statements for companies in a similar industry, 
as well as our own assessments based on our knowledge 
of the Group and the industry. 
Audit procedures in relation to goodwill associated 
with investment management teams involved assessing 
management assumptions in relation to the fair value less 
costs to sell calculations. We considered the appropriateness 
of key inputs used in the valuations such as revenue multiples 
and percentage of FuM and undertook sensitivity analysis 
and stress testing of each assumption.
We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures in 
note 15 appropriately reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of goodwill.
Valuation of defined benefit pension net liability: 
£10.1 million (2015 £13.1 million): No change in risk profile
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee report), page 109 
(accounting policy) and pages 119 to 122 (financial disclosures).
The risk
Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’s 
defined benefit scheme and changes in assumptions and 
estimates used to value the Group’s net pension deficit can 
have a significant effect on the results and financial position 
of the Group. 
Any changes in the obligation of the scheme to its 
members may also materially impact the actuarial liability, 
and therefore the net deficit of the scheme to be recognised 
on the Group balance sheet.  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 95
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Our response
Our audit procedures included using the support of our own 
actuarial specialists to challenge the key assumptions and 
estimated inputs used in the calculation of the pension 
liability. The key assumptions and estimates we tested 
included the discount rate, inflation, salary growth and life 
expectancy. This included a comparison of key assumptions 
against externally derived data and our benchmark ranges 
for similar schemes.
During the year the pension scheme amended its inflation 
indexation benchmark from the Retail Price Index (RPI) to 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This resulted in a reduced 
actuarial valuation of the defined benefit obligation. 
We reviewed the communication with the members of 
the pension scheme from the Trustees as part of our 
assessment as to whether such amendments were 
indicative of a revised constructive obligation.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosure 
in note 10 to the financial statements.
Accrual of transition bonus: £1.4 million (2015 £nil)
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee report), page 109 
(accounting policy) and page 123 (financial disclosures).
The risk
The Group is currently undergoing a strategic review of 
remuneration arrangements with its front office investment 
management professionals. As part of the transition to the 
revised remuneration and fee-sharing arrangements which 
the Group anticipates to be in place for the financial year 
ended 31 March 2018, it has agreed with certain investment 
professionals that fee-sharing arrangements for the current 
year ended 31 March 2016 will be amended. The calculation 
of this one-off transitional arrangement can have a 
significant effect on the results and financial position of the 
Group. This is a new risk for the year ended 31 March 2016, 
on the basis that the transitional bonus arrangement was 
not in place for the previous year. It is not expected to be a 
recurring risk.
Our response
Our audit procedures included reviewing and testing 
management’s calculation of the transitional fee-sharing 
payment in light of the communications that have been 
made to the investment professionals regarding the payment. 
We recalculated a sample of transition bonuses allocated to 
individual investment managers having regard to the Funds 
under Management and Administration associated with the 
client (and which provide the basis of any calculations). 
In addition, where bonuses have been paid post year-end 
we have agreed a sample to remittances and to the 
bank account.
3.  Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £700,000 (2015: £700,000), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of Group revenue of which it 
represents 0.5% (2015: 0.5%). We consider Group revenue 
to be a more appropriate benchmark in the current year as 
the Group has incurred losses and revenue is the principal 
consideration for members of the Company in assessing the 
financial performance of the Group. 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £35,000 
(2015: £40,000) in addition to other audit misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
The Group audit team performed the audit of the Group as 
if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. 
The audit was performed using the materiality levels set 
out above, covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group 
loss before taxation, and total Group assets and was all 
performed at the Group’s head office in London. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 96
4.  Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 
• The information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the financial statements.
5.  We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to: 
• The Directors’ statement of viability on pages 38 to 39, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the Directors’ assessment and expectations 
of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years 
to March 2019; or 
• The disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6.  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have identified other information in the Annual report 
that contains a material inconsistency with either that 
knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• We have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
• The Audit Committee report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• The Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
• We have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing rules we are required to review: 
• The Directors’ statements, set out on pages 38 to 39, 
in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
• The part of the Corporate Governance Statement on 
page 61 relating to the company’s compliance with the 
11 provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 March 2016
1. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the presentation of these financial statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
1.1 Basis of accounting
The Group’s consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements are presented and prepared 
on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union and IFRIC Interpretations (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS.
The Directors assessed the going concern of the Group in light of its current trading performance. The Directors looked at 
the forecasts covering the 18-month period from 31 March 2016 to 30 September 2017 and applied stress tests for adverse 
scenarios, which had been determined as part of the ICAAP process. As a result it was determined that the Group has 
enough liquidity to cover all anticipated payments. The Directors also considered the regulatory capital of the Group 
and determined that, based on the forecasts, the Group has sufficient regulatory capital for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Further details are 
contained in the Corporate Governance report on page 58.
Certain comparative figures have been amended to conform with current period presentation.
The Group and Company financial statements are preserved in GBP and all values are rounded to the nearest one 
thousand pounds (£000), except when otherwise indicated.
1.2 Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified by the revaluation of 
land and buildings, available for sale financial investments, and financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit and loss.
1.3 Consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated 
from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed 
at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority 
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
1.4 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of the Parent Company that makes strategic decisions.
Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-maker include items directly attributable to a segment 
as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 106
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
1.5 Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated into GBP using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.
1.6 Property, plant and equipment
Freehold property is shown at fair value, based on periodic valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent 
depreciation for buildings. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying 
amount of the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. All other property, plant and 
equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other 
repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of freehold property are credited to other reserves in shareholders’ 
equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged against other reserves directly in equity; 
all other decreases are charged to the income statement.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost or 
revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Freehold and leasehold properties 3 to 50 years
Vehicles 3 years
Furniture, fittings and equipment 3 to 1 0 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. 
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
within ‘gain on sale of business’ in the income statement.
When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
1.7 Intangible assets
1.7.1 Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable 
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in 
‘intangible assets’. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount 
of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to 
those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, 
identified according to operating segment.
1.7.2 Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Those customer relationships acquired outside of a business combination are initially recognised at cost. The customer 
relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using 
the straight line method over their useful lives estimated at ten years.
1.7.3 Internally generated software
Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware or has been developed internally by the Group is 
recognised as an intangible asset when the Group is expected to benefit from future use of the software and the costs are 
reliably measurable. Computer software costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their 
useful lives (three years). Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 107
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
1.8 Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets, such as goodwill, are regarded as having an indefinite useful life when there is no foreseeable limit 
to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. These assets are not subject 
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs).
Fair value less costs to sell is established based on recent public transactions for similar businesses. If the carrying amount 
relating to any CGU exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, a value in use is calculated using a discounted cash flow method. 
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment 
at each reporting date.
1.9 Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use.
1.10 Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, 
and available for sale. The classification depends on the nature of the instruments and the purpose for which the financial 
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
1.10.1 Classification
1.10.1.1 At fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in 
this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Assets in this category are classified as 
current assets.
1.10.1.2 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting 
period which are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables 
and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.
1.10.1.3 Available for sale
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of 
the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to 
dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
1.10.2 Recognition and measurement
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to 
purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not 
carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised 
at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the 
rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 108
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
1. Significant accounting p olicies (continued)
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ are presented 
in the income statement within ‘gain on sale of business’ in the period in which they arise. Dividend income from financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income statement as part of other income when the Group’s 
right to receive payments is established.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in 
equity are included in the income statement as ‘gains and losses on available for sale assets’.
Interest on available for sale securities calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement 
as part of finance income. Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in the income statement as 
part of other income when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.
1.11 Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group 
of financial assets is impaired.
1.11.1 Assets classified as available for sale
These include listed and unlisted securities. The cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost 
and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from 
equity and recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in the separate income statement on equity 
investments are reversed through equity. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of debt instrument classified as available 
for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised 
in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the separate income statement.
1.12 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from clients and other counterparties for services performed in the ordinary course of 
business. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment.
1.13 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash held at call with banks.
1.14 Segregated funds
Segregated funds are held in trust by the Group on behalf of clients in accordance with the Client Asset Rules of the FCA and 
the corresponding liability to clients is not shown in the statement of financial position.
1.15 Trade payables
Trade payables consist of amounts payable to clients and other counterparties and obligations to pay suppliers for goods 
or services in the ordinary course of business. Account payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 
one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
1.16 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are valued subsequently at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
1.17 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity. In this case the tax is recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 109
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date in the UK.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax 
is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is not provided on temporary timing differences arising on goodwill as the temporary timing difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
1.18 Employee benefits
1.18.1 Pension obligations
The Group operates two pension schemes – a defined benefit and a defined contribution scheme. A defined contribution 
plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay employees the 
benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Defined benefit plans define an amount of pension 
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service 
and compensation.
The net charge to the income statement mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit 
asset or liability and is presented in operating expenses.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of 
the defined benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit 
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of 
the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of 
AA credit rated corporate bonds that have terms of maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Remeasurements of the defined benefit obligation arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions 
are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are 
recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans 
on a mandatory contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are 
recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
1.18.2 Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. Payments made in advance of services being provided are treated as prepayments.
1.19 Share-based payments
The Group operates various equity-settled share-based payments schemes. There is a Save As You Earn scheme and a 
Long-Term Incentive Plan under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments 
(share options or share awards) of the Group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of  Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 110
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
the share options or share awards is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the share options or share awards granted on the grant date:
• Including market performance conditions
• Excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, 
sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period)
• Including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share options or share awards that are 
expected to vest.
The total employee expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share 
options or share awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact  
of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the share options or share awards are exercised the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any 
directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the share 
options or share awards are exercised.
1.20 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of VAT, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within 
the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the entity, and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below. 
The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction 
and the specifics of each arrangement.
1.20.1 Commission
Commission income and expenses are recognised on a trade date basis.
1.20.2 Fees
Investment management, administration and corporate finance retainer fees are recognised evenly over the period the 
service is provided. Corporate finance success fees are recognised when earned.
1.20.3 Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
1.20.4 Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
1.21 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis 
over the period of the lease.
Leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement date at the lower of fair value of the leased property and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance 
balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term 
payables. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful 
life of the asset and the lease term. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 111
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
1.22 Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
1.23 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less, where appropriate, provision for impairment.
1.24 Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly 
distinguished from the rest of the Group, and which:
• Represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations
•  Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
• Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be 
classified as held for sale.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income is represented as if the opinion had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
1.25 Changes in accounting policies
Except for the changes below, the Group has consistently followed the same accounting policies, presentation and methods 
of computation in these consolidated financial statements as applied in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended 31 March 2015.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for periods beginning on or 
after 1 April 2016. The following new standards are not applicable to these financial statements but are expected to have 
an impact when they become effective. The Group plans to apply these standards in the reporting period in which they 
become effective.
1.25.1 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 replaces the existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement. It includes revised 
guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 is only effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group did not apply early adoption.
1.25.2 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. 
It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 
Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 is only effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group did 
not apply early adoption.
1.25.3 IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases. It eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases. Any leases 
with more than 12 months’ term are to be recognised as a lease asset on the balance sheet and the related future lease 
obligations as a liability. IFRS 16 is only effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group did not 
apply early adoption. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 112

The Directors believe that a truer reflection of the performance of the Group’s ongoing business is given by the measure 
of Core Business earnings per share. Core Business comprises the Group’s four main operating divisions: Investment 
Management Services, Asset Management, Financial Planning and Charles Stanley Direct. This measure is also followed 
by the analyst community as a benchmark of the Group’s ongoing performance.

Share options and share-based payment
The Group recognised total expenses of £134,151 (2015: £50,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Long-term Incentive Plan
In previous year, the Board approved the implementation of a new employee share awards scheme, the Long-term 
Incentive Plan. Details of the general terms of this plan are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 72 to 73. 
Vesting will be subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. The performance conditions relate 
to the financial performance of the Group. The awards will be treated as equity-settled share-based payments. Shares will 
be granted to the holders, at no additional cost, when the awards vest, subject to performance conditions.

10. Employee benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of 
the Group in independently administered funds.
The Group also sponsors the Charles Stanley & Co. Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme (the Scheme), which is a funded 
defined benefit arrangement. This is a separate trustee administered fund holding the pension plan assets to meet 
long-term pension liabilities for some 70 past and 35 present employees as at 13 May 2014. The level of retirement benefit 
is principally based on salary earned in the last three years of employment prior to leaving active service and is linked to 
changes in inflation up to retirement.
The plan is subject to the funding legislation, which came into force on 30 December 2005, outlined in the Pensions Act 
2004. This, together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, and Guidance Notes adopted by the Financial 
Reporting Council, set out the framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension plans in the UK.
The trustees of the plan are required to act in the best interests of the plan’s beneficiaries. The appointment of the 
trustees is determined by the plan’s trust documentation. It is policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated 
by the members.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 13 May 2014 in accordance with the scheme funding requirements 
of the Pensions Act 2004 and the funding of the plan is agreed between the Group and the trustees in line with 
those requirements. These in particular require the surplus/deficit to be calculated using prudence, as opposed 
to best estimate actuarial assumptions.
The actuarial valuation showed a deficit of £4,200,000. The Group has agreed with the trustees that it will aim to eliminate 
the deficit over a period of 8.5 years from 13 May 2015 by the payment of annual contributions of £350,000 (increasing at 
3% p.a.) in respect of the deficit. In addition and in accordance with the actuarial valuation, the Group has agreed with the 
trustees that it will pay 29.0% (including member contributions at a rate of 3%, except for Directors) of pensionable earnings 
in respect of the cost of accruing benefits and will meet expenses of the plan and levies to the Pension Protection Fund.
For the purposes of IAS 19 the actuarial valuation as at 13 May 2014, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary, 
has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 March 2016. During the year, the Group switched from Retail Price Index 
(RPI) to Consumer Price Index (CPI) when calculating the future benefits augmentation allowance which is in line with recent 
industry practice. The Scheme was closed to future service accruals during the year.

The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 March 2016 are 85% of the standard tables S2PxA, Year of Birth, no age rating for 
males and females, projected using CMI_2015 converging to 1.00% p.a. These imply the following life expectancies:
Life expectancy  
at age 65 (years)
Male retiring in 2016 23.2
Female retiring in 2016 25.2
Male retiring in 2036 24.5
Female retiring in 2036 26.7
Analysis of the sensitivity to the principal assumptions of the present value of the defined benefit obligation
Change in assumption Change in liabilities
Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% p.a. Increase by 4.6%
Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% p.a. Increase by 1.9%
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of 1 year Increase by 3.0%
The sensitivities shown are approximate. Each sensitivity considers one change in isolation. The inflation sensitivity includes 
the impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation, pension increases and salary growth. The average duration of 
the defined benefit obligation at the period ended 31 March 2016 is 19 years.
The plan typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and longevity 
risk. A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to 
plan liabilities. This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future 
income statements. This effect would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s bond holdings, and in 
qualifying death in service insurance policies that cover the mortality risk. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are 
in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation.
The best estimate of contributions to be paid by the Group to the plan for the period commencing 1 April 2016 is £358,750. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 123

During the year, the Board agreed revised interim remuneration arrangements with the Group’s investment managers 
in relation to their variable compensation. Part of this agreement involved moving the basis of the bonus calculation 
from being based on billed revenue to earned revenue. This has resulted in the Group bringing forward the recognition 
of bonuses on revenues that were accrued but not yet billed as at 31 March 2016. The additional amount recognised, 
which is included within wages and salaries in the above table, was £1,400,650. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 124

15.1 Goodwill
The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) are determined by first calculating the 
fair value less cost to sell. If the fair value less cost to sell is found to be lower than the carrying amount or is unavailable, the 
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The fair value less cost to sell calculations are largely 
based on a percentage of Funds under Management and Administration. Where this approach is not appropriate a turnover 
multiple is used.
The rates used in the fair value less cost to sell calculations are those implied by recent transactions in the market or, where 
appropriate, similar quoted businesses. When calculating the fair value less cost to sell, key assumptions were stress tested 
to determine whether the calculations were sensitive to a reasonable possible change in these assumptions.
The value in use calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on revenue and expense forecasts.
15.1.1 Investment Management Services
The recoverable amount of goodwill related to Investment Management Services was assessed using fair value less cost 
to sell for the year ended 31 March 2016. The fair value is determined based on a percentage of Funds under Management 
and Administration. The recoverable amount was determined to be higher than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
attributable to this CGU and an impairment charge was not required.
In the case of EBS Management Ltd, which falls under the Investment Management Services division, the assessment 
of the carrying value of the goodwill held in respect of the business was also carried out using the fair value less cost 
to sell methodology, however this was based on a turnover multiple as this was deemed the most appropriate measure. 
The fair value calculated supports the carrying value of the goodwill attributable to this CGU and an impairment charge 
is not required.
15.1.2 Financial Planning
The recoverable amount of goodwill relating to Financial Planning was assessed using fair value less cost to sell for the year 
ended 31 March 2016. The recoverable amount was determined to be higher than the carrying amount of the CGU and 
therefore the goodwill carrying value is adequately supported. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 129
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
15.1.3 Charles Stanley Direct
The goodwill attributable to this CGU was assessed based on a value in use calculation. This was based on the projected 
revenue and profitability of the business over the next four years. Charles Stanley Direct is forecast to continue growing 
Assets under Administration, client account numbers and revenues. 
The key assumptions used in the valuation were as follows:
Discount rate 10 %
Funds under Management growth rate £1 0 million per month
Operating costs  To remain relatively stable over the period
The recoverable amount arising from the value in use calculation was determined to be higher than the carrying amount of 
goodwill attributable to the CGU.
15.1.4 Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited
The disposal of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited to its management team was completed on 1 April 2016. 
The carrying value of the goodwill held by the Group in respect of this business was assessed against the terms of the 
transaction resulting in the recognition of an impairment charge during the year of £0.4 million. Allowing for the impairment 
charge recognised during the year, the goodwill held in respect of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited at the end of 
the year was of £1.1 million. As the disposal of the company was completed on 1 April 2016, the goodwill balance is shown as 
part of the assets held for sale in these financial statements.
15.2 Customer relationships
Purchases of customer relationships relate to payments made to investment managers and third parties for the 
introduction of customer relationships.

The fair value of listed investments is determined by reference to quoted prices on active markets. 
Listed investments include a £2.0 million (2015: £2.0 million) holding in gilts which is pledged to our clearing house. 
Unlisted investments include the Group’s holding of 6,030 shares in Euroclear plc for which no observable market data 
is available as to its value. The Directors believe it is appropriate to value this holding on a dividend yield basis.
Previous revaluation now realised on disposal amounted to £53,000 (2015: £62,000).
At 31 March 2016, the Group assessed its equity investment in Masterlist. The valuation was based on the Net Asset Value 
of the operating entity of Masterlist. In light of management information provided, the Group believes that the equity 
investment should remain at nil. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 134

The rights and obligations attached to the Parent Company’s ordinary shares are set out in the Directors’ report (page 89).
During the year 118,110 ordinary shares were issued fully paid for cash at an average price of £2.48 each following the 
exercise of options by employees. These shares had a nominal value of £292,528 and a total consideration of £292,854.
Moreover, 47,000 ordinary shares were issued during the year as part of a block listing, which are not reflected above, 
bringing the total issued share capital at the end of the year to 50,723,212.
In April 2015 the Group undertook a capital raising. 4,596,000 shares were issued at £3.55 per share. These shares had a 
nominal value of £1,149,000 and a total consideration of £16,315,800.
The merger relief reserve is used where more than 90% of the share capital in a subsidiary is acquired and the consideration 
includes the issue of new shares by the Group, thereby attracting merger relief under Section 612 of Companies Act 2006. 
The merger relief reserve arose on a placing of the Group’s shares and forms part of distributable reserves.

The Group’s exposure to currency and liquidity risk related to trade and other payables is disclosed in note 25.
The Group has received a small number of claims from individuals claiming to be former clients. Such claims are subject 
to close scrutiny by the Group and its insurers, with payments being made if considered valid following investigation. 
An amount of £3.5 million has been included within accruals, together with an insurance indemnification asset within other 
receivables of the same amount (note 19). The Directors do not consider there to be a net liability based on the experience to 
date other than the excess under the insurance policy which has already been charged to the consolidated income statement.
25. Fair values and risk management
Through its normal operations the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are market, 
credit and liquidity risks.
25.1 Market risk
This is the risk that arises from fluctuations in values of, or income from, assets or in interest or exchange rates. The Group 
only trades as principal for the purposes of executing client orders. Other principal positions may arise from dealing errors.
All position limits are monitored daily in accordance with policies determined by the Board.
The Group has small currency exposures. We run positions in a variety of currencies, principally the US dollar, to support 
clients’ dealing activities. Group policy requires any significant net exposures to be hedged using forward currency 
contracts as soon as a commitment is made.
25.1.1 Equity risk
The Group is exposed to equity market risk through its equity holdings. These comprise:
i) available for sale financial investments
ii) held for trading assets and liabilities
iii) the impact on investment management fees.
The Group has performed sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of a 10% increase or decrease in underlying equity prices. 
The results shown below are indicative of the impact at the year-end.
25.1.1.1 Available for sale investments
Note 18 summarises the available for sale investments held at the year-end date, and the disposals and fair value 
movements made in the year.
Approximately 50% of the Group’s available for sale investments are unlisted. A 10% increase/decrease in the Group’s 
investments would have an impact on reserves of £697,000 (2015: £705,000). Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 137
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
25. Fair values and risk management (continued)
25.1.1.2 Held for trading assets and liabilities
The Group’s exposure to market risk on its held for trading positions is monitored daily and reported to the appropriate 
Directors and senior management. Positions are monitored against limits set down by the Risk Committee. Any breaches 
of the limits are notified immediately to the Compliance Director.
A 10% increase/decrease in equity prices of trading assets and liabilities would increase/decrease profit in the consolidated 
income statement by £7,000 (2015: £10,000).
25.1.1.3 Investment Management Services fees
A 10% increase/decrease in equity prices would increase/decrease profit on investment management fees in the 
consolidated income statement by £4.0 million (2015: £3.9 million).
25.1.2 Foreign exchange risk
The table below summarises the Group’s currency exposure arising from unmatched monetary assets or liabilities not 
denominated in the Group’s functional currency:
Net assets
2016
£000
2015
£000
Euros 190 195
US dollars 619 490
Other currencies 31 391
840 1,076
The Group’s activities are primarily denominated in GBP and it does not enter into forward exchange contracts for hedging 
anticipated transactions. The risk of adverse currency movements for settlement of non-GBP trades on behalf of clients is 
not borne by the Group. The Group is exposed to currency risk for settlement of non-GBP trade suppliers and miscellaneous 
income streams. At 31 March 2016 these totalled £21,937 (2015: £23,629).
25.1.3 Interest rate risk
The Group has interest-bearing assets, principally in cash and cash deposits and available for sale financial assets, 
and liabilities including loan notes accruing interest at fixed rates. The Group views such exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
as immaterial. If interest rates had been 200 basis points higher, profit for the year would have been £1,103,000 higher 
(2015: £571,060). If interest rates had been 200 basis points lower, profit for the year would have been £135,000 lower 
(2015: £110,000).
25.2 Credit risk
This represents the risk of loss through default by counterparty. The most significant risk to the Group is either a client or 
market counterparty failing to settle a trade. Given the wide range of retail clients of the Group it is not considered that a 
material default by connected counterparties would arise. Other credit risks, such as free delivery of stock or cash, are not 
deemed to be significant as the Group has an effective credit control department to recover any monies or stock owed 
through default.
The Group monitors both the collateral requirements of individual client accounts, as well as any debit balances that occur 
if stock purchases are not settled on due date, or that are due to losses that have been incurred during client trading 
activity, on a daily basis.
Shares are only delivered free of payment to a client or their agents once settlement has been achieved and there is no 
outstanding debit balance on the account. In the event of an error, it will again be made immediately apparent the next 
day when both the debit balances and collateral requirements of clients’ accounts are monitored. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 138
Financial statements / Notes to the financial statements
25. Fair values and risk management (continued)
On occasion delivery of stock to a recognised professional counterparty may take place free of payment via an electronic 
settlement system, but only on prior confirmation from their custodians that the required funds in settlement will be wired 
to our appropriate bank account. There have been no instances where this has created an irrecoverable loss.
Exposures for trades that are outstanding beyond the contractual settlement date are monitored on a daily basis.
The Group has a Market Exposure Committee (MEC), comprising three Charles Stanley Group PLC Directors and other 
Charles Stanley senior managers as deemed necessary, that reviews exposures to market counterparties on a daily basis. 
The Committee also sets exposure limits to individual market counterparties.
Trade receivables represent monies due from clients and market counterparties. The Risk department undertakes reviews of 
new accounts and periodically reviews all counterparties.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with regulated financial institutions with investment grade credit rating. The list of 
approved banks is reviewed at least annually by the Treasury Committee. The Group has no concerns over the credit quality 
of these institutions.

(2015: £339,300).
25.3 Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to 
meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure such resources only at excessive cost.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents that is designed to meet the Group’s operational and trading 
activities. The Group does not use the wholesale markets for any funding and is confident that it has sufficient liquidity 
for the foreseeable future. At 31 March 2016 the Group had £48.1 million in bank accounts and accordingly a high degree 
of liquidity. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 charles-stanley.co.uk 139
Strategic report Governance Financial statements
25. Fair values and risk management (continued)
The Group’s liquidity risk is overwhelmingly short-term in nature and arises from the settlement of trades within the 
stockbroking business.
The Treasury Committee operates within strict policies and procedures approved by the Board, which include strict controls 
on the use of financial instruments in managing the Group’s risk. It is the Group’s policy to hold cash resources to meet 
obligations as and when they fall due.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various items including trade 
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. We review the credit quality of counterparties and 
we limit aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The majority of the short-term creditors arise from settlement of clients’ trading activities, and it is the policy to pay 
stockbroking creditors on Settlement Day or when the stock is delivered, whichever is later. The policy is also to pay 
suppliers in accordance with their payment terms.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and financial liabilities which are all repayable on 
demand or within three months.
25.3.1 Capital risk management
The Group is required to maintain an ICAAP which includes performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate 
level of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group needs to hold. The Group’s internal risk appetite is to maintain capital 
levels of at least 125% of the regulatory capital requirement. The regulatory capital resources for the Group are as follows:

25.3.2.2 Measurement of fair values
i) Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs
Financial instruments measured at fair value
The table below analyses recurring fair value measurements for financial assets.
 These fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to 
valuation techniques used. The different levels are defined as follows:
 Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the 
measurement date
 Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset either directly (that is, 
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
Level 3 – inputs for assets that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
Performance condition Valuation technique Significant unobservable inputs
Interrelationship between 
significant unobservable 
inputs and fair value
Equity Securities: Euroclear The fair value is determined 
by considering the dividend

dividend is determined

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
25. Fair values and risk management (continued)
The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. If one or more significant 
inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. Specific valuation techniques used to 
value the financial instruments grouped under level 3 include discounting future cash flows and calculating the dividend 
yield. All valuations performed are presented to the Group Executive Directors for final approval. Significant valuation issues 
are reported to the Group Audit Committee.
25.3.3 Equity securities – available for sale
The level 3 balance comprises amounts relating to holdings in unlisted investments. At 31 March 2016 these unlisted 
investments had a fair value of £3.2 million (31 March 2015: £3.3 million). Included within this balance is the Group’s 
holding of 6,030 Euroclear plc shares with a fair value of £3.1 million (31 March 2015: £3.1 million).
This fair value has been determined using a valuation technique that used significant unobservable inputs. 
For the Euroclear investment a 1% increase/decrease in the expected dividend yield would increase/decrease other 
comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of changes in equity by £20,000 (31 March 2015: £20,000).

27. Involvement with unconsolidated structured entities
The Group holds fund management contracts over various investment funds (all open-ended investment companies). 
These investment funds invest capital received from investors in a portfolio of assets in order to provide returns to those 
investors from capital appreciation of those assets, income from those assets or both. The investment funds are financed 
through the issue of units to the investors. The Group’s objective is to generate fees from managing assets on behalf of 
third parties.
The net assets of each fund are detailed below:

30. Contingent liabilities
Clients have taken legal action against the Group in relation to a member of staff misappropriating monies. The Group is in 
discussions with the clients on compensation claims. There is no direct liability to the Group as any compensation payable 
will be recovered from the Group’s civil liability insurance policy.
A recent ruling by the European Court of Justice indicated that under the European Working Time Directive, ‘normal pay’ 
for the purposes of calculating statutory holiday pay includes contractual commission as well as basic salary. The UK 
Employment Tribunal considered the implications for UK employers under the Working Time Directive 1998 and, as expected, 
has ruled in a similar manner to the European Courts of Justice, although it has also ruled that non-guaranteed overtime 
payments should be included for the purposes of calculating holiday pay entitlements. The decision by the UK Employment 
Tribunal is currently subject to appeal and, as yet, no hearing date has been set to consider it. Based on this information and 
advice to date, the Group does not expect the impact to be material. However, in the event that analysis, judgements and/or 
appeals are determined ultimately to be different, the Group may be exposed to a material additional liability. 
31. Commitments
At 31 March 2016, capital expenditure authorised and contracted for, but not provided in the financial statements, 
amounted to nil (2015: nil).
32. Post balance sheet events
The group completed the sale of Charles Stanley Financial Solutions Limited to CS Financial Solutions Holdings Limited 
representing the management team for a total consideration of £2.0 million on 1 April 2016. The consideration is to be 
satisfied by the payment of £1.5 million in cash and £0.5 million in loan notes repayable in equal instalments over three 
years on the anniversary of the completion date.
The Group has an investment and a loan in Runpath Group Limited (previously known as Masterlist) held as available for 
sale assets and non-current receivables. As at 31 March 2016 the carrying value of the investment, comprising 119,154 
ordinary shares, was £nil and the loan was £250,000. These had previously been impaired from their initial cost of 
£500,000 each. On 8 June 2016 the Group entered into an agreement to convert the loan in full into a further 119,154 ordinary 
shares and sell 25% of its enlarged holding for £290,000 net of expenses. An option has been granted to the purchaser of 
the shares to buy the balance up to June 2018. It is anticipated that the transaction will lead to both a realised profit on the 
sale of the ordinary shares and unrealised gain on revaluation of the loan note back to par immediately prior to conversion, 
and the ordinary shares to reflect the value now attributed to Runpath.
33. Key management compensation
The compensation paid to key management is detailed on page 80. Key management has been determined as the 
Directors of Charles Stanley & Co. Limited – the main trading subsidiary within the Group.

34. Reporting entity
Charles Stanley Group PLC (the Company) is the Parent Company of a group of companies (the Group) which provides a 
range of investment and financial services within the United Kingdom.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is 25 Luke Street, London EC2A 4AR.
35. Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements are presented in GBP which is the 
Group’s functional currency. All financial information presented in GBP has been rounded to the nearest thousand unless 
otherwise indicated.
36. Use of judgements and estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, and the Parent Company financial statements, management has 
made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis taking account of historical experience and future expectations.
36.1 Intangible assets and goodwill
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Company and the Group value goodwill and client relationships based on the 
valuation of individual units making up the relevant intangible asset in accordance with the accounting policy set out in 
note 1. These fair value calculations require the use of assumptions which are set out in more detail in note 18.
During the period the Group assessed the recoverable amount of the Charles Stanley Financial Solutions business and as a 
result impairment charges of £405,000 were recognised.
The recoverable amount of the Charles Stanley Direct goodwill was assessed based on the projected revenue and profitability. 
Two of the three different revenue streams are forecast to decline over the next two to three years, while the third stream 
(direct-to-client) is forecast to continue to grow Assets under Administration and client accounts. The recoverable amount 
of the Charles Stanley Direct goodwill was determined to be higher than the carrying amount and no impairment charge 
has been recognised.
The impairment charges were allocated fully to goodwill and are included in impairment of intangible assets and 
investments in the consolidated income statement. For further details on these impairments refer to note 15.
It was concluded that no other impairments to the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets are required.
36.2 Retirement benefit obligations 
In consultation with its actuary the Company and the Group make estimates about a number of long-term trends 
and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit scheme. These long-term forecasts 
and estimates are highly judgemental and subject to the risk that actual events may be significantly different from 
those forecast.
The valuation performed as at 31 March 2016 resulted in a decrease in the actuarial deficit of £3.0 million which has been 
reflected in these financial statements.
36.3 Available for sale assets and other receivables
Unlisted available for sale financial assets include an investment in Euroclear plc. The fair value of this investment has been 
estimated by the Directors using dividend yield.
During the year, the value of the investment and loan in Masterlist was reviewed based on the net asset value of the 
operating entity.
No new information has become available that would require a change in the valuation of any further unlisted investments. Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2016 148

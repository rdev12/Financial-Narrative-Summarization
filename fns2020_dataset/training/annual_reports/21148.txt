The year 
The last 12 months have been ones of 
considerable success for Auto Trader.  
These results are our strongest yet.  
We grew revenue by 10% year-on-year to  
£281.6 million. Underlying operating profit 
was £171.3 million, representing an increase 
of 19% over the previous year. From the 
growth in value we have provided to both 
retailers and manufacturers, to the increase  
in our consumer engagement and audience 
metrics, Auto Trader continues to lead the 
way in the digital automotive classified sector.
Life as a public company 
This was Auto Trader’s first year as a  
public company. The transition has been 
relatively smooth and is, in effect, complete. 
Fortunately, as the results indicate, it has  
not distracted the business from its focus  
on driving value for our customers.
Our Board 
Since our stock market flotation in March 
2015, we have appointed three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors to our Board. 
We welcome them all and appreciate the 
contribution they have already made. David 
Keens, formerly Group Finance Director of 
NEXT plc, has taken on the roles of Senior 
Independent Director and Audit Committee 
Chairman. Jill Easterbrook, until recently  
a senior executive at Tesco plc, has taken  
on the role of Remuneration Committee 
Chairman. Jeni Mundy, a senior executive  
at Vodafone Group plc, completes our new 
Board, bringing a huge depth of knowledge 
of the fast changing mobile data environment. 
All three serve on our Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination committees.
Tom Hall and Nick Hartman resigned from 
the Board in March 2016 under the terms of 
the relationship agreement with our previous 
major shareholder. The Board would like to 
acknowledge the major contribution they 
have made to the Auto Trader business, not 
least in migrating Auto Trader from a primarily 
print based business to an entirely digital 
business. At a personal level, Tom and Nick 
have been outstanding Board members and 
will be missed. 
Chip Perry, Independent Non-Executive 
Director, resigned from the Board in March 
2016. Chip has returned to a full-time  
CEO role at TrueCar Inc. Regrettably,  
he felt that the responsibilities of a CEO  
of a public company based in California  
were incompatible with the obligations of 
consistently attending Board meetings in  
the UK. However, he has kindly agreed to 
give us access to his unparalleled industry 
knowledge by continuing to help us in an 
advisory capacity.
The composition of the Board is now  
fully compliant with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Capital structure
As indicated at the time of our stock market 
flotation, we commenced paying a dividend 
in the year, with surplus cash being used to 
pay down debt towards a two times debt 
leverage target. Most of the cash generated 
this year has been used to pursue that goal, 
which we have achieved following the end  
of the financial year. 
Shareholders can anticipate a significant 
increase in the dividend during the coming 
financial year in line with our prior guidance 
and the Board aims promptly to return to 
shareholders the majority of the surplus  
cash generated by way of a share buyback 
programme, with some surplus cash being 
used to further reduce indebtedness.
Employee contribution 
I would like to take this opportunity to express 
my thanks to all the employees of Auto Trader 
for what has been an extremely busy, as well 
as successful, year.

Chairman

Market overview
The automotive market today
The UK automotive market continues to grow modestly.  
New car registrations maintain strong levels which is feeding used car growth. 
UK economy and associated 
macroeconomic conditions
The UK automotive market is intrinsically 
linked with the wider UK economy. 
The UK remains one of the fastest growing 
developed economies, with GDP growth for 
Q4 of 2015 ahead of expectations at 0.6% 
and annual GDP growth for 2015 of 2.2%.  
In 2016, the economy has returned to its 
pre-recession size and the IMF expects 
economic growth rates of consistently above 
2% over the next few years. However, the 
service sector is growing at a subdued rate 
and other sectors, such as manufacturing, 
are struggling. The UK also has a growing 
current account deficit, which is an indication 
of the vulnerability of the economy, and the 
uncertainty surrounding Britain’s membership 
of the European Union poses risks for sterling 
as well as trade throughout Europe.
Nonetheless, 2015 saw the return of consumer 
confidence, and retail sales in 2016 are 
growing strongly as households benefit from 
continued low interest rates and inflation.  
Low unemployment, rising earnings growth 
and a low oil price are also boosting spending.
UK automotive drivers
New and used car sale volumes
Worth approximately £90 billion, the new  
and used car markets are a substantial part  
of the UK economy. In 2015 it was estimated 
that there were 34 million cars in the UK,  
and 10 million car transactions. New car 
registrations have increased over the last  
four years, growing year-on-year for 50 of  
the last 51 months according to the Society  
of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (‘SMMT’). 
They reached 2.67 million units in the 12 month 
period to March 2016, exceeding pre-recession 
levels. New car transaction growth is translating 
into used car transaction volumes, with total 
transactions up 6% in the year to March 2016. 
Opportunities
• If new car registrations maintain their existing 
levels, this will mean a good supply of three 
to six year old used cars in the coming years, 
thus growing the used car market.
• An increase in the number of used car 
transactions generally means that our 
customers are performing well, allowing  
us the opportunity to provide more  
solutions to help them to manage and  
grow their businesses. 
• With continued low interest rates and more 
retailers offering PCPs on used vehicles, 
there is the opportunity to increase the 
overall frequency of car sales.
But it’s not just consumer confidence and 
economic recovery that are responsible for 
growth in both new and used car markets.  
The availability of competitive and diverse 
finance options (often heavily incentivised)  
has made it easier than ever to secure 
bespoke and affordable funding arrangements 
for new or used cars. Personal Contract 
Purchase (‘PCP’) agreements grew again as 
predicted, accounting for over three quarters 
of consumer new car deals and over a third  
of used car deals in 2016
1
, as financing used 
cars becomes an increasingly popular model 
amongst UK car buyers.

06 Changing consumer behaviour 
As digital technologies play an ever increasing 
role in our day-to-day lives, consumers expect 
to access information anywhere, at any time and 
on any device, and this includes researching and 
buying a car . As the UK’s largest digital automotive 
marketplace, we are able to observe how 
consumers research their next car online. 
Consumers spend on average nearly 1 1 hours
2
 
choosing the exact vehicle that is right for 
them. This shift online has created a ‘digital 
forecourt’, which allows consumers to make 
their car purchase decisions long before they 
set foot onto a physical forecourt. Our research 
tells us that twice as many hours are now 
spent researching used cars online as offline
1
. 
This in turn leads to fewer forecourts visited 
than seen historically, so it is key that retailers 
advertise all their stock online – if it is not 
online, it is effectively not for sale.
Auto Trader is uniquely positioned in the market and is well  
placed to take advantage of a range of growth opportunities.
Digital buying and selling drivers Automotive advertising drivers
Advert views 
Advert views increased by 7 .5% to 2.9 billion 
in the year. Advert views are click-throughs 
from initial search result pages and are  
the consumer activity measure most 
correlated to vehicle transactions between 
consumers and retailers. This means that 
more than 93 vehicles are being virtually 
inspected every second of every day on 
Auto Trader’s marketplace.
Transition of automotive advertising
In 2015 it was estimated that 72% of 
automotive classified spend was online 
3
.  
We expect this figure to increase further  
in the next couple of years. It is also worth 
noting that the overall automotive classified 
expenditure in 2004 was 40% greater  
than we see today (over £500m) so there  
is scope within the existing cost base to  
put a greater emphasis back on core 
classifieds, particularly with the more 
prominent role being played by digital. 
Beyond that, we estimate that we account 
for only a small proportion of a retailer’s 
gross profit. There is scope to grow this  
by increasing penetration of products that 
meet customers’ needs beyond core 
classified advertising, such as i-Control.
The traditional forecourt still has an important 
role to play, but it is no longer the primary 
destination for consumers to conduct their 
research – online marketplaces are becoming 
the most important part of the purchase 
journey 
1
. That research plays a significant  
role in which forecourt a consumer might  
visit (71% of buyers first visit a forecourt  
to test drive or transact on a specific car).
Consumers expect car buying to be like any 
other retail business. This demand is challenging 
the traditional way car ‘dealers’ do business. 
Dealers need to operate as digital retailers  
to adapt to these changes. Some already 
have, by adopting digital strategies to run  
their business. Many understand the need  
to implement multi-channel approaches,  
so that the online and offline experience for 
consumers is consistent and meets the needs 
of car buyers. More progressive car retailers 
also exploit data to run their businesses –  
key to enabling them to buy desirable stock  
for their area, at the right price and sell at 
market value.

Opportunities
• With the growing UK car automotive market 
coupled with consumers conducting the 
majority of their research online, we anticipate 
a growth in usage in our consumer valuations 
tool, something we are focused on embedding 
as a benchmark for the industry.
• Our research tells us that 64% of new car 
buyers visit Auto Trader
4
, meaning we are 
highly relevant to manufacturers. This is an 
area we believe we can add increased value 
to through our display advertising propositions.
• There is also the opportunity to use our 
market position to continue to develop 
products within and outside of our core 
classified offering to better meet the needs  
of consumers and therefore improve  
market efficiency.

UK car marketplace
There were over 10 million car transactions in 
the year to March 2016 of which 27% were 
brand new registrations from the manufacturers 
to a combination of consumers, fleet and lease 
companies and direct to businesses. According  
to IDC
1
, manufacturers spend £1.5 billion 
advertising their brand in the UK but only a small 
proportion of this is online, despite online being  
a key influencer in the purchasing decision. 
New cars are typically traded in after a  
three to four year period, entering a cycle 
between retailers, consumers and third-party 
intermediaries. Greater prominence of finance 
in new car transactions is reducing the time lag 
from new to used. These used car transactions 
make up 73% of the market and this is where 
our role is currently most prominent. 
With the largest and most engaged classified 
automotive audience, we help anyone listing a 
vehicle to connect with potential buyers. Our 
audience and volume of vehicles and retailers also 
mean we have the largest source of automotive 
classified data in the UK, which we believe we 
can use to better connect buyers and sellers 
in a more efficient marketplace. 
Although the diagram focuses on UK  
cars,our other markets (bike, truck, plant, 
farm, motorhomes and caravan markets,  
and Ireland) operate in a similar way. 
Outlook
Despite the continued likelihood of low  
interest rates, we note other commentators 
who anticipate that new car volumes will  
start to plateau in 2016 now that they have 
exceeded pre-recession levels. However,  
we expect used car transactions to continue 
to grow on the back of the new car strength 
over the last four years. 
The evolving nature of the consumer buying 
journey, driven by new technologies, continues 
to enhance the relevance of digital platforms. 
This creates continued opportunity for us to 
develop products and tools for retailers and 
innovative solutions for consumers to enhance 
the car buying and selling experiences and to 
increase efficiency and transparency in the 
marketplace. There is also still a significant 
opportunity to prove the value and relevance 
of our marketplace with manufacturers who 
currently spend only a small proportion of their 
annual budgets on digital marketing.

. Auto Trader is the primary 
destination in their search followed by  
a dealer’s own website. So the digital 
forecourt is now key for retailers to 
attract consumers to buy their cars. 
But how should they do this? What 
makes an advert stand out online? 
How can they increase their stock turn? 
These and other topics are covered  
by our Retailer Education and Insight

changing digital automotive landscape. 
The Retailer Education and Insight

reached over 17 ,500 representatives 
from the retailer community.

11 Our strategy is underpinned by 
leveraging the power of our data to 
improve the process of buying and 
selling vehicles through the application 
of digital technologies, ensuring the 
consumer experience is as smooth  
as possible and that retailers gain 
maximum value from the marketplace. 
Our customers operate c.13,500  
forecourts, over 1,900 of which currently 
use products in our Managing Pillar: 
i-Control and Retail Check. These are 
data driven products designed to help 
retailers buy the right vehicle at the  
right price, in order to optimise stock 
turn. This data is also a key driver of  
our consumer valuations tool on site. 
Around 13.7 million consumer 
valuations and 30.1 million trade 
valuations were conducted in the year 
to March 2016 as consumers look to 
find out what their car is worth in a 
part-exchange or private sale, as well 
as what price is required to secure their 
new car of choice, from either a trade 
or private seller.

i-Control is a unique data intelligence 
solution that helps retailers take advantage 
of the market’s most lucrative opportunities 
to sell more cars, by putting retailers in  
control of all the relevant data on every 
piece of their used car stock. 
“This is the first time I have used i-Control 
and I’m blown away by it, I think it’s 
fantastic. At my previous employers, 
without i-Control I had to go to Auto Trader, 
manually input my car, search my region, 
and check my competitors’ prices before 
updating my ads. Now I am able to filter 
independent dealerships out of my search, 
allowing me to compare my prices with my 
actual competitors’ quickly and effectively.”

Even in a culture  
that welcomes change  
like Auto Trader’s,  
this has been a truly  
landmark year.
Trevor Mather 
Chief Executive
7.5%
Growth in advert views
£1,384
ARPR up 10.5%
(2015: £1,252) Even in a culture that welcomes change 
like Auto Trader’s, this has been a truly 
landmark year. In our first year as a listed 
company, we have significantly increased 
both the consumer audience that visits 
our marketplace and their engagement 
on our sites. We have substantially 
increased the value we deliver to vehicle 
retailers and continued the transformation 
of the way in which we manage our 
customer relationships. Whilst doing 
this, we have delivered an outstanding 
performance, improving our revenue 
and Underlying operating profit to levels 
that exceeded initial expectations. 
Summary of operating performance
Our operating results reflect an excellent  
year for the business. Revenue growth of 
10% was achieved through the positive 
contribution of all three of our revenue 
streams: trade, consumer services and 
display advertising. 
Trade
In trade, we increased the value delivered  
to our customers through a greater number 
of cross platform visits, and higher levels  
of consumer engagement, resulting in 7 .5% 
growth in advert views – the equivalent of  
an extra six vehicles being viewed every 
second on the marketplace. 
Consumers spent over 676 million minutes  
a month on our site (March 2016) compared 
to 458 million a year previously. Our share  
of minutes spent on automotive digital 
classifieds rose to 85% (2015: 76%)
1
. 
Beyond the increased levels of response,  
we have further embedded the use of data 
driven products which aim to improve the 
day-to-day operational efficiency within our 
retailers’ businesses. Market conditions were 
buoyant, resulting in an increased number  
of transactions. This helped to increase the 
number of cars listed on our site as did a 
modest growth in average retailer forecourts 
to 13,514. Those contributing factors helped 
drive Average Revenue per Retailer (‘ARPR’) 
10.5% higher to £1,384 per month. 
Consumer services 
Growth in consumer services of 4% was 
pleasing in light of the increasingly competitive 
nature of this sector, aided by our motoring 
services products (offered to consumers at 
the point of purchase) which saw growth 
similar to the previous year. 
Display advertising
A strong display advertising performance 
continued the momentum from the  
previous year, with revenue up 23%. 
Improved relationships with agencies, 
combined with new, improved advertising 
formats, in particular homepage takeovers, 
were the main drivers of this growth.
Operating efficiencies
We seek to be as lean as possible and to 
enable our teams to be as productive as  
they can be, which generally requires fewer, 
but better paid people. This year we reduced 
our headcount (including contractors) from 
915 to 859. 
Our marketing spend grew to £15.7m – an 
increase of 2% above last year, well below 
our revenue growth of 10%. This moderate 
increase enabled us to drive all of our  
brand and audience initiatives, including the 
continuance of our 2015 brand-led campaign 
on TV, video on demand and online, and the 
introduction of a new marketing campaign 
focused on our online valuation tool, new 
part-exchange product and discovery search 
functionality (see overleaf for more details). 
Other costs and capital expenditure were  
in line with expectations.
Revenue growth, coupled with lower costs, 
delivered a 5 percentage points improvement 
in Underlying operating profit margin to 61%.
Our strategy
Our strategy is to provide the UK and Ireland’s 
leading digital automotive marketplace and 
help improve the process of buying and 
selling vehicles for consumers and retailers 
alike. Critical to this are a smooth online 
experience for consumers and the provision 
of data driven intelligence for vehicle retailers.

15 Chief Executive’s statement continued
Investing in innovation
Over the past year we have continued to 
innovate, in particular through exposing the 
key insights from our massive data sources.
There are over 80,000 variations of make  
and model of cars available to buy in the  
UK. Even for confident buyers, this is a 
bewildering choice. To help consumers 
decide which car they want to buy, this year 
we introduced a new way of searching for 
vehicles – ‘discovery search’ – which allows  
a buyer to search for cars if they don’t know 
the make or model they want, e.g. by the 
number of seats, fuel type or on price alone. 
Additionally we now have over 700 expert 
reviews of vehicles (an increase of 20%), 
which have received over eight million page 
views this year, and over 45,000 owner 
reviews on site, helping consumers compare 
and choose. These innovations have 
improved the value we provide to consumers. 
Part-exchange is the most efficient way  
for retailers to acquire stock. Our research 
shows that 81% of consumers
2
 said they 
would be more likely to consider part-
exchange if they could get a trusted price 
online for their car before turning up at the 
dealership. In order for us to help our retailers 
win in the marketplace and ultimately make 
the industry more transparent and more 
efficient, we launched a new part-exchange 
tool last year. Over 60% of all classified 
retailer adverts now feature the part-
exchange tool.
Consumers conducted 13.7 million valuations 
on Auto Trader during the year, an increase of 
38% from the previous year, receiving a real 
time retail value for their car. There were also 
30.1 million trade valuations conducted (2015: 
23.8 million) as we focus on embedding the 
insight we have into valuations across the 
marketplace, so they become the benchmark 
for both consumers and retailers. 
Putting data at the core
We have continued to develop our data  
driven products to help retailers manage  
their forecourts effectively in order to optimise 
their margin and stock turn, with over 1,900 
forecourts now using them. We continue to 
develop these tools and believe more retailers 
will take advantage of these products. 
Findings from Auto Trader’s Annual Car  
Buying Report found that of those consumers 
looking at classified sites in the new car buying 
process, 85% used Auto T rader and 48%  
said Auto Trader was the most influential 
source – twice as much as the nearest 
website
3
. To capitalise on this opportunity,  
we launched new bespoke branded content 
solutions so that manufacturers could use 
new formats and editorial partnerships  
to reach these car buyers. We have also 
innovated the format of the advertising we 
offer, including native adverts on mobile 
platforms, and have combined these with a 
data driven targeting solution powered by a 
new data management platform, allowing 
vehicle manufacturers to put their brand in 
front of the most relevant consumers at every 
stage in the car buying journey. This, coupled 
with our new branded content solutions and 
advertising formats, provides a compelling 
proposition for manufacturers. 
We focus on assisting media agencies to drive 
better return on investment for their clients 
from their marketing and on helping to improve 
the effectiveness of their retailer relationships.
Enhancing our organisational structure 
With the transition from print to digital 
complete, the last year has been one of 
greater organisational continuity than in 
previous years. However, we continue to 
make significant changes to improve our 
relevance to our market. 
Firstly, we brought together our audience 
acquisition and brand marketing functions to 
ensure that those who were responsible for 
growing our audience were also responsible 
for ensuring that that audience was engaged. 
Secondly, we have merged our retailer and 
consumer product teams, who now follow an 
end-to-end, test and learn product development 
approach. Across the business, we release 
over 50 software updates every week. 
Thirdly, we transformed our sales and  
service functions, integrating them together, 
and implemented a new ‘Challenger’ sales 
model across the organisation, which we 
believe will help us deliver the strategic 
consultancy relationship we strive for with  
our retailer customers.
The commitment and enthusiasm of our people 
are vital to our continued success, and 97% 
of employees have said that they would 
recommend Auto Trader as an employer
4
.
Outlook
The new financial year has started well. 
Based upon having the largest consumer 
audience, healthy relationships with our 
retailers, a robust car buying market, and  
a modest cost base decrease, the Board is 
confident of further growth in the coming year.

to learn more about our 
business model and how  
we deliver on our priorities.
 
Increase consumer audience, 
advert views and use of our 
valuation tools 
The network effect model calls for the largest and most engaged audience in order to  
drive the most advert views and ultimately sales of retailers’ stock. Offering useful services  
that help consumers to buy and sell easily, like the valuation tool, is essential to keep our 
marketplace relevant.
 
Promote trust and fairness  
in the marketplace
A trusted, fair and effective marketplace is core to the value we deliver to consumers, 
customers and manufacturers, who expect us as operator and custodian of the  
marketplace to ensure all participants benefit.
Grow ARPR in a balanced,  
sustainable way by creating  
value for our customers 
ARPR is our primary driver of revenue growth so the more balanced we can be across  
price rises, stock listing growth, product upsell and cross sell, the more sustainable our 
revenue will be in the long term.
Extend the penetration  
of products outside of our  
core classified proposition 
Leveraging our core business to meet the wider needs of retailers, helping them to remove 
inefficiencies and become more profitable, whilst providing Auto Trader with a material  
source of future revenue growth and a closer relationship with its customers.
 
Enhance our relevance  
and value to manufacturers 
64% of car buyers use Auto Trader in their search for a new car
1
. Given £1.5 billion is  
spent on new car advertising by manufacturers
2
 and only a very small portion is spent  
with Auto Trader, there is a huge opportunity to promote the relevance and value of our  
marketplace with this audience. 
Operate a simpler,  
leaner and more  
data-oriented business
Making our processes and procedures more intuitive and streamlined, together with 
harnessing the data from our marketplace which will benefit both our customers and 
employees. Creating a high-performing, continuously developing business will unlock 
opportunities and provide a truly digital experience for all.
We will simplify our 
business and integrate  
our assets
We will continuously  
improve and be brilliant  
at everything that is  
at our core
We will build a digital  
culture that is values  
driven, customer focused  
and data oriented

Key performance indicators continued
Definition
The measure of an FTE is the number  
of hours worked to constitute working  
on a full-time basis. If an employee works 
on a part-time basis they are taken as  
the pro-rated decimal in this calculation. 
Number of FTEs is reported internally 
each calendar month, which includes 
contractors, with the full year number 
being generated from an average of those 
12 time periods. 
Progress
People are an essential asset and 
attracting, retaining and developing that 
talent is at the core of our operational 
thinking. We also have a consistent drive 
to operate in a lean and flat structure, 
which upholds simplicity over complexity 
and has been the reason behind the 6.1% 
reduction in 2016 to 859 (including five 
contractors, 2015: 17 contractors).
Risks
     
Definition
Advert views are click-throughs from  
initial search result pages to see the  
more detailed specification of the vehicle. 
Research has shown that a higher level  
of advert views correlates with a higher 
number of retailer sales. 
Progress
7 .5% growth in advert views was good 
progress against 6.6% in 2015. In the year 
we delivered 2.9 billion of these virtual 
inspections, which means there was  
an average of 93 vehicles per second 
being viewed through an advert view.

The average number per month of retailer

on the Auto Trader marketplace over the 
financial year.
Progress
We expected marginal growth in 2016 and 
that was largely what we saw with 0.5% 
year-on-year uplift. Whilst barriers to entry 
have come down with the evolving online 
consumer journey, we have seen where 
customers have struggled because of  
that evolution. There has also been higher 
levels of consolidation of ownership in  
the franchise segment than seen in the 
previous three to four years, although  
the impact so far on forecourts has been 
negligible. It is worth noting that the 2.5% 
growth seen in 2015 was disproportionate 
as the previous method for billing made it 
advantageous for customers to combine 
sites to receive a discount, which was 
unwound in 2015.

Average Revenue per Retailer (‘ARPR’) is 
the average monthly revenue generated 
from retailer forecourts divided by the 
average number of retailer forecourts  
in the month. 
Progress
On the back of the added value we have 
driven to our retailers, we have surpassed 
expectations in terms of ARPR growth 
which was a key determinant in overall 
revenue performance. This added value 
was reflected in more advert views, more 
consumer visits and greater consumer 
engagement, which also helped us deliver 
our rate changes in a more effective way. 
We implemented some changes internally 
that helped improve trust and transparency 
in the market and changed how we work 
with our customers that had a positive 
impact on ARPR. In conjunction with  
our messaging about the importance of 
having a strong online presence, 2016 
also saw a good underlying market that 
helped support healthy levels of stock.

Trade revenue increased by 10% to £236.4m 
(2015: £214.8m) with Retailer revenue growing 
by 1 1 % year -on-year to £22 4.5m (201 5: £202. 1 m). 
Revenue generated from the Selling Pillar  
of classified advertising products increased 
11% to £200.0m (2015: £180.1m) representing 
89% of total retailer revenue (2015: 89%).
The majority of revenue growth was achieved 
through an improvement in monthly ARPR 
which rose 10.5% to £1,384 (2015: £1,252). 
Next year high single digit growth in ARPR  
is expected.
Whilst the average number of retailer forecourts 
per month was similar to last year at 13,514 
(2015: 13,452), we have strengthened  
our position with franchise groups whilst 
consolidating the gains made in the previous 
year in our independent retailer customer 
base. This has been achieved against a 
backdrop of consolidation of ownership in  
the industry and therefore we expect retailer 
forecourts to remain stable again next year.
The £132 increase in monthly ARPR was 
achieved from all four of Auto Trader’s growth 
drivers: stock, price, cross sell and up-sell. 
Across all vehicle segments the increase in 
paid-for stock listings accounted for 44% of 
the ARPR increase, with the average number 
of listings of vehicles on autotrader.co.uk 
increasing year-on-year due to continued 
buoyancy in the automotive market, retailers 
increasingly recognising the value of advertising 
all of their vehicles on our marketplace and 
operational improvements to help retailers  
list their stock of vehicles more easily. The 
implementation of a new billing system and  
a focus on rate harmonisation also helped  
to remove past allowances and discounts 
between paid-for and listed units of stock.
 
Price increases accounted for 31% of the 
growth in ARPR as we implemented rate 
changes linked to the value provided as  
well as continued harmonisation of rates to 
address legacy arrangements and anomalies. 
Cross sell of retailing solutions products 
contributed £15 to ARPR growth, diluted 
slightly by the decision to terminate a number 
of low margin products where we acted as  
a reseller. Cross sell growth of 11% was 
mainly driven by continued increases in the 
number of retailer forecourts that are using 
our data products, now around 1,900 retailer 
forecourts (2015: around 1,100).
Home Trader revenue increased 12% to 
£11.5m (2015: £10.3m) underpinned by a 
buoyant market and launches of a number  
of new, higher yielding packages which 
resulted in both increased volumes and yield. 
Other revenue fell £2.0m with the closure  
of our manufacturer website business,  
2
nd
 Byte, in June 2015.
Consumer services revenues increased 4% 
to £30.3m (2015: £29.0m). Private revenue 
grew faster than in previous years despite  
an increasingly competitive market, growing 
4% to £23.3m (2015: £22.5m). Whilst we 
benefited from a greater proportion of our 
customers opting to take higher yielding 
premium packages to increase the prominence 
of their advert, we also saw strong volumes, 
particularly in the second half of the year. 
Increased audience growth enabled us to 
deliver more leads to our partners resulting  
in an 8% growth in motoring services revenue 
to £7 .0m (2015: £6.5m). Overall we anticipate 
consumer services revenue will continue to 
grow moderately.
Display advertising revenue increased by 
23% to £14.9m (2015: £12.1m). An increase in 
average yield resulted from a greater demand 
for premium and bespoke products, with 
manufacturers and their agencies recognising 
the value in reaching our audience. Homepage 
takeovers increased in volume by over 75%  
in the year. Premium products accounted  
for 69% of revenue, up 3 percentage points 
on the previous year. Looking ahead to the 
opportunities the Group has in this area, the 
expectation is for continued revenue growth 
at recent levels.
Revenue
In 2016, revenue grew by 10% to £281.6m (2015: £255.9m). Growth in Retailer revenue  
was the main contributor to overall growth aided by continued improvement in Display 
advertising revenue.

Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit increased by 19% 
to £171.3m (2015: £144.1m) with Underlying 
operating profit margin improving by 5 
percentage points to 61% (2015: 56%).
The Group reports non-underlying items in 
the income statement to highlight the impact 
of one-off and other discrete items and to 
allow better interpretation of the underlying 
performance of the business. These include 
exceptional items, IFRS 2 charges in respect 
of share-based payments (and associated NI) 
and costs related to management incentive 
schemes linked to the previous private 
ownership of the Group.
In order to provide comparability of results 
from period to period, and with listed peer 
companies, the Directors consider Underlying 
operating profit to be the most appropriate 
indicator of the performance of the business.
Adjusted underlying EBITDA was previously 
used to reflect the underlying performance  
of the business as it reflected both the impact 
of non-underlying items and the change in 
approach to technology development 
implemented in September 2013. This 
resulted in less of the Group’s expenditure  
on internal development salaries meeting  
the requirements for capitalisation. As this 
approach to technology development has 
been consistent in both the current and  
prior periods, there is no need to make an 
adjustment for the change in approach to 
technology development. Adjusted underlying 
EBITDA continues to be used to calculate two 
of the Group’s key performance indicators: 
cash conversion and leverage; the former in 
order to be consistent with past reporting and 
the latter to match the definition of leverage  
in the Group’s Senior Facilities Agreement.
In its first full year as a listed company, the 
Group has implemented a Share Incentive 
Plan (‘SIP’), its first Sharesave plan (‘SAYE’) 
and a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’). As the 
Directors intend to implement additional PSP 
schemes in the future, the share-based payment 
charge is likely to increase year-on-year  
until a steady state of three PSP schemes is 
reached. Therefore, the Directors consider  
it appropriate to make an adjustment for  
IFRS 2 charges and the associated national 
insurance costs until the steady state is 
reached, most likely in 2018.
Management incentive plans and share-based 
payment schemes implemented under the 
previous private ownership have been disclosed 
as non-underlying in the prior year.
The table below provides a reconciliation 
from operating profit to Underlying operating 
profit and to Adjusted underlying EBITDA.

Adjusted underlying

Underlying administrative expenses (defined 
as administrative expenses before share-
based payments and associated national 
insurance, management incentive plans and 
exceptional items) reduced by 1% to £110.3m 
(2015: £111.8m) as the business continues to 
realise operating efficiencies.
People costs comprise staff costs of £51.1m 
(2015: £50.3m) and third-party contractor 
costs of £0.4m (2015: £1.4m). Redundancy 
and staff related restructuring costs are also 
included in people costs, other than those 
classified as exceptional items. Overall, 
people costs decreased by £0.2m to  
£51.5m (2015: £51.7m) with the full year  
effect of the office centralisation project 
leading to a 6% decrease in average FTEs 
(including contractors) to 859. Further large 
scale restructuring is not expected in the 
foreseeable future so changes in FTE levels 
will be more organic and steady rather than 
the step changes we have seen in the past. 
The decrease in people costs resulting from 
reduced FTE levels was offset in part by  
an increase in the average cost per FTE  
as we continue to recognise the importance 
of attracting and retaining high calibre 
employees who are fluent in digital.
Targeted marketing campaigns together  
with a shift towards product advertising 
contributed to audience growth in the year 
with cross platform visits up 3% to 47 .9m 
supported by marketing spend 2% higher. 
However, spend as a proportion of revenue 
fell in the year to 5.6% (2015: 6.0%).
Depreciation and amortisation decreased  
by 15% to £10.6m (2015: £12.5m) as past 
development costs became fully amortised  
in the year. 
With our cost base well under control  
and further reduction in depreciation and 
amortisation, we expect total underlying 
administrative expenses to continue to 
decline modestly next year and our 
Underlying operating profit margin to  
improve further.
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
30 Share-based payments
The Group has implemented a number  
of share schemes during the year and,  
in accordance with IFRS 2, has recognised 
a non-cash charge of £2.3m. National 
insurance costs of £0.2m have been accrued, 
where applicable, on the potential employee 
gains on share-based incentives granted.
In April 2015, all eligible employees were 
offered free shares under the SIP , valued at 
£3,600 each at the time of the award, and the 
Company also implemented a SAYE scheme 
for the benefit of Group employees with the 
grant made in September 2015. In June 2015, 
the Executive Directors and a number of 
senior management were granted nil cost 
options under the PSP .
The implementation of additional PSP 
schemes in the future, combined with 
implementation of the SAYE scheme only 
part way through 2016, means that the 
charge for share-based payments is likely  
to at least double in financial year 2017 .
Exceptional items 
In the previous year, the Group centralised 
into two offices and made provisions for 
future lease and dilapidation costs for a 
number of offices which were vacated. 
Following an initiative to exit these properties 
early, and to secure cash discounts where 
possible, the Group has successfully ended 
its commitment on seven properties in  
the period at a cost below that originally 
anticipated. As a result, an exceptional credit 
of £0.8 million has been recognised in the 
income statement following the release of 
provisions no longer required.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax increased to £155.0m (2015: 
£10.9m) reflecting the reported Operating 
profit performance whilst net finance costs 
decreased by £107 .6m to £14.6m (2015: 
£122.2m). The substantial reduction in finance 
costs was the result of non-recurrence of a 
significant exceptional item and the change  
in capital structure in the previous year that 
allowed the Group to operate with a lower 
level of less expensive debt. 
Taxation
The Group tax charge of £28.3m represents 
an effective tax rate of 18% (2015: 22%)  
which is lower than the average standard  
UK rate of 20% (2015: 21%). The principal 
reason for the difference was the release  
of a £2.0m historic current tax provision  
that is no longer required.

Exceptional cash outflows (excluding  
IPO costs) decreased by £5.5m to £4.3m  
(2015: £9.8m) as the restructuring and office 
centralisation project started in prior years 
were concluded. Investment in capital 
expenditure decreased by £6.0m to £3.1m 
(2015: £9.1m), as 2015 required £6.1m  
of fit-out costs for the new properties  
in Manchester and London. 
Net external debt decreased in the year to 
£392.6m (2015: £527 .9m) whilst our leverage 
ratio of net external debt to Adjusted underlying 
EBITDA decreased significantly to 2.2x, due 
to operating performance, improvement in 
cash conversion and reduced interest costs, 
offset by higher tax payable. During the year 
£147m of debt repayments were made using 
excess cash in order to reduce indebtedness 
and the cost of servicing debt.
Capital structure and dividends
On 29 July 2015, the Company completed  
a reduction of capital, whereby the entire 
amount outstanding on the Company’s share 
premium account was cancelled and the 
nominal value of each issued ordinary share 
in the capital of the Company was reduced 
from £1.50 to £0.01. The capital reduction 
created significant distributable reserves that 
are available for future dividends and returns 
to shareholders.
In line with the previously stated policy, the 
Directors are recommending a final dividend 
for the year of 1.0 pence per ordinary share, 
which together with the interim dividend makes 
a total dividend of 1.5 pence per share, 
amounting to £15.0m. Subject to shareholders’ 
approval at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) 
on 22 September 2016, the final dividend will 
be paid on 30 September 2016 to shareholders 
on the register of members at the close of 
business on 2 September 2016.
Since the end of the year, the Group has 
achieved net external debt leverage of  
circa 2.0x and so, in line with previous 
guidance, we expect to increase the future 
total annual dividend to circa 1/3 of net 
income. The Group will continue to invest  
in the business but given that our strategy  
is focused on organic growth, the Board’s 
intention is to use the majority of surplus 
cash, after taking account of dividends, to 
fund a rolling programme of share buy-backs, 
starting imminently. The expectation is that 
some surplus cash will be used to further 
reduce indebtedness.
At the 2015 AGM, the Company’s shareholders 
generally authorised the Company to make 
market purchases of up to 100,105,169 of its 
ordinary shares, subject to minimum and 
maximum price restrictions. This authority  
will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM 
and the Directors intend to seek a similar 
general authority from shareholders at the 
2016 AGM. The programme will be ongoing 
and any purchases of its shares made by  
the Company under the programme will be 
effected in accordance with the Company’s 
general authority to repurchase shares and 
Chapter 12 of the UKLA Listing Rules.

Risk management
The Board has carried out  
a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the 
Company, including those 
that would threaten its 
business model, future 
performance, solvency  
or liquidity. 
The Group risk register was 
reviewed by the Board, including 
an assessment of the likelihood 
and impact of each risk and the 
mitigating actions being taken. 
Risk levels were modified to 
reflect the current view of the 
relative significance of each risk. 
Recognising the value that our 
people bring to the business,  
the risks associated with the 
retention of employees was 
elevated this year. 
The principal risks and 
uncertainties identified are 
detailed on pages 36 to 37 . 
Understanding and managing  
our principal risks and uncertainties
We recognise that effective risk management is critical to enable us to meet  
our strategic objectives and to achieve sustainable long-term growth.
1. Identify risks
A top-down and bottom-up approach is used to 
identify principal risks across the business. Whilst 
the Board has overall responsibility for making 
sure that internal control and risk management  
are effective, the detailed work is delegated to  
the Operational Leadership Team (‘OLT’).
2. Assess and quantify risks
Risks and controls are analysed and evaluated  
to establish the root causes, financial impact and 
likelihood of occurrence. The Group categorises  
risks into six areas:
•  Economy, market and business environment.
• Financial and compliance risk.
• Asset risk.
• Operational risk.
• Competitive risk.
• Product specific risk.
3. Respond to, manage and mitigate risks
The effectiveness and adequacy of controls  
in place is assessed. If additional controls are 
required to mitigate identified risks then these  
are implemented and responsibilities assigned. 
4. Monitor and review
The OLT is responsible for monitoring progress 
against principal risks in a continual process.  
They are assisted by the Group’s internal audit 
programme in conjunction with Deloitte. 
The Board reviews the Group’s risk register  
and assesses the adequacy of the principal  
risks identified and the mitigating controls  
and procedures adopted.
Risk management process
We recognise that effective risk management is critical to enable us  
to meet our strategic objectives and to achieve sustainable long-term 
growth. The Board’s role is to consider whether, given the risk appetite 
of the Group, the level of risk is acceptable within its strategy. A four-step 
process has been adopted to identify, monitor and manage the risks to 
which the Group is exposed:

34 Assessment of prospects
Auto Trader is the UK’s leading digital automotive 
marketplace and it is the Group’s clear focus 
to maintain this position by relentlessly 
focusing on improving the process of buying 
and selling vehicles. During the year ended 
27 March 2016 the Group generated a  
profit before tax of £155.0m and was highly 
cash generative with operating cash flow 
from continuing operations amounting to 
£177 .0m. Taking into account the Group’s 
current position and its principal risks and 
uncertainties as described on pages 36 to 37 , 
the Directors have assessed the Group’s 
prospects and viability. 
The strategy and business model as set  
out on pages 17 to 19 are central to an 
understanding of its prospects. These factors 
provide a framework for the rolling three-year 
plan which is developed as part of the annual 
budget process and reviewed by the Board 
to assess the Group’s prospects. 
The three-year timeframe for assessing both 
prospects and viability is considered to be 
appropriate due to the following:
• it is consistent with the Group’s rolling  
three-year strategic planning process;
• projections looking out further than three 
years become significantly less meaningful 
in the context of the fast moving nature of 
the market; and
• it reflects reasonable expectations in terms 
of the reliability and accuracy of operational 
forecasting models.
The Group’s prospects are assessed 
primarily through its strategic planning 
process. This process includes an annual 
review of the ongoing plan, led by the  
CEO through the Operational Leadership 
Team and all relevant functions are involved.  
The Board participates fully in the annual 
process and has the task of considering 
whether the plan continues to take 
appropriate account of the external 
environment including technological,  
social and macroeconomic changes. 
The output of the annual review process is  
a set of operational priorities, an analysis of 
the risks that could prevent the plan being 
delivered, and the annual financial budget.
Detailed financial forecasts that consider 
profit, cash flow, funding arrangements  
and key financial ratios have been prepared 
for the three-year period to March 2019.  
The first year of the financial forecasts form 
the Group’s 2017 budget and is subject to  
a re-forecast process at the half-year. The 
second and third years are prepared in detail, 
and are flexed based on the actual results in 
year one.
Assessment of viability
The Board’s assessment of the Group’s 
prospects, as described above, has been 
made with reference to current market 
conditions and known risk factors. The 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group are outlined on pages 36 to 37 . 
Given the Group’s financial performance  
in 2016 and over recent years, the Board 
considers that the key factor which would 
prejudice the delivery of the Group’s  
financial objectives is a severe weakening  
of Auto Trader’s marketplace proposition  
and its leading market position. This could  
be caused by a loss of audience which 
results in a reduction in retailers and the level 
of stock listed on the marketplace or by a 
reduction in the number of retailers and stock 
which could then result in a loss of audience. 
Using the current strategic plan as a  
base case, alternative forecasts have  
been produced to model the effect on  
the Group’s liquidity and solvency of very 
severe combinations of the principal risks  
and uncertainties affecting the business. 
The viability model assumed a rapid 
deterioration in stock and audience over a 
short period of time. The number of customer 
retailer forecourts and the ARPR generated 
were significantly degraded in the model,  
but expenditure in the areas of marketing, 
payroll and technology were held steady. 
Revenue and profitability are clearly affected 
in this scenario, but the business remains 
cash generative.
Based on their assessment of prospects and 
viability above, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period ending March 2019.
Going concern
The Directors also considered it appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis, as explained in the 
Basis of preparation paragraph in note 1  
to the financial statements.
Viability statement
In accordance with Provision C.2.2 of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code,  
the Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Group.

37 Corporate social responsibility
Making a difference
Our culture is shaped by our 
values of: determination, reliability, 
curiosity, inspiration and humility. 
Throughout the organisation, 
these values manifest themselves 
in our fast-paced and highly 
customer-orientated approach, 
and in our commitment to  
being an exciting, innovative  
and digital-led company.
Overview
Across the business, we are led by a sense of 
purpose and a set of principles that foster an 
environment of trust, within which challenge and 
debate are encouraged and talent is recognised 
and nurtured. People are the Group’s most 
valuable resource and the success of the Group 
is to the credit of all its employees; this helps 
drive one of our strategic priorities of building  
a digital culture that is values-driven, customer-
focused and data-oriented.
Corporate social responsibility (‘CSR’) at Auto T rader 
is driven by our values and culture and is focused 
on making a difference. It comprises employee 
engagement, people development, health and 
safety, environmental impact, sustainability and 
energy efficient operations.
Auto Trader is a responsible employer and we 
are keen to give back to the local communities  
in which we operate, as well as supporting 
charities and causes that are close to our 
employees’ hearts. 
The ways in which we wish to make a difference 
in our community are focused on four areas: 
employees’ individual charitable efforts, customer 
charitable causes, local charitable support and 
community engagement through education and 
business mentoring. Auto Trader views these 
responsibilities as things that should be embedded 
in how we operate our business on a daily basis.

To help us achieve our mission of leading the

we have built a fast-paced culture that has 
innovation at its heart and is based around  
a strong set of core values. Our teams are 
focused on continually developing our site  
to ensure consumers get a great user 
experience as well as developing innovative 
products that will add value to our retailers. 
We value our people and their opinions.  
We organise an annual Employee  
Conference and hold regular business 
updates throughout the year to update 
employees on the Group’s performance  
and operating priorities as well as giving  
them an opportunity to ask questions.
Following the all-employee share incentive 
plan (‘SIP’) launched after our stock 
market flotation, a share save scheme 
(‘SAYE’) for the benefit of Group employees 
was implemented which not only recognises 
and rewards employees, but also promotes 
a culture of shared ownership.
This year the Company launched “Incredible 
Benefits” , a new way for employees to access 
all the benefits offered at Auto Trader in one 
place, enabling them to tailor their benefits 
package to meet their own specific needs. 
As well as our Company funded benefits, 
we offer a wide range of voluntary benefits, 
including childcare vouchers, health cash 
plan and critical illness insurance, that are 
proving popular amongst our employees. 
In recognition of our commitment to 
rewarding our employees, Auto Trader 
was voted number 13 in the UK for pay 
and benefits by Glassdoor, the UK’s 
fastest growing jobs and recruitment 
platform. The Group continues to focus  
on its highly engaged workforce, and on 
attracting and retaining the most talented 
individuals in the market. As part of the 
Group’s shift to a digital culture, the Group 
has not only been able to reduce its 
headcount (March 2016: 847 vs March 
2015: 876) but also retain a more 
technology and ideas-focused team.

to equip all employees with the necessary

We continue to deliver our three-day

a one team culture at Auto Trader. We 
have launched a “Learning Hub” which

At Auto Trader we aspire to be the UK’s

alike. Being admired is not an end in itself. 
But it matters because the only way to 
deliver the best services for our customers 
– and do the right things by our people –  
is to approach things in the right way.
Whether you’re in the workplace or away 
from the office on company business we 
all must behave professionally, ethically 
and legally, treating people with decency 
and respect. 
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to treating all of  
its employees and job applicants fairly and 
equally. It is our policy not to discriminate  
on the basis of their gender, sexual 
orientation, marital or civil partner status, 
gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, 
colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, 
disability or age, pregnancy or trade union 
membership or the fact that they are a 
part-time worker or a fixed-term employee. 
The equal opportunities policy operated by 
the Group ensures all workers have a duty  
to act in accordance with this.
Employees with disabilities
We welcome all applications for employment 
made by individuals with disabilities. Our 
dedicated Auto Trader Resourcing team will 
make reasonable adjustments in the recruitment 
process according to the needs of each 
individual to ensure that they can perform 
their best during the assessment stage. 
We are also taking part in the “Change 100” 
internship programme organised by Leonard 
Cheshire Disability offering one talented 
student with a disability a summer 
placement in our Manchester head office. 
We are dedicated to supporting  
employees that become disabled during 
their employment with us. We recognise 
that each individual is unique and we 
provide support and make reasonable 
adjustments to ensure they continue 
realising their full potential at work. 
We continue to offer training, career 
development and promotion opportunities 
by taking appropriate action related to the 
needs of the individuals to allow them to 
continue to have a fulfilling career with us.

41 Corporate social responsibility continued
Each year we assign a fundraising budget 
which allows employees the opportunity  
to request funds for causes that are close 
to their hearts. This allows us to help a  
wide range of organisations and offers 
employees a variety of ways to get involved. 
Donations from Auto Trader directly to 
charities totalled £44,000 last year and  
our employees raised additional funds 
with fundraising activities across the year.
However, being a good corporate citizen is 
not just about fundraising; our community 
involvement policy supports employees 
who wish to work with communities across 
the UK, either as private individuals or as 
employees of Auto Trader. Our community 
sponsorship programme provides 
employees with a bursary to support local 
initiatives or clubs that they are involved 
with. It can be not only about making a 
monetary donation but also about offering 
our time and expertise whilst maximising 
the take-up of volunteering days, one of  
our Incredible Benefits.
We have formed a strategic partnership  
with Forever Manchester which will help  
us to make a difference in the communities  
in which we operate. The 2016 Auto Trader 
Community Fund will offer sponsorship  
of up to £1,000 to many local charities and 
community groups aimed at really making  
a difference in the lives of people across  
the region.
Leading up to Christmas last year 
approximately one hundred elderly visitors 
from local community centres near the 
Manchester and London offices joined us  
to share a Christmas dinner and festive 
entertainment with some of our employees.
During the last year we have also supported 
or sponsored Code Club in two schools in 
Greater Manchester, teaching young students 
how to code. We have also been a corporate 
partner for HOME, the largest art centre 
outside London, and the Manchester 
International Festival, the world’s first festival 
of original, new work and special events.

We are mindful of the effects of our business 
on our environment and continue to support 
energy efficiency throughout our business 
activities. As an internet-based Group with 
most staff employed in two office locations, 
we believe our own environmental footprint 
is small. We encourage our employees to 
take steps to address our environmental 
responsibilities. For instance we operate 
recycling schemes which were established 
with local authorities and recycling partners. 
There are no waste bins at desks in our 
offices which encourages the amount of 
recycling we do. 
Both offices are graded highly by the 
BREEAM standard, specifically the Kings 
Cross office is rated ‘Outstanding’ and  
the Manchester office is rated ‘Excellent’.  
The Kings Cross office is linked to the 
site-wide district heating network. This 
network will provide close to 100% of  
the development’s heating and hot water 
needs. The building has been designed  
to maximise the environmental benefits  
of its location. Orientation, solar shading, 
the use of thermal mass for cooling and 
passive ventilation systems all contribute 
to energy efficiency.
We use Fruitful Office to deliver fruit to 
both offices each week. For every fruit 
basket our employees receive, the Fruitful 
Office plants a fruit tree in Malawi to help 
mitigate the effect of global warming, 
deforestation and providing an income to 
support the local communities. This year, 
the scheme has planted 1,297 trees on

43 Governance overview
Committed to high standards  
of corporate governance
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce our corporate 
governance report for 2016, which includes 
a review of the corporate governance 
arrangements in place, and reports from 
each of our Board Committees. 
Compliance with Corporate  
Governance Code
I can confirm that the Company is now  
in full compliance with all provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2014  
(the ‘Code’).
As I reported in 2015, the Company was 
listed immediately before the end of the last 
financial year. At that time, the Company  
did not comply with all of the Code’s 
provisions. We committed to take the 
necessary steps in order to fully comply 
within 12 months of joining the FTSE 250 
Index, and we have achieved that goal, 
although we were not in compliance with  
the provisions surrounding the composition 
of the Board and its Committees for the 
whole of the year under review. 
Directors
As already outlined in my Chairman’s statement 
on page 4, we appointed three new Independent 
Non-Executive Directors during the year. There 
was a rigorous process for the appointments 
as described in the report of the Nomination 
Committee on pages 52 to 53. The new 
Directors bring with them significant financial 
and commercial experience and I am 
confident they will support the executive team 
in their implementation of the Group’s strategy. 
Following the departure of Tom Hall, Nick 
Hartman and Chip Perry, our Board is 
now at the minimum number of Directors 
required to comply with the Code. We  
believe that the Board is an appropriate  
size for the Group, which is relatively lacking 
in complexity. However, we will keep this 
under continual review.
All Directors will offer themselves for election 
or re-election by the shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
Board evaluation
As well as ensuring that the Board includes 
the appropriate balance between Executive 
and Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
we also recognise the need to be effective 
as a Board. We carried out a thorough 
internal evaluation process during the year, 
which is described on page 51. 
External audit tender
The report of the Audit Committee is set  
out on pages 54 to 59. This includes a 
detailed description of the formal audit 
tender process that was carried out by  
the Committee during the year, leading  
to our recommendation to shareholders  
that KPMG LLP should be appointed as 
auditors at the next AGM, succeeding PwC. 
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be  
held at 10.00am on 22 September 2016  
at 1 Tony Wilson Place, Fourth Floor, 
Manchester, M15 4FN. We expect that  
all Directors will be in attendance.

47 Corporate governance statement
This corporate governance statement 
explains key features of the Company’s 
governance structure and how it complies 
with the UK Corporate Governance  
Code published in 2014 by the Financial 
Reporting Council.
Introduction 
This statement also includes items required by the Listing Rules  
and the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules (‘DTRs’).  
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) is available  
on the Financial Reporting Council website at frc.org.uk.
Compliance with the 2014 Code 
As at the date of this report, the Company is in full compliance with 
the provisions of the 2014 Corporate Governance Code. However,  
the Company did not comply with all the provisions for the whole 
period as explained below. 
The Board is satisfied that, despite the non-compliance with these provisions for part of the period, no individual dominated its decision-taking, 
no undue reliance was placed on particular individuals, there was sufficient challenge of executive management in meetings of the Board or 
relevant Committee, and the Board and relevant Committees operated effectively throughout the whole period.
Code provision Detail Explanation of non-compliance 
B.1.2 Until 1 March 2016, less than half of the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, were Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
For FTSE 350 Index companies, at least half the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, should comprise Independent Non-Executive Directors.  
The Company became a member of the FTSE 350 Index during the 
reporting period.
The Company appointed three additional Independent Non-Executive 
Directors during the period on 1 May 2015 (David Keens), 1 July 2015 
(Jill Easterbrook) and 1 March 2016 (Jeni Mundy), bringing the Board 
into full compliance with this provision from that date. Furthermore,  
the two Non-Executive Directors who were not considered to be 
independent (Tom Hall and Nick Hartman) resigned from the Board  
on 7 March 2016. 
C.3.1 Until 1 July 2015, the Audit Committee  
did not comprise three Independent  
Non-Executive Directors. 
Until 1 May 2015, the Audit Committee was chaired by Tom Hall 
(Non-Executive Director) and its members were Ed Williams  
(Chairman) and Chip Perry (Independent Non-Executive Director). 
On 1 May 2015, David Keens was appointed as Audit Committee 
Chairman, Tom Hall became a Committee Member and Ed Williams 
stepped down as a member of the Committee. 
Jill Easterbrook joined the Committee on 1 July 2015, and Tom Hall 
stepped down as a member of the Committee, and so with effect  
from that date, the composition of the Audit Committee was in full 
compliance with the Code. 
D.2.1. Until 1 July 2015, the Remuneration Committee 
did not comprise three Independent Non-
Executive Directors. 
Until 1 July 2015, the Remuneration Committee was chaired by  
Ed Williams (Chairman) and its other member was Chip Perry 
(Independent Non-Executive Director). David Keens joined the 
Remuneration Committee on his appointment on 1 May 2015. 
On 1 July 2015, Jill Easterbrook was appointed as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director and Remuneration Committee Chairman,  
and Ed Williams stepped down from the Remuneration Committee, 
and so with effect from that date, the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee was in full compliance with the Code.

Board roles
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive are not exercised by 
the same person, ensuring a clear division of responsibility at the head 
of the Company. The division of roles and responsibilities between  
the Chairman, Ed Williams, and the Chief Executive, Trevor Mather, 
have been agreed by the Board and are set out in writing.
David Keens replaced Chip Perry as the Senior Independent Director

Secretary, Sean Glithero, who is also the Finance Director.

49 Corporate governance statement continued
Board balance and independence
At 27 March 2016 and to the date of this report, the Company is 
compliant with the Code provision that at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, should comprise Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Company became compliant with this provision on 
1 March 2016 with Jeni Mundy’s appointment to the Board. 
All of the current Non-Executive Directors (David Keens, Jill Easterbrook and 
Jeni Mundy), are considered to be independent in character and judgement, 
and free of any business or other relationship which could materially 
influence their judgement. Chip Perry, who resigned from the Board on 
7 March 2016, was also considered to be independent for the same 
reasons. Ed Williams was considered to be independent on appointment.
The Chairman’s fees and the Non-Executive Directors’ fees are 
disclosed on page 62, and they received no additional remuneration 
from the Company during the year. 
Until 7 March 2016, the Company had a relationship agreement  
(the ‘Relationship Agreement’) in place with its principal shareholders, 
funds advised by Apax (the ‘Apax Shareholders’). While the Relationship 
Agreement was in force, the Apax Shareholders were entitled to appoint 
two Non-Executive Directors, providing they (and any of their respective 
associates, when taken together) held voting rights over 20% or more  
of the Company’s issued share capital, and one Non-Executive Director 
providing they (and any of their respective associates, when taken 
together) held voting rights over 10% or more of the Company’s  
issued share capital. The two Non-Executive Directors appointed by, 
and representing the Apax Shareholders were Tom Hall and Nick 
Hartman, and they were therefore not considered to be independent. 
On 26 February 2016, the Apax Shareholders disposed of shares 
such that their combined holding fell below 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital. Tom Hall and Nick Hartman subsequently resigned 
from the Board with effect from 7 March 2016, and therefore the 
Relationship Agreement was terminated from that date. 
Appointments to the Board
Non-Executive appointments to the Board are for an initial term of up to 
three years. Non-Executive Directors are typically expected to serve two 
three-year terms, although the Board may invite the Director to serve for 
an additional period. Refer to the Report of the Nomination Committee 
on page 52 for more information on the appointment process. 
External directorships 
Any external appointments or other significant commitments of  
the Directors require the prior approval of the Board. Neither of  
the Executive Directors have any external directorships as at the  
date of this report. During the year, Ed Williams was appointed as  
a Non-Executive Director of Idealista S.A. The Board is comfortable 
that external appointments of the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors do not impact on the time that any Director devotes to  
the Company. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board 
has a formal system in place for Directors to declare conflicts of 
interests and for such conflicts to be considered for authorisation.
Letters of appointment
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors have letters of 
appointment which are available for inspection at the registered office 
of the Company during normal business hours and at the place of the 
AGM from at least 15 minutes before and until the end of the meeting.
Induction and development
All newly appointed Directors receive an induction briefing on their 
duties and responsibilities as Directors of a publicly quoted company, 
and meet with key members of senior management in order to 
familiarise themselves with the Group and its activities. All Directors  
are offered the opportunity to meet with customers and take part in 
sales calls to understand the business from a customer’s perspective. 
The Board as a whole is updated, as necessary, in light of any 
governance developments as and when they occur. Specific  
business-related presentations are given to the Board by senior 
management and external advisors when appropriate. 
As part of the Board evaluation, the Chairman met with each Director 
to discuss any individual training and development needs. 
During 2015/16 the Board learned more about:
• audience and brand; 
• competitive position;
• regulatory environment;
• technology; 
• business continuity planning;
• cyber security;
• display advertising market; 
• network effects and pricing  
in two-sided markets;
• new product  
development; and
• our customers’ viewpoint.
Information and support available to Directors
Full and timely access to all relevant information is given to the Board. 
For Board meetings, this consists of a formal agenda, minutes of 
previous meetings and a comprehensive set of papers including 
regular business progress reports, provided to Directors in a timely 
manner in advance of meetings. 
All the Directors have the right to have their opposition to, or concerns 
over, any Board decision noted in the minutes. Directors are entitled  
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense  
in the furtherance of their duties, where considered necessary.
Election of Directors 
The Board can appoint any person to be a Director, either to fill a 
vacancy or as an addition to the existing Board. Any Director so 
appointed by the Board shall hold office only until the next AGM  
and shall then be eligible for election by the shareholders. 
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
50 Board evaluation and effectiveness
A formal internal evaluation of the Board, Committees and individual 
Directors has taken place during the year. This included the completion 
of a detailed questionnaire by each of the Board Directors, covering 
the Board’s role, knowledge and skills, Board meetings and information 
flows, Board composition, succession planning, risk management, 
relations with shareholders and each of the Board Committees.  
The results were reviewed by the Chairman and the principal findings 
were fed back to the Board in March 2016. In addition, an assessment 
of the Chairman’s performance was carried out, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, and feedback was provided to him individually. 
Areas of focus for the coming year include:
• reviewing the level of information presented in Board papers;
• increasing exposure between Board members and operational 
management outside Board meetings;
• formalising the induction process and setting in place formal 
Board training and development plans; and
• continuing to increase the Board’s understanding of the views  
of major shareholders.
Risk management
The Company does not have a separate Risk Committee; the Board  
is collectively responsible for determining the nature and extent of the 
principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. 
The processes in place for assessment, management and monitoring 
of risks are described in a separate section on pages 33 to 34. 
Internal control framework
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and 
maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and it receives 
regular reports from management identifying, evaluating and managing 
the risks within the business. The system of internal controls is designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Audit Committee reviews the 
system of internal controls through reports received from management, 
along with others from internal and external auditors. Management 
continues to focus on how internal control and risk management can  
be further embedded into the operations of the business and on how  
to deal with areas of improvement which come to the attention of 
management and the Board.
The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, has carried out a review 
of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls during the year 
ended 27 March 2016 and for the period up to the date of approval  
of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Annual 
Report. The review covered all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. 
The Board considered the weaknesses identified and reviewed  
the developing actions, plans and programmes that it considered 
necessary. The Board confirms that no significant weaknesses  
or failings were identified as a result of the review of effectiveness.
Relations with shareholders
The Company recognises the importance of communicating with  
its shareholders to ensure that its strategy and performance are 
understood and that it remains accountable to shareholders. 
The Company formally updates the market on its financial performance 
at least twice a year, at the half year and full year in November and 
June respectively. These updates are posted on the Group’s website 
and are available to all shareholders. These are accompanied by 
formal investor roadshows in the UK and overseas. There is also an 
ongoing programme of meetings with institutional investors, fund 
managers and analysts and conferences, covering a wide range of 
issues within the constraints of publicly available information, including 
strategy, performance and governance. 
The Board is aware that institutional shareholders may be in more 
regular contact with the Company than other shareholders, but care is 
exercised to ensure that any price-sensitive information is released to all 
shareholders, institutional and private, at the same time, in accordance 
with the Financial Conduct Authority requirements. Questions from 
individual shareholders are generally dealt with by the Executive Directors.
All announcements, investor presentations and the Annual Report are 
on the Company’s website (about-us.autotrader.co.uk/investors). 
The Board receives regular reports on issues relating to share price, 
trading activity and movements in institutional investor shareholdings. 
The Board is also provided with current analyst opinions, forecasts 
and feedback from its joint corporate brokers, Bank of America,  
Merrill Lynch and Numis, on the views of institutional investors on a 
non-attributed and attributed basis. Any major shareholders’ concerns 
are communicated to the Board by the Executive Directors. 
The Senior Independent Director, David Keens, and other Non-Executive 
Directors are available to meet with shareholders and are offered the 
opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders. Arrangements 
can be made to meet with them through the Company Secretary.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will take place at 10.00 am on Thursday 
22 September 2016 at the Company’s registered office at 1 Tony Wilson 
Place, Fourth Floor, Manchester, M15 4FN. All shareholders have the 
opportunity to attend and vote, in person or by proxy, at the AGM. 
All proxy votes received in respect of each resolution at the  
AGM are counted and the balance for and against, and any  
votes withheld, are indicated. At the meeting itself, voting on all the 
proposed resolutions is conducted on a poll rather than a show of 
hands, in line with recommended best practice. The Chairman, the 
Chair of each of the Committees and both Executive Directors are 
present at the AGM and available to answer shareholders’ questions.
The Notice of the AGM can be found in a booklet which is being 
mailed out at the same time as this Report. The Notice of the AGM 
sets out the business of the meeting and an explanatory note on all 
resolutions. Separate resolutions are proposed in respect of each 
substantive issue. Results of resolutions proposed at the AGM will  
be published on the Company’s website (about-us.autotrader.co.uk/
investors) following the AGM.

51 Report of the Nomination Committee
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce the report of the Nomination Committee  
for 2016.
Role of the Committee
The Committee has responsibility for identifying and nominating 
candidates for appointment as Directors for approval by the Board.
The Committee will also make recommendations to the Board 
concerning the reappointment of any Non-Executive Director as  
he or she reaches the end of the period of their initial appointment 
(three years), and on the annual election and re-election of any 
Director by shareholders after evaluating the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience of each Director. 
Activities during the year
In our first full year as a listed Company and a member of the FTSE 
250, the Committee successfully identified and nominated three 
candidates to be appointed as Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
bringing our Board composition and Committee membership into line 
with the provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The process for identifying candidates was led by the Committee. 
• Comprehensive candidate search briefs were agreed, including  
the required industry and public company skills, knowledge and 
experience required for new Non-Executive Directors. 
• An external executive recruitment consultant, JCA Partners LLP , 
was engaged, with whom the Group has no other relationship. 
• The shortlisted candidates each met with members of the Board on 
a one-on-one basis before the Committee made its recommendation 
of the preferred candidates to the Board.
A formal internal evaluation of the Board, Committees and individual 
Directors took place during the year, led by the Committee. The process 
and the outcomes of this are summarised in the Corporate Governance 
statement on page 51.
• Composed of the Chairman and three Independent  
Non-Executive Directors. 
• At least two meetings held per year.
• Meetings are attended by the Chief Executive  
and other relevant attendees by invitation.
• For more information on the Committee’s terms of

The Committee also carried out an extensive succession planning 
review, covering the Chairman, members of the Board, Executive

are being taken to ensure that robust plans are in place.
Policy on appointments to the Board
The most important priority of the Committee has been, and will 
continue to be, ensuring that members of the Board should collectively 
possess the broad range of skills, expertise and industry knowledge, 
and business and other experience necessary for the effective 
oversight of the Group.
Appointments are made on merit, against objective criteria and with 
due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board. The Committee 
takes account of a variety of factors before recommending any new 
appointments to the Board, including relevant skills to perform the 
role, experience, knowledge and diversity. 
Auto Trader endeavours to achieve appropriate diversity, including 
gender diversity, throughout the Company and concurs with the 
recommendations of Lord Davies’ review. We have adopted the 
recommended target of female representation on our Board of 25%, 
and we have met this target, as two of our six Board members are 
female. These appointments were made based on merit, against 
objective criteria, to ensure we appointed the best individual for  
each role.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions on the work  
of the Committee.

I am pleased to introduce the Audit Committee report for 2016. 
This has been our first full year as a listed company. With the 
appointment of two further Independent Non-Executive Directors  
to the Committee, and the departure of Tom Hall, who was one  
of the Directors nominated by Apax Shareholders, I can report that 
the composition of the Audit Committee is now compliant with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code. 
With the assistance of management and the external auditors,  
the Committee has considered the main financial reporting issues, 
estimates and judgements, and we believe that the information in  
this Annual Report is fair, balanced, understandable and clearly 
explains progress against our strategic and operating objectives. 
We believe that rigorous internal controls and robust risk management 
processes are an essential part of delivering shareholder value. The 
Committee has assisted the Board in performing a review of effectiveness 
of the processes and systems in place. This includes the appointment of 
Deloitte LLP as our outsourced internal audit function, who are delivering 
a programme of work focusing on the key areas of risk.
One of the major decisions we took during the year, following a formal 
tender process, was the recommendation to appoint KPMG LLP as 
our external auditors with effect from the March 2017 audit (subject  
to shareholder approval). On behalf of the Committee and the Board,  
I would like to record our thanks to PwC, which has been Auto Trader’s 
auditor since 2004, and has provided valuable assistance, support 
and advice to the Committee during their tenure. The transition 
process has already begun and we look forward to working with 
KPMG in the future.

54 Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting is to review and monitor the integrity of the financial statements,  
including annual and half-year reports, result announcements, dividend proposals and any other formal announcement relating to  
the Group’s financial performance. 
The Committee assessed the quality and appropriateness of the accounting principles and policies adopted, and whether management  
had made appropriate underlying estimates and judgements. In doing so, the Committee reviewed management reports in respect of the  
main financial reporting issues and judgements made, together with reports prepared by the external auditor on the 2016 half-year statement  
and Annual Report 2016. 
The Committee, with the assistance of management and PwC, identified areas of financial statement risk and judgement as described below: 
Description of focus area Audit Committee action
Adjusted profit metric
The Group highlights non-underlying items in the income statement to 
show the impact of one-off and other discrete items and to allow better 
interpretation of the underlying performance of the business. 
Adjusted underlying EBITDA was previously used as it reflected both 
the impact of non-underlying items and the change in accounting for 
technology development that was implemented in 2013. This resulted 
in more of the Group’s expenditure on internal development salaries 
being expensed as they did not meet the requirements for capitalisation. 
In order to provide comparability of results from period to period, and 
with listed peer companies, the Directors now consider Underlying 
operating profit to be a more appropriate indicator of the performance 
of the business. Underlying operating profit for the year (and the 
comparative year) is defined to be operating profit before exceptional 
items, share-based payments and management incentive plans.
In its first year as a listed company, the Board has implemented new 
employee share schemes. As the Directors intend to make grants on 
an annual basis, the share-based payment charge is likely to increase 
significantly year-on-year until the third anniversary. Therefore, the Directors 
consider it appropriate to identify IFRS 2 charges and the associated 
national insurance costs separately until 2018.
The Committee considered management’s paper explaining the  
change in Adjusted profit metric and reviewed the timeline over which 
the transition from Adjusted underlying EBITDA to Underlying operating 
profit would be implemented. 
The Committee discussed with management the items considered to be 
‘non-underlying’ , particularly the inclusion of share-based payment charges. 
The Committee considered PwC’s view of the adjusted profit measure 
and consistency with other disclosures in the Annual Report.
The Committee was satisfied that the disclosure was appropriate.
Share-based payments
During the year the Company has implemented its first employee 
share schemes. 
In April 2015, employees were invited to become shareholders by 
joining the all-employee Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’). In June 2015,  
the Group implemented its first Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for 
senior management and selected other individuals. In September  
2015 the Sharesave scheme (‘SAYE’) was implemented. The first 
grants under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (‘DABP’), relating to  
the FY16 Annual Bonus, will be made in July 2016. 
 
All such share-based payment arrangements are accounted for  
as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. 
The IFRS 2 charge has been determined using widely accepted 
pricing models.
The Committee reviewed the assumptions made by management  
and assessed the adequacy of the models themselves for pricing  
such equity instruments. 
The Committee reviewed management forecasts for the number  
of options that were likely to vest under each scheme.
The Committee discussed with management the consistency of 
assumptions used throughout the financial statements in determining  
the IFRS 2 charge, particularly in relation to profit forecasts that 
determine the proportion of shares granted under the PSP and DABP . 
The Committee reviewed PwC’s report into the adequacy of the  
charge and satisfied itself that the share-based payment accounting  
is appropriate and in accordance with accounting standards.

Description of focus area Audit Committee action
Viability statement and going concern
The Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group’s viability and 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that it will continue to 
operate and meet its liabilities, as they fall due. The period over which 
the Directors have determined is appropriate to assess the prospects 
of the Group has been defined as three years. 
In addition, the Directors must consider if the going concern assumption 
is appropriate. If the financial statements do not appropriately reflect 
the conclusions on going concern, a significant number of accounts 
could be affected.
The Committee reviewed management’s schedules supporting and 
explaining the inputs and process underpinning the going concern 
assessment and viability statements. These included the Group 
medium-term plan and cash flow forecasts for the period to  
March 2019.
The Committee discussed with management as to whether a three-year 
period was the most appropriate period to consider. 
The Committee enquired as to the correlation between the principal risks 
and uncertainties as defined within the Group’s risk register and 
disclosed on pages 36 and 37 . In particular, the feasibility of mitigating 
actions and the potential speed of implementation to achieve any 
flexibility required.
The Committee evaluated the conclusions over going concern and viability 
and the proposed disclosures in the financial statements and satisfied itself 
that the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee has reviewed the content of the 2016 Annual Report and considered whether, taken as a whole, in its opinion it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy.
The Committee was provided with a draft of the Annual Report in order to assess the strategic direction and key messages being communicated. 
The Committee provided feedback highlighting any areas in which they felt that further clarity or information was required and this was then 
incorporated into the report provided for Audit Committee approval. 
When forming its opinion the Committee considered:
Is the report fair? – Is a complete picture presented and has any sensitive material been omitted that should have been included?
 – Are key messages in the narrative aligned with the KPIs and are they reflected in the financial reporting?
 – Are the revenue streams described in the narrative consistent with those used for financial reporting in the 
financial statements?
Is the report balanced? – Is there a good level of consistency between the reports in the front and the reporting in the back of the 
Annual Report? 
 – Do you get the same messages when reading the front end and the back end independently? 
 – Is there an appropriate balance between statutory and adjusted measures and are any adjustments 
explained clearly with appropriate prominence?
 – Are the key judgements referred to in the narrative reporting and significant issues reported in the Report  
of the Audit Committee consistent with disclosures of key estimation uncertainties and critical judgements 
set out in the financial statements?
 – How do these compare with the risks that PwC are planning to include in their report?
Is the report 
understandable?
 – Is there a clear and cohesive framework for the Annual Report? 
 – Are the important messages highlighted and appropriately themed throughout the document?
 – Is the report written in accessible language and are the messages clearly drawn out?
Following the Committee’s review, the Directors confirm that, in their opinion, the 2016 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy.

56 Risk management and internal control
The primary role of the Audit Committee in relation to risk management and internal controls is to review the effectiveness of risk management 
systems and related internal controls to ensure that any issues that have arisen are properly dealt with, and that going forward the systems are 
fit for purpose.
The Committee performs its duties by:
• reviewing annually the Group’s system of internal control;
• receiving reports from the Group’s internal audit function and ensuring any identified weaknesses are acted on by management; and
• reviewing reports from the external auditors on any issues identified in the course of their work, including an internal control report on control 
weaknesses, and ensuring that there is an appropriate response from management.
The Group has in place internal controls and risk management systems in relation to its financial reporting process and preparation of 
consolidated accounts. These systems include policies and procedures to ensure that adequate accounting records are maintained and 
transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The internal control 
systems include:
Component Approach Basis for assurance
Risk management Risk register is maintained by the Operational 
Leadership Team (‘OLT’) and reviewed and approved 
by the Board.
Updated by the OLT and reviewed and approved  
by the Board twice annually.
Financial reporting Consolidated Group reporting is performed on  
a monthly basis with a month-end pack being 
produced that includes an income statement, 
balance sheet and cash flow statement.
Results are reviewed each month by management, 
the OLT and the Board. Results are compared 
against expectations and significant variances  
are explained by management.
Budgeting and reforecasting The Group produces an annual budget and  
a half-year reforecast to which monthly results  
are benchmarked.
Performed using a bottom-up approach with reviews 
performed by the OLT and the Board.
Delegation of authority  
and approval limits
A documented structure of delegated authorities and 
approval for transactions and commitments exists.
Reviewed by an independent member of the finance 
team and approval limits regarding customer discounts 
have been reviewed by the internal auditor.
Segregation of duties Procedures are well defined to segregate duties  
over significant transactions. Key reconciliations are 
reviewed periodically to ensure accurate reporting.
Reviewed by an independent member of the  
finance team.
Whistleblowing
A whistleblowing policy has been adopted which includes access to a whistleblowing telephone service run by an independent organisation, 
allowing employees to raise concerns on an entirely confidential basis. The Committee receives regular reports on the use of the service,  
any significant reports that have been received, the investigations carried out and any actions arising as a result. 
Internal audit
The Committee appointed Deloitte as the Group’s outsourced internal audit function during the year. 
The internal audit function is accountable to the Audit Committee and uses a risk-based approach to provide independent assurance over the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the control environment. The internal audit work plan for 2016 was approved by the Audit Committee during the 
year and covers a broad range of core financial and operational processes and controls, focusing on specific risk areas as identified in the Group’s 
risk register. Management actions that are recommended following the audits are tracked to completion and reviewed by the Committee to ensure 
that identified risks are mitigated appropriately.

57 Report of the Audit Committee continued
External auditors
One of the Committee’s roles is to oversee the relationship with the external auditor, PwC, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the service 
provided. This assessment is achieved through various means, including approving audit plans, discussing materiality assessments in relation  
to the financial statements, reviewing the auditor’s reports and seeking feedback from management on the effectiveness of the audit process. 
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed the findings of the external auditor in respect of both the financial statements for the six-month 
period ending 27 September 2015 and for the year ended 27 March 2016.
The Committee met with representatives from PwC without management present and with management without representatives of PwC present, 
to ensure that there were no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor which it should address. There were none.
The Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity. It has therefore 
reviewed, and is satisfied with, the independence of PwC as the external auditor.
Non-audit services provided by the external auditors
The external auditors are primarily engaged to carry out statutory audit work. There may be other services where the external auditors are 
considered to be the most suitable supplier by reference to their skills and experience. It is the Group’s practice that it will seek quotes from 
several firms, which may include PwC, before engagements for non-audit projects are awarded. Contracts are awarded based on individual 
merits. A formal policy is in place for the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor, to ensure that the provision of such services 
does not impair the external auditor’s independence or objectivity.
Audit-related services directly related to the audit: for example, 
the review of interim financial statements; compliance certificates and 
reports to regulators.
Considered to be approved by the Committee to a level of £100,000 
for each individual engagement, and to a maximum aggregate of 
£200,000 for each financial year.
Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted  
services over these limits is subject to the specific approval of  
the Audit Committee.
Acceptable non-audit services: including but not limited to  
tax compliance and advisory services; work related to mergers, 
acquisition, disposals, joint ventures, or circulars; benchmarking 
services; and corporate governance advice.
Prohibited services: where the auditor’s objectivity and 
independence may be compromised by the threat of self-interest, 
self-review, management, advocacy, familiarity or intimidation –  
for example, accounting services, internal audit services,  
valuation services and financial systems consultancy.
Prohibited.
Refer to about-us.autotrader.co.uk/investors for full details of the policy. 
During the year, PwC charged the Group £0.1m (2015: £2.6m, which included matters relating to the listing on the London Stock Exchange)  
for non-audit services, as outlined in note 4 to the financial statements. 
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
58 External audit tender process
A formal tender process was undertaken during 2016, in relation to the audit for the year to March 2017 . The Committee has a formal policy  
to tender at least once every 10 years. PwC has been the Group’s auditor since 2004. The Committee considered the need to undertake a 
tender process in 2015 and concluded that, given the short length of time from the IPO, it was appropriate to retain PwC for the 2016 financial 
year end at least. 
The tender process has since been completed, led by the Committee, with a selection panel appointed to undertake much of the detailed work. 
Three audit firms, including the incumbent auditor, were invited to tender. During the process, the tendering firms met with key personnel within 
the Group and were provided with detailed information about the Group’s operations. The process culminated in written proposals being 
submitted and presented to the selection panel. 
The panel and the Committee assessed the proposals against the following pre-defined selection criteria:
• Skills, experience and commitment.
• Quality of interactions and proposal.
• Cultural fit.
• Industry experience and understanding.
• Service approach and value add.
• Understanding of PLC requirements.
• Fees and pricing.
The Committee’s recommendation to the Board that KPMG LLP be appointed as external auditor for the financial year ending March 2017 was 
accepted, and a resolution to propose the appointment of KPMG LLP as auditors will be put to shareholders at the 2016 AGM. 
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 – statement of compliance
The Company confirms that it complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year under review, 
other than in the timing of the audit tender process which was discussed with the Authority at the time of the Company’s IPO.

59 Directors’ remuneration report 
Annual statement by the Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholders,
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the report of the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) in respect of the year 
ended 27 March 2016, the Company’s first full financial year as a  
listed company. 
Objectives of the remuneration policy and link to strategy
The policy approved by shareholders in September 2015 has the 
following aims: 
• to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior management and 
structured so as to focus on the delivery of the Company’s strategic 
and business objectives in order to promote its long-term success;
• the targets for performance related pay closely linked to the 
Company’s main strategic objectives; 
• to be simple in design, transparent and understandable both to 
participants and shareholders;
• to achieve a degree of consistency in terms of approach across the 
senior management population to the extent appropriate; 
• base pay to be set having had due regard to appropriate mid-
market benchmarks with incentive pay structured so as to provide 
the opportunity to earn above mid-market benchmarks for the 
delivery of challenging performance targets; and
• to promote an ownership culture, via the encouragement of 
widespread equity ownership across the workforce.
During the year it has proved effective in both retaining and motivating 
our executive team. The policy supports our strategy through using 
performance targets for our variable pay schemes that target 
improvements in our key performance indicators (i.e. Underlying 
operating profit, audience share, new product initiatives and total 
shareholder returns). As a consequence no changes are proposed  
to our policy, or its application, for the current financial year.
The work of the Committee during the year
As reported last year, the Remuneration Committee carried out 
considerable work prior to Admission in order to develop our new 
remuneration policy. As a result, this year has been focused on the 
implementation of the approved policy for our first full year. The key 
activities of the Committee are detailed in the table below.
Our activities in 2016
• Confirming the performance targets to apply to the 2016 
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards and granting the awards. 
• Considering the executive pay environment and confirming the 
current remuneration policy remains appropriate for 2017 .
• Reviewing the choice of performance metrics for 2017 variable 
pay schemes.
• Consideration of the approach to equity participation across  
the workforce including design of first Company-wide share 
schemes (‘SIP’ and ‘SAYE’).
• Considering the impact of changes to pension tax rules.
• Considering the approach to reporting on the current financial year.
Our 2017 priorities 
• Confirming targets for and granting the 2017 PSP awards.
• Considering the ongoing appropriateness of the structure  
and design of the existing long-term incentive plans. 
• Continuing to monitor the executive pay environment and 
considering the ongoing appropriateness of the existing policy.
• Composed of three Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
• At least two meetings held per year.
• Meetings are attended by the Chief Executive and other  
relevant attendees by invitation – no person is present during  
any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
• For more information on the Committee’s terms of reference

60 Performance and reward in 2016 
Our first full year as a listed company has been very successful. 
We achieved year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to £281.6m 
(2015: £255.9m) with growth across all of our revenue streams. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 19% to £171.3m (2015: £144. 1m) 
with Underlying operating profit margin improving by 5 percentage 
points to 61% (2015: 56%). Operating cash flows from continuing 
operations were 30% higher at £177 .0m, a conversion rate of 97%, 
allowing £147 .0m of debt to be repaid during the year. Overall, the 
results were our best ever. 
In terms of non-financial performance we continued to achieve our 
objective of being the market leader in what we do (measured based 
on our audience share using customer minutes on our site versus our 
competitor set) and successfully executed our strategy of growing the 
number of Managing Pillar products. 
The level of performance achieved resulted in the maximum bonus 
targets set at the start of the year being exceeded both for financial 
and non-financial targets. Further information on the actual targets  
set, and our performance against them is provided on page 63. 
Since the first awards granted under the Company’s Performance Share 
Plan took place in June 2015, there were no outstanding awards eligible 
to vest in respect of long-term performance in the year under review. 
Approach for 2017
The Committee will continue to operate within the remuneration 
policy approved by shareholders in September 2015. The key 
highlights of how we intend to apply this for 2016/17 are:
• with effect from 1 April 2016, the salaries of the Executive
Directors were increased by 2% which is below the average
increase across the wider workforce;
• the annual bonus plan will operate similarly to last year, with 75%
being based on Underlying operating profit performance and the
remaining 25% being based on strategic metrics; and
• awards will be made in July 2016 under the PSP at 200% of salary
for Trevor Mather and 150% for Sean Glithero. Awards will also
be made to other senior colleagues at this time. The
performance conditions applying to these awards will continue
to be based on the Company’s Cumulative Underlying operating
profit (relevant to 75% of awards) and Total Shareholder Return
(‘TSR’) (relevant to 25% of awards).
Feedback from shareholders
The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring that we are 
responsive to developments in best practice, and will proactively consider 
the implementation of our policy in the light of this. Should you have 
any feedback in this regard, I shall be available at the AGM to answer 
any specific questions that you may have. 
I hope that you will be supportive of the AGM resolution to approve 
our Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Jill Easterbrook
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 31 March 2017
This section sets out how the Committee intends to implement the remuneration policy in the year ending 31 March 2017 . 
Base salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries were reviewed in early 2016 with the changes becoming effective from 1 April 2016, and will next be reviewed 
in early 2017 , with any changes becoming effective from 1 April 2017 . The following table sets out the new salaries effective 1 April 2016 (financial 
year 2017) compared to those which applied in financial year 2016: 
2017 2016
Percentage 
change
Trevor Mather £535,500 £525,000 +2% 
Sean Glithero £295,800 £290,000 +2%
For context, the increase in the salary budget for 2017 for the overall employee group was set at 4% (inclusive of merit and promotional 
increases). 
Pension and benefits
Executive Directors will continue to receive a pension contribution at the rate of 5% of base salary, payable into the Company pension scheme  
or as a cash alternative. Ancillary benefits are provided in the form of private medical cover, life assurance and income protection insurance. 
Annual bonus
As described in the Policy Report, Trevor Mather’s maximum bonus opportunity is capped at 150% of base salary whilst Sean Glithero’s  
is capped at 130% of base salary. Half of any bonus earned will be payable in shares, deferred for two years under the DABP . 
The metrics and their weightings for the year ending 31 March 2017 are:
Metric Percentage of total bonus
Underlying operating profit 75%
Strategic objectives 25%
In relation to the financial target, a challenging graduated scale will operate set around the 2017 business plan. For achievement of the threshold 
target, 20% of this part of the bonus opportunity becomes payable with the maximum becoming payable for outperforming the 2017 business plan. 
The strategic targets relate to two key performance objectives for 2017 . These are, as per 2016, the level of audience share we achieve versus our 
competitors during the year which will determine up to 12.5% of the total bonus opportunity and new product initiatives (the adoption of Managing 
Pillar products in the current financial year) which will also determine up to 12.5% of the total bonus opportunity. A financial underpin will apply to 
the strategic targets, such that no bonus will be payable if Underlying operating profit does not exceed the £171.3m achieved in 2016. 
The specific targets themselves are commercially sensitive, but the Committee intends to disclose them in the next Annual Report on Remuneration 
provided they are no longer considered to be commercially sensitive at that time. 
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The Committee’s policy is to award Executive Directors annual PSP awards. The Committee intends to grant awards in the current financial year 
to Trevor Mather and Sean Glithero, at a level of 200% of salary and 150% of salary respectively. The performance metrics and their weightings 
for the award remain unchanged and are set out below: 
Metric Percentage of total PSP awards
Cumulative Underlying operating profit 75%
Relative Total Shareholder Return 25%
Each element will be assessed independently of the other as detailed opposite.
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
66 Cumulative Underlying operating profit
Cumulative Underlying operating profit will be defined as the sum of the Group’s Underlying operating profit result over the three consecutive 
financial years ending on 31 March 2019. 
The Committee considered a number of factors when setting the range of targets including internal planning, market expectations for the future 
performance of the Company and market practice in terms of target setting across the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index. The actual range of 
targets is commercially sensitive, but the Committee intends to disclose them in the next Annual Report on Remuneration provided they are no 
longer considered to be commercially sensitive at that time. The awards will vest according to the following schedule: 
Cumulative Underlying operating profit performance achieved
Proportion of awards subject to  
Cumulative Underlying operating profit that vest
Below threshold 0%
Equal to threshold 25%
Stretch or above 100%
Pro-rata between the threshold and stretch performance targets
Relative TSR
The performance condition applying to one quarter of PSP awards will be based on TSR performance over the three financial years ending 
31 March 2019.
The TSR of the Company will be compared to that of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) over the performance period, and will 
vest according to the following schedule: 
TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) Proportion of awards subject to TSR that vest
Below Index TSR 0%
Equal to Index TSR (threshold target) 25%
Equal to Index TSR plus  
25% or above (stretch target) 100%
Pro-rata between threshold and stretch performance targets
Consistent with market practice, a three month averaging period will normally apply for the purposes of calculating the start and end values for 
the purposes of measuring TSR. 
Executive Directors will ordinarily be required to retain their net of tax number of vested shares delivered under the PSP for at least two years 
from the point of vesting.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The fee structure and levels were set on Admission. The fees were reviewed in early 2016 and were increased by 2% with effect from 1 April 2016. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees will next be reviewed in early 2017 , with any increase becoming effective from 1 April 2017 .
A summary of current fees is shown below:
Base fees 2017 2016
Percentage

Directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited) 
The Group has adopted formal shareholding guidelines in order to encourage Executive Directors to maintain a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent in value to 200% of salary for Trevor Mather and 150% of salary for Sean Glithero. If an Executive does not meet the guideline, they 
will be expected to retain at least half of the net shares vesting under the Company’s discretionary share-based employee incentive schemes 
until the guideline is met. Both Executive Directors currently hold well in excess of this limit, as set out below.

Sean Glithero beneficially owns 3,597 ,581 shares, representing 891,200% and 483,689% of salary respectively. 
External directorships
Neither of the Executive Directors holds any external directorships. 
Membership of the Committee 
Jill Easterbrook is the Committee Chairman, and its other members are David Keens and Jeni Mundy. Refer to page 60 for further details of the 
membership of the Committee, the terms of reference, the meetings held and activities during the year. 
External advisors
New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), part of Aon plc, provides independent advice to, and was appointed by, the Committee. NBS were selected by the 
Committee due to their extensive experience of advising listed companies with respect to remuneration. The Committee seeks advice relating  
to the remuneration of Executive Directors, the wider senior management population and Non-Executive Directors’ fees from NBS. Neither NBS 
nor Aon provide any other services to the Company. 
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by NBS in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was objective and 
independent. Terms of engagement are available on request from the Company Secretary. NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and abides by the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, which requires its advice to be objective and impartial. The fees 
payable to NBS for providing advice in relation to executive remuneration over the financial year under review were charged on a time-spent 
basis, and were approximately £57 ,000.

Policy overview
On Admission in March 2015, a new remuneration policy was adopted 
by the Committee. This policy is structured so as to ensure that the 
main elements of remuneration are linked to Company strategy, in line 
with best practice and aligned with shareholders’ interests. 
The policy is designed to reward Executive Directors by offering 
competitive remuneration packages, which are prudently constructed, 
sufficiently stretching and linked to long-term profitability. In promoting 
these objectives, the policy aims to be simple in design, transparent 
and structured so as to adhere to the principles of good corporate 
governance and appropriate risk management. 
A further aim of the remuneration policy is to encourage a culture of share 
ownership by colleagues throughout the Company, and in support of this 
we have put in place both a SIP , under which an award of free shares 
to commemorate the Listing was granted, and an SAYE scheme.
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors
Our policy is designed to offer competitive, but not excessive, 
remuneration structured so that there is a significant weighting 
towards performance-based elements. A significant proportion of 
our variable pay is delivered in shares with deferral and holding periods 
being mandatory, and with appropriate recovery and withholding 
provisions in place to safeguard against overpayments in the event  
of certain negative events occurring. The table below provides a full 
summary of the policy elements for the Executive Directors.

Annual 
bonus 
1,2,3
To incentivise  
and reward the 
achievement  
of annual financial  
and operational 
objectives which are 
closely linked to the 
corporate strategy.
The annual bonus is based predominantly on  
stretching financial and operational objectives as  
set at the beginning of the year and assessed by  
the Committee following the year end.
Half of any bonus earned is subject to deferral in shares 
under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (‘DABP’), typically  
for a period of two years. The deferred shares will vest 
subject to continued employment, but there are no further 
performance targets.
A dividend equivalent provision allows the Committee  
to pay dividends, at the Committee’s discretion, on 
vested shares (in cash or shares) at the time of vesting 
and may assume the reinvestment of dividends on a 
cumulative basis.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply as described 
in note 1. These provisions apply in the event of material 
misstatement of results, an error in the calculation of 
bonus outcome or in instances of individual gross 
misconduct.
Participation in the bonus plan, and all bonus payments, 
are at the discretion of the Committee.
The Chief Executive’s 
bonus is capped at 150% 
of salary and the Finance 
Director’s is capped at 
130% of salary annually. 
Financial measures will 
normally represent the  
majority of bonus, with  
clearly defined non-financial 
targets representing the 
balance (if any). 
With regards to financial 
targets, not more than 20%  
of this part of the bonus will  
be payable for achieving the 
relevant threshold hurdle. 
Where non-financial targets 
operate, it may not always be 
practicable to set targets on a 
graduated scale, where these 
operate not more than 33% will 
be payable for achieving the 
threshold target.
Measures and weightings may 
change each year to reflect any 
year-on-year changes to 
business priorities.

Awards will normally be made annually under the PSP , 
and will take the form of nil-cost options or conditional 
share awards. Participation and individual award levels 
will be determined at the discretion of the Committee 
within the policy. 
Awards normally vest after three years subject to the 
extent to which the performance conditions specified  
for the awards are satisfied, and continued service.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply as described 
in note 1. These provisions apply in the event of material 
misstatement of results, an error in the calculation  
of a vesting result or in instances of individual gross 
misconduct.
As a minimum, Executive Directors will ordinarily be 
required to retain their net of tax number of vested 
shares delivered under the PSP for at least two years 
from the point of vesting.

guidelines
To increase alignment 
between executives 
and shareholders.
Executive Directors are required to build and maintain  
a holding of shares in the Company. This is to be built 
through retaining a minimum of 50% of the net of tax 
vested PSP and DABP shares, until the guideline level  
is met.
At least 200% of salary  
for the Chief Executive  
and at least 150% of salary 
for the Finance Director,  
or such higher level as the 
Committee may determine 
from time to time.

1.  Recovery and withholding provisions apply to variable pay, to enable the Company to recover amounts paid under the annual bonus and PSP in the event of the following negative 
events occurring within three years of the payment date: a material misstatement or restatement to the audited financial statements or other data; an error in the calculation leading  
to over-payment of bonus; or individual gross misconduct. Should such an event be suspected, there will be a further two years in which the Committee may investigate the event. 
The amount to be recovered would generally be the excess payment over the amount which would otherwise be paid, and recovery may be satisfied in a variety of ways, including 
through the reduction of outstanding deferred awards, reduction of the next bonus or PSP vesting and seeking a cash repayment. 
2.  In order to ensure that the remuneration policy is capable of achieving its intended aims, the Committee retains certain discretions over the operation of the variable pay policy.  
These include the ability to vary the operation of the plans in certain circumstances (such as a change of control, rights issue, corporate restructuring events or special dividend) 
including the timing and determination of pay-outs/vesting, and making appropriate adjustments to performance targets as necessary to ensure that performance conditions  
remain appropriate. However, it should be noted that in the event that the measures or targets are varied for outstanding awards in the light of a corporate event, the revised targets 
may not be materially less difficult to satisfy. Should these discretions be used, they would be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may be subject to consultation 
with shareholders as appropriate. 
3.  Annual bonus performance measures are selected annually to reflect the Group’s key strategic initiatives for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial objectives. A majority 
weighting is placed on financial performance, including a significant element being based on profit-based metrics, ensuring that pay-outs are closely linked to Company growth.
4.  The use of a combination of internal financial performance and total shareholder return measures within the PSP is designed to ensure that rewards are linked to long-term 
shareholder value creation. The financial metrics chosen will be the measure or measures considered by the Committee at the time of each grant to be most likely to support the 
Company’s long-term growth strategy. The use of TSR aligns with the Company’s focus on shareholder value creation and rewards management for outperformance of sector peers. 
5.  In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may in its discretion allow participants to sell, transfer, assign or dispose of some or all of these shares before the end of the holding period.
6.  Although eligible, the Executive Directors opted out of the offer of Free Shares made to all employees in April 2015.
7.  A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2017 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

PSP on termination
Share-based awards are outside of service contracts. 
Normally, PSP awards will lapse upon a participant ceasing to  
hold employment. However, under the Rules of the PSP , in certain 
prescribed circumstances (namely, death, sale of employing company 
from the business or otherwise at the discretion of the Committee), 
‘good leaver’ status can be applied. In exercising its discretion  
as to whether an Executive Director should be treated as a good  
leaver the Committee will take into account the performance of  
the individual and the reasons for their departure and, in the event  
of this determination being made, will set out its rationale in the 
following Annual Report on Remuneration.
The extent to which PSP awards will vest in good leaver 
circumstances will depend on:
(i)  the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied 
at the relevant time; and 
(ii)  the pro-rating of the award determined by the period of time 
served in employment during the vesting period. 
In such circumstances, PSP awards will usually vest on the normal 
vesting date. The Committee retains the discretion to reduce or 
eliminate time pro-rating, if it regards it to be appropriate in particular 
circumstances. However, if the time pro-rating is varied from the 
default position under the PSP Rules, an explanation will be set out  
in the following Annual Report on Remuneration. For the avoidance  
of doubt, the application of the performance condition may not be 
waived, although the Committee may at its discretion alter the date  
to which performance is measured (e.g. to the date of cessation of 
employment as opposed to over the full performance period). 
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The recruitment package for a new Director would be set in accordance 
with the terms of the Company’s approved remuneration policy. Currently, 
this would include an annual bonus opportunity of up to 150% of salary 
and policy PSP award of up to 200% of salary (other than in exceptional 
circumstances where up to 300% of salary may be made).
On recruitment, salary may (but need not necessarily) be set at a level 
below the normal market rate, with phased increases greater than those 
received by others as the executive gains experience. The rate of salary 
should be set so as to reflect the individual’s experience and skills.
The Committee recognises that it may be necessary in some 
circumstances to compensate for amounts foregone from a previous 
employer (using Listing Rule 9.4.2). Any such compensatory award 
would be limited to what is felt to be a fair estimate of the value of 
remuneration foregone taking into account the value of the award,  
the extent to which performance conditions apply, the form of award 
and the time left to vesting. 
Service contracts and policy for payments on loss of office
The service contracts for the Executive Directors are terminable by 
either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months’ notice 
and make provision for early termination by way of payment of a cash 
sum equal to 12 months’ salary, and pension. 
Payment in lieu of notice can be paid either as a lump sum or in  
equal monthly instalments over the notice period, with mitigation.  
The Committee will consider the particular circumstances of each 
leaver on an individual basis and retains flexibility as to at what point, 
and the extent to which, payments are reduced. 
At the discretion of the Committee, a contribution to reasonable 
outplacement costs in the event of termination of employment due to 
redundancy may also be made. A payment to the value of 12 months’ 
contractual benefits may also be made. The Committee also retains the 
ability to reimburse reasonable legal costs incurred in connection with a 
termination of employment and may make a payment for any statutory 
entitlements or to settle or compromise claims in connection with a 
termination of any existing or future Executive Director as necessary. 
Relevant details will be provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration should such circumstances apply.
In summary, the contractual provisions on termination where the 
Company elects to make a payment in lieu of notice are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months by either party.
Termination payments 
over the notice period
 – 100% of salary.
 – 5% in respect of pension contributions.
Change of control There are no enhanced provisions  
on a change of control.
The Executive Directors are subject to annual reappointment at the AGM. 
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
Annual bonus on termination
There is no automatic or contractual right to bonus payment.  
At the discretion of the Committee, for certain leavers, a pro-rata 
bonus may become payable at the normal payment date for the  
period of employment and based on full year performance. Should  
the Committee decide to make a payment in such circumstances, the 
rationale would be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
72 For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of their prior role would normally be allowed to pay out according to 
its outstanding terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that, if they 
are outside the approved policy, they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For all appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain appropriate relocation costs.
Policy on external appointments
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted to take on one non-executive position with another company and to retain their 
fees in respect of such position. Details of outside directorships held by the Executive Directors and any fees that they received are provided  
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company, but instead have letters of appointment. 
Element
Purpose and  
link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Fees To attract and retain the 
high-calibre Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors  
by offering a market 
competitive fee level.
Fees are reviewed periodically and approved by the Board (or,  
in the case of the Chairman, by the Remuneration Committee), 
with Non-Executive Directors abstaining from any discussion in 
relation to their fees. Both the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors are paid annual fees and do not participate in any of 
the Company’s incentive arrangements, or receive any pension 
provision or other benefits. 
The Chairman receives a single fee covering all of his duties. 
The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee,  
with additional fees payable for chairing the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees and for performing the Senior 
Independent Director role. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors shall be entitled  
to have reimbursed all expenses that they reasonably incur  
in the performance of their duties.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase 
nor is there a cap on fees. 
The fee levels are  
reviewed on a periodic 
basis, with reference to  
the time commitment of  
the role and market levels in 
companies of comparable 
size and complexity.
Letters of appointment
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-appointment 
at the AGM. Appointment is terminable on six months’ written notice. The appointment letters for the Non-Executive Directors provide that no 
compensation is payable upon termination of employment. 
Letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Approach to recruitment
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.

Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
74 Until 7 March 2016, the Company had a Relationship Agreement  
with Crystal A Holdco S.à.r.l. and Crystal B Holdco S.à.r.l., funds 
advised by Apax (the ‘Apax Shareholders’), that it may appoint and 
remove two Non-Executive Directors to the Board for so long as the 
Apax Shareholders (and/or any of its associates, when taken together) 
hold 20% or more of the voting rights over the Company’s shares,  
and one Non-Executive Director to the Board for so long as it (and/or 
any of its associates, when taken together) holds 10% or more but 
less than 20% of the voting rights over the Company’s ordinary 
shares. On 26 February 2016, the Apax Shareholders disposed  
of shares such that their combined holding fell below 10% of  
the Company’s issued share capital. Subsequently, the Apax 
Non-Executive Directors (Tom Hall and Nick Hartman) resigned  
from the Board with effect from 7 March 2016, and therefore the 
Relationship Agreement was terminated from that date. 
Results and dividends
The Group’s and Company’s audited financial statements for the year 
are set out on pages 84 to 133 
The Company declared an interim dividend on 13 November 2015  
of 0.5 pence per share which was paid on 29 January 2016. 
The Directors recommend payment of a final dividend of 1.0 pence 
per share (2015: £Nil) to be paid on 30 September 2016 to shareholders 
on the register of members at 2 September 2016, subject to approval 
at the 2016 AGM. 
Amendment of the Articles
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended  
by a special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders.  
No amendments are proposed to be made to the existing Articles  
of Association at the forthcoming AGM.
Authority to allot shares
Under the 2006 Act, the Directors may only allot shares if authorised 
to do so by shareholders in a general meeting. The authority conferred 
on the Directors at the 2015 AGM under section 551 of the 2006 Act 
expires on the date of the forthcoming AGM, and ordinary resolution 
11 seeks a new authority to allow the Directors to allot ordinary shares 
up to a maximum nominal amount of £6,674,012 (667 ,401,167 shares, 
representing approximately two thirds of the Company’s existing share 
capital at 9 June 2016), of which 333,650,531 shares (representing 
approximately one third of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital) can only be allotted pursuant to a rights issue. The Directors 
have no present intention of exercising this authority which will expire 
at the conclusion of the AGM in 2017 or 21 December 2017 if earlier. 
Authority to purchase own shares
As described in the Financial review on page 32, the Directors intend 
to commence a share buyback programme in the near future. By 
resolutions passed at the 2015 AGM the Company was authorised to 
make market purchases of up to 100,105,169 of its ordinary shares, 
subject to minimum and maximum price restrictions. This authority will 
expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM. As at the date of this 
report, the Company has not exercised any powers to purchase the 
Company’s ordinary shares. The Directors will seek authority from 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for the Company to purchase, 
in the market, up to a maximum of 100,105,169 of its own ordinary 
shares either to be cancelled or retained as treasury shares. 
Share capital and control
The Company’s issued share capital comprises ordinary shares  
of £0.01 each which are listed on the London Stock Exchange  
(LSE: AUTO.L). The ISIN of the shares is GB00BVYVFW23.
The issued share capital of the Company as at 27 March 2016  
and 9 June 2016, comprises 1,001,051,699 of £0.01 each. Further 
information regarding the Company’s issued share capital and  
details of the movements in issued share capital during the year  
are provided in note 23 to the Group’s financial statements. All the 
information detailed in note 23 forms part of this Directors’ report  
and is incorporated into it by reference. 
Details of employee share schemes are provided in note 27 to the 
financial statements.
Capital reduction
During the year, the Company completed a reduction of share capital 
whereby the entire amount standing to the credit of the Company’s 
share premium account, being £144,431,628, was cancelled and  
the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the capital of the 
Company was reduced from £1.50 to £0.01. The reduction of capital 
was necessary in order to provide the Company with the distributable 
reserves required to support the dividend policy.
The capital reduction was approved by a special resolution passed  
at a general meeting of the Company on 18 March 2015, and was 
formally approved by the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division,  
on 29 July 2015. Following registration of the order of the High Court 
with Companies House, the Capital Reduction became effective on 
29 July 2015. 
Rights attaching to shares
All shares have the same rights (including voting and dividend rights 
and rights on a return of capital) and restrictions as set out in the 
Articles, described overleaf. Except in relation to dividends which  
have been declared and rights on a liquidation of the Company, the 
shareholders have no rights to share in the profits of the Company. 
The Company’s shares are not redeemable. However, following any 
grant of authority from shareholders, the Company may purchase  
or contract to purchase any of the shares on or off market, subject  
to the Companies Act 2006 and the requirements of the Listing Rules.
No shareholder holds shares in the Company which carry special 
rights with regard to control of the Company. There are no shares 
relating to an employee share scheme which have rights with regard 
to control of the Company that are not exercisable directly and solely 
by the employees, other than in the case of the Auto Trader Group 
Share Incentive Plan, where share interests of a participant in such 
scheme can be exercised by the personal representatives of a 
deceased participant in accordance with the Scheme rules.

Voting rights
Each ordinary share entitles the holder to vote at general meetings  
of the Company. A resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be 
decided on a show of hands unless a poll is demanded. On a show  
of hands, every member who is present in person or by proxy at a 
general meeting of the Company shall have one vote. On a poll, every 
member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for 
every share of which they are a holder. The Articles provide a deadline 
for submission of proxy forms of not than less than 48 hours before 
the time appointed for the holding of the meeting or adjourned 
meeting. No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting 
either in person or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him, 
unless all amounts presently payable by him in respect of that share 
have been paid. Save as noted, there are no restrictions on voting 
rights nor any agreement that may result in such restrictions. 
Restrictions on transfer of securities
The Articles do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of ordinary 
shares in the Company other than the usual restrictions applicable 
where any amount is unpaid on a share. Certain restrictions are  
also imposed by laws and regulations (such as insider trading and 
marketing requirements relating to close periods) and requirements  
of the Listing Rules whereby Directors and certain employees of the 
Company require Board approval to deal in the Company’s securities.
On 18 March 2015, the Company entered into an underwriting 
agreement (the ‘Underwriting Agreement’) with the Directors,  
the Apax Shareholders, Merrill Lynch International and Deutsche  
Bank AG London Branch (the ‘ Joint Global Coordinators’) and Merrill 
Lynch International, Deutsche Bank AG London Branch, J.P . Morgan 
Securities plc, Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and Numis 
Securities Limited (the ‘Underwriters’), in accordance with which the 
Apax Shareholders agreed not to dispose of any ordinary shares in 
the Company for a period of 360 days following Admission without  
the prior written consent of the Joint Global Coordinators; and each  
of the Directors agreed not to dispose of any ordinary shares for  
a period of 360 days following Admission without the prior written 
consent of the Joint Global Coordinators. Each member of the 
Operational Leadership Team also agreed with the Company not 
to dispose of any ordinary shares in the Company for a period of  
360 days following Admission without the prior written consent  
of the Company. These agreements expired on 18 March 2016.  
All of the above arrangements are or were subject to certain 
customary exceptions. 
Following the disposal of part of their shareholding in the Company  
on 6 April 2016, Trevor Mather and Sean Glithero each entered into a 
deed whereby they agreed not to dispose of any ordinary shares for  
a period of 90 days without the prior written consent of the Company, 
subject to certain customary exceptions.
Change of control
Save in respect of a provision of the Company’s share schemes  
which may cause options and awards granted to employees  
under such schemes to vest on takeover, there are no agreements 
between the Company and its Directors or employees providing  
for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) because of a 
takeover bid.
Significant contracts 
The only significant agreements to which the Company is a party  
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid, and the effect thereof, are the  
Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility agreements, which contain 
customary prepayment, cancellation and default provisions including, 
if required by a lender, mandatory prepayment of all utilisations 
provided by that lender upon the sale of all or substantially all of  
the business and assets of the Group or a change of control.
Interests in voting rights
At the year end the Company had been notified, in accordance  
with Chapter 5 of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, of the following significant interest in the issued

Transactions with related parties
Refer to note 30 of the consolidated financial statements for details of 
related party transactions in the year. The only material transactions 
with related parties during the year were:
• Relationship Agreement: The Relationship Agreement was 
entered into on 19 March 2015 between the Apax Shareholders 
and the Company, and its principal purpose was to ensure that  
the Company was capable at all times of carrying on its business 
independently of the Apax Shareholders. Subject to a certain 
minimum shareholding, the Relationship Agreement detailed  
the rights the Apax Shareholders had: to representation on the 
Board and Nomination Committee; to appoint observers to the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees; and to certain anti-dilution 
rights. The Company had also undertaken to cooperate with  
the Apax Shareholders in the event of a sale of the shares by  
either of the Apax Shareholders at any time following the IPO.  
This agreement was terminated on 7 March 2016 following the 
disposal of shares by the Apax Shareholders and the subsequent 
resignation of the Apax Non-Executive Directors from the Board. 
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
76 Research and development 
Innovation, specifically in software, is a critical element of Auto Trader’s 
strategy and therefore of the future success of the Group. Accordingly, 
the majority of the Group’s research and development expenditure  
is predominantly related to this area. Since 30 September 2013,  
the Group has changed its approach to technology development 
such that the Group now develops its core infrastructure through 
small-scale, maintenance-like incremental improvements, and as a 
result the amount of capitalised development costs has decreased as 
less expenditure meets the requirements of IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Indemnities and insurance
The Company maintains appropriate insurance to cover Directors’  
and officers’ liability for itself and its subsidiaries and such insurance 
was in force for the whole of the financial year ending 27 Mach 2016. 
The Company also indemnifies the Directors under a qualifying indemnity 
for the purposes of section 236 of the Companies Act 2006: in the 
case of the Non-Executive Directors in their respective letters of 
appointment and in the case of the Executive Directors in a separate 
deed of indemnity. Such indemnities contain provisions that are 
permitted by the Director Liability provisions of the Companies Act 
and the Company’s Articles. 
Environmental
Information on the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions is set out in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility section on page 43 and forms part of 
this report by reference. 
Political donations
During the year, no political donations were made.
External branches 
The Group had no active registered external branches during the 
reporting period. 
Financial instruments
Details of the financial risk management objectives and policies of  
the Group, including hedging policies and exposure of the entity  
to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk are given in 
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors has confirmed that:
(i)  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
(ii)  the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have  
taken as a Director to make him/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware  
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union, 
and the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising Financial Reporting 
Standard 102 The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the  
UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) and applicable law). Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of  
the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102, have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Group and parent company financial statements 
respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

77 Directors’ report continued
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 7 4, 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and  
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
•  the Strategic report contained on pages 2 to 43 and the Directors’

development and performance of the business and the position  
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and

Auto Trader Group plc (the parent 
company), Auto Trader Limited  
(the Group’s UK trading company)  
and Auto Trader Holding Limited  
(the Group’s financing company)

and its impact on revenue recognition.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating 
whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented 
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we 
tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments 
we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this 
context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Accounting for share-based payment arrangements 
Refer to page 55 of the Report of the Audit Committee, page 92 of  
the Statement of Accounting Policies and note 27 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
In the year the Group has implemented four share-based payment 
schemes for certain members of management and employees, which 
are accounted for under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’ (“IFRS 2”). 
A share-based payment charge of £2.5m (including associated 
national insurance costs) has been recognised within the consolidated 
income statement in the year.
Determining the fair value of awards made under share-based 
payment arrangements is complex and requires the Directors to  
apply significant judgement as the assumptions used are inherently 
subjective. The key assumptions applied in determining the fair value 
of awards made in the year include the risk free rate, the volatility  
rate, the expected lapse rate for potential leavers and the expected 
achievement of financial performance measures associated with 
awards made.
The Group engaged independent specialists to calculate the fair  
value of awards made using the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo 
option pricing models.
We focused our work on the key assumptions adopted by 
management and the appropriateness of the valuation  
methodologies applied. 
We read the scheme rules for each of the four schemes implemented in  
the year to understand the terms and conditions attached to them, as well  
as confirming the number of share options granted and the date of grant, 
which were all consistent with the Directors’ calculations and disclosures. 
We compared the risk free rate and volatility assumptions to externally derived 
data, as well as our own independently formed assessments in relation to 
these key inputs in order to assess whether the assumptions used were 
reasonable. All assumptions applied were in line with our independently 
formed assessments and within an acceptable range.
We compared the expected lapse rate for employees leaving the business  
to historical trends within the business and consider the assumptions applied 
to be reasonable.
We assessed the Directors’ assessment of the likelihood of financial 
performance measures being achieved by comparing the assumptions to  
the Group’s future trading and cash flow forecasts covering the relevant 
period, ensuring these were consistent with the forecasts used by the 
Directors in assessing going concern and in preparing the viability statement. 
No inconsistencies between the forecasts used were identified and the 
assumptions adopted were appropriate. 
We assessed the appropriateness of the option pricing models used  
to determine the fair values by the Group’s independent specialists.  
The Black-Scholes model was applied for schemes, or elements of schemes, 
which had only non-market performance conditions and the Monte Carlo 
model was used where market based performance conditions were in place. 
The use of these pricing models was consistent with our expectations given 
the performance conditions attached to the share awards and accepted 
market practices.
We considered the appropriateness of the presentation of the share-based 
payment charge as a non-underlying expense. We determined that this 
presentation was appropriate because the Group plans to make awards  
each year between now and 2018, and the income statement expense  
will only reflect a steady state once three years of awards have been made. 
Accordingly, we believe adjusting for the share-based payment charge in  
the income statement will provide greater comparability of performance to  
the user of the financial statements. 
Continued implementation of new customer billing system 
(Singleview) and its impact on revenue recognition 
The Group began the implementation of a new billing system, 
Singleview, in 2013, and this has continued to be rolled out throughout 
the 2016 financial year, with the majority of the Group’s largest 
customers being migrated to Singleview in the 2016 financial year. 
The implementation and roll out of Singleview gives rise to a 
heightened risk over the recording of revenue. The risk was identified 
in respect of three areas, as follows:
• The risk that data is not accurately migrated between the legacy 
system and Singleview resulting in incorrect customer billing 
information;
• The risk that access to Singleview is not appropriately controlled 
and managed such that changes to billing data could be made 
inaccurately or in error; and
• The risk that billing data held within Singleview does not interface 
completely and accurately with the Group’s other financial reporting 
systems.
All of these areas of risk could result in misstatements in the recording 
of revenues.
We performed testing over IT general controls in place over Singleview and 
the Group’s other key financial reporting systems which focused on controls 
covering system changes, systems operations and user access and user 
rights. Testing over the controls in operations did not identify any significant 
control deficiencies. While we did identify some minor control deficiencies, 
these did not significantly impact our audit plan.
We obtained an understanding of the processes in place and performed 
testing over the controls in operation over the migration of data to Singleview. 
The controls tested included reconciliations performed by management of 
data and billing information between Singleview and the legacy billing system 
and reviews performed by management of exception reports from Singleview 
designed to identify errors in billing data arising from data transfer. From our 
work performed no issues were identified.
We performed testing over system interfaces between the Singleview system 
and the Group’s other financial reporting system. This included reviews of 
exception reports designed to identify errors in the automatic transfer of billing 
data between the systems and performed detailed testing over the 
reconciliations of revenue between the Singleview system and the Group’s 
financial reporting systems, with no exceptions being identified.
We performed testing over a sample of revenue transactions back to 
customer contracts and rate cards which verified the accuracy of billing  
data contained within Singleview. 
We found that, following the implementation of Singleview, the accuracy of 
revenue recorded was supported by the evidence obtained.

80 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, 
the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates. 
The Group comprises the following entities:
• Auto Trader Limited and Webzone Limited being the Group’s 
trading entities which are based in the UK and the Republic of 
Ireland respectively;
• Auto Trader Group plc, the parent company of the Group;
• Three active holding companies, one based in the UK (Auto Trader 
Holding Limited) and two based in the Republic of Ireland; and
• 24 UK based dormant holding companies which are in the process 
of being liquidated.
The Group audit team in the UK performed an audit of the complete 
financial information of Auto Trader limited, Auto Trader Group plc  
and Auto Trader Holding Limited, which we regarded as financially 
significant components of the Group. These components accounted 
for over 98% and 95% of the Group’s revenue and profit before tax  
for the period.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of 
our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures  
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and  
in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on  
the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality  
for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality 
£7 ,756,000 
How we  
determined it
5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
Profit from continuing operations before tax is 
the key measure used both by the Board and 
externally by shareholders in evaluating the 
performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £388,000 as well  
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 35, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we  
have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that  
the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that 
the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date  
the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is 
appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions  
can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial period for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in

 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of 
the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no 
exceptions to report.
•  the statement given by the Directors on pages   
55 to 56, in accordance with provision C.1.1  of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), 
that they consider the Annual Report taken as a

and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge of  
the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit.
We have no 
exceptions to report.

Governance The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group  
and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 33 of the 
Annual Report, in accordance with provision 
C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that 
describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
•  the Directors’ explanation on page 35 of the 
Annual Report, in accordance with provision 
C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group, over 
what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and  
their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will  
be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to add or to 
draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation 
to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries  
and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant 
provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements  
are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed 
our review.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and 
the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement  
set out on pages 77 and 78, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that  
they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by  
the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
82 We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of 
Auto Trader Group plc for the 52 week period ended 27 March 2016 
and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited.

88 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
General information
Auto Trader Group plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have  
been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The financial information presented is at and for the 52-week 
financial years ended 29 March 2015 and 27 March 2016. Financial year ends have been referred to as 31 March throughout the consolidated 
financial statements as per the Company’s accounting reference date. Financial years are referred to as 2016 and 2015 in these consolidated 
financial statements.
On 24 March 2015, the Company obtained control of the entire share capital of Auto Trader Holding Limited via a share-for-share exchange. 
There were no changes in rights or proportion of control exercised as a result of this transaction. Although the share-for-share exchange 
resulted in a change of legal ownership, this was a common control transaction and therefore outside the scope of IFRS 3. The comparative 
year disclosed in these consolidated financial statements reflects the continuation of the pre-existing Group, headed by Auto Trader Holding 
Limited, and have been prepared applying the principles of predecessor accounting ownership.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted  
by the European Union (‘EU’), IFRS Interpretation Committee (‘IFRS IC’), certain interpretations as adopted by the EU, and the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis 
and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative 
instruments) at fair value through profit or loss. 
Going concern
The Directors, after making enquiries and on the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, believe that the Group has 
adequate financial resources to continue in operation for a period not less than 12 months from the date of this report. For this reason,  
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions.  
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and judgements 
are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed  
to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The accounting estimates believed to require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgements and which are the most critical to the 
reporting of results of operations and financial positions are as follows: 
• carrying values of goodwill; 
• share-based payments; and
• capitalised development spend.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated. The recoverable 
amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the use of estimates, see note 11. 
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are 
accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of services received in return for share options is calculated 
with reference to the fair value of the award on the date of grant. Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models have been used where appropriate  
to calculate the fair value and the Directors have therefore made estimates with regards to the inputs to that model and the period over which 
the share award is expected to vest (note 27). 
Costs incurred in developing new products are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for software and website 
development costs (note 11). Determining the amounts to be capitalised requires management to make assumptions and estimates  
regarding the expected future cash generation of the software products or websites and the expected period of benefits to be received.

New accounting standards and IFRS IC interpretations
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRSs in 2016 in the consolidated financial statements. There has not been a material 
impact to the Group when adopting these new and amended IFRSs:
• Annual improvements 2010-2012 (effective 1 July 2014) (endorsed for 1 February 2015)
•  Amendment to IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, on defined benefit plans (effective 1 July 2014) (endorsed for 1 February 2015)
•  Annual improvements 2011-2013 (effective 1 July 2014) (endorsed for 1 January 2015)
•  IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’ (effective 1 January 2014) (endorsed 17 June 2014)
The following standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRS IC, but have not been adopted either because they were not 
endorsed by the EU at 31 March 2016 or they are not yet mandatory and the Group has not chosen to early-adopt them. The impact on the 
Group’s financial statements of the future standards, amendments and interpretations is still under review, but the Group does not expect any  
of these changes to have a material impact on the results or the net assets of the Group: 
• Annual improvements 2012-2014 (effective 1 January 2016)
•  Amendment to IFRS 11, ‘ Joint arrangements on acquisition of an interest in a joint operation’, (effective 1 January 2016)  
(subject to EU endorsement)
•  Amendment to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38, ‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortisation  
(effective 1 January 2016) (subject to EU endorsement)
•  Amendments to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 41, ‘Agriculture’ on bearer plants (effective 1 January 2016)  
(subject to EU endorsement)
•  Amendments to IAS 27 , ‘Separate financial statements’ on equity accounting (effective 1 January 2016) (subject to EU endorsement)
•  Amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and IAS 28, ’Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on applying  
the consolidation exemption (effective 1 January 2016) subject to EU endorsement
•  Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ disclosure initiative (effective 1 January 2016) (subject to EU endorsement)
•  IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018)
•  IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from Contracts with customers’ (effective 1 January 2018)
•  IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ (effective 1 January 2019)
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
90 Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Auto Trader Group plc and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings. 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power  
over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from  
the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is  
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.  
Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. 
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value  
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total  
of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 
20% and 50% of the voting rights. Where significant influence is not demonstrated but the shareholding is between 20% and 50% the Group 
would account for its interest as an investment. All investments are initially recognised at cost and the carrying value is reviewed for impairment.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the Operational Leadership Team that makes strategic decisions (note 3).
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the 
Group’s activities. Revenue is stated net of discounts, rebates, returns and value-added tax.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow  
to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below. The Group bases its estimates  
on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transactions and the specifics of each arrangement.
Revenue comprises:
• fees for advertising on the Group’s website and web-related activities, which are recognised on a straight-line basis as the service is  
provided; and
• retailer website build and hosting subscription fees, maintenance contracts and other subscription fees, which where invoiced in advance  
are deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over the period to which they relate.
Discontinued operations
The closure of the magazines division in the UK and Ireland at the end of June 2013 has been presented as a discontinued operation (note 7).
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Group’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the Group’s shareholders.

Employee benefits
The Group operates several pension schemes and all except one are defined contribution schemes. Within the UK all pension schemes set  
up prior to 2001 have been closed to new members and only one defined contribution scheme is now open to new employees.
a) Defined contribution scheme
The assets of the defined contribution scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The costs  
in respect of this scheme are charged to the income statement as incurred.
b) Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme that is closed to new members. The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet 
in respect of the defined benefit scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of  
the scheme’s assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of 
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating those of the related pension liability. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes  
in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in ‘other comprehensive income’ in the period in which they arise. Any scheme 
surplus (to the extent it can be recovered) or deficit is recognised in full on the balance sheet.
c) Share-based payments
Equity-settled awards are valued at grant date, and the difference between the grant date fair value and the consideration paid by the employee 
is charged as an expense in the income statement spread over the vesting period. Fair value of the awards are measured using Black-Scholes 
and Monte Carlo pricing models. The credit side of the entry is recorded in equity. Cash-settled awards are revalued at each reporting date with 
the fair value of the award charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period and the credit side of the entry recognised as a liability. 
Movements in provisions for bad leavers are taken through reserves.
Non-underlying items
Significant items of income and expense that do not relate to the trading of the Group are disclosed as ‘non-underlying’. Examples of such items 
are exceptional items, share-based payments and associated NI, management incentive plans (relating to the change of ownership structure) 
and impairment charges.
Exceptional items
Significant non-recurring items of income and expense are disclosed as ‘exceptional items’. Examples of items that may give rise to disclosure 
as exceptional items include costs of major restructuring and reorganisation of the business, corporate refinancing and restructuring costs, 
gains on the early extinguishment of borrowings or impairments of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, as well as the reversal of 
such writedowns or impairments, material disposals of property, plant and equipment and litigation settlements. A full analysis of exceptional 
items is provided in note 4 and note 8.
Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentation currency,  
and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand (£0.1m) except when otherwise indicated.
b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the period end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses.
c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated into sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
• income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated  
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
92 Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses are charged to the 
income statement and are not reversed. The gain or loss on the disposal of an entity includes the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units that 
are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
b) Trademarks, trade names, technology and customer relationships
Separately acquired trademarks, trade names, technology and customer relationships are recognised at historical cost. They have a finite useful 
life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their 
estimated useful lives of between one and 15 years. Trademarks, trade names, technology and customer relationships acquired in a business 
combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently amortised.
c) Software
Acquired computer software is capitalised at cost, including any costs to bring it into use, and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over the estimated useful life of three to five years.
d) Software and website development costs and financial systems
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products, websites and systems 
controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product or website so that it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product or website and use or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product or website;
• it can be demonstrated how the software product or website will generate probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product or website are 
available; and
• the expenditure attributable to the software product or website during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product, website or system include employee and contractor costs.
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria as well as ongoing maintenance and costs associated with routine upgrades 
and enhancements are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs for software, websites and systems are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised over their useful 
lives (not exceeding five years) at the point in which they come into use.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost comprises 
the purchase price of the asset and expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the item.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their 
estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Land, buildings and leasehold improvements:
• Freehold buildings 50 years
• Leasehold land and buildings life of lease
• Leasehold improvements life of lease
• Plant and equipment 3–10 years
Strategic report Financial statements
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
93
Governance 1. Accounting policies continued
Assets in the course of construction are recorded separately within property, plant and equipment and are transferred to the appropriate 
classification when complete and depreciated from the date they are brought into use.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The carrying value of assets  
is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Assets will be written 
down to their recoverable amount if lower than the carrying value, and any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement within ‘administrative expenses’.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets  
that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds 
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). 
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each  
reporting date. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent 
cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated  
to the cash-generating unit (or group of units) and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a  
pro-rata basis.
Assets and liabilities (or disposal groups) held for sale
Assets and liabilities (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. On classification as held for sale, they are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. Impairment losses are included in the income statement, as are any gains and losses on subsequent re-measurement.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the categories of loans and receivables and at fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends 
on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet. Loans and 
receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial assets measured at fair value are those held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are categorised  
as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets. Financial assets carried at fair 
value through the profit or loss account are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the income statement. They 
are subsequently re-measured to fair value and gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised in the income statement in 
the period in which they arise. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets  
is impaired. A financial asset is impaired only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after  
the initial recognition of the asset and that this event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably 
estimated. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the 
loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
94 If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreased and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring  
after the impairment was recognised, the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is credited to the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group used derivative financial instruments in the year ended 31 March 2015 to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes.
Derivatives were initially recognised at fair value on the contract date and were subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the  
fair value of instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting were recognised in the income statement as they arose.
The Group documented at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The Group 
also documented its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative used in the hedging transactions 
was highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. 
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more 
than 12 months, and a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in ‘other 
comprehensive income’. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within ‘finance 
costs’. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the profit or loss.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,  
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group  
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, short-term deposits held on call with banks and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown 
within borrowings in ‘current liabilities’ on the balance sheet. 
Trade payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Finance and issue costs associated with the borrowings are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method from  
the date of issue over the estimated life of the borrowings to which the costs relate.
Borrowings are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. Where an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such as 
an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference  
in respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the income statement. 
The buyback of bank borrowings represents the discharge of the obligation to repay the debt. The difference between the carrying amount of 
the financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid is recognised as an exceptional gain in the income statement, as it is a significant 
non-recurring item.
Preference shares are treated as borrowings where in substance they have the features of debt instruments; otherwise they are classified  
as equity. The related dividends are recognised as an interest expense for debt instruments and as dividends for equity instruments.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date.

Governance 1. Accounting policies continued
Provisions
A provision is recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. Where  
there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class  
of obligations as a whole. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate  
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and where appropriate the risks specific to the obligation.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed unless an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised but 
are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred taxation. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in ‘other comprehensive income’ or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in ‘other comprehensive 
income’ or directly in equity, respectively. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid  
to the tax authorities.
Current taxation is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) calculated using the rates of tax and laws that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities  
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred taxation is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred taxation assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balance on a net basis.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Preference shares are classified as liabilities where in substance they have features of debt instruments, 
otherwise they are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from 
the proceeds.
Where the Group purchases its own equity share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from equity attributable to the Group’s 
shareholders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received is included  
in equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Auto Trader Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016
96 Share premium and other reserves
The amount subscribed for the ordinary shares in excess of the nominal value of these new shares is recorded in ‘share premium’. The amount 
subscribed for the preference shares in excess of the nominal value of these new preference shares is recorded in ‘other reserves’. 
Costs that directly relate to the issue of ordinary shares are deducted from share premium net of corporation tax.
The capital reorganisation reserve arises on consolidation as a result of the share-for-share exchange on 24 March 2015. It represents the 
difference between the nominal value of shares issued by Auto Trader Group plc in this transaction and the share capital and reserves of 
Auto Trader Holding Limited.
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (‘EPS’) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable 
to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. For diluted EPS, the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
As explained in the basis of preparation accounting policy, the Group’s financial statements reflect the continuation of the pre-existing Group 
headed by Auto Trader Holding Limited. The 2015 weighted average number of shares has been stated as the weighted average number of 
shares in the period from the date of the Group capital reorganisation to the balance sheet date.
A reconciliation of the adjusted and alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 10.
Shares held by the Employee Share Option Trust
The Employee Share Option Trust (‘ESOT’) provides for the issue of shares to Group employees principally under share option schemes.  
The Group has control of the ESOT and therefore consolidates the ESOT in the Group financial statements. Accordingly, shares in the Company 
held by the ESOT are included in the balance sheet at cost as a deduction from equity.
2. Financial risk management
a) Financial risk factors
In the course of its business the Group is exposed to market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk 
and technology risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy is to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance and net 
assets of the Group. These policies are set and reviewed by senior finance management and all significant financing transactions are authorised 
by the Board of Directors.
Market risk
i. Foreign exchange risk
The Group has no significant foreign exchange risk as 98% of the Group’s revenue and 97% of costs are sterling-denominated.
The Group operates in Ireland. Foreign-currency-denominated net assets of overseas operations are not hedged as they represent a relatively 
small proportion of the Group’s net assets. The Group operates a dividend policy ensuring any surplus cash is remitted to the UK and translated 
into sterling thereby minimising the impact of exchange volatility. 
ii. Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings under the new Syndicated Term Loan subject to floating rates of interest linked 
to LIBOR. Prior to the Group restructure in March 2015 the Group also had interest rate risk from borrowings under the former Syndicated Bank 
Loan (‘former Senior Debt’), the Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners (‘GSMP’) Junior Debt (‘former Junior Debt’) and Shareholder Loan Notes 
subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR. 
Prior to the Group restructure interest rate risk on the bank borrowings was managed by using interest rate swaps to convert £335.0m of the 
debt from floating to fixed rates. Under the interest rate swaps the Group agreed with the other party to exchange on a monthly basis the 
difference between the fixed contract rate and the floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. 
The interest rate swaps held by the Group were settled as part of the Group restructure and were not replaced by any similar arrangements. 
The Group monitors interest rates on an ongoing basis but does not currently hedge interest rate risk.

Governance 2. Financial risk management continued
iii.  Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract. The Group 
has dedicated standards, policies and procedures to control and monitor all such risks. Although the Group is potentially exposed to credit  
loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties, such credit risk is controlled through credit rating reviews of the counterparties and by 
limiting the total amount of exposure to any one party. The Group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations of credit risk.  
As an example, the Group’s borrowings are arranged with a syndicate of major banks and are committed until 2020. 
Credit risk relating to trade receivables is managed centrally and the credit risk for new customers is analysed before standard payment terms 
and conditions are offered. Policies and procedures exist to ensure that existing customers have an appropriate credit history and a significant 
number of balances are prepaid or collected via direct debit. Sales to private customers are primarily settled using major debit or credit cards 
which reduces the risk in this area. Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of either customer credit or bad 
debt risk, due to the diversified and fragmented nature of the customer base.
The cost of bad debts for the year ended 31 March 2016 was 0.8% of revenue (for the year ended 31 March 2015: 0.8%).
iv.  Liquidity risk
Cash flow forecasting is performed centrally by the Group treasury manager. Rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements  
are monitored to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. Such forecasting takes into consideration the Group’s debt  
financing plans.
Surplus cash held by operating entities over and above the balance required for working capital management is invested centrally in interest-
bearing current accounts and money market deposits with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity as required by the above-mentioned 
forecasts. At the balance sheet date the Group held money market deposits of £Nil (2015: £Nil) that are expected to generate cash inflows  
for managing liquidity risk. 
The tables below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities and undrawn commitments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period at the balance sheet date to contractual maturity date. Derivative financial instruments are included in the analysis if their contractual 
maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, except for derivative financial instruments cash flows.

98 b) Capital risk management
The Group considers capital to be net debt plus adjusted total equity. Net debt is defined as borrowings excluding debt issue costs less cash 
and short-term deposits. Adjusted total equity is defined as total equity excluding the capital reorganisation reserve, as shown in the 
consolidated balance sheet.
The calculation of total capital is shown in the table below:

Loans due within one year – –
Loans and overdrafts greater than one year 403.0 550.0

Less: Capital reorganisation reserve 1,060.8 1,060.8
Adjusted total equity 1,009.3 884.7
Total capital 1,401.9 1,412.6
The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital. 
The margin payable on the new Syndicated Term Loan interest is dependent on the consolidated leverage ratio of Auto Trader Group plc and its 
subsidiaries and this is calculated and reviewed on a semi-annual basis. Repayments can be made without penalty under the new Syndicated 
Term Loan Agreement and there is no requirement to settle all or part of the new Syndicated Term Loan earlier than its termination date of 2020. 
c) Fair value estimation
As at 31 March 2016 the Group had no financial instruments held at fair value through profit and loss.

Governance 3. Segmental information
IFRS 8 Operating segments requires the Group to determine its operating segments based on information which is provided internally. Based 
on the internal reporting information and management structures within the Group, it has been determined that there is only one operating 
segment, being the Group, as the information reported includes operating results at a consolidated Group level only. This reflects the nature of 
the business, where the major cost is to support the IT platforms upon which all of the Group’s customers are serviced. These costs are borne 
centrally and are not attributable to any specific customer type or revenue stream. There is also considered to be only one reporting segment, 
which is the Group, the results of which are shown in the consolidated income statement.
Management has determined that there is one operating and reporting segment based on the reports reviewed by the Operational Leadership 
Team (‘OLT’) which is the chief operating decision-maker (‘CODM’). The OLT is made up of the two Executive Directors and key management 
and is responsible for the strategic decision-making of the Group.
To assist in the analysis of the Group’s revenue-generating trends, the OLT reviews revenue from three customer types as detailed below:
• Trade: revenue from retailer customers and revenue from other products and services provided to retailers and home traders to support  
their online activities;
• Consumer services: revenue from individuals for vehicle advertisements on the Group’s websites. This category also includes revenue 
derived from third-party services directed at consumers relating to their motoring needs, such as insurance and loan finance; and
• Display advertising: revenue from customers and advertising agencies for placing display advertising on the Group’s websites.
The reporting information provided to the OLT, which presents revenue by customer type, has been voluntarily disclosed below:

Trade 236.4 214.8
Consumer services 30.3 29.0
Display advertising 14.9 12.1
Total revenue from continuing operations 281.6 255.9
The revenue from external parties reported to the OLT is measured in a manner consistent with that in the income statement.
Underlying operating profit
Operating costs, comprising administrative expenses, are managed on a Group basis. The OLT measures the overall performance of the  
Group by reference to the following non-GAAP measure: 
• Underlying operating profit which is operating profit before share-based payments and associated NI, management incentive plans and 
exceptional items. 
This adjusted profit measure is applied by the OLT to understand the earnings trend of the Group and is considered the most meaningful 
measure by which to assess the true operating performance of the Group.
Adjusted underlying EBITDA was previously used to reflect the underlying performance of the business as it reflected both the impact of 
non-underlying items and the change in approach to technology development that was implemented in September 2013 and which resulted  
in less of the Group’s expenditure on internal development salaries meeting the requirements for capitalisation. As this approach to technology 
development has been consistent in both the current and prior periods, there is no requirement to make such an adjustment.
In addition, in order to provide comparability of results from period to period and with listed peer companies the Directors now consider 
Underlying operating profit to be a more appropriate indicator of the underlying performance of the business during the period.

The tax charge for the year is based on the effective rate of UK corporation tax for the period of 20% (2015: 21%). Changes to the UK 
corporation tax rates were announced on 8 July 2015. These changes were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2015 on 
26 October 2015 and include reductions to the main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020. On 16 March 2016 further 
changes to the UK corporation tax rate were announced including a further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 17% from 2020, which 
supersedes the change enacted on 26 October 2015. However, this further change was not substantively enacted as at 31 March 2016 and  
has not therefore been reflected in these financial statements.

Adjusted basic and diluted EPS 1,000,000,000 41.2 4.12
Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended March 2015 are the same as there was no difference between the basic and the  
diluted number of shares. The weighted average number of shares for the year to March 2015 has been stated as if the Group reorganisation 
completed on 24 March 2015 had occurred at the beginning of the 2015 financial year. The weighted average number of shares in issue in  
the period from 24 March 2015 to the year end was 1,000 million.
The difference between the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares represents the dilutive effect of the Share Incentive Plan, 
Performance Share Plan and the Sharesave scheme. Shares issued to satisfy the Share Incentive Plan were subsequently purchased by the 
Employee Share Option Trust (‘ESOT’) and are entitled to dividends under the scheme rules. The number of shares in issue at the start of the 
year is reconciled to the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares below:

quoted market prices for the period during which the share-based incentives were outstanding.

At 31 March 2016, £0.1m of software and website development costs (31 March 2015: £0.1m) represented assets under construction. 
Amortisation of these assets will commence when they are brought into use. 
For the year to 31 March 2016, the amortisation charge of £7 .8m (2015: £10.0m) has been charged to administrative expenses in the income 
statement and £Nil (2015: £Nil) has been charged to the results from the discontinued operations. 
Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequent testing if there are indicators of impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash 
inflows independently in relation to the specific goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations that use cash flow projections from the latest three-year 
plan approved by the Directors. Following the closure of the magazine business in 2013 all assets have been allocated to the Auto Trader  
Digital CGU.
Key assumptions in the budgets and plans include future revenue growth rates, associated future levels of marketing support and directly 
associated overheads. These assumptions are based on historical trends and future market expectations. Cash flows beyond the three-year 
period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rate of 2.0% (2015: 2.0%). The pre-tax discount rate which has been applied  
in determining value in use for individual CGUs for potential impairments is 8.0% (2015: 8.0%).
Significant headroom exists in the CGUs that have not been fully impaired. There are no reasonable possible changes to the assumptions 
presented above that would result in any impairment recorded in each of the years presented in these financial statements. 
Intangible assets have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation of these intangible assets  
is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (three to fifteen years).  
The longest estimated useful life remaining at 31 March 2016 is five years.

Syndicated Term Loan (the debt under the terms of the new Senior Facilities Agreement)
On 24 March 2015, the Company and a subsidiary undertaking, Auto Trader Holding Limited, entered into a £550.0m Senior Facilities 
Agreement as part of the Group restructure. The associated debt transaction costs were £9.4m. The first utilisation was made on 24 March 
2015 when £550.0m was drawn.
Interest on the Syndicated Term Loan is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.5% and 3.25% depending on the consolidated leverage 
ratio of the Group. There is no requirement to settle all or part of the debt earlier than the termination date in March 2020.
Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the lenders also made available to the Company and Auto Trader Holding Limited a £30.0m revolving 
credit facility (the ‘RCF’). Other than an ancillary facility of £0.6m, the RCF was undrawn at 31 March 2016 (2015: undrawn). Cash drawings 
under the RCF would incur interest at LIBOR, plus a margin of between 1.25% and 3.0% depending on the consolidated leverage of the Group 
(31 March 2015: 1.25% and 3.0%). A commitment fee of 35% of the margin applicable to the RCF from time to time is payable quarterly in 
arrears on the unutilised amounts of the RCF.
During the year to 31 March 2016 the Group repaid £147 .0m of the Syndicated Term Loan (2015: £Nil).
Senior Bank Debt (‘former Senior Debt’) (the debt under the terms of the former Senior Facilities Agreement)
On 24 March 2015 the Group repaid the full £632.0m of the former Senior Debt (together with accrued interest, break costs and other costs 
payable under the terms of the former Senior Facilities Agreement) as part of the overall restructuring of the Group. Interest on the former  
Senior Debt was charged at LIBOR plus a margin of between 4.25% and 4.5% based on the consolidated leverage ratio of Trader Media  
Group Holdings Limited, a subsidiary company. This calculation encompasses the former GSMP Junior Debt of £358.4m described below.
GSMP Junior Debt (‘former Junior Debt’) (the debt under the terms of the former GSMP Junior Debt Agreement)
On 24 March 2015 the Group repaid the full £358.4m of the former Junior Debt (together with accrued interest, break costs and other costs 
payable under the terms of the GSMP Junior Debt Agreement) as part of the overall restructuring of the Group. A premium of £26.2m was 
recognised in finance costs in the year to 31 March 2015 (note 8). Interest on the former Junior Debt was charged at LIBOR with a floor of  
1% plus a fixed margin of 8.75%.
Series A, B and C Shareholder Loan Notes
On 24 March 2015, as part of the overall Group restructure, the Group settled the full £128.8m of Shareholder Loan Notes in exchange for 
ordinary shares in Auto Trader Holding Limited. Interest was charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 9% on the Series A, B and C Shareholder Loan 
Notes. Interest was payable annually in arrears in June on the anniversary of the issue date, however the interest was rolled up into the principal 
every year since issue.

22. Retirement benefit obligations 
Across the UK and Ireland the Group operates several pension schemes. All except one are defined contribution schemes. Within the UK,  
all pension schemes set up prior to 2001 have been closed to new members and only one defined contribution scheme is now open to  
new employees.
In the year to 31 March 2016 the pension contributions to the Group defined contribution scheme amounted to £1.9m (2015: £2.0m) including 
the contributions related to the discontinued operations. At 31 March 2016, there are £0.3m (31 March 2015: £0.3m) of pension contributions 
outstanding relating to the Group’s defined contribution scheme.
The defined benefit pension scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable pay and this scheme was closed to new joiners with effect 
from May 2002. New employees after that date have been offered membership of the Group’s defined contribution scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit obligations was performed as at 31 March 2016 by a qualified independent actuary.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:
2016

During the year to 31 March 2016, the Group did not contribute to the defined benefit scheme (2015: £Nil). No contributions to this scheme are 
expected in the next financial year and there are no minimum funding requirements. As at 31 March 2016, approximately 65% of the liabilities 
(2015: 70%) are attributable to former employees who have yet to reach retirement and 35% to current pensioners (2015: 30%).

2016 2015
Discount rate 3.55% 3.30%
Pension growth rate 2.15% 2.20%
Inflation rate (‘RPI’) 3.25% 3.30%
Sensitivity to key assumptions has not been disclosed as any reasonable possible changes would not result in a significant change to the 
amounts recorded in the financial statements.
The Group has assumed that mortality will be in line with nationally published mortality table S1NA related to members’ years of birth with  
a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum. These tables translate into an average life expectancy for a pensioner retiring at age 65  
as follows:

Years

Total 18.4 100.0 19.6 100.0
This defined benefit pension scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are:
Asset volatility
The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will 
create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term while 
creating volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to equities is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term 
objectives.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the 
scheme’s bond holdings.
Inflation risk
A proportion of the scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although in most cases 
caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by  
or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy
The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the liabilities.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 22 years.

was 1,001,051,699.
On 29 July 2015 the Company completed a reduction of share capital and share premium (the ‘Capital Reduction’), whereby the entire amount 
outstanding on the Company’s share premium account was cancelled and the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the capital of the 
Company was reduced from £1.50 to £0.01. The Capital Reduction has created a significant amount of distributable reserves for the Company.

1,051,699 shares of the Company at a cost of £1.6m (2015: £nil) representing 0.1% of issued share capital. At 31 March 2016, 1,021,224 shares

The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016 is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and hence 
has not been included as liabilities in the financial statements at 31 March 2016.
Prior to the Group restructure on 24 March 2015, ordinary dividends of £3.6 million were paid in respect of the year ended March 2015 to the 
shareholders of Auto Trader Holding Limited. Dividends paid were declared on shares of the Group’s previous parent, Auto Trader Holding 
Limited, and were settled via the waiver of amounts due from shareholders. 
The Directors’ policy with regards to future dividends is set out in the Strategic report on pages 2 to 43.

Share options are granted to senior executives and other individuals throughout the organisation. The Group currently operates four share 
schemes and these are the Performance Share Plan, Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, Share Incentive Plan and the Sharesave scheme. The total 
charge in the year relating to the four schemes including associated national insurance (‘NI’) charges was £2.5m.
All share-based incentives are subject to service conditions. Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service received. 
The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives 
granted. The estimate of the fair value of the share-based incentives is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes pricing model 
as is most appropriate for each scheme.
NI is being accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when the awards are exercised, 
based on the share price at the reporting date. NI for the year ended 31 March 2016 relating to all awards was a charge of £0.2m. The Company 
NI charge for the year was £0.1m.
Share Incentive Plan
The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) scheme that was made available to all eligible employees following admission to the 
London Stock Exchange in March 2015. On 20 April 2015, all eligible employees were awarded free shares valued at £3,600 each based on 
the share price at the time of Admission. A total of 1,051,699 shares were awarded under the scheme, subject to a three-year service period 
(‘Vesting Period’).
The SIP awards have been valued using the Black-Scholes model and the resulting share-based payments charge spread evenly over the 
Vesting Period. The SIP shareholders are entitled to dividends over the Vesting Period. No performance criteria are applied to the vesting of S 
IP shares. Fair value at the grant date was measured to be £2.72.

The total charge in the year, included in operating profit, in relation to these awards was £0.7m (2015: £Nil). The Company charge for the year 
was £Nil.
Performance Share Plan
The Group operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for Executive Directors and certain key senior executives. On 19 June 2015, the Group 
awarded 1,641,267 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. The extent to which such awards vest will depend upon the Group’s performance 
over a three-year period following the award date. The vesting in March 2018 (‘Vesting Date’) of 25% of the 2015 PSP award will be dependent 
on a relative TSR performance condition measured over the performance period and the vesting of the 75% of the 2015 PSP award will be 
dependent on the satisfaction of a cumulative Underlying operating profit (‘UOP’) target measured over the performance period.
The PSP awards have been valued using the Monte Carlo model for the TSR element and the Black-Scholes model for the Underlying 
operating profit element and the resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the grant date  
and the Vesting Date.

Sharesave scheme
The Group operates a Sharesave (‘SAYE’) scheme for all employees under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares 
in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years’ time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make
monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period. Options are granted and are linked to a savings contract with a term of 
three years. These funds are used to fund the option exercise. No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options. The

Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (‘DABP’)
In June 2015 a DABP scheme was established which allows Executive Directors and other selected senior management the opportunity to earn 
a bonus determined as a percentage of base salary settled in nil cost deferred shares. The award of shares under the plan is contingent on the
satisfaction of pre-set internal targets relating to financial and operational objectives. The right to the shares is deferred for two years from the 
date of the award (the ‘Vesting Period’) and potentially forfeitable during that period should the employee leave employment. The charge is being 
spread evenly over the combined Performance Period and Vesting Period of the shares, being three years.
As of 31 March 2016 no options had been awarded for the June 2015 scheme. The share-based payments charge for the year in respect of the 
Performance Period is £0.3m (2015: £Nil). The Company charge for the year was £0.2m (2015: £Nil).

Report on the Company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Auto Trader Group plc’s Company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
27 March 2016;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• the Company balance sheet as at 27 March 2016; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement  
set out on page 77 , the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a  
true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the  
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently  
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other  
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information  
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter

Auto Trader Group plc for the 52 week period ended 27 March 2016.

128 1. Accounting policies
Auto Trader Group plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The Company was incorporated on 13 February 2015 and adopted FRS 102 from that date.
Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The Company financial statements of Auto Trader Group plc have been prepared in compliance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
including Financial Reporting Standard 102, ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland’  
(‘FRS 102’) and the Companies Act 2006. The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified 
for the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities through profit or loss. The current year financial information presented is for the year 
ended 27 March 2016. The comparative financial information presented is at and for the 45-day period ended 29 March 2015. Financial period 
ends have been referred to as 31 March throughout the consolidated financial statements as per the Company’s accounting reference date.
The Directors have used the going concern principle on the basis that the current profitable financial projections and facilities of the consolidated 
Group will continue in operation for a period not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
The Company financial statements have been prepared in sterling which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company and have 
been presented in round £m.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, an entity profit and loss account is not included as part of the published consolidated 
financial statements of Auto Trader Group plc. The loss for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company was 
£1.1m (2015: loss of £1.3m).
Amounts paid to the Company’s auditors in respect of the statutory audit were £50,000.
Estimation techniques
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree  
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are
• share-based payments; and
• carrying value of investments.
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are 
accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The accounting policies of such arrangements are disclosed in note 1 of  
the Group accounts. The fair value of services received in return for share options is calculated with reference to the fair value of the award on 
the date of grant. Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models have been used where appropriate to calculate the fair value and the Directors have 
therefore made estimates with regards to the inputs to that model and the period over which the share award is expected to vest (note 27 of  
the consolidated Group financial statements). 
The Group considers annually whether the carrying value of investments has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy 
stated. The recoverable amounts of investments have been determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the use of estimates. 
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment. Annually, the Directors consider whether any events or 
circumstances have occurred that could indicate that the carrying amount of fixed asset investments may not be recoverable. If such 
circumstances do exist, a full impairment review is undertaken to establish whether the carrying amount exceeds the higher of net  
realisable value or value in use. If this is the case, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the related investment.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the award is treated  
as a capital contribution by the Company and the investments in subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.

Governance 1. Accounting policies continued
Taxation and deferred taxation
UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred on the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all evidence available, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried-forward tax losses and from which  
the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse 
based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis.
Financial instruments
The Company has chosen to adopt Sections 11 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect of financial instruments.
a) Financial assets
Basic financial assets, including trade and other receivables, cash and bank balances and investments in commercial paper, are initially recognised 
at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the 
future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
At the end of each reporting period financial assets measured at amortised cost are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. If an asset 
is impaired the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at 
the asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the impairment is reversed. 
The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not 
previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Such assets are subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that investments in equity 
instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
Financial assets are derecognised when (a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or (b) substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party or (c) despite having retained some significant risks and rewards 
of ownership, control of the asset has been transferred to another party who has the practical ability to unilaterally sell the asset to an unrelated 
third-party without imposing additional restrictions.
b) Financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including trade and other payables, bank loans, loans from fellow Group companies and preference shares that are 
classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt 
instrument is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Debt instruments are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of 
the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of 
the facility to which it relates.
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts 
payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade 
payables are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which  
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. In respect of interim dividends, these are recognised once paid.

2012, with results for the year at the top
end of the Board’s expectations.
Strong revenue growth from our French and
Middle East businesses, together with the
disciplined delivery of our business plan,
which targets improvements in both
operational and capital efficiency, have
enhanced the performance of the Group
and strengthened its resilience to the
economic headwinds prevailing in our
European markets.
This strategic focus has improved our
return on capital employed (“ROCE”) for
the year , delivered revenue growth and
margin improvement, as well as supported
increased fleet investment, funded an
enhanced dividend and enabled further
debt reduction.
As our business plan gathers momentum,
the Board believes that a firm operational
base is being established with an
increasingly differentiated service offering.
This firm foundation together with our
strong cash flows and healthy capital
structure, will underpin the future
development of the Group, provide
enhanced financial returns and continue to
create increased shareholder value over
the medium term.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE, our key performance
metric, increased to 10.7% for the year; a
marked improvement over the return of
9.0% in 2011. The calculation of ROCE has
been based on the Group’s operating profit
before exceptional items for 2012, and the
average of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £292.5 million
(2011: £306.1 million). Further
improvements are targeted in 2013 as we
look to move the Group’s ROCE above our
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of
11% across the business cycle.
Dividend
Given the continued improvement in the
Group’s financial performance, the Board is
proposing a final dividend of 2.00 pence
per share, making a total dividend for the
year of 2.75 pence; an increase of 57% over
the previous year (2011: total dividend of
1.75 pence). The final dividend, if
approved, will be paid on 30 April 2013 to
shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 8 March 2013.
The proposed increase in the dividend for
the year reflects the Board’s confidence in
the future and our continued recognition
that dividends are an important means of
delivering shareholder value. As previously
stated, we intend, over time, to increase
dividend distributions to a level that is
covered three to four times by earnings.
Dividend cover in 2012, based on
underlying earnings per share, has been
reduced to 4.7 times (2011: 5.7 times): the
pace of further progress towards our aim
will reflect the Group’s investment needs
and funding requirements as we move
through the business cycle.
Operational and capital
efficiency programmes
The expected efficiency gains from our
three year plan are being delivered through
a range of enhanced operational
procedures and processes. By the end of
2012, we had secured operational
efficiency gains of £3.7 million per annum;
slightly ahead of our schedule to achieve
our previously stated target of annualised
savings of £5.0 million by the end of 2013.
These gains have been derived over the
past two years, principally in France,
Germany and the UK, from a combination
of better pricing, improved transport
efficiency, sales resource realignment and
procurement of goods and services. 
Our capital efficiency programmes remain
focussed on realigning the level of capital
employed in our European businesses,
while looking to allocate additional capital
through fleet expansion to our Middle East
operation to meet growing demand. We
continue to dispose of surplus under-
utilised fleet, mainly from Germany, but
more recently from Belgium, as well as re-
distributing fleet to improve overall
utilisation levels. Benefits from
Chairman’s statement
2    Lavendon Group plc 2012 improvements to our maintenance
processes, originally expected as a
reduction to our cost base, are now being
delivered through improved availability of
fleet, providing increased revenue
generation capacity without additional
capital investment – an important factor
that can amplify our financial returns
when market conditions improve.
The operational and capital efficiency
programmes remain a core focus for the
Board, and they have played a key part in
the overall improvement in the Group’s
ROCE, particularly in Germany where its
ROCE performance has improved by 210
bps in the year , thereby increasing its
relative contribution towards the Group’s
overall performance.
Financial results
The Group’s total revenue for the year
increased by 4% to £234.6 million (2011:
£225.4 million), with rental revenues
increasing by 2% to £220.7 million (2011:
£216.9 million) and revenues from the sale
of new and ex-rental fleet equipment
increasing by £5.4 million.
This increased revenue, together with the
additional operational efficiency gains
secured in the period, increased underlying
operating profits by 17% to £35.0 million
(2011: £30.0 million), with margins
improving to 14.9% (2011: 13.3%).
With underlying net interest costs reducing
to £7.4 million during the year (2011: £8.1
million), the Group’s underlying profit
before tax increased by 26% to £27.6
million (2011: £21.9 million). This increase
in profitability, combined with a reduced
effective tax rate of 23% (2011: 25%),
generated an underlying profit after tax of
£21.2 million (2011: £16.5 million) and a
28% increase in underlying earnings per
share to 12.83 pence (2011: 10.03 pence).
Amortisation charges in the year increased to
£3.8 million (2011: £2.3 million), reflecting
the full year amortisation of the intangible
assets acquired as part of the acquisition of
BlueSky Access Limited in October 2011.
During the year , the Group incurred an
exceptional charge of £3.6 million (2011:
£6.3 million). This charge relates to
ongoing restructuring, principally within
our German business, and the fees
associated with the Group’s bank
refinancing in February 2012. In addition to
this charge, there was a credit of £0.7
million relating to the net fair value
movement in financial derivatives arising in
the year (2011: credit of £0.8 million).
After amortisation charges, exceptional
items and fair value movements in financial
derivatives, the Group’s operating profit
was £29.7 million (2011: £22.9 million).
The Group’s profit before tax was £20.8
million (2011: £14.2 million) and the
Group’s profit after tax was £16.2 million
(2011: £15.2 million), with earnings per
share of 9.80 pence (2011: 9.22 pence).
Using exchange rates consistent with 2011,
the Group’s total revenues for the year
increased by 6% to £239.5 million (2011:
£225.4 million), with underlying operating
profits increasing by 18% to £35.4 million
(2011: £30.0 million). Underlying profits
before tax increased by 28% to £28.0
million (2011: £21.9 million), while
underlying profits after tax increased by
30% to £21.5 million (2011: £16.5 million),
with earnings per share also increasing by
30% to 13.06 pence (2011: 10.03 pence). 
As previously reported, the Group’s Spanish
business was closed in 2011 and its results
for the comparative period have been
reported as a discontinued operation.
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased by 5% to £75.6 million (2011:
£71.7 million), with margins improving to
32.2% (2011: 31.8%). Whilst the planned
increase in the purchase and sale of rental
fleet assets during the year resulted in net
cash outflows rising to £25.4 million (2011:
£4.4 million), the Group still generated a
healthy level of cash from operations of
£39.7 million (2011: £56.9 million). Net
cash generated from operating activities,
after payment of interest and tax, reduced
to £21.2 million (2011: £41.2 million).
Investment
As planned, the Group increased its level of
capital expenditure for 2012 with a total of
£47.9 million being invested in the Group’s
rental fleet and operational infrastructure
(2011: £16.9 million). This was partly
funded by the disposal of surplus or retired
assets which generated £11.1 million
(2011: £6.2 million). After reflecting
movements in amounts owing to equipment
suppliers at the beginning and end of the
year , this activity resulted in a net cash
outflow relating to capital expenditure of
£29.8 million (2011: £8.8 million), which
was funded from annual operating cash
flows. In 2013, it is planned to undertake
an investment programme of similar size to
2012, again funded through annual
operating cash flows.
The investment programme undertaken in
the year has replaced approximately 10% of
the Group’s rental fleet, expanded the
Middle East fleet to meet growing demand,
increased the availability of our BlueSky
range of machine attachments and
improved our operational infrastructure.
The overall impact of our fleet investment
and disposal programme has been a net
reduction in the Group’s total fleet size of
around 150 units to 19,800 machines by the
year end, but with an improved mix of
fleet and revenue-generating capability.
Net debt
Although the Group’s capital expenditure
programme increased in 2012, the strength
of the Group’s cash flows, combined with a
favourable foreign exchange movement of
£1.8 million, enabled the Group to reduce
its net debt levels at the year end to £97.3
million (2011: £106.6 million). Adjusting for
the un-amortised costs of £0.8 million
relating to the Group’s US Private
Placement in February 2012, the Group’s
reported net debt position at 31 December
2012 was £96.5 million. The corresponding
debt to equity ratio was 49% (2011: 58%),
with an improved net debt to pre-
exceptional EBITDA ratio (calculated on a 
“The Group’s ROCE, our key performance
metric, increased to 10.7% for the year;
a marked improvement over the return
of 9.0% in 2011 .”

rolling 12 month basis) of 1.28 times (2011:
1.49 times). The Group is operating well
within its banking covenants and has
significant liquidity available from its
combined finance facilities.
Refinancing
In February 2012, the Group replaced its
previous bank facilities with new debt
facilities of £150 million, comprising 
a £100 million revolving bank facility
expiring in July 2016 and a €60 million 
US Private Placement expiring in July
2019. These new facilities provide the
Group with a robust diversified financing
package, with significant liquidity that 
will support the development of the Group
in the coming years. The costs associated
with the new bank facility have been
written off as an exceptional item in 2012,
whilst the costs relating to the US Private
Placement are being amortised over the
term of that facility.
Summary and outlook
We are encouraged by the progress we
made during 2012, with our operational
and capital efficiency improvements
delivering the expected benefits, and
increasing demand continuing to drive our
Middle Eastern revenues and margins.
As a Board, the further improvement in
the Group’s ROCE continues to be our 
key priority, as we seek to move this
ahead of our weighted average cost of
capital in the coming year. Our focus
remains on the timely delivery of our
targeted operational efficiency gains, 
to enhance margins, and to allocate
capital in support of growth opportunities
and underpin our strong market positions.
In particular, further investment in our
Middle East business is planned, as we
believe the growth opportunities in that
region are considerable over the coming
years and the returns available warrant
the deployment of additional capital.
The planned increase in our investment
programme in 2012 was funded from
annual operating cash flows, enabling an
extensive replacement programme to be
undertaken in our European fleet as well
as facilitating an expansion of our Middle
East fleet to meet growing demand. 
The strength of the Group’s cash flows 
not only supported this increased level 
of investment during the year and funded
an enhanced dividend, but also facilitated
a further modest reduction in net 
debt levels. With strong cash flows, a
comfortable level of borrowings, a healthy
capital structure and enhanced liquidity
following the refinancing of the Group in
the year, we are well placed to fund our
future development and exploit growth
opportunities over the medium term.
While trading since the year end has been
disrupted by the adverse weather seen in
the UK and Continental Europe, and being
ever mindful of the continuing economic
uncertainty, the Board remains confident of
its expectations for the year as a whole and
believes the Group is well positioned to
deliver another year of financial progress
and continue to create increased
shareholder value over the medium term.

Chief Executive’s review
Introduction
This Operating and Financial Review
(“OFR”) describes the main factors and
trends underlying the Group’s performance
and financial position during the year ,
together with how these factors and trends
could impact the Group’s future
development.
The review has been prepared for the
Group as a whole and therefore gives
greater emphasis to those matters that 
are significant to Lavendon Group plc 
and its subsidiaries when viewed as a 
combined entity.
Business and market overview
The Group is the European and Middle East
market leader in the rental of powered
access equipment, operating a fleet of
almost 20,000 machines through a network
of 83 depots located in Belgium, France,
Germany, the UK and a number of
countries in the Middle East.
Powered access equipment is designed
to enable people to work safely and
efficiently at height. It is used in a wide
range of market sectors and applications,
including construction, civil engineering,
cleaning, inspection, facilities
management, industrial maintenance,
broadcasting and telecommunications.
In addition to general economic conditions,
demand for the equipment is driven by
the following factors:
• Commercial pressure to reduce
project timescales, where speed,
convenience, efficiency and safety
are prime concerns.
• Increased focus on safety in the
workplace, supported by ever more
stringent Health and Safety legislation,
accelerating the substitution of more
traditional methods of access, such as
ladders, scaffolding and mobile towers 
by powered access.
• The increasing modularisation of
construction processes, which tends to
produce a greater demand for access
equipment on construction sites.
• Escalating costs and shortage of skilled
labour in the construction and
refurbishment sectors, leading to a need
to ensure those available are equipped
with the necessary tools to be as
productive as possible.
Powered access equipment tends to be
rented rather than owned for the following
main reasons:
• The equipment has a relatively high
capital cost and stringent transport and
maintenance requirements.
• A range of equipment would be required
to satisfy all applications.
• The need for the equipment tends to be
infrequent and inconsistent due to varying
work schedules and applications.
The combination of the drivers of demand
and the efficiencies gained from the rental
of the equipment, should, we believe,
continue to enable the market to grow in
the coming years, subject to prevailing
economic conditions.
The competitive environments that we
experience vary from country to country.
However , a consistent feature is that the
markets are highly competitive, serviced by
operations ranging from divisions of public
companies, through private equity backed
ventures, to privately owned family
businesses, with the construction sector an
important market and particularly sensitive
to pricing levels. In recent years, we have
concentrated our efforts on building our
market position in those sectors that value
service, reliability and product range above
that of simply achieving the lowest price. At
the same time, we have sought to improve
our operational and capital efficiency
through a wide-ranging programme of
initiatives, to reduce the impact of fluctuations in the economic circumstances
of one or more of the countries in which we
operate. During 2012 we have continued the
development of consultative capabilities to
offer solutions to major powered access
users, enabling them to achieve safer , more
controlled and more efficient environments
for their staff involved in working at height.
Through deployment of these, often
intellectual-property protected solutions,
we believe we can continue to win market
share in maturing markets with a
proposition based on total value added,
rather than direct rental price.
Strategy and business objectives
We have seen a further improvement in the
Group’s financial performance during 2012,
despite the continuation of an uncertain
economic climate in our European markets.
This improvement, driven by operational
efficiency gains and leveraging strong
market positions, has enabled good
progress to be made towards our key
strategic objective of delivering returns on
capital employed (ROCE) that are above
our weighted average cost of capital over
the business cycle. We believe that by
achieving this objective; 
• substantial shareholder value will 
be created;
• additional growth capital will be 
attracted when required; and
• the Group’s investment case will be
fundamentally differentiated against
available alternatives.
Our strategy will be delivered through
deploying capital into markets that offer
attractive margins and/or growth potential,
and ensuring our businesses operate with
sufficient scale and efficiency that strong
market positions are secured to support
the future growth of the Group.
The Board monitors progress against its
strategic goal by reference to key
performance indicators. The key
performance indicators for the period 2008
to 2012 are shown in the table below:

Definitions
1 Revenue = revenue from continuing businesses as per
the Group income statement. 
2 EBITDA margin = Underlying EBITDA as a percentage of
revenue. Underlying EBITDA is defined as earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation,
exceptional items and movements in the fair value of
financial derivatives from continuing businesses, where
all figures are as per the Group financial statements.
3 Underlying operating profit margin = Underlying
operating profit as a percentage of revenue. Underlying
operating profit is defined as operating profit before
amortisation charges, exceptional items and
movements in the fair value of financial derivatives
from continuing operations, where all figures are as per
the Group income statement.
4 Debt to underlying EBITDA ratio = the Group’s total
net debt divided by EBITDA. Net debt is as per the
Group financial statements, and EBITDA is as defined in
definition 2 above plus EBITDA from discontinued
businesses where applicable.
5 Return on capital employed = operating profit before
exceptional items as a percentage of capital employed.
Capital employed being the aggregate of the average of
the Group’s opening and closing net assets and net
debt, as per the Group financial statements.
6 Employee turnover = number of employees leaving as
a percentage of total workforce on an annualised basis.
All staff departures are included within the calculation,
including restructures and redundancies. 
(Source: internal data).
The table demonstrates the improvement
in the Group’s financial performance in
2012, with revenues continuing to show
growth and underlying EBITDA and
operating margins both demonstrating
further improvement. As we planned,
investment in our rental fleet and
operating infrastructure increased
considerably in 2012 to £47.9 million
(from the £16.9 million invested in 2011),
however we were still able to make a
modest reduction of £9.3 million in the
Group’s net debt levels due to the
strength of our operating cash flows.
The debt to underlying EBITDA ratio has
reduced to 1.28 times from 1.49 times at
the end of 2011, an important indicator
of the improving financial strength of the
Group. In 2013, we will continue to invest
at the levels seen in 2012 and again plan
to fully fund this expenditure through
annual cash flows.
Employee turnover has increased to 19%
from 18% in the prior year , with ‘normalised’
employee turnover , after removing the
impact of restructuring, increasing to 11%
from 10% in 2011. This increase is
disappointing given our focus on employee
retention. We will continue to look at the
underlying causes behind this movement, so
that the appropriate measures can be taken
to improve retention in the coming year ,
and remain convinced that having a stable
and well motivated employee base is an
important factor in improving the overall
performance of the Group.

Don Kenny
Group Chief Executive
“We have seen a further improvement in the Group’s
financial performance during 2012, despite the
continuation of an uncertain economic climate in our
European markets. This improvement, driven by
operational efficiency gains and leveraging strong market
positions, has enabled good progress to be made...” Operating and financial review
Chief Executive’s review
continued
8    Lavendon Group plc 2012
We have structured the Group so that each
country of operation is viewed as a
separate reporting profit centre, supported
by central Group service functions. Each
operation has its own management team
responsible for delivering agreed
performance targets.
The performance of each continuing
operation is summarised below, with all
financial figures being underlying numbers
quoted before amortisation charges,
exceptional items and movements in the
fair value of financial derivatives.
UK
Rental revenues in the UK were broadly
flat for the year at £107.7 million (2011:
£108.4 million), as a year on year pricing
improvement of 1.5% compensated for a
decline in volumes during the year. An
increase in the sale of new and ex-rental
fleet equipment enabled the UK to grow
total revenues in the year by 2% to
£114.8 million (2011: £112.3 million).
Against the backdrop of a relatively weak
market, we believe our UK business is
continuing to gain market share with
major users of powered access equipment,
by differentiating itself through the
provision of value adding solutions that
improve safety and efficiency. At the same
time, we have improved the UK’s fleet
mix through the replacement of some
1,700 rental units, enhancing the range
of equipment on offer to our customers
and increasing our revenue generating
capacity. The combination of a well
invested fleet and a service offering that
goes beyond the pure rental of equipment,
underpins our ability to secure market
share and provides a degree of resilience
to pricing pressures. 
The UK business has been a key
contributor to the Group’s operational and
capital efficiency programme over the
past two years, with improvements in
pricing, transport efficiency and sales
resource allocation. The progress made in
transitioning to a more efficient operating
model has contributed to the increase in
underlying operating profits in the year to
£18.9 million (2011: £17.7 million) with
margins improving to 16.5% (2011: 15.8%).
Germany
Total Euro revenues in Germany were flat
compared to 2011, with an almost two fold
increase in revenues derived from the sale
of ex-rental fleet equipment off-setting 
a 6% decline in rental revenues. Once
converted to sterling, total revenues
declined by 7% to £47.5 million (2011:
£51.2 million), with rental revenues
declining by 12% to £43.5 million (2011:
£49.7 million).
Demand levels in Germany continue to be
unpredictable, with volumes in 2012,
particularly following the summer months,
not reaching prior year levels and not
reflecting traditional seasonal patterns.
Consequently, our focus was on the
continued delivery of our business plan to
increase the operational efficiency of the
business and to lower its capital base. In
particular over the past two years, the
German rental fleet has been reduced by
over 700 machines, with a net reduction of
almost 400 machines in 2012. This action
has lowered the German capital base,
removed a future capital replacement
requirement and generated increased
disposal revenues and profits.
Despite the weaker revenues seen in 2012,
the improvements in the cost efficiency of
the business and the reduced capital base
have delivered a marked improvement in
the ROCE performance of Germany, both
in absolute terms and in its relative
contribution to the overall financial
performance of the Group. Whilst the full
benefits of our restructure of the business
are yet to be seen, and, in the short term,
its delivery can create a degree of revenue
disruption, we are encouraged by the
progress made to date.
Underlying operating profits increased to
£5.0 million (2011: £4.1 million) and margins
improved to 10.5% from 8.0% in 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                           Lavendon Group plc 2012    9
Belgium
Belgium’s total Euro revenues grew by 6%,
with rental revenues increasing by 1% and
revenues from the sale of new and ex-
rental fleet equipment almost doubling.
Once converted to sterling, total revenues
were flat at £15.6 million (2011: £15.7
million), with rental revenues declining by
5% to £14.0 million (2011: £14.8 million).
This revenue performance was
disappointing given our expectation that
the transfer of fleet from our closed
Spanish operation towards the end of 2011
would be progressively utilised through the
year. As we moved through the second half
of the year and pricing pressure started to
emerge in the market, we took the view
that the additional fleet would not be fully
utilised and consequently commenced a
process to redistribute fleet and dispose of
surplus units.
Underlying operating profits reflect the
increase in the cost base in the year
following the transfer of fleet from Spain,
declining to £2.8 million (2011: £3.5
million), with margins declining but
remaining relatively healthy at 18.0%
(2011: 22.3%).
France
Our French business grew strongly in 2012,
with both total and rental Euro revenues
increasing by 17%. Once converted to
sterling, both total and rental revenues
increased by 10%.
This strong revenue performance has been
driven by a well utilised expanded fleet,
with excellent availability, and supported
by a targeted sales and marketing strategy.
Although the market has remained
relatively flat throughout the year , we have
been able to gain market share, and whilst
pricing has eased this has been more than
compensated by increased volumes. The
operating leverage derived from the
increased revenues was good, as the
expanded fleet was placed within the
existing depot network, and this generated
a 36% increase in underlying operating
profits to £2.7 million (2011: £2.0 million),
with margins improving to 13.7% from
11.2% in the previous year. 
Additional capital will be allocated to our
French business in 2013 to support our
growth aspirations in this market. 
Middle East
Revenues from our Middle East business
increased across the year , with the rate of
growth accelerating as we moved through
the second half of the year. Total local
currency revenues, including the sale of
new and ex-rental fleet equipment
increased by 29%, with local currency
rental revenues increasing by 35%. 
On conversion to sterling, total revenues
increased by 31% to £37.1 million 
(2011: £28.3 million) with rental revenues
increasing by 37% to £36.3 million 
(2011: £26.6 million).
Although this growth is centred on our
main markets of Saudi Arabia and Abu
Dhabi, our other operations in the region
experienced increased demand. To meet
this increased demand and support the
growth of our business, we progressively
allocated more capital to the region as we
went through the year , investing a total 
of £12 million in fleet expansion.
We believe that the current activity levels
are sustainable and likely to improve
further as we move through 2013.
Consequently we are committing additional
capital to the region in the coming year , to
ensure we are well placed to benefit from
the growth opportunities that become
available. We believe the scale of the
potential in the region could be significant
over the medium term and will warrant 
a further shift of our available capital into
the region over time.
Underlying operating profits for the 
year increased to £10.5 million (2011: 
£6.8 million), with margins improving to 
28.3% (2011: 24.0%).
Future developments
The Group made good progress during 2012
in improving the financial performance of
its operations, with strong revenue growth
in France and the Middle East being
augmented by further operational
efficiency gains.
In the coming year , we will ensure that the
final year of our three year business
improvement plan is delivered and that 
the overall targeted efficiency gain of 
£5.0 million is secured by the end of 2013.
At the same time, we will allocate
additional capital, principally into the
Middle East market but also on a smaller
scale into France, to support our ability to
meet increased demand, whilst continuing 
to manage our capital base in Germany 
to ensure further recovery in its ROCE 
is delivered.
The planned capital investment programme
for 2013 is, as in 2012, circa £50 million,
and will again be funded from our
operating cash flows, thereby ensuring that
the Group maintains a comfortable level of
borrowing and a healthy capital structure.
Whilst ever conscious of the continuing
uncertain economic environment, we
believe that the combination of “self-help”
measures to improve operational
performance, our selective investment in
attractive markets and close management
of cash generation, should enable the
Group to make further progress in
improving its return on capital employed 
in the coming year.

To help convey this message, in 2012 we created a guide which shows
how we strive to keep your safety as our priority. From engineering and 
operations, to customer service, training, and procurement, the brochure
details the steps we take to put safety first.
Of course,‘Your safety, our priority’ is about more than a document.
It’s about our belief in providing the solutions which truly safeguard
the wellbeing of all individuals, groups, and businesses who rely on us.
In 2013 we will be reinforcing the “Your safety, our priority” message
with specific campaigns in which we hope to raise the awareness of the
processes, policies and plans to enhance our reputation as a leading
safety solutions provider.
Your safety, our priority
At Lavendon Group, your safety is always our priority.
Whatever your relationship with the Group, as a
customer , an employee, a supplier , or other stakeholder ,
that is the goal, we’re committed to achieving.

Getting “Fit 
for the Future”
Last year a three year “Fit for the Future”
plan was launched across the Group to 
help coordinate key targets and outline
areas for improvement and new 
success. Broken down into clear and 
straightforward aims, these were: 
Growth: Improve business financial
performance on the previous year
Safety: Continue to improve our 
safety culture in all business areas 
Communication: Begin monthly 
internal communication TeamTalks 
in all locations to share information,
expertise and support
Excellence: Implement Technical
Excellence (TechX) standards in 
all depots throughout the Group
One year on, and all key targets have 
been met, and an updated plan is about 
to be launched.
                                   
Designed to encourage
improved awareness of
occupational safety and
health for all employees,
the events of the week
were adapted to specific
regional requirements and also aimed to
embrace suppliers and customers. 
Events taking place through the week
included:
• Tyre safety awareness workshops (UK)
• BlueSky product customer demonstration
events (UK and Middle East)
• Director tours of depots and offices to 
gain safety feedback (UK, Germany 
and Middle East)
• Employee health care scheme guidance

Building upon this, the Lavendon Group
announced the creation of BlueSky
Solutions, a new brand which will be the
standard bearer for the introduction of
safety innovations to new territories where
the Group does not have a rental presence.
From its base in the UK, the team behind
BlueSky Solutions will continue development
of new product innovations, as well as
supporting the Group rental businesses in
promoting the use of BlueSky products by
the traditional rental customer community.

Following its acquisition in 2011,
2012 was a year of considerable
success for the BlueSky range of
safety innovations. A number of
major multinational contractors
have mandated the use of these
products on their sites. We have
also received wider industry
acclaim and awards as the products

Customer 
survey 
highlights 
(Group)
We believe it’s essential to
continually listen, learn, and make
improvements for our customers.
Last year we held a Customer Survey
designed to give us the information and
intelligence to continue to deliver and
strive to go beyond providing truly market
leading products and services.
The responses received were very positive
and pleasing, indicating that our businesses
are excelling in a number of key areas:
• Machine availability
• On-time deliveries
• Local service and support
• Product innovations
• Ease of ordering
• Staff friendliness
How are we doing as an employer? 
What the Lavendon Group Employee Survey said about us... Last year we invited 
all of our employees to participate in the Lavendon Group Employee Survey. 
We have received some excellent
feedback from our staff and we have
now outlined our plans to build upon our
successes and make further improvements
where we believe we can do better.
Highlights from these results, include:
• 36% of employees answered
10/10 on how likely they were
to recommend Lavendon Group
companies as employers, with
10 being most likely and one
being least likely
• Our overall response rate 63%
Some of our employees also took the
time and effort to comment further in
support of their responses, examples of
which we have are:
“
All staff at all levels are approachable for information and help.
The company is well recognised and we are always encouraged to
help others and not to be afraid to ask for help.
”
“
The support the company offers its employees
when they want to further themselves is quite
special. The training offered, and encouraged,
is over and above what is required to do 
the job, which I think says a lot about 
the company.
”
“
Being the market leaders gives me 
a feeling that the business has
continued to be strong throughout 
the recession, and therefore I feel

The way we do business
Lavendon in 2012
Planned
Preventative
Maintenance
programme 
To complement the TechX project,
Lavendon has also introduced
and is rolling out a Planned
Preventative Maintenance
(“PPM”) programme. 
The programme is designed to regularly
replace those parts with a finite life, well
before their mean failure date and thus
reduce machine breakdowns from such 
part failures. This reduces not only the
future likelihood of a customer breakdown,
but also over time is expected to help
reduce the Group’s overall machine
maintenance costs.
The programme has been dovetailed into
the existing servicing and pre-dispatch
inspection processes. Over time the entire
fleet will be brought into the programme.
The TechX project set the new standard 
for our depots in a number of key areas
including engineering and equipment
maintenance, environmental management,
procurement, housekeeping and health 
and safety.
Technical Excellence status is a standard
that a depot must achieve following an
audit by the Lavendon’s TechX Team. 
The accreditation process is certainly not
automatic, and to gain accreditation 
a depot must achieve a pass rate of 95%.
TechX International ensures quality
machines, every time. Once attained annual
reviews are conducted to ensure the industry
leading standards have been maintained.
After five years of commitment, by 2012,
all depots right across the Lavendon Group
achieved at least the basic TechX standard.
Many have even gone far beyond. For all
locations, the transformation has been
clear , with Lavendon Group workshops
standing alone in the industry for the 
unparalleled levels of service, health and
safety and cleanliness.
Now, to help the business continue to
improve upon its engineering and technical
standards, new TechX levels are set to 
be launched. Not only will these new
accreditations demand the highest levels 
of organisation, but also the greatest
standards in the consistent performance 
of its engineers, the safe and effective
maintenance and repairing of equipment,
as well as the integration of business
systems, such as the new Lavendon Visual
Information System (L ViS) which has been
designed to aid operational processes.
Once these standards are achieved, three
new levels of improvements are available
to depots:
• TechX Bronze
• TechX Silver
• TechX Gold
By the close of 2012, 42 of our depots had
achieved TechX Silver status and a further
12 depots were accredited with TechX
Bronze status.
What does Technical 
Excellence (TechX) mean 
to Lavendon Group plc? 
All our customer surveys over the last five years have identified 
machine reliability as a key driver of customer satisfaction and 
customer loyalty. In response Lavendon launched the pioneering
Technical Excellence (“TechX”) project in 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                           Lavendon Group plc 2012  17

The review of the Group’s financial
performance is based principally on 
what we term the ‘underlying’ business
performance. This measure excludes
amortisation charges, exceptional items,
movements in the fair value of financial
derivatives and, in 2011, the results from
the Group’s discontinued Spanish
operation. We believe that the use of
underlying figures aids the comparison
with prior periods and the understanding
of the Group’s financial performance.
Underlying trading
performance
A summary of the Group’s financial
performance for 2012, at both constant
currency exchange rates and actual
exchange rates, with a comparison against
2011, is set out in the table below:-
£million 2012 at 2011

Statutory earnings 
per share (pence)           9.80      9.99     9.22
All figures shown in the above table and described as
‘Underlying,’ are figures per the Group financial
statements before amortisation charges, exceptional
items, movements in the fair value of financial derivatives
and discontinued businesses. Statutory earnings per share
represent earnings from continuing operations.
The impact of the year on year movement
in average exchange rates for the Group’s
main trading currencies (principally
sterling, euros and a number of Middle east
currencies), was to reduce revenues,
profits and earnings in 2012 by up to 8% 
as shown in the table above. The figures
discussed in this ‘Financial review of 2012’
are at actual exchange rates for both 2012
and 2011.
Group revenues for the year increased by
4% to £234.6 million (2011: £225.4 million).
The split of these revenues between the
various countries of operation, compared
to 2011, is shown in the adjacent charts
(all figures in £’millions):
The Group’s revenues are principally
derived from the rental of its equipment
fleet, but also include revenues from the
sale of new equipment and from the
disposal of ex-rental fleet units. The split
of revenues between each of these
channels is shown in the table on page 20.
Rental revenue is shown net of discounts
and value added tax, but includes income
generated from the transportation of
equipment, provision of fuel, charging of
damage waiver fees and the sale of spare
parts. The income derived from the rental
of machines is determined by the interplay
of several factors: size of rental fleet, 
mix of machine types within the fleet,
utilisation of the fleet, length of hire and
rental rates achieved. The importance, 
or weighting, of each of these factors can
change by week or by month as the year
progresses, due to normal seasonal
patterns of demand, or to changing
customer workloads.
As the table on page 20 shows, rental
revenues for the year increased by 2% to
£220.7 million (2011: £216.9 million),
while revenues derived from the sale of
new equipment and ex-rental fleet units
increased by 15% and 86% respectively.
The increase in revenues from the sale of
ex-rental fleet units, compared to 2011,
was expected due to the increased level
of investment in the Group’s rental fleet
which has resulted in the replacement 
and subsequent disposal of over 2,000
rental machines in the year. The increased
level of sales of new equipment reflects
the unpredictable nature of this 
revenue stream.
The Group’s costs are largely fixed in
nature within the short to medium term,
with significant movements in the cost
base, outside of acquisitions, mainly being
determined by either depot openings and

Operating and financial review
Financial review of 2012 Working at height
safety success for new
12,000 seater arena
Throughout the last 12 months, major
international contractor Lend Lease has called
upon UK access leader, Nationwide Platforms, 
to help take on the £125 million challenge to
construct Scotland’s largest purpose built arena. 
The Hydro is set for final completion in 2013 and will be a
12,000 seat national home for major entertainment events.
The venue will also be used for the Netball and Gymnastics
events during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
All applicable platforms on the site were fitted with
SkySiren
®
, whilst a series of unique Material Handling
Attachments (MHAs) from the BlueSky range were also
made available to powered access users. 
“With effect from 29 February 2012,
the Group agreed terms to replace
its existing bank facilities with new
debt facilities of £150 million.”
closures, or fleet expansion or contraction.
This feature of our business amplifies the
effect of any small movements in revenue
on the profitability of the Group, as there
is little associated increase or decrease in
our cost base in the short term. This
impact is often referred to as “operational
leverage”. The two main cost areas of the
business are employee costs and
depreciation. During 2012, employee costs,
excluding redundancy costs, increased to
£61.2 million (2011: £59.8 million), but as a
percentage of rental revenues, these costs
remained stable at 27.7% (2011: 27.6%).
Depreciation costs reduced to £40.7 million
in the year (2011: £41.6 million), and as a
percentage of rental revenues depreciation
reduced to 18.4% (2011: 19.2%) due to the
continued reduction in the size of the
Group’s rental fleet and the increased
revenues generated from this fleet.
The Group’s underlying EBITDA for the
year increased to £75.6 million (2011:
£71.7 million), with margins improving to
32.2% from 31.8% in 2011. Underlying
operating profits increased by 17% to
£35.0 million (2011: £30.0 million), with
margins improving to 14.9% from 13.3% in
the prior year. The improvements seen
in both underlying EBITDA and operating
profit margins reflect the combination
of the revenue growth achieved and the
actions taken to increase operational
efficiencies and restructure the Group
across the year.
Net interest charges for the year reduced
to £7.4 million (2011: £8.1 million),
following the reduction in the net debt
levels of the Group across both 2011 and
2012. After interest costs, the Group’s
underlying profit before tax increased by
26% to £27.6 million (2011: £21.9 million).
With an effective tax rate of 23% (2011:
25%), the Group’s underlying profit after
tax was £21.2 million (2011: £16.5 million). 
The Group’s underlying earnings per share
increased by 28% to 12.83 pence per share
(2011: 10.03 pence).

Statutory trading performance
Amortisation charges were £3.8 million 
for the year (2011: £2.3 million), reflecting
the annualisation of the amortisation of 
the intangible assets acquired with the
acquisition of BlueSky Access Limited in
October 2011. 
During the year , the Group incurred
exceptional items of £3.6 million (2011: 
£6.3 million). This charge is the combined
effect of exceptional operating costs of 
£1.5 million, relating principally to
restructuring charges incurred in Germany
during the year , and exceptional finance
expense of £2.1 million relating to the
fees associated with the Group bank
refinancing in February 2012.
The Group also benefited in the year from
a credit on the movement in the fair value
of the Group’s financial derivatives of
£0.7 million (2011: £0.8 million).
After amortisation charges and exceptional
operating costs, the Group produced an
operating profit of £29.7 million (2011: 
£22.9 million). After amortisation charges,
exceptional items and movements in the
fair value of financial derivatives the Group
produced a profit before tax of £20.8
million (2011: £14.2 million) and a profit
after tax of £16.2 million (2011: £15.2
million), earnings per share of 9.80 pence
(2011: 9.22 pence).
Discontinued operation
As previously reported, the Group’s
Spanish business was closed in 2011
and its results for the comparative
period have been reported as a
discontinued operation.

Dividends
The Group is proposing a final dividend 
of 2.00 pence per share, making a total
dividend for the year of 2.75 pence an
increase of 57% over the previous year
(2011: 1.75 pence). The final dividend, 
if approved, will be paid on 30 April 2013
to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business of 8 March 2013.
Cash flow, investment
and acquisitions
A summary of the Group’s cash flows for
the year is shown in the chart on page 22.
During the year , the Group generated
£65.3 million of cash from operations,
after movements in working capital and
payment of exceptional operating costs
but prior to the purchase and sale of
rental assets (2011: £61.3 million). 
A total of £47.9 million was invested in the
maintenance and expansion of the Group’s
fixed asset base (2011: £16.9 million). 
This investment was partly funded by the
sale of surplus and retired assets, which
generated £11.1 million in cash (2011:
£6.2 million). After movements in
amounts owed to equipment suppliers
at the beginning and end of the year of
£7.0 million, the net capital expenditure
for the year was £29.8 million as shown
in the chart above. The amount owed to
equipment suppliers at the end of the
year was £10.4 million. 
During 2012, deferred consideration of
£3.0 million was paid relating to the
acquisition of BlueSky Access Limited
completed in October 2011. A final
payment relating to this acquisition
20  Lavendon Group plc 2012
of £1.0 million will become payable in
October 2013.

from the BlueSky range. 
• a reduction in net debt following
repayments from operational cash flows
in the year.
Although the level of capital expenditure
increased significantly during the year , the
Group’s strong cash flows were sufficient to
fund this investment and also facilitate,
when combined with a small favourable
foreign exchange movement of £1.8
million, a further modest reduction of £9.3
million in net debt levels to £97.3 million
by the year end (2011: £106.6 million).
Adjusting for the un-amortised costs of
£0.8 million relating to the Group’s US
Private Placement in February 2012, the
Group’s reported net debt position at 
31 December 2012 was £96.5 million. 
The corresponding net debt to underlying
EBITDA ratio is 1.28 times, a further
reduction from the previous year’s level 
of 1.49 times, and net debt to equity ratio
is a comfortable 49% (2011: 58%). This
reduced level of debt is well supported 
by operational cash flows. 
The Group has exposure to movements 
in interest rates on its borrowings. 
This exposure is managed by maintaining 
a mix of fixed and floating interest rate
borrowings. This allows the Group to
mitigate the impact of interest rate
fluctuations by allowing some benefit from
rate reductions, whilst offering some
protection against rate rises. At the year
end, the fixed rate element of borrowings
was 56%, a reduced level when compared
with the previous year end fixed rate
element of 65%. This reduction reflects the
decline in the Group’s use of hire purchase
facilities to fund the acquisition of assets,
and the desire to move towards a more even
split between fixed and variable interest
rate borrowings. Based on the year end mix
and quantum of borrowings, a movement in
Euro interest base rates of 0.25% would
increase or decrease the Group’s annual
interest cost by approximately £68,000,
whilst a similar movement in Sterling base
rates would also increase or decrease
annual costs by £68,000.
In February 2012, the Group agreed terms
to replace its existing bank facilities with
                                                                                                                                                                                          Lavendon Group plc 2012  21

increase in full 
year dividend over 
the previous year new debt facilities of £150 million,
comprising a £100 million revolving bank
facility expiring in July 2016 and a €60
million US private placement expiring in
July 2019. The bank facility has an interest
rate margin of between 225 basis points
and 325 basis points above LIBOR or
EURIBOR depending on the currency drawn,
and the US private placement has a fixed
coupon of 4.89%. These facilities provide
the Group with a robust medium to long
term diversified financing package, with
significant liquidity, which will support the
development of the Group in the coming
years. The costs associated with the
completion of the bank refinancing, of 
£2.2 million, have been written off as an
exceptional item in 2012, whilst the costs
associated with the US Private Placement,
of £0.9 million are being amortised over
the term of that facility.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s return on capital employed
(ROCE) increased for the year to 10.7%, a
marked improvement on the 9.0% achieved
in 2011, driven by increased operating
profits and a further reduction in the
average capital employed during the year.
Further improvement in this key metric
remains the fundamental objective of the
Group for the coming years.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the
directors have formed a judgement, at the
time of approving the accounts, that the
Group can have a reasonable expectation
that adequate resources will be available
for it to continue its operations for the
foreseeable future, and consequently it is
appropriate to adopt the going concern
principle in the preparation of the financial
statements. In forming this judgement, the
directors have reviewed the Group’s budget
for 2013 and the forecast for 2014 (including
downside sensitivity scenarios), cash flow
forecasts, contingency planning, the
sufficiency of banking facilities and forecast
compliance with banking covenants. 
Risks
The Group has a structured process to
identify and prepare mitigation strategies
for business risks. A formal risk register is
reviewed annually by the Group Executive
Committee and the Group’s internal
auditors. The register details the risks
identified, the allocation of executive
accountabilities and current and planned
future mitigation strategies. The Group
Executive Committee and the Audit
Committee have approved the risk register.
There are risks and uncertainties inherent
in our business that may affect future
performance. Some of these factors have
already been discussed, but others are
listed below and are amongst those that we
think could cause the Group’s actual results
to differ materially from those expected or
those produced historically:

Competition
The powered access industry is highly
competitive and highly fragmented.
Numerous competitors, ranging from
national operators to smaller multi-regional
or independent companies, serve many of
the markets in which the Group operates.
The Group is generally able to compete on
the basis of quality and breadth of service,
expertise, reliability, and the price, size,
mix and relative attractiveness of its
powered access fleet. During the year ,
the Group has pro-actively sought to
strengthen its market positions, by
developing consultative capabilities which
seek to differentiate our offering to
customers, to mitigate the impact of
increased competition should it occur.
Reduction in demand by customers
A large portion of the Group’s customer
base consists of customers from the
commercial construction and industrial
sectors. A downturn in commercial
construction or industrial activity, or a
decline in the desirability of powered
access equipment, may decrease the
demand for powered access equipment,
or depress the hire rates that the Group
can charge for its units.
The key factors which may cause a
temporary or long-term downturn in the
commercial construction and industrial
sectors are as follows:
• a slow-down in the economies within
which the Group operates; and/or
• a significant increase in interest rates 
or other factors affecting end customer
demand/investment; and/or
• a restriction on the availability of
finance to fund construction projects;
and/or
• over-capacity in the businesses that
drive the demand for commercial
construction or industrial equipment.
Whilst a downturn in the commercial
construction and industrial sectors could
have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business, we are actively managing
our exposure to these sectors and are

Safety solutions at 
the core of Qatari
gas project 
The new construction of a world leading gas-to-
liquid plant in Qatar has been taking shape
throughout 2012 supported by Lavendon’s
Middle East brand, Rapid. 
The £12bn project has stringent health and safety
requirements and also imposes the challenge of a
remote construction location upon contractors.
Rapid have provided powered access solutions to enable
safe and cost-effective work at height on the project 
which is predicted to take three years to complete. 
The Middle East powered access leader has also 
provided accredited training and unique innovations 
from the BlueSky range to further enhance safety and 
aid productivity.

focusing our efforts on widening the
Group’s customer base into other less
cyclical areas. In addition, the Group’s
geographic spread of profits and cash flows
reduce the impact that country specific
economic fluctuations would have on the
Group’s overall performance.
Seasonality
The Group is subject to changes in demand
patterns during the year caused by
seasonal factors. Construction activity
tends to increase in the summer months
and during periods of prolonged mild
weather , whilst decreasing during the
winter months and extended periods of
adverse weather. In addition, due to the
timing of public holidays in Europe, there
are more invoicing days in the second half
of the year. Furthermore, the Group’s
trading is weighted towards the months of
September , October , November and early
December as the Group’s customers seek to
complete work ahead of the year end and
onset of winter. Should the Group
experience a prolonged period of adverse
weather , it could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business.
Retention of senior management
and employees
The Group depends on its senior
management team and a stable
experienced workforce. Although it is not
anticipated that members of the
management team will be lost or replaced,
or that employee turnover will increase
sharply, the disruption caused by either of
these events happening could adversely
affect the Group’s business until suitable
replacements are found. The Group
regularly reviews remuneration packages
and aims to offer competitive salaries and
attractive short- and long-term incentive
schemes, including the use of share
incentive plans where appropriate.
Access to capital
The Group requires capital for, amongst
other things, purchasing powered access
machines to replace existing machines
that have reached the end of their useful
life and for growth through increasing the
scale of the existing rental fleet, by
31%
increase in revenues 
generated by the 
Group’s operations 
in the Middle East establishing new depots and operations, or
completing acquisitions. If the cash that
the Group generates from its business,
together with cash that it may borrow or
has borrowed under its credit facilities, is
not sufficient in the long term to fund its
capital requirements, additional debt
and/or equity financing will be required.
If such additional financing were not
available to fund the Group’s capital
requirements, revenue and cash flow
could decrease, potentially having a
material adverse effect on the Group.
The Group aims to ensure that it has the
necessary equity base and sufficient
banking and other credit facilities
available to support its development
plans. We believe that the combination 
of the Group’s equity base and the strong
cash flows generated by the business,
together with the credit lines available
from banks and other institutions, will
provide adequate funding for our
foreseeable needs.
Currency and interest rate fluctuations
Although the Company is a UK company
that reports in pounds sterling, in 2012 the
Group derived approximately 35% and 16%
of its revenue in Euros and Middle Eastern
currencies, respectively. A significant
amount of its assets, liabilities and costs
are also denominated in Euros and Middle
Eastern currencies. These overseas results
are translated at the applicable exchange
rate, which fluctuates from time to time.
Fluctuations in the value of the Euro or
Middle Eastern currencies in relation to 
the pound sterling may have a significant
impact on the Company’s financial
condition and results of operations as
reported in pounds sterling. 
Currency fluctuations can also have a
significant impact on the Group balance
sheet, particularly total shareholders’
funds, when the financial statements of
the non-UK subsidiaries are translated into
pounds sterling. The translation of the
assets and liabilities of the Group’s non-UK
businesses at the relevant balance sheet
date results in the recognition of foreign
24  Lavendon Group plc 2012
exchange translation gains or losses. 
The Group balance sheet is affected by
movements in the sterling value of its net
investments in its non-UK businesses and the
sterling value of its consolidated net debt. 
The Group is also exposed to interest rate
risk on its floating rate debt. Fluctuations
in interest rates may affect the interest
expense on existing debt and the cost of
new financings. The Group utilises interest
rate swap agreements and fixed interest
rate debt agreements to manage and
mitigate its exposure to changes in the
interest rates. 
Legal proceedings
The nature of the Group’s business exposes
it to claims for personal injury or property
damage resulting from the use of the
powered access equipment that the Group
rents or sells. The Group carries insurance
covering a wide range of potential claims.
The Board believes that the level of
insurance is sufficient to cover existing
and future claims.
Changes in tax legislation
or interpretation
The Group is exposed to the risk presented
by changes in tax legislation and the
interpretation and enforcement of such
legislation. The Group’s activities are
subject to tax at various rates, computed
in accordance with relevant legislation
and practice. Action by governments to
increase tax rates or to impose additional
taxes could reduce the profitability of
the Group.
Political, legal and
regulatory developments
The Group is subject to various legal and
regulatory regimes. Future global political,
legal or regulatory developments
concerning the activities carried out by the
Group and the arena in which the business
operates may affect the Group’s ability to
operate and operate profitably in the
affected jurisdictions. Should the Group’s
businesses fail to comply with applicable
legal and regulatory requirements, or
become unable to operate due to a
deteriorating political climate, this may

result in a financial loss or restriction on
the Group’s ability to operate its business.
Environment and safety laws
and regulations
The Group’s operations, like those of
other companies engaged in similar
business, require the handling, use,
storage and disposal of certain regulated
materials. As a result, the Group is
subject to the requirements of UK and
European environmental and occupational
health and safety laws and regulations.
These regulate such matters as waste
water, storm water, solid and hazardous
wastes and materials and air quality.
Under such laws and regulations, the
Group may be liable for, amongst other
things, the cost of investigating and
remediating contamination (regardless 
of fault) and for fines and penalties for
non-compliance. The Group’s operations
generally do not raise significant
environmental risks, but the Group does
use hazardous materials to clean and
maintain equipment, dispose of solid and
hazardous waste and waste water from
equipment washing, and store and
dispense petroleum products from storage
tanks located at some of its locations.
The Group has rigorous procedures to
manage the disposal of these materials.
The Group also operates in an industry
where safety is a key consideration for
both the well being of our employees 
and customers that hire our equipment.
Failure to comply with regulatory
requirements or to meet customer
expectations with regard to the provision
of safe equipment could result in
litigation, financial penalties and damage
to the reputation of the Group.
As far as the Board is currently aware,
there are no pending or likely litigation,
remediation or compliance costs relating
to either environmental or safety issues
that will have a material adverse effect
on the Group. However, it is not possible
to be certain as to the potential financial
impact on the Group if adverse
environmental conditions or safety
concerns are discovered or environmental
51%

or safety requirements become more
stringent. If the Group were required to
incur material environmental compliance
or remediation costs that are not
currently anticipated, the Group’s results
would be adversely affected.
Business IT system availability
An interruption to the availability of the
Group’s IT systems could have a material
impact on the Group’s communication,
ability to service customer needs,
maintenance of adequate records and
overall financial performance. 
In order to mitigate this risk, the Group is
engaged in a continuous improvement
programme to upgrade and harmonise its
operational, business and accounting
processes across all territories. The Group
employs system and software programming
professionals to maintain the Group’s IT
infrastructure and develop systems to meet
the business requirements. In addition the
group has a fully formed and tested
disaster recovery programme in place to
protect against major systems failure.

32   Sustainability policy 28  Lavendon Group plc 2012
In our 2010 Annual Report we set out our
vision for Corporate Responsibility. 
We believe we have always operated in 
a responsible and sustainable manner but 
we have recognised the need for a more
focussed and directed Corporate
Responsibility agenda as a part of our
unique offering to our customers and to
further engage our employees. In our
previous annual report we identified the
four key principles that our company
operates by:
• Performance: valuing and rewarding 
the attainment of business goals.
• Integrity: being reliable, ethical, honest
and straightforward in our relationships
with customers, staff, shareholders 
and suppliers.
• Process-orientation: encouraging 
a culture where business challenges are
resolved constructively and permanently
and “fire-fighting” is avoided.
• Initiative: encouraging staff to take
ownership of business opportunities 
and to proactively collaborate in their
personal development.
These principles are reflected in a set 
of management values, which have 
been adopted by the Board and senior
management of the business as the guide
to how we endeavour to run our business:
• We provide a safe working environment.
• We aspire to be a motivated, 
professional team.
• We treat everyone with respect.
• We invest time and resources to develop
each employee to their full potential.
• We behave like responsible co-owners 
of the business.
• We care about customers and 
colleagues alike.
• We are easy to do business with.
• We deliver on our promises, both
operational and financial.
These key principles have served us
well and will continue to form the
foundations of our vision for Lavendon
Group’s Corporate Responsibility
going forward.
Environment
In our 2010 Annual Report we introduced
our six Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
for the Environment. We set targets that
would not only challenge our employees
but would tackle environmental issues that
will be relevant to us, and the wider
industry, for the foreseeable future.
This focus area requires greater
engagement from our employees, involving
a change to their habits and a greater
involvement in the management process.
To help achieve the targets, we provide
clear and justified reasoning to aid
understanding as well as encouragement
and leadership from all areas of the
business. The successes we have seen in
achieving our targets to date demonstrates
how intrinsic our Corporate Responsibility
programme has become and how well our
employees have accepted the challenge.
In 2010 we set an ambitious target to
achieve a 10% reduction in utility use 
by 2012. Our consumption figures for all 
three utility services (gas, electricity and
water) have seen a 13% reduction since
2010, a considerable achievement. Aside
from the financial benefits in the reduction
of utility use, significant reductions have
been made in the environmental impact of
our operations. The use of electricity and 
gas has a well understood CO
2
impact and
the reduction in our use of these utilities
delivers immediate savings in CO
2
emissions. In 2012 water use became 
a national focal point, record periods of
drought were recorded, bringing with it a
sharper focus on the issues of the global
water imbalance. In 2010 we recognised the
importance of water usage forming part of
our wider environment targets and included
this within our strategy. The figures for 2012
demonstrate the benefits of our dedication.
As a business we pride ourselves on the
service provided to our customers. It is this
service that maintains our market leading
position and our value as a business. A part
of this service is our dedication to providing
high quality equipment supported by ‘best
in class’ maintenance programmes. In 2011 
we started our Planned Preventative
Maintenance (PPM) scheme which, together
with our TechX programme, promotes
efficient maintenance of machines. 
These two schemes have both improved
the quality of service to our customers 
and have also brought us reductions in
breakdowns and requirements to scrap
machines. These reductions have a direct
impact on the amount of waste produced
by our operations as well as the CO
2
emissions associated with attending
breakdowns or disposing of scrap machines.
As our PPM scheme becomes further
embedded in to our business and the
benefits of our work filters through our
fleet, we will expect to see further
reductions in CO
2
emissions beyond 2012.

The UK Volunteering Policy was introduced
during the inaugural Sustainability Week
held in June 2012. The policy encourages
our employees to take part in community
volunteering and charity events by allowing
two days a year , in addition to the
employee holiday entitlement, to dedicate
to a charitable cause. Community
volunteering has been identified as an
excellent way to engage our employees in
our corporate responsibility aims, as well
as developing new skill sets, stronger
teams and greater community participation
for our employees. 
The Lavendon Group Cycle Challenge
involved all of our European companies 
in one combined effort to raise money for
charity. A team of sixteen employees, made
up of four employees from each of our
European companies, Nationwide Platforms
(UK), Gardemann (Germany), Lavendon
(France) and dk Rental (Belgium), took 
on the challenge to cycle between Alpen 
in Germany to Lutterworth in the UK. 
The route took in various depots from 
each country and covered a combined total
distance of 790km. In all, forty employees
were involved in the completion of the
challenge helping to raise over £25,000 
for charity. The total funds raised were
shared between four nominated charities
which were chosen by the employees 
from each company. This truly
collaborative event underlines the
dedication that Lavendon Group has 
to its Corporate Responsibility vision 
and demonstrates the engagement
in this vision from its employees.
A Cycle2Work initiative was also
introduced to the business, as well 
as a volunteering policy which 
encouraged employees to donate their
time to good causes in business time.

Community
The UK Volunteering Policy was introduced during the inaugural
Sustainability Week held in June 2012.
In June 2012 the inaugural Sustainability
Week was held in the UK. Each day of
the week was dedicated to a different
theme, from Environment, Community,
Marketplace and Workplace culminating in
a ‘Give and Gain Day’. The week focussed
on employee engagement and saw the
launch of various initiatives within the
company to drive the delivery of our
Corporate Responsibility targets. 
The week was a great success with some 
of the key outcomes being the nomination
of Cancer Research UK as the dedicated
charity of year , employee engagement 
in local fund raising, a volunteering
placement at a college local to the
Lavendon Group head office in
Leicestershire and the re-launch and 
focus on the ‘Big Switch Off’ first

Lavendon Group is focussed on delivering
excellence to its customers, through
innovation and service. Our internal
programmes such as TechX, the Lavendon
Academy and Planned Preventative
Maintenance all go towards improving the
experience of the customer when dealing
with our Group.
Our BlueSky range of products offers a
range of solutions to our customers that 
can help to reduce unsafe practises and
improve efficiency. The products are
designed to support the health and safety,
budgetary and corporate responsibility
targets of our customers. Lavendon Group
offer a range of different products, such 
as SkyRack, which is designed to carry pipe
work safely to height, SkySiren
®
, which 
has been designed specifically to prevent
crushing hazards in a boom lift, and
SkySentry, which prevents unauthorised
use and ‘intelligent machine management’.
We recognise that the vast majority of our
customers experience the same pressures
and expectations in their work, and as
market leader we strive to provide solutions
that improve both safety and efficiency.
SkySiren was developed in response to 
a need from our customers to prevent the
issue of entrapment within boom type
platforms. The uptake of SkySiren by 
170 of our customers within two years
demonstrates how important this device 
is in supporting their health and safety
obligations. In 2012 we introduced
SkySentry which is designed to remotely
secure machines from unauthorised use
and at the same time monitor and display
information on machine use. For the first
time, this product enables a customer to
have full control over their rented
equipment, helping us to support many of
our customers own Corporate Responsibility
objectives. This product enables customers
to realise benefits in health and safety, 
cost efficiency, emissions reduction and
a reduction in community disruption.
Workplace
Our employees are the key to driving the
success of our Corporate Responsibility
agenda. The workplace is where we
engage our employees on our Corporate
Responsibility aims and it is only through
them that we will develop a sustained
approach to Corporate Responsibility.
The development and progression of our
employees is vital to us in order to retain
talent, develop the skills of our staff and
constantly improve on the service we offer
to our customers. Lavendon Group is keen
to promote staff from within it ranks, and 
is developing a pool of talent through its
training programmes. 
Lavendon Group will also continue to support
the training of apprentices, especially in
engineering trades. We understand that as
well as developing talent from within, the
benefit of an apprenticeship scheme is that 
it allows us to train our workforce not just
the necessary skills but also in the culture 
of our company. Specific focus is made on
the engineering job family as we recognise
that this trade is becoming increasingly
under-subscribed. By working to introduce
engineers at an apprenticeship level 
we are insuring ourselves against an ever
decreasing pool of talent. Our apprentices
come from all areas of our operation, 
some of which are communities listed in the
English Indices of Deprivation for education
and employment. Promoting and developing
our apprenticeship scheme tackles 
these issues head on.
In 2012 we continued to develop and roll
out our TechX programme, with all new
premises going through the accreditation
process. Designed to improve efficiencies
in work, health and safety and general
housekeeping TechX not only supports our
commitment to health and safety and the
highest levels of quality for our customers,
but it supports our aim of improving the
environment. The TechX programme aids
the reduction and efficient streaming of
waste and it promotes the efficient
maintenance of machines, which together
with Planned Preventative Maintenance,
reduces the emissions and waste associated
with attending machine breakdowns.
Summary
Lavendon Group has demonstrated its
increasing dedication to Corporate
Responsibility and this is evident through
the successes delivered against the KPIs 
for 2012. Particular success can be seen in
employee engagement, which has resulted
in utility use reductions and ENPS scores.
In 2012 we introduced our Corporate
Responsibility agenda to the Group outside
of the UK, and the successful conclusion 
of the Lavendon Group Cycle Challenge
demonstrates that there is total support 
for our vision around the Group.
In 2013, we will focus more on pushing the
KPIs within each operating country to make
further progress towards our Corporate
Responsibility targets.
Our Corporate Responsibility agenda within
the Group will move towards a more global
focus over time as we have demonstrated
that not only can our operations deliver
savings and achieve greater engagement
with our workforce, but the systems and
processes that are put in place are
promoting best practise and are delivering
a better service to our customers. It is
this realisation that is of paramount
importance in sustaining our Corporate
Responsibility and this is the message
that will make the programme successful
across the Group.

Introduction
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and is in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under
the Companies Act 2006 as well as the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. The report describes
how the principles relating to directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) have been applied during the
year. A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company on 18 April 2013.
Auditable information
The Remuneration Report has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as required by Schedule 8 to the Companies Act 2006.
Under Part 3 of the schedule, the following sections of the Remuneration Report are subject to audit: remuneration during 2012,
pension contributions, long term equity incentives and Directors’ interests. The remaining sections of the Remuneration report
are unaudited.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) comprises the two non-executive directors of the Company, Jan Åstrand (Chairman 
of the Committee) and Andrew Wood together with the Group’s Chairman John Standen. All members of the Committee are considered 
to be independent by the Company. The terms of reference for the Committee are available from the Lavendon Group website
(www.lavendongroup.com). The Committee’s principal duties are summarised below:
• make recommendations to the Board on the framework and policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chairman, 
executive directors and other senior management members as shall be determined;
• review the remuneration policy on a regular basis to ensure it remains appropriate and that members of executive management 
are rewarded fairly and provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance; and
• review and approve the design, determine the targets and level of annual awards for any performance related bonus schemes 
and long-term incentive schemes.
During the year , the Committee were advised by Aon Hewitt, a firm of independent executive remuneration consultants, on its current
remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the Company’s executive directors (Aon Hewitt did not provide any other services
to the Company or Group in the year). The Committee met on six occasions during the year where the following matters were reviewed:
• whether any bonus was payable to executive directors under the annual bonus scheme for 2011;
• the design of the annual bonus scheme, including targets, for executive directors for 2012;
• whether any awards made under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme in earlier years were to vest;
• the level of awards to be made under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme for 2012, together with the 
performance measures and targets that were to apply to these awards;
• the appropriateness of the Company’s remuneration policy and the remuneration arrangements for the executive 
directors and senior management members;
• the implementation of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, following shareholder approval at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2012;
• the introduction of clawback provisions to be applied to awards under the annual bonus scheme, 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan; and
• approval of the Remuneration Report for 2011.
Details of attendance at Remuneration Committee meetings are given in the Corporate Governance Report on page 51.
Directors’ remuneration policy
The remuneration of the Company’s executive directors comprise a base salary, an annual performance bonus, participation in a long
term incentive plan with returns based on group performance, together with a defined contribution towards pension arrangements and
other benefits, as detailed in this report. 
In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors of the Group, and advising, where appropriate, on the remuneration
policies relating to the Group’s senior management below Board level, the Committee aims to ensure that:
• executives are appropriately rewarded for their contributions to the Group, and account is taken of their individual 
responsibility and performance;
• remuneration packages reflect current market conditions in order to attract, retain and motivate executives of a high quality;
34 Lavendon Group plc 2012 • rewards are linked to the Group’s performance so that the interests of the executives are aligned with those of the 
Company’s shareholders;
• executive shareholding is encouraged to ensure a longer term focus; and
• the Company complies with the Code.
The Committee believes that there should be an appropriate balance in the executive directors’ remuneration packages between fixed
and variable (performance related) pay, that encourages the long-term success of the Company. The chart below illustrates the expected
mix between fixed remuneration (base salary, benefits and pension) and variable remuneration (bonuses and long-term incentives), for
target performance (target payout) and out-performance (maximum payout):
The Committee introduced clawback provisions during 2012 for performance related awards (the annual bonus scheme, Deferred Share
Bonus Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan). This reflects best practice guidelines as set out in the Code and enables the Committee to
'clawback' awards in prescribed circumstances.
The individual components of the remuneration package for executive directors are summarised below:

Base salary
The Committee reviews salaries of executive directors annually, with changes taking effect on 1 January of each year. In determining
salary increases the Committee takes into account individual performance, market data and the policy being adopted by the Company for
pay reviews elsewhere in the Company or Group. Salaries are benchmarked against comparable roles in companies of a similar size and in
companies within the industry sector. 
Benefits in kind 
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally company cars, private medical insurance and disability cover.
Directors’ pension entitlement
The Company does not offer a defined benefit pension scheme, instead it makes contributions to individual pension arrangements of 25%
of base salary. Where contributions to individual pension arrangements would exceed £50,000 per year , executive directors are offered
‘cash in lieu’, as an alternative for the amount above £50,000. 
Annual bonus & deferred share bonus plan
The Committee establishes the criteria that must be met in each financial year if a bonus is to become payable to the executive directors.
The maximum bonus potential is 150% of salary (maximum payout), with 45% of salary (target payout) being payable for on-target
performance. The targets are a combination of financial performance and corporate/personal objectives, with up to 125% of salary payable
for achievement of financial performance targets and up to 25% of salary payable for achievement of corporate/personal objectives.
The financial performance targets have to be achieved before any bonus relating to corporate or personal objectives become payable. 
Under the terms of the bonus scheme, where any bonus payable exceeds £30,000, 30% of the total bonus will be deferred into shares 
of the Company for a period of one year , as required under the terms of the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan. In addition, at the
discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the executive directors may voluntarily invest part or all of their remaining after tax cash
bonus in shares and receive a potential matching award subject to performance over a three year period (up to a 1:1 match on the gross
bonus invested). The performance conditions for any potential matching awards will be finalised each year once bonus payments are
confirmed and if notification is received that a director wishes to voluntarily invest part, or all, of his remaining cash bonus. Performance
conditions will be based on earnings per share and return on capital employed reflecting the strategic priorities of the business to grow
earnings and improve returns on the Company’s invested capital 
Long term incentive plan
The Committee has responsibility to supervise the Company’s long-term equity incentive schemes, determining the level of annual awards
and their associated performance conditions. The executive directors currently have outstanding awards under the 2006 Long Term
Incentive Plan. The Share Option Scheme, previously in place, is now closed and no further awards will be made under that plan. 
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the Company is able to make annual awards up to 150% of base salary each year. The performance
period for each annual award is three years with no retesting available. The performance measure relating to the outstanding awards
granted as at 31 December 2012 is ‘Total Shareholder Return’ relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts. 
The awards granted under this Plan to the executive directors are detailed in the ‘Remuneration during 2012’ section of the Directors'
Remuneration Report.
Directors’ service contracts
In keeping with recommended practices under the Code, the Group’s policy on executive directors’ service contracts is that no notice
period of employment should exceed twelve months duration and that contractual termination payments must not exceed the notice
period in the directors’ service contracts at the time of termination. The service contracts of both Don Kenny and Alan Merrell contain
provisions relating to their duty to mitigate their loss in the event of termination.
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company and the Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of
appointment, which in the case of the non-executive directors, are for a period of three years. Details of the service contracts and letters
of appointment are given below:

* Don Kenny was appointed on 1 October 2011.
** Kevin Appleton left employment with effect from 30 June 2011, and, under the terms of his contact, he was entitled to receive a termination payment, after mitigation, of
£312,000. In addition to Kevin Appleton’s termination payment , the Committee determined that awards over 136,500 shares in the Company, previously granted under the
Company’s 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2010, would vest on the date of cessation of his employment. These awards were exercised on 9 August 2011 and had a value, on
exercise, of £136,500. 
*** Tim Ross retired from the Board on 20 April 2011.
**** John Standen and Jan Åstrand received additional fees of £145,000 and £99,000 respectively in 2011, due to their expanded interim responsibilities as Executive Chairman and
Chief Executive Europe while the search for the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer was being undertaken. Andrew Wood received additional fees of £8,125 in 2011 due to the
increase in his responsibilities for the period that John Standen and Jan Åstrand assumed interim executive roles in the management of the Group. The fees of Jan Åstrand and
Andrew Wood also included a supplementary payment of £8,125 in 2011 to their base fees as non-executive directors for the year , relating to the time commitment required at the
start of their terms of appointment to become fully briefed on the Group’s operations and markets. 
Amounts shown as base salary and fees relate to base salary in the case of executive directors and fees in the case of the Chairman and
the non-executive directors. The Board has determined the fees payable for the Chairman and the non-executive directors with reference
to current market conditions and after consultation with external advisors. Base salaries for Don Kenny and Alan Merrell throughout 2012
were £315,000 and £230,000 respectively. These base salaries were reviewed in January 2013, where Don Kenny’s and Alan Merrell’s
salaries for 2013 were set at £324,450 & £237,000 respectively.
Pension contributions
In 2012, the total of contributions made towards individual pension arrangements for Don Kenny and Alan Merrell was £78,750 and £57,500
respectively. Of Don Kenny’s total contribution, £50,000 was paid into his pension fund and a taxable ‘cash in lieu’ payment of £28,750 was
made. Of Alan Merrell’s total contribution, £50,000 was paid into his pension fund and a taxable ‘cash in lieu’ payment of £7,500 was made.
Annual bonus payments
For 2012, the Group’s financial performance had to deliver an operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items of £34.7 million
and a return on capital employed of 10.4% before any bonus payments would start to accrue. The maximum bonus potential would be
earned if operating profits before amortisation and exceptional items for the year were £51.0 million and the Group’s return on capital
employed reached 15.8%. The Group’s financial performance for the year passed through the minimum threshold, and a provisional bonus
accrual of 35% of base salary has been made for Don Kenny and Alan Merrell which is subject to the Committee’s review of performance
against the corporate/personal objectives set for the year.
As required under the terms of the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan, should bonuses be awarded, and if they are in excess
of £30,000, then 30% of the total bonuses will be deferred into shares of the Company for a period of one year.

Notes:
(ii) The awards were subject to performance conditions. The vesting of 50% of the awards was based on the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance and the vesting of the other half was based 
on the Company’s ‘EPS’ performance. EPS was measured by reference to the fully diluted EPS as disclosed in the audited annual financial statements adjusted to exclude unusual 
or non-recurring items at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The vesting of the TSR-related half of the awards required the Company’s TSR performance over a single
three-year period to be at least £2.00 for 7.5% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% of the awards vesting if the share price was at least £4.00. 
The EPS-related element required the Company’s EPS in 2011 to be at least equal to 33.10p for 7.5% of the awards to vest and greater than or equal to 48.92p for 50% of the 
awards to vest. The performance conditions of these awards were not met during the performance period, and the awards lapsed on 23 April 2012.
(iii) The awards are subject to a performance condition. The vesting of 100% of the awards will be based on the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance relative to the performance of the 
FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts (the “Index”). The vesting of the awards will require the Company’s TSR performance over a single three-year period to be 
at least equal to the performance of the Index for 15% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if the TSR performance is 60% 
or more above the performance of the index.

The chart below shows the Company’s performance, measured by ‘Total Shareholder Return’ (TSR), compared to the FTSE Small Cap
Index excluding Investment Trusts (the ’Index’) for the five years ended 31 December 2012. The Company considers the Index to be the
most meaningful comparison of historic share price performance in assessing the Company against an index of similarly sized businesses.
Total shareholder return reflects the theoretical growth in
value of a shareholding over the period assuming that gross
dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at
the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date.

Employees
The Group pursues a policy of employee communication through regular team briefings and newsletters. Personal employee development
is encouraged through the provision of relevant training towards industry accredited certification and licences. Employee involvement 
in the financial performance of the Group is encouraged through a comprehensive range of well-established profit share programmes. 
The Group consults with employees on a regular basis so their views can be taken into account in making decisions that might effect 
their interests.
It is the policy of the Group that disabled people, whether registered or not, should receive full and fair consideration for all job
vacancies for which they are suitable applicants. Employees who become disabled during employment will be retained wherever possible
and retrained if necessary. The Group is prepared to modify procedures or equipment wherever this is practicable, to allow full use to be
made of an individual’s abilities.
The Board has issued a statement of business operations and culture detailing the Group’s commitment to ensuring that all employees
comply with all applicable laws and regulations, support a culture of honesty and integrity, conduct operations in an ethical and
professional manner , and act at all times to prevent impropriety, discrimination, bribery and corruption. The Board also operates 
an independent whistle-blowing system to allow employees to raise matters that they feel should be addressed by the Group.

Issue of share capital
By resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting on 19 April 2012 the directors were generally and unconditionally authorised for the
purposes of Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares and grant rights
to subscribe for , or convert any security into, shares:
(a) up to an aggregate nominal amount (within the meaning of Section 551(3) and (6) of the Act) of £549,708 (such amount to be reduced
by the nominal amount allotted or granted under (b) below in excess of such sum); and

with or pursuant to an offer by way of a rights issue in favour of holders of ordinary shares in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to
the respective number of ordinary shares held by them on the record date for such allotment (and holders of any other class of equity
securities entitled to participate therein or if the directors consider it necessary, as permitted by the rights of those securities), but
subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may consider necessary or appropriate to deal with fractional
entitlements, treasury shares, record dates or legal, regulatory or practical difficulties which may arise under the laws of, or the
requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory or any other matter whatsoever.
These authorisations expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 18 April 2013, and

resolution; and
(b) sell ordinary shares (as defined in Section 560(1) of the Act) held by the Company as treasury shares for cash, as if Section 561 of the
Act did not apply to any such allotment or sale, provided that this power shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities for cash
and the sale of treasury shares:
i. in connection with or pursuant to an offer of or invitation to acquire equity securities (but in the case of the authorisation granted
under (b) above, by way of a rights issue only) in favour of holders of ordinary shares in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to 
the respective number of ordinary shares held by them on the record date for such allotment or sale (and holders of any other 
class of equity securities entitled to participate therein or if the directors consider it necessary, as permitted by the rights of those
securities) but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may consider necessary or appropriate to deal
with fractional entitlements, treasury shares, record dates or legal, regulatory or practical difficulties which may arise under 
the laws of or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory or any other matter whatsoever; and
ii. in the case of the authorisation granted under (a) above (or in the case of any transfer of treasury shares), and otherwise than

Share option schemes
The Company established two share option schemes on admission of its ordinary shares to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange
on 10 October 1996, namely:
i. the Lavendon Group 1996 Company Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Scheme’); and
ii. the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘Executive Scheme’).
Options were granted under the terms of the schemes on the day following the announcement of the Group’s interim and annual financial
results each year at an option price equal to the mid-market quoted share price derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official
List at the close of trading on the preceding day. The schemes were closed on reaching their tenth anniversary on 10 October 2006,
and no further share options have been issued under these schemes.
The value of options granted to any individual was subject to an individual limit such that the aggregate exercise price of all options
granted during a year could not exceed 200 per cent of base annual salary in the case of a director , or 100 per cent in the case of any
other employee.
Options were granted subject to the following performance targets:
The Employee Scheme
An option would be exercisable in full if growth in pre-exceptional earnings per share (“EPS”) exceeded growth in the Retail Price Index
(“RPI”) over the performance period by an average of at least 3 per cent per annum.
The Executive Scheme
An option would not be exercisable unless growth in pre-exceptional EPS exceeded growth in the RPI over the performance period by an
average of at least 3 per cent per annum. The option would be exercisable in full if growth in EPS exceeded growth in the RPI by an
average of at least 6 per cent per annum. The option would be exercisable on a straight line basis between these two percentage levels.
All performance targets were measured over an initial three year period and to the extent that they were not met, they could be retested.
In the case of an option granted in the period to 31 August 2003, the target may be achieved on a three-year rolling basis up to the tenth
anniversary of grant in the case of the Employee Scheme, and the seventh anniversary in the case of the Executive Scheme. Any options
granted after this date are capable of being retested annually over 0-4 years and 0-5 years, provided that the target is always measured
from the fixed base of the financial year immediately prior to grant. The option will lapse to the extent that the target has not been
achieved by the end of the fifth year. There is a two year period over which options can be exercised. The options remain exercisable
until the seventh anniversary of their date of grant.
Details of options granted to executive directors are disclosed separately in the Remuneration report on pages 34 to 39.
Details of all other share options granted under the terms of the schemes, that still have options exercisable at 31 December 2012,
are shown below:

42 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Share incentive plan
During 2007 the Company established a Share Incentive Plan (‘the SIP’).
The SIP is a UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) approved plan under which the Company can provide share benefits in a tax advantaged
way to all its UK employees on the same terms. Details of the shares issued under the SIP are detailed in note 27.
The SIP allows the Company to either give “free shares” to employees or provide a facility for employees to purchase shares from their
pre-tax salary. Shares purchased by employees may be supplemented by the Company with additional free “matching shares”.
Operation
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) supervises the operation of the SIP .
The SIP comprises the following three elements and the Board may decide which element to offer to eligible employees:
(a) “Free Shares” are ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”) which may be allocated to an employee.
The market value of Free Shares allocated to any employee in any tax year may not exceed £3,000 or such other limit as may be
permitted by the relevant legislation. Free Shares may be allocated to employees equally, on the basis of salary, length of service 
or hours worked, or on the basis of performance, as permitted by legislation.
(b) “Partnership Shares” are Shares an employee may purchase out of their pre-tax earnings.
The market value of Partnership Shares which an employee can purchase in any tax year may not exceed £1,500 (or 10% of the
employee’s salary, if lower), or such other limit as may be permitted by the relevant legislation. The funds used to purchase
Partnership Shares will be deducted from the employee’s pre-tax salary.
(c) “Matching Shares” are free Shares which may be allocated to an employee who purchases Partnership Shares.
The Board may allocate Matching Shares to an employee who purchases Partnership Shares up to a maximum of two Matching Shares
for every one Partnership Share purchased (or such other maximum ratio as may be permitted by the relevant legislation). 
The same Matching Share ratio will apply to all employees who purchase Partnership Shares under the SIP on the same occasion.
An award of Shares may not be made under the SIP later than ten years after shareholder approval of the SIP .
Eligibility
Employees of the Company and any designated participating subsidiary who are UK resident taxpayers are eligible to participate. 
The Board may allow non-UK tax resident taxpayers to participate. The Board may require employees to have completed a qualifying
period of employment of up to 18 months in order to be eligible to participate. All eligible employees must be invited to participate.
Retention of shares
The trustee of the SIP trust will award Free Shares and Matching Shares to employees and hold those Shares on behalf of the participants.
Free Shares and Matching Shares must usually be retained by the trustee of the SIP trust for a period of between three and five years
after award. The trustee will acquire Partnership Shares on behalf of participants and hold those Shares on behalf of the participants.
Employees can withdraw Partnership Shares from the SIP trust at any time.
The Board may decide that awards of Free Shares and/or Matching Shares will be forfeited if participants cease to be employed by a
company in the Company’s Group within three years from the grant of those awards unless they leave by reason of death, injury,
disability, redundancy, retirement on or after reaching age 50, or the business or company for which they work ceases to be part of the
Company’s Group. In any of those cases, the participants will be required to withdraw their Shares from the SIP .
If an employee ceases to be employed by the Company’s Group at any time after acquiring Partnership Shares, he will be required to
withdraw the Shares from the SIP trust.
Lavendon Group plc 2012 43 Directors’ report
Continued
Corporate events
In the event of a general offer being made to shareholders, participants will be able to direct the trustees how to act in relation to
their Shares. In the event of a corporate reorganisation any Shares held by participants may be replaced by equivalent shares in a new
holding company.
Dividends on shares held by the trustee of the SIP
Any dividends paid on Shares held by the trustee of the SIP on behalf of participants may be either used to acquire additional Shares 
for employees (“Dividend Shares”) or distributed to participants.
Rights attaching to shares
An employee will be treated as the beneficial owner of Shares held on his behalf by the trustee of the SIP .
Any Shares allotted under the SIP will rank equally with Shares then in issue except for rights attaching to such Shares by reference 
to a record date prior to their allotment.
Overall SIP limits
The SIP may operate over new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than 10 per cent of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company under the SIP and any other employee share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purpose of this limit unless institutional investor bodies decide that they need 
not count.
Variation of capital
In the case of a variation in the share capital of the Company, Shares held in the SIP will be treated in the same way as other shares.
Alterations to the SIP
The Board may, at any time, amend the SIP in any respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for any
amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing eligibility, limits on participation, the overall
limits on the issue of Shares or the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for determining a participant’s entitlement to, and the terms of,
Shares to be acquired and the adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain prior shareholder approval will not, however , apply to any minor alteration to benefit the administration of 
the SIP , to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control, or regulatory treatment for
any participant or any company in the Company’s Group.
General
Awards made under the SIP are not transferable other than to the participant’s personal representatives in the event of their death. 
No benefits received under the SIP will be pensionable.

Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the auditors and recommended to the Board that a resolution to re-appoint PwC be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting. Consequently a resolution to reappoint PwC as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting together with a resolution authorising the director’s to fix their remuneration.
A review of PwC’s effectiveness will be undertaken in 2013 following completion of the 2012 year end audit. The Audit Committee will

46 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union,
and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards and applicable law. Under
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the group and company financial statements respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that
the financial statements and the Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Directors and advisers section of the Annual Report confirms that,
to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group,
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and they have
taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

The directors believe as a Board that their principal function is to deliver sustainable wealth to the Company’s shareholders, within a
framework of good corporate governance. The corporate governance procedures within the Company and the extent of compliance with
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the”Code”) is summarised below;
The Board
The Board currently comprises a non-executive chairman (John Standen), a chief executive officer (Don Kenny), a group finance director
(Alan Merrell), a Senior Independent Director (Jan Åstrand) and a non-executive director (Andrew Wood).
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated, with John Standen holding the office of Chairman and Don Kenny the

The Board directors provide the Company with experience and knowledge from a range of industry, financial and commercial
backgrounds. This combination of skills and experience assists the Board in any decision making process and in the development of
business strategy. Biographical details of each director , including current directorships held in other companies, are detailed on page 48
of the financial statements.
The Company maintains a schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board, including the release of a number of financial,
corporate and statutory disclosures, approval of business strategy and acquisitions, composition of relevant committees and management
structures, and matters relating to ethical, health and safety concerns.
The Company holds regular Board meetings during the year , with minutes being recorded and agreed by all directors ensuring an accurate
record is made of all relevant matters. During 2012, the Board held 11 formal meetings. The attendance of each director at these
meetings is shown in the table below:
Director J Standen D Kenny A Merrell J Åstrand A Wood

Apologies given —— —— 1
The Chairman holds separate meetings, at least annually, with the non-executive directors in order to review the contributions and
performance of all individuals comprising the Board.
The Company reviews conduct and liability issues as part of its annual risk review and mitigates these exposures through Directors and
Officer’s insurance cover where appropriate.
Board balance, independence and commitment
The two non-executive directors constitute, excluding the Chairman, one half of the Board. The non-executive directors provide a strong
and independent monitor on the performance of both the Company and its executive management.
The Board believes that the non-executive directors are independent within the guidance of the Code as they have not been previously
employed by the Company, do not currently and have not had a material business relationship with the Company, are remunerated on a
fixed fee basis, do not have close family ties with the Company’s advisers, directors or senior employees, do not hold cross directorships
with the other directors nor have other significant links with other directors, do not represent significant shareholders and have not
served on the Board for more than nine years. Their backgrounds in industry and finance make them suitably qualified to perform their
duties as members of the Board and as members of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The executive directors, Don Kenny and Alan Merrell, do not hold non-executive directorships outside of the Company. Neither the
Chairman nor non-executive directors currently hold other roles that are considered to impair or conflict with their abilities to fulfill their
duties to the Company.
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee is chaired by the Company’s Chairman, John Standen, with the two non-executive directors, Jan Åstrand,
and Andrew Wood as members of the Committee. The Committee has written terms of reference, which are published on the Company’s
website (www.lavendongroup.com). The principal responsibilities of the Committee are to consider and review the structure and
composition of the Board and its committees, identification and consideration of candidates for appointment to the Board, re-election
of Board members retiring by rotation and succession planning in general. All Committee members are considered to be independent.

Information and professional development
Board papers are circulated to all members of the Board in advance of each meeting, and the quantity and focus of such information is
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Directors provide feedback to management to enable the reporting formats and content of Board papers to
be enhanced, and make individual enquiries of management for clarification on issues whenever necessary.
The Company allows directors to take professional and independent advice as may be necessary in carrying out their duties. Directors also
attend training courses, when appropriate, to ensure they remain up to date with the latest developments and legal requirements that
impact their individual responsibilities.
The joint role of Finance Director and Company Secretary, held by Alan Merrell, ensures that the directors have ready access to the
Company Secretary in all relevant matters and that compliance with Board procedures is maintained.
Performance evaluation
The Board has undertaken an annual review of its performance in 2012. This review was facilitated by the directors completing detailed
appraisals on matters relevant to the Board, its Committees and director performance, from which action plans were developed, where
necessary, to address areas identified for improvement.
Re-election
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, all directors are subject to election at the Company’s first Annual General
Meeting following their appointment, and all are required to seek re-election at intervals of no more than three years. In accordance with
best practice, all of the Company’s directors seek re-election on an annual basis, and their biographical details and the Annual General
Meeting particulars are detailed on page 48 and on pages 98 to 104 of the financial statements respectively.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The directors and auditors set out their respective responsibilities for preparing and reviewing the financial statements in the Statement
of directors’ responsibilities on page 47 and in the Independent auditors’ report on page 54 of the financial statements. The Company’s
strategy for delivering sustained value over the longer term is set out in the “Operating and Financial Review” on pages 5 to 26, which
also incorporates the Company’s review on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern principle in preparing the financial
statements for 2012.
Risk management and internal control
The Board maintains a system of internal controls within the Company to manage risks and provide a reasonable, but not absolute, degree
of assurance on the reliability of the financial and other information used both within the business and for external publication, as well
as safeguarding the assets of the Company against unauthorised use or disposition. The systems in place are designed to identify to the
Board, on a timely basis, matters that require attention so that they may be considered and dealt with appropriately. The Board has
reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal control that were in operation during the past financial year , and these are
summarised under the following headings:
• Control environment
There is a clearly defined organisational structure that allows the Company’s objectives to be planned, communicated, executed,
controlled and monitored. The Company employs suitably qualified staff so that the appropriate level of authority can be delegated
to ensure the efficient management of the business. Delegated authority is embedded throughout the organization, covering the
preparation and review of financial and operational information together with the procedures for seeking and obtaining approval for
major transactions and organisational changes. The level of delegated authority is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee.
• Identification and evaluation of business risks and control objectives
The identification and evaluation of both financial and non financial business risks facing the Company is reviewed annually by the
Board. During this process the effectiveness of its internal controls in safeguarding against these risks is considered, and where
necessary additional controls are introduced or existing controls are enhanced.
50 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Risk management and internal control continued
• Information systems
The management information systems provide the Company with relevant and timely reports from which both the Board and senior
management can monitor the performance of the business. Budgets and prior year data provide the Board and senior management with
comparative information with which to assess and monitor the performance of the various activities of the Company. Operational
performance statistics are reviewed against a range of measures including competitive benchmarks and historical trends. The Group
has continued to invest in developing and enhancing these information systems during the year , to ensure that the information is
provided in the most efficient manner.
• Monitoring
The executive directors have significant involvement in the day-to-day management of the Company’s activities and are, therefore,
able to monitor the control procedures at an operational and financial level. A Group Executive Committee, comprising the two
executive directors and direct reports from the operating subsidiaries and business functional units, meets regularly to discuss key
operational risks and issues, monitor business unit performance and ensure efficient communication.
The Company maintains an internal audit function, outsourced to Grant Thornton LLP , which undertakes a programme of audits across the
Company. Each year , a risk workshop is held to identify and evaluate the key business risks, from which a focused audit programme is
developed and agreed with the executive and the Audit Committee. The internal audit reports are addressed to, and reviewed by, the
Audit Committee, and appropriate actions, if required, agreed.
Any reportable control weaknesses identified by the Company’s external auditors are discussed with the Audit Committee, and reports
circulated to the relevant executive directors.
Audit Committee and Auditors
The Audit Committee Chairman is Andrew Wood, with Jan Åstrand and John Standen as a members of the Committee. The Committee’s
main responsibilities and activities are set out in a separate Audit Committee Report on page 53 of the financial statements. The
Committee has written terms of reference, which are published on the Company’s website (www.lavendongroup.com). All Committee
members are considered to be independent.
During 2012 the Audit Committee held three formal meetings. The attendance of each director at these meetings (and the occasions at
which the Group’s external auditors attended) is shown in the table below:

Committee has written terms of reference, which are published on the Company’s website (www.lavendongroup.com). All Committee
members are considered to be independent.
The Remuneration Committee considers it is complying in full with the relevant provisions of the Code and outlines its procedures and
guidelines in a separate Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 39 of the financial statements. Details of the directors’ remuneration and
interests in shares during 2012 are included within the Remuneration Report. The Committee annually invites shareholders to vote on the
Remuneration Report at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.

Continued
Non-executive directors hold appointments for a term of three years, and their fees are determined by the Board following external
benchmarking. The reappointment of non-executive directors is addressed after giving due consideration to their qualifications,
continuing independence, performance and willingness to accept reappointment.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office
and during the Annual General Meeting each year.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The directors hold a series of meetings with institutional investors after the publication of the Company’s annual and interim financial
results each year. Meetings are also held during the year with both existing and prospective shareholders, to provide the opportunity to
understand the Company’s operations and strategy in greater detail.
The Chairman maintains a regular dialogue with major shareholders in relation to strategy and corporate governance issues, and non-
executive directors are also available to meet major shareholders as required. In particular , the Senior Independent Director , Jan Åstrand,
is available to meet major shareholders in the Company, to allow any concerns to be raised independently from the Board. In addition,
the non-executive directors are available for questions from individual shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting each year.
The Board retains a Stockbroker to ensure a regular flow of relevant information is made available to both current and prospective
shareholders and to facilitate feedback to assist the Board in understanding the issues and concerns of its shareholders.
The Annual General Meeting and shareholder communications
The majority of the Company’s share capital continues to be held by institutional investors.

Whilst the Company does not include a formal presentation at the Annual General Meeting for private shareholders, the Company
maintains a website: www.lavendongroup.com, which publishes financial results, presentations, formal announcements, and a number of
corporate governance documents for review by current and potential shareholders. In addition, at the Company’s Annual General
Meeting, the full Board, including the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, are available to answer
individual questions or concerns about the Company’s performance and strategy.
It is the Company’s policy to ensure that Annual General Meeting resolution proposals remain segregated when voting issues are substantially
separate issues. The directors announce the proxy vote on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting, after the show of hands for each
resolution. The overall voting for each resolution is publicly announced following the completion of the Annual General Meeting.
Going concern
The directors have detailed their going concern statement on page 22.

52 Lavendon Group plc 2012  Report of the Audit Committee
Members and qualifications of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Company’s two independent non-executive directors, Andrew Wood as Chairman and Jan Åstrand,
together with the Company’s Chairman, John Standen. The Committee’s Chairman, Andrew Wood, is a chartered management accountant
with over 15 years experience as Group Finance Director of FTSE 250 companies, and is considered to have relevant financial experience.
The biographies of the members of the Committee are set out on page 48.
Terms of reference
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference which are reviewed annually and published on the Company’s website
(www.lavendongroup.com).
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to:
• Monitor and review the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any announcements related to the Group’s financial performance
• Review the Group’s accounting policies annually to ensure they remain relevant and comply with best practice
• Monitor the Group’s key areas of risk, together with the application of policies, procedures and practices to manage these risks
• Approve the scope of work of the internal audit function, review its performance and its findings
• Approve the appointment, scope of work and remuneration of the Group’s external auditors
• Review and make recommendations to the Board on any issues raised by either internal or external auditors
• Monitor the continuing independence of the external auditors and make appropriate policy recommendations to the Board.
• Determine and communicate policy to the Board relating to procurement of non-audit related assignments from the external auditors
Performance of the Audit Committee
The Committee held three meetings during the year , at which the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director as well as the Group’s external
and internal auditors were invited to attend. At these meetings, the interim and annual financial statements were reviewed, an
assessment of the scope and findings of the external and internal audits discussed, and the strategy and scope of forthcoming audits
planned and agreed. The Audit Committee confirmed with the auditors that they had received all necessary information for completion of
their assignments. At each meeting, the auditors were asked whether they wished to bring any matters to the attention of the Committee
without the executive directors being present.
During 2012 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP formally confirmed their independence and willingness to continue as auditors to the Group.
The Audit Committee has a formal policy relating to the procurement of non-audit related work from the Group’s external auditors.
This policy has been applied in the year and is reviewed annually. The policy permits the engagement of external auditors, without the
prior approval of the Committee, for non-audit services where the fees will not exceed 30% of the annual audit fee for the Group (50% in
the case of taxation services), and where the services relate to advice on the interpretation of accounting regulations, taxation and
treasury services and other matters that have relevance to the external audit function. The policy specifically prohibits engaging external
auditors to make management decisions or provide management services, acting as an advocate in litigation, investment banking
services, internal audit services of a recurring nature, the design and implementation of financial and risk management systems and
executive search services. After reviewing the level of fees relating to the provision of non-audit services and the nature of that work,
the Committee believes that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP remain independent of the Group.
To enable employees to raise matters of impropriety or concern relating to financial or other issues, the Committee maintains an
independent reporting procedure through which employee concerns can be raised. This procedure provides feedback to all employees
of matters raised and actions taken.

Chairman of the Audit Committee

Lavendon Group plc 2012 53 Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Lavendon Group plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the Group
income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Group
statement of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 47, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and
express an opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . This includes an assessment of:
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report and financial statements to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 52, in relation to going concern;
• the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code specified for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012
and on the information in the directors’ Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

58 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012
1. Principal accounting policies
General information
Lavendon Group plc (‘the Company’ or with its subsidiaries ‘the Group’) is the European and Middle Eastern market leader in the rental
of powered access equipment operating a fleet of approximately 20,000 machines through a network of 83 active depots located in
Belgium, France, Germany, the UK and a number of countries in the Middle East.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 15 Midland Court, Central Park, Lutterworth, Leicestershire LE17 4PN.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS’s”)
and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group
financial statements have been prepared, on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention as modified by financial assets and
liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the profit or loss. A summary of the more significant Group accounting
policies is set out below.
The Parent Company has not adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. Its results, reported under UK GAAP , are detailed on
pages 90 to 96.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount,
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. All material
intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have been
adopted across the Group.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their
fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is
recorded as goodwill. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities where a controlling interest is held by the Group or , in the case of the Middle East, where the
Group has the right to give directions with respect to the operating and financial policies and as a result is considered to have control of
the entities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Details of the principal subsidiaries of the Group are given in note 4 of the Parent Company financial statements on page 93.
Impact of new accounting standards
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year on or after 1 January 2012 that would
be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The new standards and interpretations applicable from the beginning of the year are as follows:
• Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’
• Amendment to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’
• Amendment to IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption on financial instrument disclosures’
• Annual improvements 2011
Lavendon Group plc 2012 59 Notes to the financial statements

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided to customers outside of the Group, stated net of returns and value added and other sales taxes.
Revenue from rental fleet hire is recognised on a daily basis over the period of hire when the Group can reliably measure the likely flow
of economic benefits. Other revenue, including the sale of new and ex-rental fleet equipment, is recognised as at the point at which the
goods or services are delivered to and accepted by the customer.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker , who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments,
has been identified as the Group Board.
A discontinued operation is a component that either has been disposed of, or that is classified as held for sale, and (a) represents a
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; and (b) is a part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations; or (c) is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Cash flows and operations that relate to a major component of the business or geographical region that has been sold or is classified as
held for sale are shown separately from continuing operations.
The continuing operating segments are the main geographic areas in which the Group operates together with one non operating corporate
cost centre. The Group’s main geographic areas are the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany and the Middle East.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. Items
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet
date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance
sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are
subject to effective cash flow or net investment hedges which are recorded in equity. Translation differences on non-monetary items are
reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
Group companies
The results and financial position of overseas Group entities are translated into Sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
• income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, where effective, are taken to equity. Tax charges and credits attributable
to those exchange differences are also taken directly to equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.
Financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss,
loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this position
at each reporting date.
60 Lavendon Group plc 2012 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial instruments held for trading and those assets designated
at fair value through profit or loss. A financial instrument is classified in this category if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling
or repurchasing in the short term or if it is a financial asset so designated by management on initial recognition. Derivative financial
instruments are included as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Items in this category are classified as current assets
or current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised costs are non-derivative financial instruments with fixed or determinable
payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly
to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are initially measured at fair value. Other liabilities at amortised cost are
initially recognised at fair value. They are included in current liabilities, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after
the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current liabilities.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. Impairments of such financial assets are recorded in the income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for equipment rental or other products or services performed in the ordinary course of
business. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. The
cost of unrecoverable trade receivables is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility that
are treated as an extinguishment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at
their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as:
• cash flow hedges – hedges of floating interest rate transactions; or
• net investment hedges – hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Movements on the hedging reserves in equity are shown in
the Group statement of changes in equity.
Lavendon Group plc 2012 61 Notes to the financial statements

1. Principal accounting policies continued
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss
(for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However , when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur , the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is
recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and
losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately
in the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of
business on the balance sheet date. Financial assets held by the Group are valued on a mark to market basis by financial institutions.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar
instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value
for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The nominal value less estimated
credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities
is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar
financial instruments.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on
the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in financial liabilities –
borrowings. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under
finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and its lease term.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the periods benefiting from the incentives.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; and
• it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• the amount has been reliably estimated.
62 Lavendon Group plc 2012 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are recorded
separately in the financial statements where material.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
Where the Group expects amounts to be received in relation to a provision, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when its
receipt is considered certain.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairments in value. Cost includes
the initial purchase price of the asset and any directly attributable costs of bringing it into its intended use. Additional transportation
costs incurred to move existing fleet between operating segments are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is
provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their
estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives and residual values are as follows:
Useful lives Residual values
Short leasehold properties — amortised over the period of lease nil
Rental fleet — 7 to 13 years 5-20%
Office fixtures and equipment — 3 to 4 years nil
Motor vehicles — 3 to 5 years nil
Residual values and useful economic lives are reassessed annually.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of
identifiable net assets of a subsidiary acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are made where
necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if
there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of
goodwill exceeds its fair value.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where
necessary on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Other intangible assets acquired as part of an
acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable and their fair value can be measured
reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of
criteria are satisfied. These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability
of adequate resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate probable future
economic benefit.
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition are detailed in note 13. They are estimated to have asset lives in the range of 1 to 6 years
and are amortised on a straight-line basis accordingly.
Lavendon Group plc 2012 63 Notes to the financial statements
Continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets continued
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will
generate economic benefits beyond one year , are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property comprises trademarks and patents which are initially recognised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis
over a period of up to 5 years.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject
to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating
units). In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the cash generating units are discounted to their present value
using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and associated risks.
The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
Employee benefit costs
The Group operates several defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independently administered fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The cost of providing these benefits, recognised in
the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Following the acquisition of the Gardemann group of companies in 2006, the Group now has an obligation to a single ex-employee of the
Gardemann group under a defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is unfunded, but a full provision of £158,000 (2011: £152,000), based
on an actuarial valuation, is included in the Group’s balance sheet under accruals. Given the immateriality of this single obligation to the
Group as a whole, management do not consider the full disclosure required by IAS19 “Retirement Benefits” to be appropriate in this instance.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends
are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Inventories
Inventories, comprising ex-rental fleet equipment available for sale, third party equipment purchased for resale, machine spare parts and
consumables, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost basis used within the Group is a ‘First In First Out’ or FIFO
basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Taxation including deferred tax
Provision for taxation is made at the current rate.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However , if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor
taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related
deferred taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.
64 Lavendon Group plc 2012 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
amounts can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.
Share based payment
The Group operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received under
such plans is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair value is determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model
for share option schemes and in the case of share matching plans and the long-term incentive plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact
of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share
incentives that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that
are expected to vest. The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares)
are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the Parent Company.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as a
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over
the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertaking, with a corresponding credit to equity. This does not have an
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Group
Balance Sheet. For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding
bank overdrafts.
Key assumptions and estimates
Significant estimates have been used in respect of the calculation of the residual values of property, plant and equipment, the calculation
of any impairment to the carrying value of goodwill, the valuation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, and the trade
receivables provision.
The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are estimated based on management’s historic experience of
disposals of such used equipment and their judgement of the current market conditions.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using estimating long-term growth rates and
appropriate discount rates, based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of future prospects. Other intangible assets are
tested for impairment if there are indications they might be impaired. Full details of the assumptions used are given in note 13.
The fair value of intangibles recognised on acquisition is derived from a combination of previous knowledge, experience and consultation
with independent valuers.
The trade receivables provision is based on management’s best estimate of the recoverability of specific customer balances, after taking
into account the recent payment experience, underlying economic climate and discussions with key customers.
Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items to be those that, by virtue of their nature, size or frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the
financial statements in order to better understand the underlying performance of the Group. These include, but are not limited to, costs
of reorganisation and restructuring, impairment of non-current assets, significant one-off financing costs and significant one-off claims.
Lavendon Group plc 2012 65 Notes to the financial statements

2. Segmental analysis
From 1 January 2012, the internal reporting arrangements for the Group were reorganised into six operating segments based on the
geographical locations of the UK, Germany, Belgium, France and the Middle East together with one non operating Corporate cost centre.
The Corporate cost centre comprises the Group directorate, statutory compliance and Group administrative functions and holds the
Group’s bank borrowing facilities. The segmental reporting has therefore been updated to reflect this change for the current and
comparative periods with Corporate items, that were previous reported as part of the UK segment, now reported separately.
The Group’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is the Group Board. The Group Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting in
order to monitor and assess performance of the operating segments for the purpose of making decisions about allocation of resources.
Performance is evaluated based on actual results compared to agreed targets and performance in prior periods.

The depreciation charge shown for the Middle East operation includes rental equipment owned by the UK operation for the first half of the year , but which were used by and costed 
to the Middle East operation. The inclusion of the depreciation charge in the Middle East more accurately reflects the commercial nature of the arrangement and the reporting to the
CODM. The associated assets were transferred to the Middle East in June 2012.
Inter segment trading has been eliminated in the analysis presented above, so that only trading between the Group and external third parties is represented.

Note
The assets and depreciation charge shown for the Middle East operation includes rental equipment owned by the UK operation, but which is used by and costed to the Middle East
operation. The inclusion of the assets and depreciation charge in the Middle East more accurately reflects the commercial nature of the arrangement and the reporting to the CODM.
The associated assets were transferred to the Middle East in June 2012.
Inter segment trading has been eliminated in the analysis presented above, so that only trading between the Group and external third parties is represented.
The total of non-current assets other than financial instruments and deferred tax located in the UK is £109,570,000 (2011: £183,520,000),
and the total of such non-current assets located in other countries is £191,358,000 (2011: £121,886,000).

Notes
(i) Restructuring costs during 2012 principally relate to the ongoing reorganisation of the German business. Restructuring costs in 2011 related to consultancy costs, employee
termination costs and associated professional fees that arose following the operational and business plan reviews conducted during the period.
(ii) In 2011 the Group reached an agreement with certain tax authorities on the treatment of intra group financing arrangements from prior periods (2006 – 2009). This agreement
resulted in a reduction being required to the Group’s corporation tax and deferred tax creditors to reduce these provisions to reflect the actual liability agreed, and interest
payable becoming due on the agreed liability.
(iii) Relates to the movement in fair value of interest rate swaps that are not designated as cash flow hedges.
(iv) Fees incurred on bank refinancing (note 20).

services of £87,000 (2011: £51,000).
Tax services incorporate both compliance and advisory services. Due to the international nature of the Group, its tax affairs can cross
jurisdictions and involve complex structures. Given the auditors considerable experience and knowledge of the Group’s structure and
history, it is deemed expedient to use their tax services.

— current year 8,647 7,295
— adjustment in respect of prior years 341 (3,600)

— taxation movement on share based payments (154) (34)
Total deferred tax (4,356) (4,729)
Taxation charge/(credit) 4,632 (1,034)
The taxation charge on the underlying profit is £6,388,000, (2011: £5,353,000). The taxation credit on amortisation charges, exceptional
items and fair value movements on financial derivatives is £1,756,000 (2011: £6,387,000), see note 3.
In addition to the amount of taxation charged/(credited) to the income statement, tax of £555,000 (2011: £15,000) in respect of share
based payments was credited directly to reserves. This represents the recognition of a deferred tax asset which is in excess of the credit
to the income statement for share based payments.
No provision has been made in the financial statements for any tax liability which may arise upon future distributions of profit to the
United Kingdom from overseas subsidiaries.

Reconciliation of taxation
The tax charge/(credit) for the year is lower (2011: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 24.50% (2011: 26.49%).
The differences are explained below:
2012 2011
£’000 £’000
Profit before taxation 20,798 14,157
Profit at standard rate of corporation tax in the UK: 24.50% (2011: 26.49%) 5,096 3,750
Adjustments to tax in respect of prior years – current tax 341 (3,600)

Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 955 663
Additional tax losses recognised (2,150) (1,220)
Effect on deferred tax due to the tax rate change in the UK (1,074) (1,195)
Tax losses not recognised 368 454
Timing differences on which deferred tax is not provided (48) (3)
4,632 (1,034)
The standard rate of corporation tax rate in the UK changed from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012. Accordingly, the Company’s UK profits for
this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 24.50%. The relevant deferred tax balances have been re-measured to reflect this
change in the rate of corporation tax.
With effect from 1 April 2013 the UK corporation tax rate will change to 23% (legislation was enacted in Finance Act 2012), and it has
been announced that the rate will further reduce to 21% from 1 April 2014. The change in tax rate to 21% had not been substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore is not recognised in these financial statements. The estimated impact of the change 
is a reduction in deferred tax balances of £1.0m.

Earnings per share are calculated on the 164,990,033 weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year ended
31 December 2012 (year ended 31 December 2011: 164,688,101).
Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares which arise from share incentive scheme awards
granted to employees, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary share capital during
the year. The effect of this dilution is to increase the weighted average number of ordinary shares to 169,167,889 (year ended
31 December 2011: 164,696,423).
Underlying earnings per share is presented to exclude the impact of amortisation charges, exceptional items and movements in fair value
of financial derivatives in the year and their associated tax effect. The directors believe that underlying earnings per share provides
additional relevant information about underlying business performance.

which will distribute an estimated £3,301,000 of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 30 April 2013 to those shareholders who are on the
register at 8 March 2013, subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination was allocated, at date of acquisition, to the cash generating unit that benefited from that
business combination. The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
74 Lavendon Group plc 2012 13. Intangible assets continued
The allocation of the goodwill by operating segment is shown in the table below:
Goodwill
2012 2011
Operating segments £’000 £’000
United Kingdom 45,541 40,941
Belgium 15,188 20,261
Germany 16,999 17,401
Total 77,728 78,603
During the year the group altered the way in which it manages and operates the sale of ex-rental fleet. Following this change £4,600,000 
of goodwill previously associated with Belgium has been re-allocated to the UK. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. For the purpose of
determining potential goodwill impairment, recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections
based on financial plans covering a three year period. The growth rate assumptions used in the plans are based on past performance and
management's expectations of market developments. The growth rate assumptions used to determine the cash flows beyond the three year
period is 2.25% for UK and Germany and 2% for Belgium (2011: 2.5% for all). The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows for
the UK and Germany is 11% (2011: 11%) and for Belgium 11.4% (2011: 12.5%). 
The impairment review for Belgium identified headroom of £5,955,000 (2011: £10,257,000) against the carrying value of the assets.
No additional impairment would be required for Belgium if any of the following were to occur: if the pre-tax rate used to discount the
project cash flows increased by 1.6% to 13.0%, or if the long term growth assumption reduced by 2% to nil, or if projected earnings
before interest, taxation and amortisation in the periods beyond the initial three year period is reduced by 20%.

In accordance with IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement’, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded
derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately if they meet certain requirements set out in IAS39. No contracts requiring
separate accounting were identified that would have a material effect on the financial statements.

— interest rate swaps —— — — 780 —
At 31 December 2012 the Group had no financial instruments carried at fair value (2011: three). The notional principal amount of the
outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2012 was £nil (31 December 2011 were £10,000,000 and €43,000,000).
In 2011 the level 2 valuations were derived from Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets and Bank of Scotland Markets models, and were based on
mid-market levels as of the close of business on 31 December 2011.
Fair value gains of £780,000 (2011: gains of £1,380,000) relating to interest rate swaps have been recognised in equity (£121,000, net of
£30,000 tax) or in the income statement as appropriate. Interest rate swap cash flows are paid/received on a quarterly basis. Interest
rate swaps are valued on a marked to market (‘MTM’) basis by established financial institutions.
At 31 December 2011 the EURIBOR fixed interest rates secured by the interest rate swap contracts ranged from 3.62% to 4.25%, compared
to the one month EURIBOR floating interest rate at the year end of 0.964%. The fair value of the difference between fixed and floating
interest rates was deferred in equity where hedging was effective and was reversed in the income statement during 2012.
At 31 December 2011 the LIBOR fixed interest rate secured by the interest rate swap contract was 4.09%, compared to the one month
LIBOR floating interest rate at the year end of 0.770%. The fair value of the difference between fixed and floating interest rates was
deferred in equity where hedging was effective and was reversed in the income statement during 2012.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities
The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which are designated as hedges of the net investment in its subsidiaries in Belgium, 
France and Germany. The foreign exchange profit on translation into Sterling of £1,007,000 (2011: £1,912,000) relating to these hedged
borrowings has been recognised in the net investment hedge reserve where hedging is effective. No ineffectiveness has been charged 
to the income statement in the year (2011: £nil).

23. Financial risk management
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the overall cost of capital.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital risk management during the year.
Consistent with other companies in the rental industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of return on capital employed and the
ratio of net debt to equity.

Total equity 196,832 185,160
Debt to equity ratio 49% 58%
Return on capital employed 10.7% 9.0%
The ratio of net debt to equity decreased during the year , due to a further reduction in year end net debt and the increase in total equity
that was principally derived from profits generated during the year. During the period the Group has complied with its banking covenants,
and expects to remain compliant for the foreseeable future.
Lavendon Group plc 2012 81 Notes to the financial statements
Continued
23. Financial risk management continued
The Group has exposure to the following principal risks:
• market risk;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management policy aims to minimise the potential adverse effects of financial markets on the Group’s financial
performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out centrally by the Group except for customer credit risk which is the responsibility of each operational entity.
1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the Group’s income, or its financial instruments, will be affected by changes in market prices, for example
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on its financial liabilities. The risk is currently
managed by maintaining a proportion of borrowings at fixed interest rates, principally hire purchase and finance lease agreements and
the loan placement undertaken during 2012. Interest rate risk is presented in the Operating and financial review on page 24.
The Group also has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. This risk is minimised through the use of foreign currency
borrowings and net investment hedging. The effect on the Group’s 2012 results due to movements in foreign exchange rates is presented
in the Operating and financial review on page 18.
2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations. Such risk arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash and bank balances.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is shown in the table below:
2012 2011
£’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents (note 17) 13,667 16,031
Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments (note 16) 51,249 47,927
64,916 63,958
Cash and cash equivalents
Surplus cash is held in current and deposit accounts with established financial institutions. All the financial institutions have at least a
Moody’s credit rating of Baa.
Trade and other receivables
The management of credit risk exposure to customers is the responsibility of each operation who have formal credit policies in place to
mitigate this risk. The credit policies require that the credit worthiness of a customer is assessed prior to trading and that the level of
exposure to that customer remains within agreed credit limits. To support these policies, the Group maintains certain levels of credit
insurance for its main operating subsidiaries.
The Group’s only exposure to concentrations of credit risk is to geographic and industry sector risk. As set out in the Operating 
and financial review on pages 18 to 26 the construction sector is an important market and particularly sensitive to pricing levels. 
This exposure is actively managed with efforts being focused on widening the Group’s customer base to other sectors.
No individual customer makes up more than 3% of revenue (2011: 3%).

Middle East currencies 16,706 12,195
51,249 47,927
3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to achieve a
balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective borrowing structure. The Group has committed debt facilities of
£100 million and €60 million which finally mature in July 2016 and July 2019 respectively. This is supplemented by hire purchase and
finance lease facilities. The Group aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit lines available to supplement cash flows
generated from trading to meet known obligations in the next twelve months. An analysis of liquidity risk, being the maturity of financial
liabilities and the undrawn committed borrowing facilities is presented in note 22.
The Group’s financial liabilities are analysed in note 21.

during the year are shown in the table below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right
of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
During the year, a deferred tax asset has been recognised based on brought forward tax losses of £23,498,000 (2011: £22,943,000).
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through
future taxable profits is probable.
There are unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to trading losses in overseas operations. The losses which have not been recognised
amount to £22,271,000 (2011: £27,451,000). The tax values associated with these losses are £6,154,000 (2011: £8,011,000).

The total charge for the year relating to the five equity settled compensation plans was £690,000 (2011: £571,000), all of which related
to equity settled share based payment transactions. After deferred tax debited/credited to the income statement, the total charge was
£536,000 (2011: £537,000).
Share option schemes
The Company established two share option schemes on 10 October 1996. The Company has made periodic grants of options under both
schemes, details of which are given in the Directors’ report on pages 42 to 43. Both the Employee Scheme and the Executive Scheme
closed in October 2006. Consequently no further awards have been made since that date.
The fair value of the share options is based on historic volatility of the share price over the last five years. The expected life is the
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent
with the assumed option life.

Long term incentive plan
The Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (“the LTIP”) was approved at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2006.
The performance condition is based on the Group’s TSR performance relative to the performance of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding
Investment Trusts (the “Index”) over the vesting period. The vesting of the awards will require the Company’s TSR performance over a
single three year period to be at least equal to that of the Index for 15% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100%
of the awards vesting if the TSR exceeds the index by 60% or more. The actual share price performance of the Company will be adjusted
to take into account the impact of dividends and any capital adjustments.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards made in 2012 are detailed below:
TSR
Share price at grant date (pence) 115
No. of employees 35
Rights granted 1,495,982
Vesting period (years) 3
Award pricing model Monte Carlo
% expected to vest 81%
Fair value of award (pence) 46.5
Share Incentive Plan (“The SIP”)
In November 2007 the Group introduced the Lavendon Group plc Share Incentive Plan.
189,225 SIP shares (2011: 222,922) were issued during the year of which 75,690 shares were SIP matching shares (2011: 87,706).
The fair values are calculated by applying the following models:
Share Incentive Plan — Black-Scholes option pricing model:
Share price Price at date of grant
Exercise price Nil pence per share
Expected share price volatility 44.2% – 57.9%
Expected share price volatility is estimated by calculating the annualised daily volatility of the share price over the preceding
three years.
Expected dividends Based on historical dividend yield
Risk-free interest 4.5%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.

88 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Lavendon Group plc
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise
the Parent Company balance sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 47, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to
audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report and
financial statements to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2012;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Parent Company financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2012.

90 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Notes to the Company’s financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012
1. Principal accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable Accounting
Standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). The principal accounting policies and estimation techniques have been applied consistently and
are set out below:
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange
differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Fixed asset investments
Investments are included at cost stated at the historical Sterling value at the time of investment other than where overseas investments
are hedged by foreign currency borrowings in which case the investment is included at cost, restated at the year end Sterling value at the
balance sheet date and any exchange movement is taken to reserves. Where appropriate, the carrying values of fixed asset investments
are measured by reference to their discounted future operational cash flows, or their imputed resale value, and provision is made for any
diminution in value where necessary.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans on behalf of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received under such plans is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. Fair value is
determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model for share option schemes and the Share Incentive Plan, and in the case of
Share Matching Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount to be expensed over the vesting
period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non- market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact
of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity,
over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares)
are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the Parent Company and the Group.
The amounts in the Company are immaterial and are therefore not disclosed.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the
dividends are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility that
are treated as an extinguishment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Lavendon Group plc 2012 91 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit can differ from net profit/loss as reported in the profit
and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method.
2. Result for the financial year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented in these
financial statements. The Parent Company’s loss after tax for the financial year was £6,647,000 (2011: loss of £7,085,000).
3. Employee information
The Company has no employees. Non-executive directors of the Company are employed under letters of appointment. Full details
regarding their remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration report on pages 34 to 39.

100 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Notes
1. The Company specifies that in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and also for the purpose of
determining how many votes a person entitled to attend and vote may cast), a person must be entered on the register of members of
the Company at 6.00 p.m. on 16 April 2013 or , in the event of any adjournment, at 6.00 p.m. on the date which is two days before the
day of the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the
rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
2. A member is entitled to appoint another person as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, to speak and to vote at the
Annual General Meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
A form of proxy for the meeting is enclosed. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form.
To be valid any proxy form or other instrument appointing a proxy must be received by post or by hand (during normal business hours
only) by our registrar Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4TU. Votes must be received no later than
11.30am on 16 April 2013. If you are a CREST member , see note 3 below.
Completion of a form of proxy, or other instrument appointing a proxy or any CREST Proxy Instruction will not preclude a member
attending and voting in person at the meeting if he/she wishes to do so.
3. Alternatively, if you are a member of CREST , you may register the appointment of a proxy by using the CREST electronic proxy
appointment service. Further details are contained below:
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the
Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures, and to the address, described in the CREST Manual
(available via www.euroclear.com/CREST) subject to the provisions of the Company’s articles of association. CREST personal members
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear”) specifications
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must,
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA 10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy
appointments specified in the notice of the Annual General Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time
(as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to
retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . After this time any change of instructions to proxies
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not make
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or , if the CREST
member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of
the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service provider(s) are referred, in particular , to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST
system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001.

4. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may have a right, under an agreement between him/her and the member by whom he/she was
nominated, to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person
has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may have a right, under such an agreement, to give
instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statement of the above rights of the members in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated Persons.

powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
6. Any member attending the Annual General Meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such
question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere
unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the answer has already been
given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order
of the meeting that the question be answered.
7. Copies of executive directors’ service agreements and copies of the terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors

Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General
Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at
which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 of the Act, (in each case) that the members propose to
raise at the Annual General Meeting. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its
expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under
Section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement
available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been
required under Section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
10. As at 28 February 2013 (being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this notice) the Company’s issued share capital
consists of 165,096,473 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at that date

11. You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of Section 333(4) of the Companies Act 2006) provided in this Notice of
Meeting (or in any related documents) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

102 Lavendon Group plc 2012 Explanatory notes to the Resolutions

Resolution 3: Re-appointment of director
Don Kenny will retire and being eligible will stand for re-election by the shareholders. The Board recommends to shareholders the re-

Resolutions 8 and 9: The auditors
Company law requires Lavendon Group plc, at each general meeting at which accounts are laid, to appoint auditors who will remain in
office until the next general meeting at which accounts are laid. Resolution 8, therefore, proposes to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as auditors of Lavendon Group plc and Resolution 9 authorises the directors to agree to the auditors’ remuneration.
Lavendon Group plc 2012 103 Explanatory notes to the Resolutions continued
Resolution 10: Remuneration report
The directors are seeking approval of the shareholders for the directors’ Remuneration report for the financial year ended on
31 December 2012. The resolution is an advisory vote, as permitted by law, and no entitlement to remuneration is made conditional on
the resolution being passed. The Remuneration report is set out in full on pages 34 to 39 to in the Annual Report of the Company for the
year ended 31 December 2012.
Resolution 11
Your directors may allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for , or convert any security into, shares only if authorised to do so by
shareholders. The authority granted at the last Annual General Meeting of the Company is due to expire at this year’s Annual General
Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 11 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant new authorities to allot shares and grant rights to
subscribe for , or convert any security into, shares (a) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £550,322 and (b) in connection with a rights
issue up to an aggregate nominal amount (reduced by allotments under part (a) of the resolution) of £1,100,643.
These amounts represent approximately 33.3 per cent. and approximately 66.7 per cent. respectively of the total issued ordinary share
capital of the Company as at 28 February 2013, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice. If given, these authorities
will expire at the Annual General Meeting in 2014 or on 31 May 2014, whichever is the earlier.
Your directors have no present intention of issuing shares pursuant to this authority. As at the date of this notice the Company holds no
treasury shares.
Resolution 12
Your directors also require a power from shareholders to allot equity securities or sell treasury shares for cash and otherwise than to
existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The power granted at the last Annual General Meeting of the Company is due to expire 
at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 12 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such a power. Apart from
offers or invitations in proportion to the respective number of shares held, the power will be limited to the allotment of equity securities
and sales of treasury shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £82,548 (being five per cent. of the Company’s issued ordinary
share capital at 28 February 2013, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice). If given, this power will expire on 
31 May 2014 or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2014, whichever is the earlier. Your directors will have due regard to
institutional guidelines in relation to any exercise of this power , in particular the requirement for advance consultation and explanation
before making any non pre-emptive cash issue pursuant to this resolution which exceeds 7.5 per cent. of the Company’s issued share
capital in any rolling three year period.
Your directors have no present intention of exercising this authority.
Resolution 13
Resolution 13 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold general meetings (other than annual general meetings) on 14 days’ notice.
The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a
shorter notice period, which cannot be less than 14 clear days. Annual General Meetings must always be held on at least 21 clear days’
notice. The flexibility offered by Resolution 13 will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the directors consider a shorter
notice appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the meeting. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next
annual general meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. In order to be able to call a general meeting on
less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.
Resolution 14
Resolution 14 is designed to deal with rules on political donations and expenditure contained in Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 (the
“Act”) (sections 362 to 379). Under section 378 of the Act, a company may not make donations to a political party, or other political
organisation, or to an independent election candidate of more than £5,000 in total, or incur any political expenditure, without first
obtaining shareholder approval.
It is the Company’s policy not to make contributions to political parties. There is no intention to change that policy. What constitutes a
“political donation”, a “political party”, a “political organisation” or “political expenditure” under the Act is not clear , as the legislation
is capable of wide interpretation and may have the effect of covering a number of normal business or charitable activities that would not
be thought to be political donations in the usual sense. To avoid any possibility of inadvertently contravening the Act, the Board considers
that it would be prudent to follow the procedure specified in the Act to obtain shareholder approval for the Company and its subsidiaries
to make political donations to incur political expenditure in the forthcoming year until the conclusion of the annual general meeting of
the Company in 2014. This authority will not be used to make any political donations as that expression would normally be understood.

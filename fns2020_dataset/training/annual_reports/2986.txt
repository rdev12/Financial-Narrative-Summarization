Chairman’s Statement
W
e have achieved another year of rapid growth.
The mobile phone market has continued to grow
after last year’s recovery, and our position within it has
strengthened signiﬁcantly. Overall Group revenues were
up 27.4% to £2,355.1m and headline earnings per share
rose 37.9% to 9.39p. Statutory earnings per share rose
76.3% to 5.59p and the Board is proposing a ﬁnal
dividend of 1.25p, taking the total for the year to 
1.80p – an increase of 38.5% on 2004. 
Once again the quality of our earnings improved. The
evolution of our differentiated business model, based 
on providing higher value services beyond the point of
sale but with the store portfolio at its heart, has reached
the stage where over 56% of Group contribution comes
from recurring income streams. This is likely to grow
further this year as TalkTalk moves strongly into proﬁt.
At the same time we are absolutely committed to
developing a business that can continue to deliver
attractive rates of proﬁt growth and cash generation
over the long term. This philosophy underpins our
capital expenditure plans for a rapid roll-out of new
stores, increased capacity and efﬁciency in our ﬁxed
line telecoms network, and continued investment in
technology. This year we opened 247 stores – a record
for the Group – and we plan to open a similar number
in the year ahead. We see numerous opportunities to
continue to improve returns for shareholders through
reinvestment in existing and new businesses.
As we announced in April 2005, I will be stepping down
from the Board at the AGM in July after three years as
Chairman. It has been a great honour to serve the Group
and I have enjoyed every minute. The business has
come a long way and it has enormous potential. John
Gildersleeve, who has served on the Board as a Non-
Executive Director since the IPO in 2000, has agreed 
to become Chairman in my place, and his enormous
experience will be an invaluable asset in steering the
Group through its next exciting phase of growth. 
In summary, my last year as Chairman has been the
most successful in the Group’s short history. We have
put substantial distance between ourselves and our
competitors in our core Retail operations and in TalkTalk.

programme of investment in the last 12 months and
continuing over the coming years will further strengthen
Carphone Warehouse’s competitive position. 
We value our human capital most highly of all because
ultimately it is our people that differentiate us from our
peers. Their continued commitment and loyalty to the
Group are outstanding and I am very honoured to thank
all our employees for their substantial contributions.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
I
t has been another very good year for The Carphone
Warehouse. Our excellent ﬁnancial performance stems
from our continued investment in growing our existing
businesses and our ability to identify and exploit new
commercial opportunities both through our existing asset
base and via acquisition. We are committed to long-term
value creation, through the development of a portfolio of
related businesses and services that can deliver attractive
and sustainable growth in earnings and dividends. Our
track record speaks for itself and the more detailed
analysis of our strategy that follows demonstrates that our
plans for the future are clear, exciting and achievable.
Developing a broad-based telecoms group
Our strategy remains essentially consistent with that
outlined in last year’s Annual Report and is built on
three core objectives:
• To continue to grow market share in all our
geographical markets both by investing in new 
store openings and by generating like-for-like 
growth from our existing estate and developing
additional sales channels;
• To maximise the lifetime value of our customers, 
both by providing a level of service that encourages
repeat business, and by identifying relevant new
products and services where we have a sustainable
competitive advantage over other suppliers; and
• To grow our business-to-business ﬁxed line operations
organically and through acquisition, and to invest in
our network to provide an increasing range of
communications services.
Before reporting on progress in each of these areas in
more detail, it is worth highlighting how closely integrated
the different elements of our strategy really are.
Without our stores and our market share, we would not
be able to provide such consistent levels of service and
value to our customers; without our ﬁxed line network
and its business trafﬁc, we would not enjoy such a
competitive advantage in the provision of residential
services; and without the combination of our mobile
network relationships, our stores and our ﬁxed line
network, we would not have been able to launch a new
service such as Mobile World. Sustainable competitive
advantage does not come from any of these assets in
their own right, but from their unique combination.
Growing our retail presence
At the start of the year we aimed to open 200 new
stores across Europe, in a concerted drive to build on
our substantial retail platform and become a more
signiﬁcant player in all of our markets. By the year end
we had succeeded in opening a record 247 stores, net
of closures. In our two biggest retail markets, the UK and
Spain, we opened 92 stores and 75 stores respectively. 
We continue to generate a very attractive return on 
new store openings, comfortably in excess of our two-
year payback hurdle. Our return on investment on
stores opened since 2002 has consistently been over
60%. Taking into account the lifetime value of Insurance,
Ongoing ARPU share and TalkTalk proﬁts, the return 
on investment is in excess of 140%. However, we also
enjoy other, broader effects of building our presence,
such as the growing handset purchasing beneﬁts that
our increasing scale gives us, and our improving
position as a key partner of the mobile networks in 
all our markets. 
We intend to continue this strategy of rapid physical
expansion into the new ﬁnancial year, and have plans 
to open at least a further 250 stores by March 2006.
Once again, the UK and Spain will represent the
majority of new openings, but we see signiﬁcant
expansion opportunities in all our markets. In particular,
the success of our German business since the
acquisition of Hutchison Telecommunications in 
June 2003 has given us conﬁdence to expand 
our operations in that market, which represents a
signiﬁcant long-term opportunity.
We are developing a portfolio of related
businesses and services that can deliver
attractive and sustainable growth in
earnings and dividends
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200
5 KEY TARGETS
further development of broadband, and the introduction
of line rental, will both be key strategic initiatives in the
coming year, and central to our aim of becoming a mass
market provider of telecoms services to the home. We
have set a long-term target of 2 million voice customers
in the UK by March 2008, and expect to have 100,000-
150,000 broadband customers by March 2006.
On the mobile side, we have recently renewed our
strategic focus on our MVNO strategy. During the year
we launched a virtual network in France, Breizh Mobile
– the ﬁrst service of its kind in that country. We have
cut our tariffs aggressively on Fresh, our UK virtual
network, and intend to remain the price leader in the
discount segment of the market. In April 2005, we
launched Mobile World, a highly innovative mobile
service offering international tariffs that compete head-
on with the cheapest available ﬁxed line international
tariffs. The initial response to the launch has exceeded
our expectations and we are in the process of
expanding its distribution, as planned, into thousands
of third-party outlets across the UK.
Growing our business-to-business fixed line operations
Opal has consolidated well on its outstanding year 
of growth last year. The business mix has improved
signiﬁcantly towards directly-managed customers and
trafﬁc growth has continued to be strong. Excluding
TalkTalk trafﬁc, minutes carried rose by 20.9% year-on-
year to 5.45 billion. We also began to consolidate the
smaller end of the alternative carrier market, acquiring 
a number of resellers during the year.
We are excited about the ongoing growth prospects 
for Opal, with its continued strong focus on sales and
marketing. We intend to grow the Opal business both
by winning new customers and by broadening the 
range of services we provide to existing customers. 
We launched line rental successfully this year and 
will extend its roll-out in the coming year, while also
providing DSL-based broadband services for the ﬁrst
time. In addition, we believe that there is strong demand
from our business customer base for mobile services,
and we will invest in the coming year in growing our
corporate mobile proposition to meet that demand.
Maximising customer lifetime value
Since before our IPO ﬁve years ago, we have been
looking at ways to broaden our business model by
introducing new products and services where we 
can add value both to our customers and our mobile
network partners, and improve the quality and visibility
of our earnings. With 56.1% of Group contribution this
year coming from recurring sources, the ﬁnancial case
for this strategy is clear. At the same time, we have
achieved compound annual growth in these recurring
proﬁt streams of 47.4% over the last ﬁve years.
We have always operated on the basic premise that if
we provide a good service for our customers, they are
more likely to reward us with their loyalty. Similarly, if we
can demonstrate good customer traction to the mobile
network operators, we become more of a value-added
partner to them rather than simply a recruitment channel.
This has allowed us to structure customer management
agreements with a number of networks in the UK and
France, and to share in the ongoing value of the
customers we recruit via revenue-sharing agreements.
More recently we have launched residential ﬁxed line
services. Within just two years, we have made TalkTalk
in the UK the clear number one alternative to BT and
now take up to 50% of all customers who leave BT
each month. TalkTalk UK has moved into proﬁtability
already and will be a major driver of Group proﬁts
growth over the medium term.
We have been very active this year in evolving our 
ﬁxed line strategy. TalkTalk has now been launched 
in France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland, and we 
have moved into Ireland and Belgium since the year
end. Our UK business launched a very competitive
broadband service in November 2004, and the
customer response has comfortably exceeded our
expectations. We are now reviewing our options to
assess the most effective way to build a signiﬁcant 
and proﬁtable broadband business while continuing to
deliver outstanding value to our broadband customers.
Looking ahead, we see numerous opportunities to build
on the platform we have created by providing additional
services to our customers. On the ﬁxed line side, the

Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued
Everything that our business-to-business and
residential ﬁxed line operations can achieve is reliant 
on the technical excellence and outstanding efﬁciency
of the Opal network. During the year, the build-out 
into BT’s local exchange network was completed,
maximising the cost efﬁciency of carrying calls over 
our network. This year we plan to add further capacity
and to adapt the network for future integration into 
BT’s 21st Century Network. Through these avenues,
we are preparing our network for continued strong
growth in trafﬁc, and for the further move towards
corporate data products.
Outlook
The business has never been in better shape. The
markets in which we operate are very attractive.
Continued intense competition between mobile
networks translates into compelling offers for our
customers. We expect further competition over the
medium term as networks seek to migrate customers
to their 3G platforms and more MVNOs enter the
market. The handset market is vibrant, with more
models than ever before due to be released in the 
next 12 months and a number of new manufacturers
seeking to gain a foothold in the European market. 
In response to these excellent market conditions, 
the acceleration in the expansion of our retail platform
will continue into this ﬁnancial year, as outlined above.
This feeds through into strong growth prospects across
the whole of the Distribution division. Although the
current weakness in UK consumer spending has been
well documented, we believe the dynamics of mobile
phone retailing are materially different from the sale of
other consumer goods. This, in addition to our diversiﬁed
and service-orientated proposition and our European
platform, gives us some insulation from the consumer
economic environment.
On the ﬁxed line side, we have now proved that
TalkTalk has all the ingredients to become the major
alternative force in UK residential communications, and
further regulatory change over the next year should
allow us to move to the next level in terms of the scale
of our operations and the range of services we offer.
The investment we are making in the Opal network 
will continue to maximise the value we achieve from
providing services to homes and businesses, and
extend the range of those services. Outside the UK, 
we will invest further in building our existing customer
bases and entering new ﬁxed line markets.
The outlook for our mobile services operations is 
very promising. Our German service provision 
business, The Phone House Telecom, has signiﬁcantly
outperformed our expectations and we will continue 
to invest in growing the base strongly. Our MVNO
strategy is gaining pace and reﬂects the true
entrepreneurial roots of the Group: identifying and
exploiting market niches while using our existing 
assets in innovative new ways.
We ask a lot of our employees and every year they
respond to the challenges we set them. This year,
despite no major acquisitions, a further 2,000 people
have joined The Carphone Warehouse, taking the total
number of employees to over 12,000. We are very
pleased to welcome all the new joiners and extend 
our thanks to all of our employees for their exceptional
service in the last twelve months.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank
Hans Snook for his valuable contribution to the
development of the Group during his three years as
Chairman. We have been very lucky to beneﬁt from 
his knowledge and guidance over that time. In turn, 
I am delighted to welcome John Gildersleeve as our
new Chairman. John knows the business well, having
already served on the Board for ﬁve years, and I know
his rich commercial experience will be invaluable to 
the Group as we enter this next phase of growth.

outbound call centres, print media and website). 
In the key metric of subscription connections, we
achieved 52 week growth of 14.8% to 2.77m. This
continued strong performance was a result of enduring
competition between mobile networks and an attractive
range of new, richly-featured handsets, allied to our
unique market proposition. We have now achieved
compound annual growth of 20.3% in subscription
connections over the last 5 years.
Our pre-pay business had a very good year, with 52
week connections up 28.1% to 3.23m. The combination
of falling prices on entry level handsets, and increased
network interest in the pre-pay segment, drove demand.
Our SIM-free sales recovered well from the previous
year, rising 21.4% to 0.51m.
We opened 306 new stores during the year and 
closed 59. The total number of stores increased 
from 1,214 at March 2004 to 1,461 at March 2005.
The total includes 70 franchise stores (March 2004: 26).
Including franchises, average selling space increased
by 14.3% to 75,619 sqm (2004: 66,170 sqm), 
and sales per square metre were up by 7.3% to
£15,343. Excluding franchises, average selling 
space increased by 12.3% to 73,399 sqm 
(2004: 65,369 sqm) and sales per square metre
increased by 9.2% to £15,807.

way, and delivered 52 week connections growth of
40.4%. Our Spanish management team also succeeded
in opening 75 new stores during the period to take the
total to 239, and is conﬁdent of achieving further strong
growth in the portfolio over the coming year. The scale
of our Spanish operation is now feeding through 
into material contributions, not only from a Retail
perspective, but also through Insurance and 
Ongoing ARPU share income. 
Our French Retail operations experienced more
challenging conditions as the market continued to
display subdued levels of network competition.
Nevertheless, connections were up 16.4%, which
represents a creditable performance in the market
context. We opened 9 new stores during the period,
taking the total French portfolio to 185. In the coming
year we are putting a renewed effort into expanding 
our presence with a marked acceleration in new store
openings. In addition, we are conﬁdent that the market
environment will improve, with the entry of MVNOs 
and closer regulatory involvement.
In our other major Retail markets, Sweden and The
Netherlands, we beneﬁted from intense competition
between the network operators. The Swedish business
generated connections growth of 29.9% and opened
11 new stores, taking the base to 69 stores. Dutch
connections were up 11.2% and the portfolio increased
by 29 to 116 stores. 24 of these openings were
franchises, whose connections are excluded for
reporting purposes.
Connections growth across all our other markets,
incorporating Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Portugal 
and Switzerland, was 29.8%. Our Belgian business
Total Retail revenues grew by 22.6% and gross proﬁt
by 16.9%. Like-for-like, after stripping out the impact of
new store openings and the 53rd week, revenues grew
by 8.8% and gross proﬁt by 5.0%. The increase in
revenues was driven both by the strong connections
growth through the year, and an increase in average
revenues per connection, which rose by 1.0% as 
the average value of handsets increased.
Average cash gross proﬁt per connection fell by 3.6%
from £56.0 to £54.0, in line with our expectations.
Subscription gross proﬁt per connection held up very
well but the anticipated competition from other retailers
in the pre-pay market, where there are fewer barriers 
to entry, saw pre-pay gross proﬁt per connection fall.
Nonetheless, the signiﬁcant uplift in volumes that we
experienced delivered a much higher level of overall
proﬁtability from pre-pay connections than in the
previous year and the margin trend improved in the
second half, with gross proﬁt per connection on both
subscription and pre-pay rising year-on-year.
Contribution (see note 10) to the ﬁnancial statements
from Retail grew by 22.2% to £101.4m. The contribution
margin fell from 8.8% to 8.7%. However, the ratio
between contribution and gross proﬁt, which gives a
more meaningful indication of cost efﬁciency given the
variability of revenues per connection, improved from
29.4% to 30.7%. Overall Retail direct costs grew by
14.7%, driven by the greater store base and like-for-like
growth in commission payments to our sales consultants
in the buoyant market. Within these ﬁgures, rent costs
increased by only 10.5%, as we beneﬁted from a wider
geographic spread.
In the UK, our store portfolio increased from 509 stores
to 601 stores. We have continued our strategy of
identifying sites on arterial routes and in retail parks, but
at the same time we have had great success in opening
stores in smaller towns. This new type of location will
provide us with ample opportunities to continue to grow
our UK portfolio over the medium term, and we are
targeting a further 100 openings in the next 12 months.
Our businesses outside the UK continued to deliver
very encouraging growth. Once again, Spain led the

Distribution Division continued
continues to perform exceptionally well and represents
a signiﬁcant turnaround from the loss-making position
two years ago, and our Irish and Portuguese operations
consolidated their position as the leading independent
distributors in their respective markets. In Germany, our
retail operations primarily support The Phone House
Telecom service provision business, which is discussed
in more detail below.
The Swiss Retail business reported a small loss for the
year. However, we have made several changes to the
management team and have focused on improving our
competitive position, and the business is now trading
back in line with budget, with a strong recovery
forecast in the current year.
Online connections increased by 53.7% year-on-year 
to 0.47m on a 52 week basis. Revenues were 
£128.2m (2004: £64.5m) and contribution was 
£7.7m (2004: £4.5m). The UK continues to be the
engine of growth for our Online business, enhanced 
by a full-year contribution from E2Save, and very strong
growth in the off-the-page and web segments of the
mobile phone market. As highlighted last year, we have
begun to explore direct channels in other geographical
markets, but at this stage these are not material to
overall Online performance. Just before the year end,
we acquired One Stop Phone Shop, another strong 
off-the-page brand in the UK market.
Insurance
The Group offers a range of insurance products to 
its retail customers, providing protection against the
replacement cost of a lost, stolen or broken handset,
as well as cover for any outstanding contractual liability
and the cost of any calls made if a mobile phone falls
into the wrong hands. Insurance is a core element of
the Group’s customer proposition.
Our Insurance customer base continued to grow
strongly during the year. Overall the customer base grew
by 24.3% to 1.65m. The UK base grew by 22.7% to
1.02m and the non-UK base grew by 26.8% to 0.63m.
The non-UK base now represents 38.2% of the total.
Insurance revenues grew 29.7% to £102.0m 
(2004: £78.6m) and contribution increased by 25.0% 
to £35.0m (2004: £28.0m). Margins remained relatively
steady, as a gradual decrease in claims rates, driven 
by increased public awareness about mobile phone
crime, was offset by a rising average claims cost as
higher value handsets became more widely owned. 
We continue to see good growth prospects in our
Insurance business as we build out the store portfolio
across Europe. Our third-party business, acting as
underwriter to other organisations offering mobile
phone insurance, is still in its infancy but provides a
further source of long-term growth. 
Ongoing
Ongoing represents the share in customer call spend
(or ARPU) we receive as a result of connecting
subscription customers to certain networks. We are
typically contractually entitled to our share of revenue
for as long as a customer is active, so this income
stream represents an important element of our overall
commercial agreement with many networks.
Ongoing revenues grew by 18.2% to £46.5m during
the year (2004: £39.4m). This performance reﬂects the
sustained strong subscription connections growth over
the last two years. We continue to view Ongoing share
as a vital element of our network agreements, as it
provides us with excellent visibility of earnings and
clearly aligns our interests with those of the networks.

T
he Group’s Telecoms Services operations are split
into two businesses, Mobile and Fixed. The Mobile
business encompasses our facilities management
(‘FM’) operations, managing customers on behalf of
networks, and our own customers, including our virtual
network, Fresh, and our German service provision
(‘SP’) business, The Phone House Telecom. The Fixed
business primarily comprises Opal, our business-to-
business network, and TalkTalk, our residential service,
both in the UK. We also operate a number of smaller
ﬁxed line businesses across Europe. 
Telecoms Services revenues grew by 45.0% year-on-
year to £804.0m (2004: £554.5m), with good growth
across all major business lines. EBIT increased by
50.0% to £22.5m (2004: £15.0m). The EBIT margin
increased slightly from 2.7% to 2.8% as strong top line
growth was offset by continued investment in recruiting
customers to TalkTalk and building support functions to
create a robust platform for long-term growth.
Mobile
Overall we achieved revenue growth of 23.5% to
£377.7m (2004: £305.9m), with contribution rising
9.3% to £25.7m (2004: £23.5m). 
The Phone House Telecom, our German SP business,
performed very strongly. The rate of customer acquisition
accelerated in the second half and by March 2005 we
had 0.86m customers, of whom 0.64m were on two-
year subscriptions. We completed the integration of our
German retail operations and are now focused on
growing our distribution network, both by opening new
stores and by expanding our dealer channel. Revenues
rose by 41.3% to £298.3m compared to the ten-months
ﬁgure from the previous year, with contribution up by
52.8% to £16.4m on the same basis. The contribution
margin increased from 5.1% to 5.5% as the business
beneﬁted from strong competition between the
incumbent networks.
Total revenues from the rest of our Mobile businesses
fell 16.2% to £79.4m, while contribution fell 27.3% 
to £9.3m. The fall in revenues was the result of the
migration of Sainsbury’s customers from an SP to an
FM arrangement, and a lower average base at Fresh.

The Telecoms Services division
comprises a range of network
and support services to business
and residential telecoms customers 14
Telecoms Services Division continued
The decline in contribution includes a start-up loss from
our French MVNO of £1.0m.
We continued to grow our UK FM business with
customers managed on behalf of O2 and Vodafone up
by 19.7% to 0.67m (2004: 0.56m). Growth is driven by
new subscription customers signed up to these networks
in our stores. The key drivers of our FM businesses are
the number of customers under management, and the
efﬁciency with which we manage our call centres and
bad debt. We continue to manage 0.6m customers in
France on behalf of Orange and SFR. 
Our other own customer operations, predominantly
Fresh, our UK virtual network, did not make a material
ﬁnancial contribution during the year. However, we have
recently taken a more proactive approach to our MVNO
strategy, with a number of initiatives that will support
long-term growth in this business unit. In July 2004 
we launched Breizh Mobile, an MVNO in France
addressing the low-penetration Brittany region with 
a locally-tailored offering. In the last quarter, we
aggressively promoted our Fresh proposition to
maintain our status as the best value pre-pay offer 
in the UK market. Finally, we announced just after the
year end the launch of Mobile World, a unique pre-pay
service which offers very attractive rates to international
destinations, designed to compete directly with the
ﬁxed line pre-paid calling card market.
Fixed
Our ﬁxed line operations continued their strong
momentum from the previous year. Total revenues 
were £426.3m, up 71.5% on the previous year, and
contribution was £33.7m, a rise of 71.7%.
Total revenues from business operations were
£267.3m. Opal, the network provider for all of 
our ﬁxed line activity in the UK, generated revenues 
of £237.7m, an increase of 8.8% (2004: £218.4m).
Revenues in the second half were, as expected,
adversely affected by the regulatory cuts to mobile
termination rates. With the cost of terminating calls 
on mobile networks falling, we passed on the saving to
our customers, which reduced revenue per minute by
approximately 12% over the second half. Total business
trafﬁc over the network increased by 20.9% to 5.45bn
minutes. Including TalkTalk activity, total trafﬁc increased
by 73.4% to 9.56bn minutes. 
Total contribution from business operations was
£31.5m. Opal contribution was £30.6m, broadly the
same as in 2004. Underlying growth in our direct
channel, where we recruit and manage our own
corporate customers, was very encouraging. However,
we experienced increased price competition in our
reseller channel, and scaled down our low margin
premium rate services during the year. 
We made a number of small reseller acquisitions in the
UK during the year, as the rate of consolidation in the
sector picked up. These acquisitions are attractive
because we are able to improve the margin on customer
trafﬁc immediately by moving the lines onto the Opal
network. Acquisitions also give us ready access to sales
platforms in regions of the UK where we are currently
under-represented. In total these deals added £17.8m of
revenues and £3.0m of contribution to the year’s results.
Xtra, our Spanish ﬁxed line network acquired in March
2004, recorded revenues of £29.6m and contribution 
of £0.9m in its ﬁrst full year in the Group.
Opal’s engineering strategy made further good progress
during the year. We provisioned a further 5 switches,
taking the total to 11. In addition, we completed our
three-year programme of building interconnect into the
BT exchange network, so that by March 2005 over
90% of calls across the Opal network originated and
terminated at the local exchange level. This was
signiﬁcantly ahead of our 75% target and makes Opal
one of the most efﬁcient networks in the UK based on
the costs paid to BT – a call that is originated onto
Opal at the local exchange level is 27% cheaper than 
a call originating at the regional exchange level.
Opal’s network strategy will evolve over the next 12
months in two important ways: ﬁrstly, to add more
capacity through the provisioning of additional switches
and further ﬁbre leases to meet the demands of our
growing business; and secondly, to prepare for the
provision of broadband services and integration to 
BT’s 21st Century Network, which will be key to our
long-term strategy for Opal and TalkTalk.

Our non-UK residential ﬁxed line operations have made
a promising start. The acquisitions of Xtra in Spain and
N Tel in Switzerland in the previous ﬁnancial period have
been successfully integrated into the Group and we
have launched TalkTalk in those two countries, as well
as in France and Germany. At the year end we had
170,000 ﬁxed line customers outside the UK, generating
revenues of £35.4m and contribution of £1.8m. N Tel
continued to be strongly proﬁtable, while we incurred
start-up losses elsewhere. Since the year end we have
launched TalkTalk in Belgium and Ireland, and we expect
a similar overall result from our non-UK TalkTalk
operations in the next 12 months.

Wholesale operations comprise our pre-pay voucher
distribution business, our dealer operations and the
wholesale shipment of trade-in handsets. We are still
aware that European VAT authorities continue to
investigate the recovery of VAT in the industry for
trading activities conducted prior to April 2003. Having
undertaken a detailed internal investigation and taken
advice, we continue to believe that we have no ﬁnancial
exposure to this issue within the ﬁnancial statements.
We are continuing to invest in Opal to maximise its
potential in the business telecoms market. We intend 
to develop and grow a number of new business areas
this year, including line rental, data products, and a
corporate mobile proposition. In addition, we are
launching TalkTalk Business, addressing the small
business market. At the same time, our core voice
business is set for continued growth.
Total residential revenues rose from £30.2m to £159.0m,
and contribution was £2.3m, compared to a loss of
£11.0m last year. Our UK residential ﬁxed line service,
TalkTalk, had an outstanding year. We exceeded our
target of 900,000 customers by March 2005, ﬁnishing
the year with 920,000. TalkTalk UK generated revenues
of £123.6m and became proﬁtable in its second full
year, despite continued heavy investment in marketing
and customer acquisition. In addition, we launched 
a broadband service in the second half of the year 
and recruited nearly 50,000 customers by the year 
end, which was well ahead of our own expectations.
Contribution in the UK was £0.5m, net of £1.4m start-
up losses from our broadband activities, compared to 
a loss of £11.0m in 2004.
We believe that TalkTalk’s competitive position is
strengthening all the time as it gains real scale. This gives
us scope to continue to invest in developing the brand and
recruiting customers aggressively. We intend to introduce
further enhancements to our broadband service during the
year, and will launch a line rental product when the
regulatory environment allows. We expect this to have a
positive impact both on customer recruitment and on
churn, since it allows us to consolidate all of a customer’s
phone bill and terminates the billing relationship with BT.
We have set a target of 2 million residential customers by
March 2008 – equivalent to a 10% share of the UK market.

Financial Performance
Eliminations
Included within Retail revenue is £17.9m of commissions
from the Group’s German SP business (2004: £12.5m).
This revenue is reported within Retail to avoid distortion
of performance.
Exceptional items
There were no exceptional items during the year 
(2004: £6.4m exceptional charge).
Interest and tax
Net interest of £4.8m was payable during the year,
compared to a charge of £4.9m in the prior year.
Signiﬁcant investment in capital expenditure and
acquisitions was ﬁnanced largely out of operating 
cash ﬂow.
The effective tax rate before amortisation and
exceptionals was 19.5% (2004: 22.0%). The tax rate
continued to beneﬁt from the utilisation of tax losses
incurred in earlier years, and the effect of proﬁt within
low tax rate jurisdictions.
Goodwill amortisation
Goodwill of £53.7m arose during the year, principally on
the acquisition of a number of ﬁxed line
telecommunications providers, as detailed in note 15 
to the ﬁnancial statements. The total goodwill
amortisation charge for the year increased by 30.7% 
to £33.2m (2004: £25.4m), reﬂecting the increase in
goodwill over the past two years and a shorter average
amortisation period for a number of recent acquisitions.
Earnings per share (‘EPS’)
Headline EPS was 9.39p (2004: 6.81p). Statutory EPS
was 5.59p (2004: 3.17p).
Cash flow and dividend
At 2 April 2005, the Group had net debt of £68.4m
(2004: £40.6m). During the year the Group generated
cash ﬂow from operations of £143.1m (2004: £102.7m),
and total free cash ﬂow, before acquisitions, new stores,
freehold investments and dividend payments, of £68.2m
(2004: £57.0m).
Cash generation is a prime objective of the Group and
we expect to continue to generate signiﬁcant levels of
free cash ﬂow in the future, allowing us to reinvest in the
growth of the business and to pursue a progressive
dividend policy. We are proposing a ﬁnal dividend of
1.25p per share, taking the total dividend for the ﬁnancial
year to 1.80p, an increase of 38.5% on the prior year,
reﬂecting underlying EPS growth. The ex-dividend date 
is Wednesday 6 July 2005, with a record date of 
Friday 8 July 2005 and an intended payment date 
of Friday 5 August 2005.

Balance sheet
Acquisitions and capital investment during the period
are reﬂected in an increase in ﬁxed assets from
£604.7m to £674.0m year-on-year. Debtors and short-
term creditors also increased substantially from March
2004 to March 2005, reﬂecting acquisitions during the
period, together with growth in turnover of 27.4%.
Short-term investments increased from £10.8m at
March 2004 to £60.5m at March 2005, reﬂecting the
reallocation of funds held by the Group’s insurance
business from cash into bonds and managed funds,
further to its relocation to Dublin last year.
The increase in provisions for liabilities and charges
from £40.2m to £68.0m principally reﬂects an uplift in
the Group’s use of ‘cashback’ and similar promotions,
the anticipated costs of which are provided for on sale.

movements in interest rates will have a limited impact

Accounting policies
The accounting policies applied during the period are
consistent with those applied in the prior year and 
are set out in note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements.
International financial reporting standards
The Group will be required to adopt International
Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the period ending 
1 April 2006. We will continue to assess the impact 
of adopting IFRS on an ongoing basis until then.
Return on capital employed 
Total shareholders’ funds at March 2005 were
£502.9m, compared to £471.8m at March 2004. 
After taking into account average net debt, and
adjusting for goodwill amortisation and goodwill arising
on historic minority acquisitions, the Group generated 
a return on capital employed of 18.7% (2004: 17.6%).
Assuming a weighted average cost of capital for the
period ended 2 April 2005 of 6.9% (2004: 7.1%), this
represents an increase in economic value added from
£37.8m to £54.4m, being 10.5% and 11.8% respectively.
Financing and treasury
The Group’s operations are ﬁnanced by committed
bank facilities, retained proﬁts and equity. During the
period, the Group agreed a new £300m revolving credit
facility to replace the previous £180m facility, which was
due to expire in August 2005. This reﬁnancing also took
advantage of the signiﬁcant reduction in bank loan
margins that occurred during 2004. We also took this
opportunity to renegotiate the terms of the £120m term
loan facility, which was signed in July 2003. The new
facility was arranged by HSBC Bank PLC, ING Bank
NV and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC. The Group
was in compliance with the covenant conditions of both
facilities throughout the period.
Net borrowings peaked late in 2004, in line with the
normal annual cycle as the Group invests in inventory
ahead of the Christmas trading season. The Group
seeks to maintain comfortable headroom on committed
facilities at all times. 
In addition to the revolving credit facility and term loan,
the Group has a number of uncommitted loan facilities,
overdrafts and guarantee lines, all technically repayable
on demand, which enable it to optimise cash
management efﬁciency particularly at times of peak
working capital requirements. 
Funding of our subsidiaries is arranged centrally. All
cross-border funding is provided on an arm’s length
basis and currency risk is hedged using foreign exchange
swaps or currency borrowings, as appropriate, at all
times. Other than through inter-company loans and
capital funding, balance sheet translational risk is not
hedged against adverse movements in exchange rates
and the results of any such movements are taken to
reserves. The Group is exposed to limited cross-border
transactional commitments and where signiﬁcant, these
are hedged at inception using forward currency contracts. 
Treasury policy permits the use of long-term derivative
treasury products for the management of currency and
interest rate risk; however, with the current low levels 
of Group debt, all debt is liable to ﬂoating rate interest.
The interest cover covenant was comfortably exceeded
at the year end and, whilst low levels of debt persist,

Corporate Responsibility
In February 2005 we hosted an auction to help raise
funds for Get Connected. Held at BAFTA, Piccadilly
and hosted by Charles Dunstone and Andrew Harrison,
the event was supported by suppliers and partners 
and raised nearly £70,000 for the charity.
Business Action on Homelessness
CPW supports the Business Action on Homelessness
(‘BAOH’) programme, offering two-week work
experience placements to people who have been
homeless. Most are now in hostels and their placement
is part of a recovery process to give them the experience
and conﬁdence to look at long-term employment
and prevent “revolving door” homelessness. The 
work placements vary and aim to give participants 
a broad view of the business, looking at different
aspects of the operation. We also give practical help 
in respect of interview techniques and producing 
CVs. Of the 12 placements over the past two years,
three have subsequently been employed by the
Company and are working in our Acton Support
Centre. We support the programme nationally and
Richard Smelt, the Group’s HR Director, is on the
BAOH Planning Board. 
Comic Relief
The Acton Support Centre acted as a call centre for
Comic Relief’s Sport Relief event in July 2004 and 
took £80,000 worth of donations for the charity. 
50 employees, including Andrew Harrison, UK CEO,
and Chris Murton, Managing Director of CPW Online,
volunteered their Saturday night to take donations 
from the general public. Due to the success of an
internally developed bespoke data input system the
Comic Relief team visited the Acton ofﬁce after the
event when they were researching models for their 
own online data processing procedures.
After the success of this night Carphone Warehouse
decided to expand operations for Red Nose Day in
March 2005 and recruited 200 volunteers over two
sites to act once more as a call centre. The night
helped to raise a grand total of over £175,000 in
donations taken in response to the Comic Relief
television broadcast. Between the Acton and

he Group has a strong track record as a
responsible employer, consumer and distributor. 
We divide our corporate responsibility activities into 
two categories: our charity, community and employee
activities; and our social and regulatory responsibilities.
There are separate committees composed of
executives from across the Group that manage our
involvement in these areas. We have a dedicated
Corporate Social Responsibility manager who co-
ordinates strategy and actions across both elements,
and in the past year Martin Dawes, a Non-Executive
Director, has sponsored activities at Board level. 
A new Non-Executive Director will be our sponsor
following the retirement of Martin Dawes at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting.
Charity, community and employee activities
In September 2004 The Carphone Warehouse
launched a new charity partnership with Barnardo’s 
and Get Connected with an aim of raising £500,000
over two years to help children and young adults
throughout the UK. In addition, a percentage of the
funds raised goes towards supporting small and local
charities either put forward by employees or situated 
in a community close to a CPW store or non-retail
operation. Funds are being raised in many different
ways from in-store activities to overseas treks to 
mobile phone recycling.
Get Connected
The Carphone Warehouse has had a relationship 
with Get Connected for ﬁve years and has now 
made it a beneﬁciary of the Carphone Warehouse
Charity Partnership. In addition, we provide Get
Connected with its accommodation, phone lines 
and IT support, and offer volunteers the opportunity 
to earn extra holiday or take matched company 
hours for giving up their time to help out. In 2004, 
in response to the expansion of the charity, we
relocated them to new premises in central London,
providing newly renovated and fully equipped ofﬁces,
doubling the capacity for volunteers and employees
and providing a meeting room and facilities for 
disabled volunteers.

Tsunami
On 17 January 2005 the UK’s commercial radio stations
came together for the ﬁrst time to create UK RadioAid
to raise money for the victims of the tsunami that
devastated hundreds of thousands of lives on 
26 December 2004. The Carphone Warehouse
sponsored the prime 8am – 9am slot, hosted by 
Chris Evans. Listeners who sent the word ‘phone’ 
via text message during the show had £1.50 donated
to the tsunami appeal on their behalf and this was 
then matched by us.
Employees across the Group worked hard to raise
money for the appeal, donating out of their payroll 
and performing stunts up and down the country such
as shaving their heads and bathing in baked beans.
Donations from employees and in store contributions
from the general public in the UK were matched by
CPW, resulting in a donation of over £200,000 to the
Disasters Emergency Committee.
Employees
As an organisation we are aware that our employees
are our greatest asset and as a growing and
developing Group have to ensure that our values and
the treatment of our employees are not compromised.
There are many ways in which our HR department
constantly examine and address the work environment,
from stores to repair centres and contact centres, but
the best way to ﬁnd out how satisﬁed our employees
are is by asking them directly.
In 2001, Backchat was launched, offering an
opportunity for all employees at every level of the
business to express how they felt about all aspects 
of the Group, their roles within it and their personal
development, through a conﬁdential survey. In the ﬁrst
year, 33% of employees completed the survey but with
re-examination and assessment of the content and
presentation of the survey year-on-year, we have made
it more and more accessible, and the survey in 2004
saw a 92.7% response rate. This massive uptake
allows us as an organisation to undertake open and
honest self-analysis. 
There are many areas where we are pleased to 
see sustained and improved feedback year-on-year.
Highlights of this year’s survey include:
• 87% of people are proud to work for CPW, 
an increase of 6% on the previous year;
• 81% feel that CPW is a fun place to work; and
• 83% feel that the training and development they
have received in the last 12 months has been
valuable and worthwhile.
The year-on-year results have shown a steady
improvement and not one area saw a negative trend 
in the 2004 survey. This analysis allows us to continue
our work in areas where we are doing well, but more
importantly, to focus on addressing areas that are not
regarded so favourably. This year’s results showed
score improvements from 9% to 18% across the least
favourable scores, showing that targeted dedication
and listening to our employees allows us to improve 
the work environment.
As well as the targets we can set ourselves, we are 
able to use the data against external benchmarks and
track our performance against other major retailers.

Areas where we hold the greatest difference against 
the average in the retail sector include being personally
valued by the organisation, making good use of skills 
and abilities, fair pay, and being proud to work for 
the organisation.

Regulatory and social responsibilities
We continue to operate in a relatively low impact
industry and our meetings and discussions with 
Group businesses on social, environmental and 
ethical (‘SEE’) matters give us conﬁdence both that 
the SEE risks to our business are relatively low, and
also that controls are in place to ensure compliance
with new laws and regulations where necessary. We
remain very much abreast of key issues and business
risks arising in these areas (as outlined below). Over 
the coming year we will undertake to put the SEE
committee on a more formal footing and renew our
Board representation.
Below we have identiﬁed the key SEE-related risks
currently affecting the Group. The list is not intended to
be exhaustive but to address those risks that are most
material to the business.
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive
(‘WEEE Directive’)
In March 2005, the UK Government announced its
intention to transpose the WEEE Directive into law 
by the summer of 2005. The producer responsibility
obligations and the take-back obligations on retailers
and distributors are planned to commence in January
2006. Our purchasing teams across the Group are
working with our Group legal department and our
suppliers to ensure compliance within this timetable.
Disability discrimination
We are constantly reviewing and improving our websites
and stores to provide greater accessibility for our
disabled customers. We have a special needs section
on our retail website (www.carphonewarehouse.com),
and in June 2004 we launched dedicated phone
numbers for our customers. In addition, we now
provide bills in a number of formats for the visually-
impaired. During the year our corporate website
(www.cpwplc.com) was also extensively overhauled 
to comply with the Royal National Institute of the Blind’s
“See It Right” accessibility criteria and priority level 1
criteria of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines.
The Disability Discrimination Act came into force in the
UK in October 2004. Over 90% of our UK stores are
now fully accessible for wheelchair users. To assist
customers, we have published a list of stores with access
difﬁculties on our website, with suggested alternative
stores in the area. Induction loops have been provided
to all stores, and drop counters are now ﬁtted in new
stores as standard. Stores also have customer care
packs containing magnifying glasses and easy-grip pens. 
We remain fully committed to the principle that 
disabled customers should as far as possible be 
able to obtain goods and services in just the same 
way as any other customer, and we continue to
monitor the situation to improve access facilities
wherever possible.
Fighting mobile crime
In 2003 The Carphone Warehouse spearheaded the
joint industry ‘Immobilise’ campaign, with the aim of
encouraging customers to report their lost or stolen
handset, so that it could be blacklisted. In January
2005 a second ‘Immobilise’ campaign was launched,
this time asking customers to register their lost or
stolen phones on Immobilise.com for the best chance
of getting it back.

In the UK, network operators have collectively
developed a code of practice for the self-regulation of
age-sensitive content on mobiles. As part of this, they
will appoint an independent classiﬁcation body to
provide a framework for classifying commercial content
that is unsuitable for customers under the age of 18. 
Promoting safe driving
We followed our successful ‘Hang up or Go Handsfree’
awareness campaign in December 2003 with a further
campaign a year after the new driving legislation
coming into force. In December 2004 we conducted
customer research to ﬁnd out which area in the UK 
had the highest and lowest awareness of the new
legislation. We then used the results to target areas
where awareness of the legislation was low. We also
created a guide to help customers choose the right
handsfree solution and now have over 60 dedicated 
car kit installation centres across the UK.
As a member of Mobile Industry Crime Action Forum,
we also endorse the work of MEND, the Mobile
Equipment National Database, that provides recovery
and assistance with an aim to reunite owners with 
their property. The Carphone Warehouse is leading 
the way in supporting this new campaign as the 
ﬁrst UK retailer to automatically register all of its
insurance customers.
Mobile phones and health
The Carphone Warehouse continues to lead the
industry in providing customers with all of the
information on mobile phones and health concerns 
so that they can make informed decisions. An
independent and extensive health fact sheet is 
available in our stores and on our website, with the
11th edition due for publication in the next few months.
We also continue to list speciﬁc absorption rates 
for every handset in our buyers’ guide every month 
and again on our website.

Introduction
The Board of Directors recognises the importance of high standards of
corporate governance. This Report and the Remuneration Report set out
on pages 26 to 31 explain that the Company has complied during the
period with the principles contained in the new Combined Code on
corporate governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
July 2003 (the ‘Code’) except as stated to the contrary in this Report. 
In accordance with Listing Rule 12.43A as varied by the instrument issued
by the Financial Services Authority in October 2004, the relevant parts 
of this Report have been reviewed by the Auditors and their opinion is
contained in the Independent Auditor’s Report on page 33.
Board of Directors
Composition of the Board
During the period there were ﬁve Executive Directors and ﬁve Non-Executive
Directors (including the Non-Executive Chairman). Biographies of each of
the Directors, their responsibilities and principal Board Committee
memberships are set out on page 22. 
On 14 April 2005 the Company announced that with effect from the Annual
General Meeting on 28 July 2005 (‘AGM’), Hans Roger Snook will stand
down as Non-Executive Chairman, that John Gildersleeve will become
Non-Executive Chairman and that David Goldie will become an Executive
Director. On 19 May 2005 the Company announced that Martin Dawes
would stand down as a Non-Executive Director with effect from the AGM.
The effect of all of these changes on the composition of the Board and its
committees will be reported on in next year’s Annual Report. Charles
Dunstone is the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Sir Brian Pitman is the Senior
Independent Director and David Ross is Deputy Chairman. 
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the ﬁrst Annual General
Meeting following appointment and thereafter to re-election at least every three
years. Each Executive Director has a service contract that can be terminated
by either the Company or the Director on twelve-months’ notice or less. 
The Non-Executive Directors, apart from Hans Roger Snook, have three-
year periods of appointment, the terms of which are substantially in the
same format as suggested by the Code, with three-month notice periods
and no compensation for loss of ofﬁce. Hans Roger Snook has a service
contract which can be terminated by either party on twelve-months’ notice
with no provision for compensation on early termination. As stated above,
Hans Roger Snook will stand down as a Director of the Company with
effect from the AGM such that a notice period of less than twelve months
will have applied and no other compensation for loss of ofﬁce will be paid.
Further details on each Director’s remuneration including the dates of their
contracts with the Company are set out in the Remuneration Report on
pages 26 to 31. 
All the Non-Executive Directors, except Hans Roger Snook, are considered
by the Board to be independent. Hans Roger Snook is not considered to be
independent as he holds 1 million share options in the Company. Four out of
the nine Directors, excluding the Chairman, are independent. Whilst the Code
states that at least half the Board excluding the Chairman should consist of
independent Directors, the Board believes that the current composition of
four out of nine is sufﬁcient to produce a well balanced Board in terms of
size, balance of skills and experience, and independence in character and
judgement, to meet the requirements of the Group’s business.
Board meetings
The Board meets at least six times a year, with additional meetings as
required. The Board met seven times formally during the period (including 
a strategy day). With the exception of Sir Brian Pitman, who was absent for
the meetings held on 28 July 2004 and 28 October 2004 because he had
other meetings ﬁxed for such dates before the Company had arranged
such meetings, all of the Directors attended these meetings.
The Company Secretary ensures that all Board papers are sent out to 
non-attending Directors and that, where possible, any comments they have
are received beforehand so that they can be expressed at the meeting.
Operation of the Board
The wide range of experience and expertise of the Non-Executive Directors,
combined with the skill sets of the Executive Directors, provides vast
experience of mobile and ﬁxed line telecommunications and general
business experience, strong personal skills and independence of thought
and perspective. 
The overriding responsibility of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial and
responsible leadership to the Group within a framework of prudent and
effective controls. These allow for the key issues and risks surrounding the
business to be assessed and managed. The Board determines the overall
strategic direction for the Group, reviews management performance and
ensures that the necessary ﬁnancial and human resources are in place to
enable the Group to meet its objectives. The Board is comfortable that the
necessary controls and resources exist within the Group to enable these
responsibilities to be met.
The Board ensures that the Directors, and in particular the Non-Executive
Directors, develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders
about the Company. The Company regularly communicates with major
shareholders and has a dedicated internal investor relations department.
Brieﬁngs on market activity, together with the views of shareholders and
analysts on the Company, are also regularly provided to the Board.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the roles of the
Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. There are also documented
schedules of matters reserved to the Board and matters delegated to
Committees of the Board. Such reserved matters include decisions on
strategic and policy issues, the approval of published ﬁnancial statements
and major acquisitions and disposals, authority levels for expenditure,
treasury and risk management policies. Strategic and policy issues are
reviewed annually at a combined Board and senior executive strategy day.
Performance evaluation
During the period the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of Directors
was reviewed. The Board, and each individual Director, also undertook
performance evaluations. Using the Higgs ‘Suggestions for Good Practice’ as
guidance, the individual Directors initially completed separate questionnaires.
The results were compiled and analysed by the Company Secretary, who
prepared reports as appropriate to the Chairman, the Senior Independent
Director, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and to the Board as a whole. The areas
covered included the role of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, the
Board and the Board Committees, preparation for and performance at
meetings, the effectiveness of each Director, leadership, culture and corporate
governance. The results were then considered by the Board as a speciﬁc item
of business. These exercises or similar ones will be carried out each year.
Following such performance evaluation the Chairman conﬁrms that all those
Non-Executive Directors seeking re-election at the AGM continue to be
effective and demonstrate a commitment to the role, including having time
to attend all necessary meetings and to carry out other appropriate duties.
The Chairman also convened a formal meeting of the Non-Executive
Directors to assess the performance of the Board in the absence of the
Executive Directors.

Corporate Governance continued
The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200
5
The Senior Independent Director also met with the Non-Executive
Directors, in the absence of the Chairman, to assess the Chairman’s
effectiveness (having taken soundings beforehand from the Executive
Directors). The Chairman had no other signiﬁcant commitments during 
the period that would have affected his performance in his role.
External appointments
The Board supports Executive Directors taking up Non-Executive
Directorships as part of their continued development, and the Board
believes that this will ultimately beneﬁt the Company. Further details 
are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 31.
Board Committees
There are three principal Board Committees: Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination. The Committees are provided with sufﬁcient resources via 
the Company Secretary and, where necessary, have direct access to
independent professional advisers to undertake their duties.
Audit Committee
During the period the Committee comprised three independent Non-Executive
Directors, Adrian Martin (Chairman), John Gildersleeve and Sir Brian Pitman.
Adrian Martin is deemed by the Board to be the Committee member with
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. All of the Committee members have
extensive commercial experience. The Committee met formally four times during
the period. All members of the Committee were present at each meeting, except
Sir Brian Pitman who was absent from the meetings on 13 May 2004 and
28 October 2004 because he had to attend other meetings that had been
ﬁxed before the Company had arranged the meetings. The Company
Secretary ensured that he received all relevant papers in advance and that any
comments he had were communicated to the meeting. The Chairman of the
Committee updates the Board on any signiﬁcant issues that may have arisen
at the Board meeting following each Committee meeting. Martin Dawes was
appointed to the Committee on 27 January 2005, from which point the
Committee comprised four independent Non-Executive Directors. 
During the period, all the requirements of the Code in respect of the
Committee were met. The work undertaken by the Committee is described
within the following sections of this Report.
The Group’s Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and other senior management attend
Committee meetings by invitation of the Committee. Representatives of the
Group’s external auditors and the Group Director of Risk also attend these
meetings by invitation of the Committee. The external and internal auditors
have direct access to the Committee during formal meetings and time is
set aside for them to have private discussions with the Committee, in the
absence of management.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which are available on request from
the Company Secretary and are published on the Company’s website,
comply with the Code. During the period, the formal calendar of items
considered at each Audit Committee meeting within each annual cycle
embraced the Code requirements to:
• monitor the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company, and any
formal announcements relating to the Group’s ﬁnancial performance, including
reviewing signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgements contained in them; 
• review the Company’s internal ﬁnancial controls and its internal control and
risk management systems and to make recommendations to the Board; 
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function; 
• make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, re-
appointment and removal of external auditors and to approve their
remuneration and terms of engagement; 
• review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and objectivity
and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration
relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements; and
• review the Group’s policy on the engagement of the external auditors 
to supply non-audit services. In this context the Committee’s remit
requires it to report to the Board identifying any matters in respect of
which it considers that action or improvement is needed and to make
recommendations as to the steps to be taken. 
In the light of the assessments and review undertaken, the Committee
recommended to the Board that Deloitte & Touche LLP be retained as
auditors of the Group. This recommendation was endorsed by the Board.
The policy relating to the provision of non-audit services by the external
auditors speciﬁes the types of work from which the external auditors are
excluded; for which the external auditors can be engaged without referral 
to the Committee; and for which a case-by-case decision is required. The
ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees is monitored by the Committee within
an overall limit set by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
A statement of fees paid or accrued for services from the external auditors
during the period is set out below:
2005 2004
£000 £000
Audit services:
– statutory audit 836 568
– non-statutory audit 98 –
Further assurance services 15 225
Tax services:
– compliance services 10 –
– advisory services 150 313
Other services 54 12
Total 1,163 1,118
Certain non-audit services are pre-approved by the Committee depending
upon the nature and size of the service. Non-statutory audit services during
the period primarily related to work undertaken in respect of International
Accounting Standards. Tax services comprise compliance services and
technical advice associated with relevant UK and international ﬁscal laws
and regulations and, in particular, assessment of the potential implications
of proposed corporate transactions or restructuring.
Having undertaken a review of the non-audit related work the Committee
has satisﬁed itself that the services undertaken during the period did not
prejudice the external auditors’ independence.
At each of its meetings the Committee reviewed and considered reports
from the Group Director of Risk on the status of the Group’s risk management
systems, ﬁndings from the internal audit function concerning internal
controls, and reports on the status of any weaknesses in internal controls
identiﬁed by the internal or external auditors.
Remuneration Committee
During the period the Committee comprised four independent Non-Executive
Directors, John Gildersleeve (Chairman), Sir Brian Pitman, Martin Dawes and
Adrian Martin. The Committee met formally three times during the period and
each member attended every meeting, except Adrian Martin who was absent
from the meeting on 27 May 2004 because he was not appointed to the
Committee until 27 January 2005. Other Directors, the Company Secretary,
the Group Director of Human Resources and advisers attended by invitation
only. A detailed description of the Committee’s remit and work during the
period is contained in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 31. Its terms of
reference comply with the Code, are available on request from the Company www.cpwplc.com
Secretary and are published on the Company’s website. The Chairman of
the Committee updates the Board following each Committee meeting.
Nomination Committee
During the period the Committee comprised three independent Non-Executive
Directors, Sir Brian Pitman (Chairman), John Gildersleeve and Martin Dawes
and David Ross. It meets as and when required and met once formally
during the period. Every member attended this meeting, except that John
Gildersleeve did not attend the part of the meeting in respect of his own
proposed appointment as Non-Executive Chairman of the Company.
The Committee’s terms of reference comply with the Code and are
available from the Company Secretary on request and are published on 
the Company’s website. The Committee is responsible for succession
planning at Board level, overseeing the selection and appointment of
Directors, regularly reviewing the structure, size and composition of the
Board and making its recommendations to the Board. It assists in
evaluating the commitments of individual Directors and the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. 
During the period, the work of the Committee reﬂected succession planning
and a consideration of appropriate appointments to the Board. In particular,
the Committee (excluding John Gildersleeve) carried out such work and
recommended that John Gildersleeve be appointed as Non-Executive
Chairman when Hans Roger Snook stands down as Chairman with effect
from the AGM. The full Committee also recommended the appointment of
David Goldie as an Executive Director with effect from the AGM. 
The Committee did not use an external search consultancy nor open
advertising in respect of John Gildersleeve’s appointment, although the
Committee did follow the other principles of the Code in leading and
making recommendations to the Board. Given the level of experience 
of John Gildersleeve and his existing knowledge of the Company, the
Committee determined that he was the best candidate for Non-Executive
Chairman and as such decided that it was not appropriate to look
externally for a suitable candidate. The Committee also determined that
John Gildersleeve satisﬁed the test of independence set out in the Code
on his appointment. Similarly, David Goldie was already an existing
member of senior management and the Committee determined that his
appointment was part of the Company’s orderly succession plans so as 
to maintain the appropriate balance of skills and experience within the
Company on the Board.
Both of these recommendations were unanimously approved by the Board. 
Risk management and internal control
The Group has established a risk management programme that assists
management throughout the Group to identify, assess and mitigate business,
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance risks. The Board views management
of risk as integral to good business practice. The programme is designed to
support management’s decision-making and to improve the reliability of
business performance.
The risk management programme is supported by a dedicated team of risk
specialists, including internal auditors, who comprise the Group Risk and
Assurance function. To ensure that all parts of the Group have a good
understanding of risk, members of this team have conducted risk
workshops and reviews within each of the main operating divisions in the
past year, culminating in an assessment of key business risks by the
Executive Directors and senior management. These risk assessments have
been wide-ranging, covering risks arising from the regulatory environment,
strategy, counter-parties and organisational change associated both with
major projects and with acquisitions. The risk management process
operates throughout the Group, being applied equally to the main business
divisions and corporate functions.
The output from each annual assessment is a list of key strategic, ﬁnancial,
operational and compliance risks. Associated action plans and controls to
mitigate them are also put in place where this is possible and to the extent
considered appropriate by the Board taking account of costs and beneﬁts.
Changes in the status of the key risks and changes to the risk matrix are
reported regularly to the Audit Committee and at each Board Meeting.
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of
internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness. The Board delegates
to executive management the responsibility for designing, operating 
and monitoring these systems. The systems are based on a process 
of identifying, evaluating and managing key risks and include the risk
management processes set out above. The systems of internal control
were in place throughout the period and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and financial statements. The effectiveness of 
these systems is periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee in
accordance with the guidance in the Turnbull Report. These systems 
are also refined as necessary to meet changes in the Group’s business
and associated risks. 
The systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material errors,
losses, fraud or breaches of laws and regulations.
The Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the
systems of risk management and internal control in operation during 
the year and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and
ﬁnancial statements. Controls required to mitigate such risks and any
signiﬁcant control failings are reviewed by the Board through operational
reports from management. 
Communication with investors
The Board believes it is important to explain business developments and
ﬁnancial results to the Company’s shareholders and to understand any
shareholder concerns. The principal communication media used to impart
information to shareholders are news releases (including results
announcements) and Company publications. In all such communications,
care is taken to ensure that no price sensitive information is released.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer have lead
responsibility for investor relations. They are supported by a dedicated
investor relations department that, amongst other matters, organises
presentations for analysts and institutional investors. There is a full
programme of regular dialogue with major institutional shareholders, fund
managers, analysts, retail brokers and credit investors, upon which the
Chairman ensures that the Board receives regular updates at Board
meetings. The Board also receives periodic reports on investors’ views of
the performance of the Group. All the Non-Executive Directors and, in
particular, the Chairman and Senior Independent Director, are available to
meet with major shareholders, if such meetings are required. Further
ﬁnancial and business information is available on the Company’s website,
www.cpwplc.com.
The Company also communicates with shareholders through the Annual
General Meeting, at which the Chairman gives an account of the progress
of the business over the last year, and a review of current issues, and
provides the opportunity for shareholders to ask questions.

Compliance
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (‘Regulations’) and the new
Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in July 2003 (the ‘Code’). The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee are in
compliance with the Code. In framing its remuneration policy the Committee has given full consideration to the matters set out in Schedule A of the Code. 
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) to be held on 28 July 2005.
The Regulations require the Company’s auditors to report to the members on the “auditable part” of this Report (marked with a *) and to state, in their
opinion, that this part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations).
Remuneration Committee
Responsibility for the establishment of overall remuneration policy for the Group lies with the full Board of Directors. The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Directors and senior managers. The terms of
reference of the Committee are available on the Group’s website (www.cpwplc.com) or on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee’s current composition is John Gildersleeve (Chairman), Sir Brian Pitman, Martin Dawes and Adrian Martin (who was appointed to the
Committee on 27 January 2005), all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors. Upon becoming Non-Executive Chairman of the Company at the
AGM, John Gildersleeve will relinquish the Committee chairmanship in line with the requirements of the Code, and a new Chairman will be appointed. None 
of the members of the Committee has any personal ﬁnancial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided by the Committee, 
no potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross-memberships and no day-to-day involvement in running the Group’s business.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (‘NBSC’) have been appointed lead advisors to the Committee and have conducted a total reward survey for Executive
Directors and other senior managers. NBSC have no other connection with the Group. Deloitte & Touche LLP (‘Deloitte’) provided advice to the Remuneration
Committee on the administration of share option and SAYE schemes. Deloitte are the Group’s auditors and provide other services to the Group as set out in
the Corporate Governance Report on pages 23 to 25. The Deputy Chairman, the Group Director of Human Resources and the Company Secretary also
provided internal advice in respect of matters raised by the Committee. No Director nor any person advising the Committee plays a part in any discussion
about his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The primary aim of the Committee is to ensure that remuneration aligns the interests of management and shareholders and reinforces behaviour which 
will lead to the continued long-term development of the business.
The Committee makes its recommendations by taking into account:
• The experience of Executive Directors and other senior managers;
• The Group’s competitiveness in the market place, assessed through independent external market comparisons;
• The growing international nature of the Group;
• The development of new business streams; and
• Pay and conditions throughout the Group as a whole.
The overall remuneration policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, retain and motivate executives of the calibre required, and to align
their interests with those of shareholders by relating a signiﬁcant element of the remuneration package to speciﬁc performance measures. The approach is to
set ﬁxed remuneration at market median levels and to offer variable rewards which are linked to the performance of the Group. Before long-term incentive
share awards are taken into account, approximately 43% of Executive Directors’ remuneration earned in the year was performance related. Messrs Dunstone
and Ross do not receive long-term incentive share awards.
Components of remuneration
The main ﬁxed and performance related elements of remuneration that can be awarded to Executive Directors are as follows:
• basic salary, and beneﬁts and pension contributions (ﬁxed); 
• annual performance bonus (variable); 
• share options (variable); and
• Performance Shares (see below) (variable).
The Company operates a minimum shareholding policy, requiring Executive Directors to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company equal 
to at least 100% of their annual salaries. 
Salaries and beneﬁts
Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed annually and take into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individuals and
information obtained from published market data on the salary rates for similar positions in companies of a similar size. Salaries are reviewed on 1 July each year.
Following the most recent review, salaries from 1 July 2005 will be as follows:
Charles Dunstone £450,000, David Ross £210,000, Roger Taylor £300,000, Geoffroy Roux de Bezieux £285,000, Jim Dale £128,000, David Goldie £250,000.
The increases over the year reﬂect very strong Group performance and a further increase in the size of the business and complexity of the Directors’ roles.
These basic salaries remain generally below market median levels compared to companies of a similar size. Executive Directors also receive beneﬁts in
respect of cars or car allowances, private medical cover and a deﬁned contribution pension scheme.
Annual performance bonus
The Company operates a bonus scheme designed to reﬂect the performance of the Group. Bonuses are governed by performance conditions set by 
the Remuneration Committee to ensure that maximum variable rewards are paid only for exceptional performance. The bonus scheme for the period Remuneration Report continued www.cpwplc.com 27
ending 1 April 2006 will have targets based on improvements in Headline EPS (see note 10 to the ﬁnancial statements). This performance measure was
chosen to focus the Executive Directors on the key measure of the Group’s short-term ﬁnancial performance, thereby aligning the Executive Directors’
interests with those of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for the forthcoming ﬁnancial year the annual bonus potential should be increased from 100% to 195% of
base salary and that the threshold for compulsory deferral (into the Annual Deferred Bonus Plan) should be raised from 60% to 100% of salary. In addition, the
bonus award for reaching target has been increased from 40% to 60% of base salary. These changes have been made after considering the following factors:
• Targets are extremely stretching, with no bonus payable if targets are not met.
• First level target for Headline EPS in the forthcoming year is higher than Headline EPS for the year ended 2 April 2005. The upper end of the EPS range
represents truly exceptional performance.
• Considering other elements of pay, including the fact that these percentages are leveraged off generally below median base salary levels, total
remuneration is still considered to be no higher than market median levels.
Headline EPS performance and its implications for bonuses payable will be disclosed in next year’s Remuneration Report to provide shareholders with a
clear indication of the link between reward and performance. 
Annual Deferred Bonus Plan 
In the forthcoming year, any bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary will be compulsorily paid as a deferred share award under the Annual Deferred
Bonus Plan approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 28 July 2004. 
Executive Directors and senior managers also have the option of taking some or all of their cash bonus in the form of a deferred share award. The rights to
deferred shares cannot be exercised for 12 months. Matching shares may also be awarded if the deferred share award is not exercised for up to a further two
years. The number of matching shares awarded equates to 12.5% of the deferred amount at the beginning of each year. The share equivalent of dividends
which would have been paid on the shares is added to the deferred share award each year. Given the modest level of potential match and the Committee’s 
aim of encouraging Executive Directors to build up a signiﬁcant shareholding, no additional performance criteria are attached to the matching shares. 
Share options
The Company has a performance related share option scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers both in the UK and overseas. No options were
granted to Executive Directors in the period ended 2 April 2005 and it is currently not envisaged that grants will be made to them in the forthcoming year. 
A UK savings related share option scheme is open to all eligible employees in the UK, including Executive Directors. No Executive Director currently
participates in the scheme.
Performance Share Plan
Senior managers, including Executive Directors, received awards of Performance Shares (as deﬁned in the Annual General Meeting on 28 July 2004) in the period
ended 2 April 2005. These awards are subject to a mixture of Headline EPS and Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance targets measured over a three
or four year performance period. Details of the grants to Executive Directors and the performance targets are set out in the share tables later in this Report.
It is not envisaged that further awards of Performance Shares will be made to the Executive Directors in the forthcoming year. The Remuneration
Committee intends to review the Group’s remuneration requirements during the next year with a view to seeking shareholder approval, if required, 
for revised arrangements at the Annual General Meeting in 2006.

(ii) The taxable beneﬁts provided consist of a company car or car allowance, car insurance and fuel and private medical cover.
(iii) Annual bonuses for the period ended 2 April 2005 were accrued at the balance sheet date and will be paid in June 2005. For this period the bonus was
based on improvements in Headline EPS. Headline EPS for the period was 9.39p which meant that a bonus of 80% of salary was earned (out of a maximum
potential of 100% of salary). Only bonus worth up to 60% of salary is payable in cash. The remainder of the bonus will be payable in deferred shares under
the Annual Deferred Bonus Plan. Details of the deferred share awards (and the related potential matching shares) will be announced separately for Directors
and will be disclosed in next year’s Remuneration Report. At the time the Report was prepared the time period for the Directors to decide if any of the 60%
bonus should be paid in shares instead of cash had not yet expired. Messrs Dunstone and Ross do not participate in such a plan. The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC Annual Report 200

Pensions*
The schedule below sets out payments to deﬁned contribution pension schemes on behalf of Executive Directors. Geoffroy Roux de Bezieux and Roger
Taylor are members of a UK stakeholder pension scheme. Under this scheme a ﬁxed proportion of salary is paid by the Company, together with a ﬁxed
proportion by the Executive Director. Both amounts are invested on behalf of the Executive Director. Pension beneﬁts are then funded by the total
investment. Jim Dale is in a similar scheme in the Isle of Man. Levels are reviewed annually against published market data. None of the Directors was 
a member of a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme. Pension entitlements are based on basic salary only.

The dates of each contract are set out below and none speciﬁcally provides for compensation for early termination. 
External appointments
The Board supports Executive Directors holding Non-Executive Directorships of other companies and believes such appointments are part of the continuing
development of the Executive Directors from which the Company will ultimately beneﬁt. The Board has reviewed all such appointments and the following
sets out those appointments that the Board believes require disclosure pursuant to the Code. The Board has also agreed that the Directors may retain their
fees from such appointments.

Directors’ Report
The Directors have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report and ﬁnancial
statements of The Carphone Warehouse Group PLC for the 53 weeks
ended 2 April 2005.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Group continues to be the provision of mobile
communication products and services and ﬁxed line communication
services. For the purposes of segmental reporting, operations are classiﬁed
into three divisions, being Distribution, Telecoms Services and Wholesale.
The subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the results or net assets 
of the Group in the period are listed in note 15 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Results
The proﬁt before tax for the ﬁnancial period increased from £44.5m in the
prior period to £68.9m. An interim dividend of 0.55p per share (2004 –
0.40p) was paid in the period. The Directors recommend the payment of 
a ﬁnal dividend of 1.25p per share (2004 – 0.90p). Subject to shareholders’
approval at the Annual General Meeting, the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 
5 August 2005 to shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 8 July 2005. No signiﬁcant events have occurred since the balance
sheet date.
Directors
The names and brief biographical details of the Directors are shown on
page 22. Particulars of Directors’ remuneration, interests in the shares of 
the Company and its subsidiaries, and interests in share options are given
in the Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 31.
Employment of disabled people
It is the Group’s policy to encourage application for employment from
disabled people and to assist with their training and career development,
having regard to particular aptitudes and abilities. Every endeavour is made
to ﬁnd suitable alternative employment and to re-train any employee who
becomes disabled while serving the Group.
Employee involvement
The Group places signiﬁcant emphasis on its employees’ involvement 
in the business at all levels. Managers are remunerated according to results
wherever possible and all employees are kept informed of issues affecting
the Group through formal and informal meetings and through the Group’s
internal publications. Members of the management team regularly visit 
all Group locations and discuss matters of current interest and concern
with employees.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to agree terms of transactions, including payment
terms, with suppliers and, provided that suppliers perform in accordance
with the agreed terms, it is the Group’s normal practice that payment is
made accordingly. The number of days outstanding between receipt of
invoices and date of payment, calculated by reference to the amount owed
to trade creditors at the period end as a proportion of the amounts invoiced
by suppliers during the period, was 47 days (2004 – 42 days). The Company
did not have any trade creditors at 2 April 2005 or 27 March 2004.
Donations
The Group made charitable donations of £477,000 during the period 
(2004 – £85,000). No political donations were made during either period.
Contracts with controlling shareholders
There are no material contracts with controlling shareholders.
Share capital
Details of the movements in authorised and issued share capital during 
the period are provided in note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Tangible fixed assets
Movements in tangible ﬁxed assets are set out in note 14 to the ﬁnancial
statements. In the opinion of the Directors the current open market value of
the Group’s interests in freehold land and buildings exceeds the book value
by £9.7m at 2 April 2005. The Group’s liability to taxation if such assets
were sold at that value would be insigniﬁcant.
Significant shareholdings
The following interests appeared on the Register of Members or had been
notiﬁed to the Company in accordance with sections 198 to 208 of the
Companies Act 1985 on 6 June 2005:
Number Percentage
of shares of share capital
Aviva PLC 39,378,699 4.49%
Wellington Management Company LLP 42,183,998 4.81%
The total interests of the Directors are detailed in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 31.
Going concern
On the basis of current ﬁnancial projections and facilities available, the
Directors are satisﬁed that the Group has adequate resources to continue
in operation for the foreseeable future and consequently the ﬁnancial
statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
Auditors
Deloitte & Touche LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in ofﬁce
as auditors and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial period which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and Group and of their proﬁt or loss for that
period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and 
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the
Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for taking
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Company and Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Independent Auditors’ Report
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of The Carphone 
Warehouse Group PLC 
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of The Carphone Warehouse
Group PLC for the period ended 2 April 2005 which comprise the proﬁt
and loss account, the balance sheets, the cash ﬂow statement, the
reconciliation of operating proﬁt to net cash inﬂow from operating activities,
the statement of total recognised gains and losses, the statement of
accounting policies, and the related notes 1 to 32. These ﬁnancial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out
therein. We have also audited the information in the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having being audited.
This Report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this Report, or for
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Company’s
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information
contained in the Annual Report including the Directors’ Remuneration
Report. Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited in
accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements
and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a
true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We
also report if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the
ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of
the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the July 2003 FRC
Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information contained in the
Annual Report for the above period as described in the contents section
including the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the
above period and consider the implications for our Report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report described as having been audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by 
the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group as at 2 April 2005 and of the proﬁt of 
the Group for the period then ended; and
• the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
described as having been audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom accounting standards under the historical cost convention. 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently
throughout the period and the preceding period.
a) Turnover
Turnover is stated net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The following
accounting policies are applied to each business segment:
Distribution:
Distribution turnover comprises revenue generated from the sale of mobile
communication products and services, commissions receivable on sales less
provision for promotional offers and network operator performance penalties,
ongoing revenue (share of customer airtime spend, and customer revenue and
retention bonuses) and insurance premiums.
• Commission receivable on sales is recognised when the sales to which 
the commission relates are made.
• Volume bonuses are recognised when the conditions on which they 
are earned have been met.
• Ongoing revenue is recognised as it is earned over the life of the relevant
customers.
• Insurance premiums are typically paid quarterly in advance. Initial administration
fees, which are speciﬁed in the contract, are recognised at the point of sale.
Insurance premium income is recognised over the life of the relevant policies.
• All other revenue is recognised when sales are made.
Telecoms Services:
Telecoms Services turnover comprises revenue generated from facilities management,
revenue from mobile and ﬁxed network services and ongoing revenue. All such
revenue is recognised as it is earned over the life of the relevant customers.
Wholesale:
Wholesale turnover comprises revenue generated from the sale of mobile
hardware and is recognised when sales are made.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the results of The Carphone
Warehouse Group PLC and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 2 April
2005. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the period are included
from or to the date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for
under the acquisition method.
c) Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses,
representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair
value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written
off on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life of up to 20 years.
Provision is made for any impairment. Deferred consideration is recognised 
to the extent that it is considered probable that it will be paid.
d) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for
impairment. Depreciation is provided on all tangible ﬁxed assets at rates calculated
to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line
basis over its expected useful life from the date it is brought into use, as follows:
Freehold buildings 2-4% per annum
Short leasehold costs 10 years or the lease term if less
Computer hardware and software, 
network and ofﬁce equipment 12.5-50% per annum
Fixtures and ﬁttings 20-25% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
e) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes 
all direct costs incurred in bringing stock to its present location and condition
and represents ﬁnished goods and goods for resale.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs
expected to be incurred to disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-
moving or defective items where appropriate.
38
f) Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment, other
than investments held via independently managed external funds which are
evaluated on a portfolio basis at the end of the period. Current asset
investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
g) Leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the proﬁt and loss
account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives
and rent-free periods are amortised through the proﬁt and loss account over the
shorter of the period of the lease or the period until rentals are expected to 
be revised to prevailing market rates.
h) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at
amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred
tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an
obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at
the balance sheet date, with the following exceptions:
• Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained
earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet
date, distributions are expected.
• Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider
that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts from which
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on
tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
i) Subscriber acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs, being the direct third-party costs of recruiting and
retaining new customers, net of incentives from network operators and provision
for in-contract churn, are capitalised and amortised over the minimum subscription
period. Subscriber acquisition costs for customers with no minimum subscription
commitment are taken to the proﬁt and loss account as incurred.
j) Software and website development costs
The Group capitalises both internal and external infrastructure and design costs
incurred in the development of software for internal use and in the development
of the functionality of its website. These costs are depreciated in accordance
with the policy deﬁned in note 1d.
k) Pensions
Contributions to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged to the proﬁt and loss
account as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
l) Foreign exchange
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases
or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements
at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded at 
the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are hedged, mainly using forward foreign
exchange contracts to create matching liabilities and assets. At the balance
sheet date, both the monetary assets and liabilities and the foreign currency
hedges are retranslated at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date and any
differences are taken to the proﬁt and loss account. The results of overseas
operations are translated at the average foreign exchange rates for the period,
and their balance sheets are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance
sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of opening net assets
and results of overseas operations are dealt with through reserves. All other
exchange differences are included in the proﬁt and loss account.
m) Employee incentive schemes
The cost of awards made under the Company’s Performance Share Plan is based
on the intrinsic value of the awards at the date of grant and is charged to the proﬁt
and loss account on a straight-line basis over the relevant performance period.

Following the acquisition of The Phone House Telecom GmbH (formerly Hutchison Telecommunications GmbH) (‘HTG’) in June 2003, the Group closed its support

Limited (£1.7m). This consideration relates to acquisitions from previous years, and was provided for in full in the year of acquisition.

21 Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Operating and Financial Review on pages 9 to 20 provides an explanation of the role that ﬁnancial instruments have in managing the Group’s currency and
interest rate risk. The disclosures below deal with ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities as deﬁned in FRS 13 ‘Derivatives and other ﬁnancial instruments’.
As permitted by FRS 13, short-term trade debtors and creditors have been excluded from these disclosures. This has no material effect on the currency disclosures.
Certain ﬁnancial assets such as investments in subsidiaries are also excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
(a) Interest rate and currency proﬁle of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets include cash and short-term deposits, mainly denominated in Sterling, Euro and US Dollars. Foreign exchange swaps, used for hedging
purposes, create an asset and a liability. For the purposes of this note, foreign exchange assets and liabilities have been netted against each other. The Group’s
ﬁnancial liabilities, other than currency hedges, consist of committed and uncommitted loans in Sterling and Euro as well as local overdraft facilities, which are
denominated in several European currencies.

Total (48,342) (122,146) – (170,488) – (124,190) – (124,190)
All ﬁnancial assets and liabilities attract interest at ﬂoating rates. There are no ﬁxed rate ﬁnancial liabilities (2004 – 4.84% for weighted average periods of 0.3 years).
The interest rates on ﬂoating rate ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are linked to market interest rates, mainly on an overnight basis or for one, two or three-month periods.

The Group provides various pension schemes for the beneﬁt of a signiﬁcant number of its employees:
Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group operates a number of deﬁned contribution schemes for which the cost for the period was £1.9m (2004 – £1.7m).
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
On 5 April 2000 the Group commenced the winding up of a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme. Based on actuarial advice, the assets of the scheme are anticipated 
to be sufﬁcient to meet the levels required by the Government’s Minimum Funding Requirements calculations. On completion of the winding up of the scheme, the
Group will retain no obligations in relation to the funding of scheme beneﬁts.

1 Contingent liabilities
We are still aware that European VAT authorities continue to investigate the recovery of VAT in the industry for trading activities conducted prior to April 2003. Having
undertaken a detailed internal investigation and taken advice, we continue to believe that we have no ﬁnancial exposure to this issue within the ﬁnancial statements.

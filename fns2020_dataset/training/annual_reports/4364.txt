MARKET OvERvIEW
Market developments globally and at the 
local level are opening up tremendous 
opportunities for all our businesses. 
Geopolitical forces and changing 
demographics are shifting the economic axis 
towards Asia and emerging markets. New 
patterns of consumer behaviour are creating 
different challenges for digital content 
delivery and feeding demand for precisely 
targeted information. 
Technology is reshaping the competitive 
arena. Nearly half a billion smartphones are 
already in the hands of consumers. Big data, 
mobile connectivity, cloud services and 
social networking are combining to deliver 
on the promise of rich, detailed information 
to every individual no matter where they are.
With a third of the world now online 
compared with just 8% a decade ago, we 
now have many more potential customers. 
They are more engaged and more 
demanding about the services they expect. 
Increasingly, tailored and insightful content is 
at a premium. Our challenge as content 
providers is to get high quality, relevant 
information to the right people, where and 
when they want it. 
STRATEGy AND PERFORMANCE OvERvIEW
DMGT’s strategic ambition is to become  
a global-growth company with increasing 
exposure to emerging economies and 
high-growth markets. We aim to achieve  
that by growing our business-to-business 
operations, developing our consumer media 
franchise and diversifying internationally into 
high-growth markets.
The Group delivered a solid set of results in 20 1 2, 
with underlying revenue and operating profit 
up 3% and 7% respectively. More than half of 
operating profits were earned outside the UK.
Our international B2B companies increased 
both revenue and profits. 
RMS delivered another solid year of revenue 
and profit growth. The company continues  
to have strong growth prospects. It now  
offers a broad portfolio of products and  
data solutions. It is also seeing many more 
international opportunities. 
dmg::information contributed healthy 
increases in revenue and operating profit. 
Each of its four sectors – property, education, 
energy and finance – contributed. 
dmg::events registered 13% underlying 
growth in a year in which just one of its three 
marquee biennial events was staged. 
Euromoney Institutional Investor maintained 
its impressive history of profits growth. Its 
business has been transformed in recent 
years. Subscriptions now account for just  
over half of total revenues. 
The UK consumer business performed well in 
challenging trading conditions. 
At A&N Media, underlying revenues were up 
slightly, and operating profit rose strongly. This 
pleasing result demonstrates the success of 
our strategy of combining the best traditional 
and new media content in ways that make 
sense for our consumers. 
The Mail titles continued to outperform the 
market. Our free newspaper, Metro, also 
performed strongly. Our regional newspaper 
group, Northcliffe, improved profitability 
despite the secular decline in its revenue 
base. 
MailOnline had an excellent year, becoming 
the world’s most popular English language 
newspaper website in 2012. Our recruitment 
portal Evenbase acquired Jobrapido to 
extend its international footprint. Digital 
Property Group’s (DPG) merger with Zoopla 
has created a formidable new UK property 
search portal. 
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
The strategic priority for RMS remains its new 
platform, RMS (one), scheduled for a 
mid-2014 launch. It continues to develop 
supporting programmes, which are 
expected to yield additional revenue in 2013. 
dmg::information’s ambition to invest in 
must-have, high-growth, innovative business 
information companies remains unchanged, 
as does its remit to diversify DMGT by sector, 
by business model and by geography. 
dmg::events is expanding its significant 
footprint in the Middle East into Saudi Arabia, 
and on to Asia. It will continue to extend its 
successful global energy division. It is also 
developing digital solutions to complement 
its live events portfolio.
Euromoney continues to pursue its strategy  
of growing international, digital and 
subscription-based revenues. 
A&N Media’s new print facility in Thurrock  
will yield significant cost reductions and 
environmental benefits. It will invest to drive 
even faster growth in its core digital 
businesses, particularly MailOnline.  
Mail Newspapers will launch paid-for  
tablet editions. 
At Evenbase international expansion remains 
a key priority. Our online discount business 
Wowcher is continuing to build up its 
database of affluent young female 
subscribers. Zoopla Property Group is 
implementing its integration plan following  
its recent merger with DPG.

Capabilities and overview Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 06
Our businesses compete in international 
markets by providing valuable content in  
the consumer media and business sectors. 
Market developments globally and at the 
local level are opening up tremendous 
opportunities. Data traffic levels continue  
to scale new heights. 
There are more customers in more territories 
with different expectations and better access 
to digital content. Adapting to changing 
customer behaviour and keeping pace  
with the technology they are using is a key 
challenge for content providers.
ThE ExPLOSION IN DATA TRAFFIC
Global IP traffic increased eightfold over the 
past five years and is expected to quadruple 
over the next five years, as sharing video  
and other rich-data forms becomes 
commonplace. Annual global IP data centre 
traffic is expected to reach 6.6 zettabytes by 
2016. Globally, cloud traffic is expected to 
grow from 39% of total data centre traffic in 
201 1 to 64% of total data centre traffic in 2016.
CuSTOMER BEhAvIOuR IS ChANGING
Over a third of the world’s population is now 
online. That compares with just 8% a decade 
ago. Ten billion devices connect to the 
internet. By 2016, forecasts suggest that there 
may be as many as 19 billion internet-
enabled devices.
Mobile connectivity has entered the 
mainstream. Sales and shipments of mobile, 
smartphone and tablets outstripped PCs this 
year. Mobile-connected tablets will be the 
fastest-growing consumer mobile device, 
increasing from 25 million devices globally in 
201 1 to 200 million in 2016
People accessing content on the move  
have different requirements. They want 
contextually sensitive content for their 
devices. If they are on a smartphone they 
want to use capabilities like mapping and 
one-click calling. They expect touch-screen 
navigation and screen-responsive  
page design.
More of our customers are becoming better 
connected. In 201 1, over 679 million used 
social network services via mobile devices. 
That will reach 2.4 billion by 2016. There are 
great opportunities for high value content 
providers. High value, relevant and  
hard-to-replicate content will be at  
a premium. 
ThE IMPACT OF TEChNOLOGy
The IT industry is on the cusp of a generational 
shift. The new computing paradigm is being 
built on four enabling technologies – cloud 
services, mobile connectivity, big data and 
social networking.
These technologies are reshaping the 
competitive landscape. Big data is forecast 
to drive rapid changes in infrastructure and 
$232 billion in IT spending through 2016.
Spending on mobile networks exceeded 
fixed data networks for the first time in 2012. 
By 2015, Wi-Fi and mobile devices will 
account for over half of IP traffic. By 2016, 
global mobile data traffic will top 10 exabytes 
per month, a sixteen-fold increase, and 
mobile video will constitute over two-thirds  
of all mobile data traffic. 
The trend is for tailored content, getting the 
right information to the right person at the 
right time.
In our own markets we are witnessing a 
proliferation of artificial intelligence and 
machine-learning applications processing 
large quantities of data to generate 
knowledge and insight in real-time. 
Applications connect with social networking 
services as a matter of course. Customisation 
and visualisation tools are becoming  
more important.
The cloud is bringing cost-effective, scalable, 
tailored services to businesses and individuals 
in an unparalleled way. Analysts estimate 
that 80% of new commercial enterprise apps 
will be deployed on cloud platforms.
Cloud-based services are revolutionising  
the way businesses operate. Instead of 
developing expensive proprietary software, 
businesses are sharing open-source 
applications. This is driving greater 
efficiencies and fomenting new business 
ecosystems.  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 07

ThE ShIFTING ECONOMIC CENTRE  
OF GRAvITy 
According to IMF forecasts, the total GDP  
of emerging economies could overtake  
the developed economies as early as 2014. 
Estimates indicate that 70% of world growth 
over the next few years will come from 
emerging markets, with as much as 40% from 
China and India.
Leading emerging markets’ businesses will 
build on their domestic successes to 
compete internationally. These challenger 
brands have prospered without institutional 
backing and have strong entrepreneurial 
cultures. They have the potential to be a 
powerful disruptive force in the global 
competitive arena. 
The BRIC countries’ growing economic 
strength is leading to greater power to 
influence world economic policy. Emerging 
economies now have significant voting 
shares in the IMF.
POPuLATION GROWTh
The global population is expected to top 
nine billion by 2050. Over the same period 
there will be a near doubling in the urban 
population, to over six billion. Currently, urban 
migration adds up to a new city the size of 
Barcelona every 10 days. Meeting this 
additional capacity will require major 
infrastructure investment and radical new 
approaches to urban planning.
Population growth will be matched by 
growing prosperity. A global middle class is 
emerging. By 2030, it is expected to more 
than double, from two billion today to 4.9 
billion. The European and American middle 
classes, currently 50% of the total, will 
account for just 22%. Asia will provide 64% of 
the global middle class and 40% of global 
middle-class consumption. 
The growth of the world’s middle class is 
coming almost exclusively from developing 
countries. In advanced countries, where 
population and incomes are halting, the 
number of people in the middle classes may 
even be declining.
Age demographics are changing. Advances 
in healthcare are triggering a rise in older 
populations. By 2050, more than one in three 
people in developed economies will be  
over 60. 
These trends raise important issues for public 
policy. We are evolving and adapting our 
information services to meet changing 
customer requirements, demographic 
change and the new opportunities in 
high-growth markets. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 08
BuSINESS hIGh LIGhTS
I am pleased to report another set of strong 
results in what remains a challenging global 
economy, again testament to the robust 
structure and dynamic nature of the Group. 
The world continues to change and grow at 
a staggering rate. The way consumers and 
businesses access and utilise information now 
underpins how people around the world 
interact, behave, even think. With that comes 
opportunity: to utilise the best technology; to 
innovate and develop new products; and to 
expand across geographies and sectors. 
As a Group we have a responsibility to ensure 
that we maximise that opportunity to the 
best of our ability. Technology is the tool, but 
our people are the ones who harness it to 
push new boundaries and build more value. 
That ingenuity is why we have been able to 
grow revenue and profits year on year and 
increase the proportion of revenues and 
profits coming from outside the UK, as well as 
our digital activities which are considerable 
and continue apace. 
The Group is well placed to capitalise on the 
significant changes we are seeing in our 
markets, from consumer behaviour to 
business-to-business needs in an increasingly 
volatile environment. People expect more 
and demand more, to which our response is 
to continue to challenge the status quo and 
to create outstanding products that answer 
those growing aspirations. We aim to set the 
agenda. Others follow. 
On 18 April 2012, FTSE announced that 
DMGT’s ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares 
would no longer be eligible for inclusion in 
the UK Index Series. The Board of DMGT has 
considered at length, with the assistance of 
its advisors, the options available to it and the 
suitability of such options to meet the needs 
of its stakeholders to make the ‘ A ’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares eligible for inclusion in the 
UK Index Series but no solution has to date 
been found. The FSA ’s recently issued 
consultation paper on ‘Enhancing the 
effectiveness of the Listing Regime and 
feedback on CP12/2’ makes it more difficult 
to envisage how the Company can regain its 
premium listing. It is unlikely, therefore, that 
the ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares will 
become eligible for inclusion in the index in 
the foreseeable future. However, DMGT’s ‘ A ’ 
Ordinary Non-Voting Shares will continue to 
be standard listed and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange and to be a member of 
other important indices such as MSCI,  
STOXX, S&P and the FTSE Global Equity Index 
Series and DMGT will continue to maintain 
the highest standard of governance  
and disclosure. 
CORPORATE GOvERNANCE
As Chairman I have always been committed 
to ensuring that DMGT maintains the highest 
standards of corporate governance and our 
Corporate Governance Report highlights 
how we continue to incorporate these 
principles into the delivery of our strategy. 
Last year I also highlighted the importance of 
diversity on our Board which is about ensuring 
that there is an appropriate range and 
balance of skills. I am pleased to now 
welcome Heidi Roizen onto the Board 
bringing invaluable experience, insight and 
skills from her career in Silicon Valley. 
Likewise, I would like to personally thank Nick 
Jennings who stood down as Company 
Secretary after 24 years of service over a time 
of immense change and progress for the 
Group. We welcome Claire Chapman, who 
joined us in September, as DMGT’s first 
General Counsel and Company Secretary.

PADRAIC FALLON
It is with great sadness that we say goodbye 
to Padraic Fallon who passed away on 
13th October, 2012. A creative force, a genius 
journalist and a talented businessman, 
Padraic worked with the Group for over 40 
years. Aged 28 he moved from his role as a 
financial journalist for the Daily Mail to 
become Editor and then Executive Director, 
Managing Director and finally Chairman of 
Euromoney, building a phenomenally 
successful brand that defined and set the 
pace, globally, for financial publishing. A 
gifted writer and a much-loved friend, his 
approach to life was underpinned by his 
inimitable Irish character and flair. He will be 
sorely missed by us all. Our thoughts are with 
his wife and four children.

REMuNERATION 
Earlier this year, we discussed some changes 
to our executive reward policy with our 
shareholders. These are set out in detail in our 
Remuneration Report. It is vitally important 
that the incentives offered to our senior 
leadership team are clearly aligned with the 
interests of our shareholders in promoting our 
long-term success, stability and growth. 
At an individual business level our long-term 
incentive plans are designed to share the 
value created by the leaders of those 
businesses in a way that supports our 
innovative and entrepreneurial culture by 
promoting an ownership mindset within  
the business.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
We continue to apply a proactive approach 
to risk management across the Group, 
applying appropriate criteria and risk 
management best practices for the various 
areas in which we operate. Our Risk 
Committee has oversight and management 
of significant risks around the Group and 
regularly reports to the Board.

Governance report for further

NORThCLIFFE MEDIA
At the end of November 2012 we announced 
an historic transaction. After more than 90 
years of regional newspaper ownership, we 
agreed to sell Northcliffe Media to a powerful 
new group – Local World – to ensure a 
sustainable future for our 77 regional titles 
and numerous local websites. This transaction 
will enable management to focus resources 
on our world-class national newspapers, our 
expanding digital media operations and our 
important B2B and consumers businesses.
TEChNOLOGy AND INNOvATION
Over the past decade we have seen an 
astonishing pace of change, in consumer 
habits and business focus. At the heart of  
this is technology: offering businesses and 
consumers ever-increasing choice, speed 
and flexibility. That pace of change is only 
going to increase.
I believe that DMGT’s future lies in its ability  
to respond to this opportunity, investing in 
products and services that harness the 
potential of the very best technological 
advances. We are committed to embracing 
innovative solutions to the treatment and 
sharing of data that is vital, live and 
personally relevant, whether in a business-to-
business or a consumer capacity.
The single fastest-growing medium in the 
world is mobile. That is why it will remain  
a key focus in every step of our strategic 
development and we will continue to invest 
time and resources to maximise its potential. 
Its effect on how people connect with each 
other and with the world around them, will 
revolutionise how we lead our lives. The 
opportunity it gives us to deepen and 
enhance the relationships we have with our 
customers is unprecedented. This is 
something that I am personally keen to 
promote across the Group so that the free 
flow and sharing of ideas underpins how  
we embrace change and the pace at which 
we progress. We have already had some 
significant successes with mobile, heralding 
much more to come.
PEOPLE AND CuLTuRE
In February we took senior management 
from across the Group to Bangalore to 
discuss and shape the future. I would like to 
thank so many of our non-executive directors 
for attending and for their active involvement 
in the debate about our future strategy. 
Personally, I found seeing the wealth and 
depth of talent, the creativity and potential of 
the ideas, and the quality and relevance of 
the discussions deeply inspiring. The event set 
a very clear vision for DMGT as a global 
growth company, driven by pride in our 
products and services, belief in the people 
who work in the Group and the courage  
to think innovatively and entrepreneurially. 
A crucial part of our culture is rooted in 
personal responsibility: each and every 
person in the Group has an individual role  
to play in our future success. Our organic 
growth, our ability to innovate internally and 
our proactive approach all testify to the 
entrepreneurial spirit that sits at the heart of 
DMGT. This strength also drives our ability to 
endure and prosper despite intense global 
pressures and I would like to applaud and 
congratulate staff across DMGT on the past 
year’s growing profits.
It is a great source of pride for me that DMGT 
is defined by the high calibre of its talent.  
As a Group we will continue to champion 
and nurture that talent, bringing on the next 
generation of exceptional business leaders 
with the skills and experience to deliver our 
strategy. We have the momentum, the 
knowledge and the hunger to achieve  
great things.
The v iscount Rothermere 
Chairman Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 10
Our strategic ambition is to become a  
global growth company, focused on three 
key areas: 
1. Growing our business-to-business (B2B) 
companies
2. Developing our consumer media franchise
3. Diversifying internationally into high-  
growth markets
INTRODuCTION
My Chief Executive’s Review sets out our 
philosophy, strategy and progress made over 
the past year, as well as outlining the main 
operational and financial factors which 
underpin our ongoing development  
and performance. 
A Business Review of the performance of 
each of our operating divisions follows on 
pages 22 to 37 . 
A Financial and Treasury Review is given on 
pages 38 to 43 and the principal risks and 
uncertainties the Group faces are set out  
on pages 52 to 55 of the Directors’ Report.
OuR PuRPOSE
Our core purpose is to seek out, invest in and 
grow a diverse group of high quality, 
entrepreneurially run businesses. The key to 
our long-term success is a culture where 
people are given the freedom to innovate in 
order to create outstanding products and 
services to meet customer needs. 
Throughout our long history, being controlled 
by the founding family has proved highly 
successful and well suited to the media and 
information industry. Our ownership structure 
allows us to take a longer-term perspective 
and gives us a competitive advantage.
We are committed to remaining a diversified 
Group with exposure to both the B2B and 
consumer media sectors in a variety of 
geographies serving a variety of industry 
sectors. This approach provides us with a 
breadth of opportunities and the ability to 
spread risk. 
Our B2B arm is made up of Risk Management 
Solutions (RMS), dmg::information, 
dmg::events and Euromoney Institutional 
Investor. We manage our consumer media 
activities through A&N Media, comprising the 
Daily Mail, The Mail On Sunday, MailOnline, 
Metro, Evenbase (our digital jobs search 
business), Zoopla Property Group (our interest 
in digital property search) and our local 
media business, Northcliffe Media. During the 
year, we disposed of our remaining interest  
in dmg Radio Australia Pty Ltd. Since the 
financial end we announced an agreement 
for the sale of Northcliffe Media to a new 
company called Local World.
STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Our overall ambition is to develop DMGT into 
a truly global growth company with an 
increasing exposure to emerging economies 
and high-growth markets.
We have identified five strategic priorities to 
help us realise our objective: 
The first is rigorous and active portfolio 
management. We have brought a sharper 
focus to our portfolio so as to concentrate 
talent and resources on businesses and 
brands where we see the greatest potential 
for profitable growth. 
Every part of the DMGT portfolio is regularly 
scrutinised. We undertake periodic, 
disciplined assessments of all current 
businesses. All new investment and 
acquisition proposals are carefully but  
rapidly evaluated within a predetermined 
framework of capital allocation priorities  
and against our strict investment criteria. 
Second, we pursue organic growth through 
innovation. We encourage our business 
leaders to create ambitious long-term 
growth plans. 
International growth is our third strategic 
priority. We are consciously diversifying 
internationally, with a special emphasis on 
growing our presence in high-growth 
markets. Our existing companies are looking 
for new international markets and are 
investing in bolt-on acquisitions that extend 
their geographic footprint.
Our fourth priority is technology. If we are  
to remain competitive we have to continue 
to embrace and harness new technologies. 
Owning both consumer media and business-
to-business organisations gives us a special 
opportunity to grow and cross-fertilise 
technological developments. We have 
stepped up the rate of technological 
change right across the Group. 
Our fifth priority, developing entrepreneurial 
talent, is becoming increasingly important.  
In creative businesses, ideas – and the 
people that have them – are what matter 
most. So we have been raising the bar on 
talent. We are committed to attracting and 
retaining the best people to optimise  
our decentralised operating approach and 
meet our global growth ambitions. Ensuring 
we have the right technical capabilities is a 
particular priority.
Financial discipline is the common factor 
underpinning all we do. Strong cash flows 
and a strengthened balance sheet give us 
the financial flexibility to take advantage of 
new opportunities and to weather adverse 
external events. Our capital allocation 
strategy prioritises organic growth supported 
by bolt-on acquisitions and investment in

PROGRESS IN ThE yEAR
We made a great deal of progress in the 
pursuit of our strategic priorities over the last 
twelve months. As a way of measuring our 
success we monitor a series of key 
performance indicators (KPIs) covering both 
financial returns and strategic objectives. 
As can be seen on page 17 of this review, we 
have continued to derive the majority of our 
operating profit from our B2B companies and 
expanded our digital revenues. 
We completed several bolt-on acquisitions 
and selective disposals to ensure our capital 
is effectively utilised. All our acquisitions met 
our strict investment criteria. We invested 
additional resources to execute against our 
long-term plan for international growth.
There has been an increased focus on 
technology and digital transformation both 
in terms of adapting existing products and 
services to the changing way in which our 
customers access information, but also in 
terms of modernising our internal systems and 
processes. We clearly recognise that if we are 
to compete with new start-up companies we 
need to move away from expensive legacy 
systems and become more agile. 
We have completed the second DMGT 
Technology Summer School which focused 
on the implications of social networking, 
mobile technology and cloud computing. 
A&N Media created an Ideas Factory.  
A cross Group Council of Chief Technology 
Officers was set up, which I chair. 
We remain very much committed to 
reducing operational costs wherever 
possible. One significant example of the 
latter is the impending move of our London 
print operation to a new site in Essex. 
As mentioned before, we have elevated the 
priority given to talent and continued to 
refine and develop our leadership 
programme, which is now in its third year.  
This year saw the holding of a Chairman’s 
Conference for executives drawn from across 
the Group. It provided an outstanding 
opportunity to harness the depth and 
breadth of talent we have throughout our 
organisation. It was held in Bangalore to 
emphasise the seriousness of our intent to 
become a more global company.

acquisitions where we can invest in 
businesses that complement our existing

entrepreneurial leaders who we can retain 
and support. Examples this year are the

We continued to review the incentives and 
rewards we have in place at each operating 
company to ensure that they match our 
expectations for growth by encouraging and 
nurturing successful entrepreneurial 
leadership, so vital to raising performance 
over the longer term. 
On compensation, we do not apply a ‘one 
size fits all’ policy. This is a major strength, 
reflecting the value of the decentralised 
model and diversified nature of our portfolio 
of businesses. The Remuneration Committee 
ensures that compensation is aligned with 
the strategies and particular circumstances 
of each operating company. 
We continued to exercise financial discipline 
with strong cash flow conversion and active 
portfolio management resulting in a reduced 
level of net debt. This has been the fourth 
consecutive year when disposal proceeds 
have exceeded acquisition costs. In addition, 
the new pension guarantee structure, 
established in July 2012, is expected to 
reduce the near-term cash payments  
to the defined benefit pension fund. 
As a result we are increasingly able to 
finance the wealth of opportunities we  
see in front of us.
OPERATIONAL MODEL
We take a considerable amount of comfort 
in the fact that we know all our companies 
are run by chief executives with expert 
knowledge of the markets in which they 
operate. Autonomous management keeps 
decision making close to the customer,  
as real innovation comes from having  
a genuine customer focus. 
We deliberately strive to run DMGT in a 
manner which provides a fertile environment 
for our people to produce innovative ideas 
by adopting a decentralised structure. 
Maintaining this approach is of the utmost 
importance to me and my colleagues 
because we realise that to survive in a  
rapidly changing media world, you must  
be able to react quickly and effectively.  
We build value by creating conditions  
where diverse businesses can prosper and 
experience sustained growth. We give our 
businesses freedom to operate within  
a broad framework.
The benefits are numerous. For example,  
it enabled us to respond rapidly to the 
economic downturn and to digital 
opportunities.
At Group level, the Investment and Finance 
Committee of the Board oversees Group 
strategy development. It makes decisions  
on investment and capital allocation acting 
independently from the operating 
companies. The DMGT Leadership Team 
comprises the operating company leaders, 
together with the DMGT executive team.  
Its remit is to focus on furthering cross-Group 
co-operation when and where this makes 
sense, for example Group leadership courses, 
communications and international 
expansion. It complements the decision 
making and accountability structures in 
place through our decentralised  
operating structure.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITy 
Across the Group we take corporate 
responsibility (CR) seriously and it permeates 
our outlook on the environment, the way we 
treat our employees, our customers and 
suppliers, as well as on local community 
issues. 
We recognise that our businesses have an 
impact on the environment, be that through 
our printing operations, offices, transport or 
other activities. We are truly committed to 
ensuring that, where possible, our impact on 
the environment is minimised. 
The greatest impact we make on the 
environment arises from our printing 
operations. Here, I am pleased to say that  
we have been diligent in measuring and 
reducing waste in our usage of materials, 
and through our analysis of our carbon 
footprint, monitoring and improving our 
efficiency in the use of energy. 
We started to measure our footprint in 2006 
and the Group’s emissions have fallen 
steadily since then. This year we are 
announcing that we have set a new target 
for reducing carbon emissions over the next 
three years.
At Harmsworth Quays, our largest printing 
plant, and Northcliffe House, the Company’s 
headquarters and the London base of 
Associated Newspapers, Northcliffe Media 
and dmg::events, we maintained the key 
international environmental standard ISO 
14001. We also hold this standard at our 
Landmark office in Exeter. 
Community involvement is integral to the way 
we run our company, as is its importance to 
the personal motivation of our employees. 
We donate money, time and in-kind 
donations such as advertising space, and 
staff participate in a huge range of activities, 
including fund-raising, organising events and 
acting as trustees to charitable initiatives. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 15

ACTIvE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
When I became Chief Executive in 2008,  
I recognised the need for us to focus on  
a narrower range of activities in order to 
concentrate human resources and financial 
capital where the most potential for 
long-term growth and value creation existed. 
I stated that we would be active managers 
of our portfolio of businesses and apply our 
investment criteria vigorously in determining 
where to allocate capital. At the same time 
we would maintain our long-term 
perspective and a high rate of internal 
investment to drive organic growth. 
The investment criteria that I identified then 
has encouraged investing in businesses 
which operate in attractive growth markets. 
Such businesses need to have products or 
services which are highly innovative and 
highly valued, ones which customers repeat 
buy. We prefer to invest in businesses that are 
either in international markets or offer scope 
to expand internationally, especially into 
high-growth economies. We have a strong 
bias towards market leaders and businesses 
with high-margin, cash-generative 
characteristics expected to produce a high 
return on capital. We are also focused on 
gaining access to and retaining 
entrepreneurial management and we give 
preference to businesses which can benefit 
from DMGT’s long-term perspective. 
In keeping with this approach, we have 
further refocused the portfolio with a range 
of disposals, acquisitions and selective 
investments throughout the year. We 
announced a series of bolt-on acquisitions  
at dmg::information including Intelliworks, 
PrepMe and SpringRock. Euromoney 
acquired Global Grain Geneva and Global 
Grain Asia and A&N Media acquired 
Jobrapido. We also announced the merger 
of our online property portal, The Digital 
Property Group, with Zoopla to create a 
world-class property search business. 
dmg::information also made a series of 
investments in the US property market 
through Xceligent, Real Capital Analytics  
and BuildFax. In total, acquisitions, including 
a slight increase in our shareholding in 
Euromoney to offset dilution from incentive 
plans, utilised £75 million of cash.
Following the year-end we made a further 
bolt-on investment at Hobsons with their 
acquisition of the US website Beat the GMAT. 
We also made a number of disposals of 
non-core businesses. Disposals in the early 
part of the year were primarily focused in 
Associated (Top Consultant, motors.co.uk 
and Teletext) whilst in the second half of the 
year we announced the disposal of our 
remaining stake in DMG Radio Australia and 
the sale of dmg::event’s Evanta leadership 
and conference business. Total disposal 
proceeds amounted to £125 million.
Post year-end on 21st November, 2012 we 
announced we had reached agreement to 
sell Northcliffe Media, to Local World, a newly 
formed media group. DMGT will receive 
consideration of £52.5 million in cash and  
a 38.7% shareholding in Local World, which  
will allow us to benefit from the potential 
upside from the evolution of the regional 
newspaper industry.
This portfolio management activity has 
further improved the overall quality of the 
DMGT portfolio and reduced debt. We 
succeeded in our long-term goal of 
increasing exposure to international markets.
ShARE PRICE PERFORMANCE
Our share performance remains important  
to us as an indicator as to whether our 
strategy is understood and appreciated  
by institutional investors.
The price of our widely traded ‘ A ’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares has risen by 37% over the 
year, outperforming both the UK Media 
sector and the FTSE All-share index which 
provided returns of 18% and 14% respectively. 
As explained in last year’s Business Review, 
the decision by FTSE to adopt listing 
classifications for determining the weighting 
of share classes in their indices, resulted in 
DMGT’s weighting in the UK Index Series 
falling from 75% to 0%. The FTSE rules on 
standard listings means that DMGT ‘ A ’ shares 
are now no longer included in the FTSE UK 
Index Series. However, DMGT continues to be 
a member of a number of other important 
indices such as MSCI, STOXX and S&P . 
This change has made no impact on the 
approach DMGT takes to its obligations as  
a listed company. We will continue to adopt 
the obligations and practices of the UK  
Listing Rules as they have applied to DMGT 
historically, maintaining the highest standard 
of governance and disclosure including the 
application of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.  Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 16
WEIGhTING OF DMGT’S ‘A’ ShARES  
IN ThE FTSE INDICES
On 18th April, 2012, FTSE announced that 
DMGT’s ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares 
would no longer be eligible for inclusion in 
the UK Series Index. The Board of DMGT has 
considered at length, with the assistance of 
its advisors, the options available to it and the 
suitability of such options to meet the needs 
of its stakeholders to make the ‘ A ’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares eligible for inclusion in the 
UK Series Index but no solution has to date 
been found. The FSA ’s recently issued 
consultation paper on ‘Enhancing the 
effectiveness of the Listing Regime and 
feedback on CP12/2’ makes it more difficult 
to envisage how we can regain our premium 
listing. It is unlikely, therefore, that the ‘ A ’ 
Ordinary Non-Voting Shares will become 
eligible for inclusion in the index in the 
foreseeable future. However, DMGT’s ‘ A ’ 
Ordinary Non-Voting shares will continue to 
be standard listed and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange and to be a member of 
other important indices such as MSCI, STOXX, 
S&P and the FTSE Global Equity Index Series 
and DMGT will continue to maintain the 
highest standard of governance and 
disclosure. 
CAPITAL STRuCTuRE
The Company has not made a capital call 
on its shareholders since 1933. Growth is 
funded by long-term debt and by retained 
earnings. Since the late 1980s, our strategy 
has been to seek to raise the dividend in real 
terms over the economic cycle. Since 2002, 
the Board’s policy has been to target a real 
rate of growth in the dividend in the region  
of 5% to 7% on the basis of the Directors’ 
confidence in the Group’s long-term 
financial health. 
Subject to shareholder approval, the Board  
is recommending payment on the issued 
Ordinary and ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares, 
a final dividend of 12.4 pence per share for 
the year ended 30th September, 2012 (201 1 
1 1.7 pence). This will make a total of 18.0 
pence (201 1 17 .0 pence per share). The final 
dividend will be paid on 8th February, 2013  
to shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 30th November, 2012. This is an 
increase of 6% for the year. The compound 
dividend growth over the last 20 years is 8.9% 
in nominal terms, which is an increase of 6.1% 
in real terms. 
Because of continued strong cash flow 
generation, representing a 1 13% conversion 
rate of operating profits, and the proceeds 
from disposals, our financial strength 
improved. We continue to have a 
comfortable level of longer-term funding 
through £678 million of outstanding bonds, 
with maturities ranging from December, 2018 
through to June, 2027 . At the year-end, we 
also had unused bank facilities of £298 
million. Given surplus cash of £107 million at 
the year end, we will consider buying back 
any bonds which become available, at the 
right price.
Throughout the year, we have stayed well 
within our own internal net debt to EBITDA 
limit of 2.4 times with our year-end net debt  
to EBITDA ratio standing at 1.6 times. 
Whilst we can comfortably run the Group 
without having to raise new finance, we  
may want to do so in order to sustain the 
Group’s long-term growth ambitions. 
Regaining investment grade status remains 
an objective.
We anticipate that capital allocation in the 
forthcoming year will continue to be funded 
from our existing capital structure and will be 
directed towards supporting the Group’s 
long-term growth ambitions as well as our 
continued commitment to growing the 
dividend in real terms. 
We believe that the creation of shareholder 
value over the long term requires a balanced 
approach to investing in growth and 
returning excess capital to shareholders, 
whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet.  
In reviewing our capital management 
programme the Board has decided to utilise 
part of its authority to make on market 
purchase of ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares 
of up to £100 million over the coming year.
Containing and eventually eliminating 
significant liability risk and volatility from our 
pension schemes remains a high priority.  
The recently announced pension guarantee 
structure is a significant step in that direction.  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 17

REvIEW OF ThE yEAR
DMGT has delivered a solid set of results, with 
Group underlying revenue and operating 
profit up 3% and 7% respectively and our 
operating margin increasing to 15%. 
Our international B2B companies have 
continued to grow underlying revenues, up 
7%, and profits, up 8%, reflecting the strength 
of their market positions as well as the success 
of new product launches and organic 
growth initiatives. 
We are pleased to report that our UK 
consumer business’s underlying revenue  
was flat overall in the face of continued 
challenging trading conditions, with 
circulation and digital revenue growth 
offsetting print advertising weakness. A strong 
focus on operational efficiency helped 
consumer underlying profits to grow by 7%.
73% of this year’s operating profit was 
generated from the Group’s B2B operations 
and 27% from Consumer, compared to 74% 
and 26% in 201 1 and more than half of the 
Group’s operating profits were again derived 
from outside the UK, demonstrating the 
benefits of our international diversification. 
Adjusted PBT grew by 10%, and after a higher 
tax rate compared to the prior year, adjusted 
EPS was up 7% to 49.4p. The increase in the full 
year dividend per share of 6% reflects the 
pleasing Group results and our confidence in 
the future of DMGT and its ability to generate 
sustainable earnings growth. 
BuSINESS-TO-BuSINESS SuMMARy
Our B2B operations achieved another year  
of good growth, with combined revenues of 
£899 million, 1% higher than last year, but up 
7% on an underlying basis. Reported revenue 
growth was lower than underlying growth, 
reflecting the disposal of George Little 
Management (GLM) within dmg::events and 
Sanborn within dmg::information. Combined 
B2B operating profit increased by 7%, or 8% 
on an underlying basis, with an overall B2B 
margin of 26%.
RISK MANAGEMENT SOLuTIONS
RMS delivered a solid year of revenue and 
profit growth. Revenues increased by 3% on  
a reported basis, with an underlying increase 
of 6% reflecting the disposal of the third-party 
part of RMS’s Indian operation (RMSI). 
Operating profit rose by 18%, with underlying 
profits up 7%, the difference due to the 
absence of RMSI losses in the year compared 
to the prior year’s inclusion. 
Subscriptions continued to grow well, with  
a renewal rate of approximately 95%. 
RMS enjoys multiple drivers of growth. While 
continuing to focus on its core catastrophe- 
modelling business, growth is increasingly 
being driven by new products and solutions 
such as Data Management Services and 
mortality risk analysis. Opportunities are also 
presenting themselves with new customers  
in new geographies as RMS expands 
globally. A key part of RMS’s development  
is the significant investment programme in  
a new software platform which is now firmly 
under way and is expected to generate high 
levels of future revenue growth. As a result, 
RMS increased headcount, consulting and 
hosting costs.
RMS spun off two development initiatives 
during the year. The Asia Risk Centre (ARC) 
was set up in Singapore under DMGT 
oversight. ARC is developing models for the 
agricultural insurance markets in Asia. The 
second spin-off was Praedicat which in 
partnership with the Rand Corporation is in 
the early stages of developing models for  
the liability insurance market.
The minority shareholding in RMS Japan was 
acquired from the OYO Corporation.
DMG INFORMATION
dmg::information had a good year, with 
reported revenue up 9%, or 1 1% on an 
underlying basis. Operating profit grew by a 
healthy 14%, with underlying operating profit 
up 19%.
dmg::information’s four sectors of education, 
property, finance and energy all contributed 
to growth, with a particularly strong 
performance from Hobsons serving the 
education market, and Landmark, serving 
the UK, and more recently German property 
markets with the acquisition of On-Geo.  
A series of bolt-on and adjacent sector 
investments were made. 
Its ambition to invest in must-have, high-
growth, innovative business information 
companies remains unchanged, as does its 
remit to diversify DMGT by sector, by business 
model and increasingly by geography.  Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 18
DMG EvENTS 
dmg::events delivered highly satisfactory 
results in a year which included only one  
of the three major biennial events which, 
alongside the sale of GLM, resulted in 
reported revenue being down 33%. Adjusting 
for these factors, underlying revenue 
increased by 13%, reflecting good organic 
growth across the portfolio. Reported 
operating profit decreased by 46%, but 
underlying growth of 21% was achieved.
dmg::events continued to refine its structure, 
with the disposal of Evanta, a conference 
business, announced in September, 2012. 
dmg::events is now focused on the growth 
verticals of Energy and Digital Marketing and 
in expanding its significant footprint in the 
Middle East into new countries such as Saudi 
Arabia, and into Asia.
EuROMONEy INSTITuTIONAL INvESTOR 
Euromoney’s record operating profit was  
up 9%, before its capital appreciation plan 
(CAP) expense, maintaining its impressive 
recent history of profits growth. 
These results confirm the value of 
Euromoney’s strategy to build a more resilient 
and better-focused business by increasing 
the proportion of revenues derived from 
subscription products, with subscriptions now 
accounting for nearly half of total revenues.  
A predominantly publishing-driven business 
has been transformed to one with significant 
activities in electronic information and 
database services. 
Euromoney has outperformed expectations, 
allowing management to shift its focus to 
positioning the business for growth, both  
from existing products as markets recover, 
and from investment in technology and  
new products. 
Euromoney’s performance and its shift into 
more subscription and digital activity and its 
global reach mean that the Board regards  
it as core to DMGT’s own strategic global 
growth ambitions. 
Euromoney’s separate listing on the London 
Stock Exchange has enabled it to introduce 
incentive plans which have motivated 
management to grow the company 
significantly over recent years. We remain  
a supportive shareholder, fully backing its 
management’s expansion strategy. We  
have slightly increased our equity interest  
to around 68%. 
CONSuMER MEDIA
At A&N Media, underlying revenues were  
in line with the prior year at £1,060 million,  
a decrease of 3% on a reported basis. 
Operating profit increased by 12%, with an 
operating margin of 10%. This was a very 
pleasing result in the context of continued 
challenging trading conditions in the UK, and 
is a testament to the success of our strategy 
to exploit the very best of traditional and new 
media, and bring them together in a way 
that meets the constant and rapidly 
changing demands of our consumers. 
Digitalisation and advances in technology 
have given A&N Media the ability to be more 
productive and efficient. Introducing less 
labour-intensive processes has enabled  
costs to be taken out of the business without 
sacrificing quality. This drive for efficiency  
has delivered a leaner and more robust 
foundation on which to grow, with 
headcount at A&N Media reducing  
by 855 (12%) in the year. 
ASSOCIATED NEWSPAPERS 
The Mail titles continued to outperform the 
market, with circulation revenues growing  
by 3% due to the benefit of cover price 
increases. Market share increased to 21.6% 
and 20.8% for the Daily Mail and The Mail  
on Sunday respectively. Content has been  
at the heart of the Group’s success at 
Associated and we continue to invest  
in editorial quality. Metro, the Group’s  
free newspaper, also continued to  
perform strongly. 
MailOnline had an excellent year, becoming 
the world’s most visited newspaper website, 
with 106 million global unique browsers in 
August, 2012. Revenues grew by 74% and the 
business was profitable in the second half of 
the year. The international expansion of 
MailOnline continued apace, and will  
be a key aspect driving its long-term  
growth potential.
Other digital initiatives, such as Wowcher,  
our consumer daily deals voucher business, 
saw strong growth and attracted additional 
investment in marketing and promotion. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 19
Directors’ Report
Governance
Financial Statements
A&N Media’s recruitment and property 
online portals both had an exciting year. 
Evenbase, our online recruitment businesses, 
acquired Jobrapido to establish an 
international footprint for expansion. At the 
end of May, The Digital Property Group 
merged with Zoopla to create a world-class 
property search platform and a genuine 
contender to challenge the dominant UK 
market leader. Our consumer digital 
revenues across all our consumer digital 
platforms including MailOnline, metro.co.uk, 
Evenbase, Zoopla Property Group and 
Wowcher were in the region of £140 million  
on a pro forma basis in 2012. 
As a result of circulation revenue growth and 
strong progress in digital revenues, overall 
underlying revenues at Associated were up 
2% in the year, despite another challenging 
year for print advertising.
NORThCLIFFE MEDIA 
Northcliffe’s revenue performance, down 
10% on a reported basis, reflects another 
difficult year for the UK regional press and 
continued advertising pressure. The lower 
underlying revenue decline of 6% reflects  
our efforts to transition the portfolio of titles, 
including the conversion of several titles from 
a daily to weekly basis. The transformation of 
the cost base continued rapidly, with costs 
down a further 15% in the year. This resulted in 
Northcliffe’s operating profit increasing by an 
impressive 54%, achieving a margin of 12%.
OuTLOOK 
We have entered our new financial year  
with our companies performing well and  
in line with our expectations. All of our  
B2B businesses are expected to deliver 
underlying revenue and profit growth in  
the year ahead. On the consumer side,  
we expect stable revenues and margins, 
reflecting an uncertain advertising 
environment balanced against continued 
growth in digital areas.
RMS has started the year as expected, with a 
solid sales pipeline and a range of significant 
development programmes in place. RMS 
expects to achieve revenue growth in the 
high to mid-single digits, a slight decline from 
the trend of recent years, as it focuses its sales 
efforts on preparing for the new generation 
of products. RMS is expected to deliver a 
slightly reduced margin of around 30% as 
investment increases ahead of the launch 
in 2014. 
dmg::information expects to drive double- 
digit organic growth as the portfolio of 
businesses continues to benefit from new 
product initiatives and stronger customer 
demand. The Education and Property 
businesses will continue to be key drivers  
of overall growth, with Energy expected  
to gather further momentum during the  
year. We expect operating margins to  
be maintained.
At dmg::events, our refocused portfolio is 
expected to deliver double-digit underlying 
growth and it will also benefit from two of the 
three major biennial events taking place this 
financial year. Margins are anticipated to be 
around 25%. 
Euromoney’s first quarter trading has started 
in line with expectations. The uncertainty  
over Europe remains, as does a solution to 
the pending US fiscal cliff. Meanwhile global 
financial institutions face the combined 
challenges of difficult markets, increased 
capital requirements and a tougher 
regulatory environment. Inevitably they  
have responded by cutting costs, particularly 
people, and exiting some parts of their 
business. The Euromoney board expects this 
challenging trading background to continue 
at least into the early part of 2013. 
Subscriptions account for half of Euromoney’s 
revenues and therefore provide some 
protection against weak markets in 2013,  
as does Euromoney’s reliance on emerging 
markets for more than a third of its revenues. 
However, the negative trends in advertising 
and delegate revenues in the last quarter are 
expected to continue into the first quarter of 
financial year 2013, although the outlook for 
event sponsorship is more positive.
Within A&N Media, national advertising 
revenue at Associated in the first seven weeks 
of the year was down 5% on last year, with 
digital continuing to grow strongly, but 
visibility remaining limited on print advertising. 
Overall, Associated expects to achieve 
broadly stable revenues in the year, with  
cost efficiency helping to maintain operating 
margins at around 9%.
For the Group as a whole, we will continue  
to invest in order to secure future growth and 
ensure that our financial and talent resources 
are appropriately managed. My colleagues 
and I remain confident that DMGT is well 
placed for 2013 and beyond.

BuSINESS DESCRIPTION
RMS continues to focus primarily on the 
commercial catastrophe-modelling business, 
which includes modelling of natural hazards 
risks such as earthquake, hurricane and 
flood, as well as terrorism risk and risk from 
pandemic diseases. Its primary market is the 
global property and casualty re/insurance 
industry, where it currently serves hundreds  
of customers around the world. Products  
and services are developed and delivered 
through the activity of more than 1,000 RMS 
employees in North America, Europe, India, 
Japan and China. RMS models are deeply 
embedded in risk decision-making processes 
throughout the re/insurance vertical, 
including insurance companies, insurance 
and reinsurance brokers, reinsurers and the 
capital markets. In addition, RMS also 
provides models and solutions in the capital 
markets and life insurance industries.
STRATEGy
RMS’s primary strategic focus continues to be 
its new platform, now branded as RMS(one), 
which is designed to provide complete 
solutions in the cloud for its clients across the 
re/insurance value chain, including access to 
sophisticated models, an ability to integrate 
those models into enterprise-wide business 
processes, and analytics to help clients make 
better decisions. Clients seek upstream 
capability to acquire and manage high 
quality exposure data, and downstream 
capability to open and interpret the models, 
and then apply these insights to deliver 
targeted decision support for underwriting, 
pricing and managing their business. RMS 
has undertaken a significant development 
effort of its new software platform, RMS(one), 
and is working towards a release in mid 2014 
to deliver the full range of new capabilities 
and solutions to its global client base. In the 
meantime, RMS continues to pursue selected 
growth areas in its Core modelling franchise, 
as well as in its Capital Markets and  
LifeRisks initiatives.

reported basis, revenues increased by 3% 
and operating profits by 18%, which includes 
the benefit of capitalising software 
development expenses related to RMS(one), 
a program that is expected to continue 
through to the launch in 2014. 
BuSINESS MODEL
RMS leads the market for delivering 
scientifically-based catastrophe models that 
have become the standard in the industry for 
quantifying and managing catastrophe risk. 
The main revenue streams are from licensing 
the models through an annual subscription 
model, but RMS also provides a range of 
professional services that are complementary 
to the core modelling business. RMS’s client 
relationships are characterised by their 
longevity and high renewal rates. Over the 
past 10 years, RMS has invested over $200 
million in developing and updating its 
products to incorporate the latest in scientific 
research and enhance model resolution, 
which is delivered to clients through the 
release of annual updates. 
MARKET ENvIRONMENT
The re-insurance industry experienced  
slow growth in 2012 as a result of poor  
global economic decisions, and the  
lingering financial effects of the worldwide 
catastrophes in 201 1. Many in the industry  
are experiencing pressure to cut costs and 
exit lines of business perceived to be too risky. 
In addition, there was greater M&A activity  
in 2012 as weaker performing companies 
became acquisition targets.

SEGMENT BuSINESS PERFORMANCE
Core business
RMS’s core business, which includes natural 
catastrophe and terrorism modelling,  
was impacted by slower growth in the 
re-insurance industry. The core business relies 
heavily upon existing clients expanding their 
relationship with RMS by licensing additional 
models and services. In a year where many 
clients were tightening their budgets, this 
proved to be a challenge. In an effort to seize 
new opportunities for growth, RMS continued 
to invest in new markets for its core suite  
of models.
Capital Markets
The insurance-linked securities market 
rebounded in 2012, with strong demand and 
an influx of new capital driving a forecast 
$6 billion of issuance for the year. RMS 
participated in a number of transactions, 
particularly related to the transfer of life and 
health risk (excess mortality and longevity). 
The capital markets business continued to 
face headwinds from the adoption of the 
version 1 1 models, but RMS was able to 
establish itself as the leading portfolio risk 
management platform provider amongst ILS 
funds, with the vast majority of the dedicated 
ILS funds now RMS users. RMS continues to 
see major growth opportunities in the capital 
markets space, especially around longevity 
risk transfer. 
LifeRisks
RMS’s LifeRisks business has developed 
innovative models for the life insurance 
industry to manage the risk of excess 
mortality and the longevity risk associated 
with pensions and annuities. RMS tools have 
been instrumental in helping companies 
aggressively grow through risk swaps and 
acquisitions. The power and transparency of 
RMS’s model methodologies is leading many 
insurers to adopt RMS technology for use in 
their response to Solvency II capital adequacy 
tests. In 2012, LifeRisks’ growth trajectory  
was modestly slower than planned due  
to the complexity of model and software 
development, along with regulator delays in 
implementing Solvency II, but RMS remains 
bullish on the prospects for the initiative.
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
2013 represents a key pre-launch period for 
RMS in advance of the release of RMS(one), 
scheduled for mid 2014. The investment 
programmes established in support of all its 
new initiatives will continue throughout 2013 
and are expected to result in similar growth 
characteristics as in 2012. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 24

BuSINESS DESCRIPTION
dmg::information operates B2B information 
companies in four sectors, namely Property 
Information (Environmental Data Resources, 
Landmark Information Group and BuildFax), 
Educational Information (Hobsons), Energy 
Information (Genscape) and Financial 
Information (Trepp and Lewtan). We also 
have a number of strategic investments in  
the property information sector, including 
Xceligent, Real Capital Analytics and 
TreppPort.
dmg::information’s business model prioritises 
annual subscriptions and highly repetitive 
transactions, which account for 85% of the 
total revenue, and all our businesses are 
market leaders providing their clients with 
crucial, mission-critical information.
ACTIvITy WIThIN ThE REPORTING yEAR
dmg::information’s underlying revenues and 
profits both grew strongly in the year at 1 1% 
and 19% respectively, largely driven by strong 
organic growth and complemented by the 
performance of small bolt-on acquisitions.
Reported revenue increased by 9% to £253 
million and reported operating profits 
increased by 14% to £48 million, with margins 
up to 19% from 18%.
BuSINESS MODEL
As a portfolio of B2B information businesses, 
dmg::information has a variety of business 
models. The majority of our revenue is made 
up of high renewal rate, recurring subscription 
fees and high-repeat transactions. 
MARKET ENvIRONMENT
The markets we serve are large and 
complex. Information volumes grow 
exponentially and our professional customers 
look to our portfolio companies to provide 
them with unique, must-have content, 
incisive and timely analyses and powerful, 
flexible analytics. In many cases, our datasets 
are proprietary and extremely difficult to 
replicate and we are seen as class leaders  
in the markets we serve.
PROPERTy INFORMATION
Underlying revenues from the property 
information businesses grew by 1 1% while 
underlying profits grew by 25%. Revenues 
and profits were £106 million and £24 million 
respectively, representing the largest of our 
business sectors and accounting for 42%  
of revenues.
The market conditions have remained 
relatively benign in both the UK housing 
market, served by Landmark, and the 
commercial real estate market in the UK  
and US, served by Landmark and EDR 
respectively. Our revenues are influenced by 
transaction volumes which have grown only 
marginally year on year. Underlying revenues 
in the UK and US grew by 6% in aggregate.
In 201 1 we acquired On-Geo in Germany, 
complementing our existing German 
business, and we have enjoyed a highly 
successful year with underlying revenues 
growing strongly and integration plans 
ahead of schedule.
BuildFax, a provider of planning consent 
(building permits) and related property 
information to the US insurance and financial 
services markets, is an early-stage business 
that continues to develop well.
In April, we made a strategic investment in 
Xceligent, one of only two companies in the 
US that provides fully researched property 
and listing information to the commercial real 
estate community. Since our initial investment 
the business has developed in line with 
expectations and we are supporting the 
expansion of its strategy to increase the 
number of major US locations covered.

EDuCATION INFORMATION
Hobsons, our educational information 
business, enjoyed a very successful year. 
Underlying revenues increased by 20%  
and reported revenues by 27% as we  
also completed two important bolt-on 
acquisitions. 
In February we acquired PrepMe, providing 
sophisticated software to guide students in 
college preparation tests, and in December 
acquired Intelliworks, providing subscription-
based software services to higher education 
institutions that are highly complementary 
with Hobsons’ existing business.
Hobsons is growing strongly in both its K-12 
division, serving US high schools, and its HE 
division, serving higher education institutions 
in both the US and internationally. Our 
strategy is to continue to develop must-have 
products in both these divisions and to 
extend our footprint internationally.
ENERGy INFORMATION
Genscape, the market-leading provider of 
real-time ‘supply-side’ energy information, 
has continued to grow. Underlying revenues 
grew by 7% but this underplays the increasing 
momentum in the business which grew  
net bookings by 13% in the second half  
of the year and launched some exciting  
new initiatives.
We have invested significantly in both 
products and people. As a result, the  
business is well positioned for the future,  
with a strengthened management team,  
an expanded sales force and a number  
of newly launched products, with more  
in the pipeline.
Genscape is a thought-leader and innovator 
in its market. During the year we launched  
a compliance and information service that 
will provide physical verification of biodiesel 
production in the US and, in addition to this 
organic growth initiative, have also added 
modelling and forecasting capabilities with  
a small bolt-on acquisition of a company 
called SpringRock.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The fragility that has existed in the financial 
information market for the last couple of 
years continued to prevail through 2012. In 
these challenging market conditions we are 
pleased that our businesses serving this 
sector. Trepp and Lewtan, grew underlying 
revenues by 2%.
Trepp, the market leader of information 
about Commercial Mortgage-Backed 
Securities (CMBS), provides information that  
is mission critical to participants in the CMBS 
marketplace and has also successfully 
expanded its product offerings with new 
products targeted at banks and other  
loan providers.
Lewtan, offering products to both investors 
and issuers in the asset-backed securities 
market, continued to improve their market 
position with the delivery of several important 
new product enhancements. 
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
Our property and financial information 
businesses are exposed to the cyclicality of 
the UK and US property and financial markets 
which remain subdued. Despite this 
headwind, our continuous investment in 
innovation has resulted in a strong and 
continuing pipeline of new products and 
services that continue to propel our growth. 
Furthermore, individual market issues are 
attenuated through the portfolio effect  
of our businesses.
Overall we operate in long-term, attractive 
grow markets that are global in scope such 
as education, energy and property. These 
markets have extended runways for growth. 
The explosive growth of information and 
technology in these areas means a strong 
and steady demand for support and insight 
from specialist businesses such as ours. We 
enjoy deep relationships with our customers 
which help us to identify and then deliver 
innovative new products and services that 
help our customers find the ‘signal’ amongst 
the ‘noise’ . Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 26

dmg::events organises B2B exhibitions with 
associated conferences focusing on the 
energy, construction and digital marketing 
sectors. Events are held across 12 countries 
including the US, UK, Canada and the United 
Arab Emirates. 
ACTIvITy WIThIN ThE yEAR
dmg::events enjoyed a strong year with 
growth in underlying revenues of 13% and 
underlying profits increasing by 21%. 
Reported revenue reduced by 33% to £89 
million and reported operating profits 
reduced by 46% to £21 million, due to the 
disposal of GLM in September, 201 1 and the 
cycle of biennial shows which meant only 
one of dmg::events’ large biennials occurred 
in 2012 compared with two in the prior year.
At the end of the financial year dmg::events 
completed the disposal of Evanta,  
a leadership and conferences business,  
as we continue to focus our capital and 
talent resources towards further expanding 
our fast-growing businesses operating in the 
Middle East and Asia region, and energy  
and digital marketing sectors.
BuSINESS MODEL
dmg::events organises B2B events with the 
majority of revenue derived from trade  
show exhibitors, conference attendees  
and corporate sponsors. Unlike consumer 
trade shows, admittance is a nominal 
revenue stream. 
Following the disposal of Evanta in 
September, 2012 our exposure to sponsorship 
revenues has been significantly reduced. 
MARKET ENvIRONMENT
dmg::events organises B2B events serving the 
energy and digital marketing sectors as well 
as the geographical Middle East market. Our 
brands are class leaders in their respective 
arenas and include the Big 5, Adipec, 
Gastech, the Global Petroleum Show and 
ad::tech to name a few. Our exhibitors and 
attendees are the professionals in these fast- 
changing markets for whom face-to-face 
meeting opportunities are a critical part of 
their annual calendars.
PERFORMANCE
In the Energy sector, underlying revenue 
growth was impressive at 22%, with a 
particularly good performance from the 
Global Petroleum Show (GPS), held biennially 
in Calgary, Canada and supplemented  
by a number of successful new launches.
High energy prices drive continued 
investment in energy development and 
technology, which along with deep market 
connection, drive the growth of our events.
Gastech, held in London in November 2012  
is a market-leading brand that is extending  
its reach through the launch of a series of 
complementary regional satellite events.
The digital marketing-focused business is 
centred around the ad:tech shows and 
conferences, with significant events held 
annually in New York, San Francisco and 
London and recent new launches in Tokyo, 
New Delhi and Singapore. Overall, 
underlying revenues grew by 5%.
dmg::events operates a number of market-
leading events in the Middle East, organised 
by our operations based in Dubai. The largest 
events are the annual Big 5 show, serving the 
construction sector, and the biennial Adipec 
show, serving the Energy sector. 
In 2012, Big 5 continued to grow despite 
difficult economic conditions through the 
continued success of its geo-cloning 
programme in Saudi Arabia. Overall we 
enjoyed a very satisfactory 15% underlying 
revenue growth in the Middle East region, 
fuelled by an aggressive launch programme.
Additionally, we are pleased to have 
reached an agreement to hold the large 
Adipec event in Abu Dhabi annually with 
effect from 2014.
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
Our events in the United Arab Emirates  
have traditionally enjoyed a high degree  
of participation from European delegations 
and exhibitors. The recent economic 
downturn has proved challenging for those 
exhibitors. However, our brands are big, 
strong, class-leaders and thus have proved 
remarkably resilient and have responded by 
forging deeper relationships with emerging 
Asian and intra-regional exhibitors.
Strong brands in growing sectors allied to 
powerful relationships position dmg::events 
well for the future. Our brands lend 
themselves to geo-cloning. Our sector 
expertise lends itself to the creation of 
adjacent products such as conferences and 
online services and our relationships facilitate 
a high velocity of new show launches.

BuSINESS DESCRIPTION
Euromoney is a leading international  
B2B media group focused primarily  
on the international finance, metals and 
commodities sectors. It publishes more than 
70 titles in both print and online formats and  
is a leading provider of electronic research 
and data. It also runs an extensive portfolio  
of conferences, seminars and training 
courses for financial markets.
STRATEGy
Euromoney’s strategy remains focused  
on the building of a robust and tightly 
focused global online information business 
with an emphasis on emerging markets. This 
strategy is being executed through 
increasing the proportion of revenues 
derived from electronic subscription 
products; using technology efficiently to assist 
the online migration of print products as well 
as developing new electronic information 
services; investing in products of the highest 
quality; eliminating products with a low 
margin or too high a dependence on print 
advertising; maintaining tight cost control  
at all times, and retaining and fostering  
an entrepreneurial culture.
Driving revenue growth from existing as well 
as new products is a key part of Euromoney’s 
strategy. Since 2010, the business has been 
investing heavily in technology and content 
delivery platforms, particularly for the mobile 
user, and in new digital products as part of its 
transition to an online information business.  
In 2012, as in 201 1, Euromoney spent 
approximately £10 million on this transition, 
which is expected to continue in 2013. In 
addition, work has commenced to build  
a new platform for authoring, storing and 
presenting content, with a view to both 
improving the quality of existing subscription 
products and increasing the speed to market 
of new online information services. This 
project is expected to have a capital cost  
of approximately £6 million in 2013.
ACTIvITy IN ThE REPORTING yEAR
Acquisitions remain a key part of the 
Euromoney strategy. In February, Euromoney 
purchased Global Grain for £6 million. Global 
Grain’s main asset, Global Grain Geneva,  
is the world’s leading event for international 
grain traders. The event is held in November 
each year and is on track to exceed last 
year’s attendance by at least 10%, while  
an event for the Asia-Pacific region was 
launched successfully in March and two 
further new events are planned for 2013.

Research and data
The business provides a number of 
subscription-based research and data 
services for financial markets. 
MARKET ENvIRONMENT
The outlook for financial markets remains 
challenging. The continuing uncertainty  
over the future of the Eurozone, along with 
increasing political instability in the region, is 
holding back growth and causing European 
financial institutions to implement tough  
cost measures. In contrast, sentiment for US 
markets is improving, and emerging markets 
remain in reasonable health as measures to 
control inflation in key markets such as China 
appear to be working. 
PERFORMANCE
Total revenues for the year increased by 9% to 
£394 million. Underlying revenues, excluding 
acquisitions, increased by 2%. The acquisition 
of Ned Davis Research (NDR) in August 201 1 
has helped increase the proportion of 
revenues generated from subscriptions  
to more than 50% for the first time. Headline 
subscription revenues increased by 17% to 
£200 million and underlying subscriptions, 
excluding NDR, by 5%, with growth driven 
largely by electronic information services 
industry BCA Research and CEIC Data.

A 7% fall in advertising revenues reflects two 
very different trends. Financial titles have 
experienced falls of as much as 20% in the 
face of deep cuts by global financial 
institutions. But this has been partly offset  
by increases in online advertising, a greater 
appetite for print advertising from emerging 
markets and growth in advertising from 
sectors outside finance, particularly energy. 
Event revenues broadly comprise an equal 
mix of sponsorship and paying delegates. 
Event sponsorship, which is heavily financial 
market focused, has suffered in a similar way 
to advertising, although to a lesser degree. 
Events, particularly those outside the financial 
sector which tend to be more delegate 
driven, performed well in the first half but 
growth has been more difficult to achieve  
in the second and some smaller events  
were cut. 
The adjusted operating margin was 28%,  
up 2% on the prior year. Costs, particularly 
headcount, have remained tightly controlled 
throughout the year. At the same time, the 
group has increased its investment in 
technology and new products as part  
of its online growth strategy. 
Euromoney derives nearly two-thirds of its 
total revenue in US dollars and movements  
in the sterling-US dollar rate can have  
a significant impact on reported revenues. 
However, this was not the case in 2012 and 
headline revenue growth rates are similar  
to those at constant currency. 
BuSINESS REvIEW
Financial Publishing: revenues fell by 8%  
to £77 million and adjusted operating profits 
by 12% to £25 million. Advertising, which 
accounts for approximately half the division’s 
revenues, has been under pressure all year 
from cuts in spend by global financial 
institutions as well as a gradual shift away 
from print advertising across the sector.  
As a result, financial advertising fell by 13%, 
although the impact of more severe cuts  
by Wall Street banks was offset by a stronger 
performance from emerging markets which 
helped sustain titles such as Euromoney  
and Asiamoney. Revenues from subscription 
products were flat, helped by the launch  
of new products. 
Business Publishing: Euromoney’s activities 
outside finance cover a number of sectors 
including metals, commodities, energy, 
telecoms and law, and provide a strong 
counterbalance to the more volatile 
financial publishing division. Revenues 
increased by 9% to £65 million and adjusted 
operating profits by 5% to £25 million, with 
growth achieved from both advertising, 
particularly in the energy sector, and 
subscriptions, for which Metal Bulletin is the 
biggest driver. This year is the first that profits 
from Business Publishing have been similar  
to those from Financial Publishing.
Training: Euromoney’s training division 
predominantly serves the global financial 
sector. However, more than half its revenues 
are derived from emerging markets, and this 
has helped mitigate the impact of cuts in 
bank headcount and training budgets. 
Training revenues fell by 4% to £31 million and 
adjusted operating profits by 1 1% to £7 million. 
The decline in operating margin from 24% to 
22% was largely due to the completion at the 
end of 201 1 of a long-term training contract 
in Asia, and the margin in the second half 
recovered to 25%. 
Conferences and Seminars: revenues 
comprise both sponsorship and paying 
delegates and increased by 7% to £92 
million, with adjusted operating profits up 9% 
to £29 million. After a strong first half, markets 
became more challenging during the third 
quarter, the most important of the year for 
the events businesses. Financial market 
events, with a heavy emphasis on 
sponsorship revenues, have been under 
pressure from cost cutting among global 
financial institutions. In contrast, events in 
sectors outside finance, particularly in the 
commodities and energy sectors, have 
performed better. The division also generates 
nearly 20% of its revenues from subscriptions 
to membership organisations for the  
asset management industry. These have 
continued to grow, helped by a significant 
investment in Institutional Investor’s  
Investor Intelligence Network, a private  
online community for senior executives  
from institutional investors and asset  
owners worldwide.
Research and Data: revenues are derived 
predominantly from subscriptions and 
increased by 25% to £130 million. Underlying 
growth, excluding NDR, was 6%. The trends 
seen in the first half have continued, with  
the main drivers of growth being BCA, the 
group’s independent macroeconomic 
research house, CEIC, the emerging market 
data provider, and the capital market 
databases run as a joint venture with 
Dealogic. Renewal rates for all these 
products have held up well, although  
new sales have been harder to generate. 
Adjusted operating profits increased  
by 30% to £55 million including a £9 million 
contribution from NDR. 
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
The uncertainty over Europe remains, as  
does a solution to the pending US fiscal cliff. 
Meanwhile global financial institutions face 
the combined challenges of difficult markets, 
increased capital requirements and a 
tougher regulatory environment. Inevitably 
they have responded by cutting costs, 
particularly people, and exiting some parts 
of their business. The board expects this 
challenging trading background to continue 
at least into the early part of 2013. 
Subscriptions account for half of Euromoney’s 
revenues and therefore provide some 
protection against weak markets in 2013, as 
does the group’s reliance on emerging 
markets for more than a third of its revenues. 
However, the negative trends in advertising 
and delegate revenues in the last quarter are 
expected to continue into the first quarter of 
financial year 2013, although the outlook for 
event sponsorship is more positive. First- 
quarter trading has started in line with the 
board’s expectations but as usual at this time, 
forward revenue visibility beyond the first 
quarter is limited, other than for subscriptions. 
For 2013, Euromoney plans to continue its 
programme of investing in the digital 
transformation of its publishing businesses 
and in improving the quality of its products. 
The board is confident its strategy for investing 
in new products and digital publishing and 
using its strong balance sheet to fund 
acquisitions, its exposure to emerging 
markets, and its tight control of operating 
costs will continue to sustain it through these 
difficult market conditions. As the world 
economy begins an albeit slow recovery, 
financial and other markets will also 
gradually improve, enhancing our prospects.  Strategic Report 29

BuSINESS DESCRIPTION
A&N Media, the consumer media company 
of DMGT plc, is a leading international 
multi-channel media company comprising 
Associated Newspapers and Northcliffe 
Media. The portfolio includes iconic 
newspaper titles such as the Daily Mail, The 
Mail on Sunday, Metro, over 70 local 
newspapers, an extensive network of local 
web portals, MailOnline, Evenbase (an 
international digital recruitment business), 
Wowcher (a daily deals business) and a 
52.3% interest in the Zoopla Property Group. 
STRATEGy 
A&N Media has transitioned in recent years 
to focus on market-leading assets which will 
be the material profit generators of the 
future. Over the next three years, the business 
will continue its transformation, investing  
in its digital businesses in order to rebalance 
revenues from print towards digital to evolve 
the business to reflect broader changes in 
consumer media consumption. 
Over the last 12 months, the business has 
streamlined its portfolio, exiting assets that 
are non-core or unable to deliver sizeable 
profits. This has resulted in the sale of motors.
co.uk, Teletext Holidays, and the merger of 
the Digital Property Group with Zoopla to 
create a strong business in the online 
property market. In April 2012, Jobrapido, the 
number two global job search engine in the 
world, was acquired. Jobrapido delivers over 
850 million visits per year in more than 50 
countries. The A&N Media portfolio is now 
simpler with a focus on a smaller number of 
objectives for growth aligned to its core assets.
On 21st November, 2012, the company 
announced it had exchanged contracts for 
the disposal of its Northcliffe Media division  
to Local World in return for £52.5 million cash 
and a 38.7% holding in Local World.
MARKET ENvIRONMENT 
The boundaries of where A&N Media’s 
businesses operate and compete have 
extended over recent years as it enters new 
adjacent markets, utilises new channels such 
as mobile and tablet, and deploys different 
business models. As the competitive silos 
between media channels are broken down, 
the business faces competition from a 
growing range of competitors for advertising 
revenues and customer engagement.
By developing and extending products and 
services into these high-growth advertising 
areas and expanding internationally, the 
business is positioning itself well for the 
changing market environment, whilst the 
enduring strength of its newspaper assets  
will ensure it outperforms the broader 
newspaper market and provides the strong 
support to enable this transition.
PERFORMANCE
Reported revenues
#
 for the year were £1,060
 
million, an underlying increase of £1 million  
or 0.1%, though 3% lower on a reported basis, 
mainly reflecting the disposal of Motors, 
Property and Travel digital businesses during 
the year and the loss of low-margin printing 
contracts. The testing economic conditions 
adversely affected both Northcliffe’s 
classified revenues and the Mail titles’ display 
advertising revenues, although the latter 
showed a marked improvement in the last 
four months of the year. 
Although investment continues to be made 
(headcount and promotional activity mainly) 
in the digital businesses, a reduction in the 
price of newsprint, headcount reducing by 
855 (12%) during the year and continued 
tight control over all expenditure, led to  
a 5% reduction in costs.

• Costs £16 million or 2% lower than last year 
– headcount 530 (12%) lower, Derby press 
closed in first half of the year.
DIvISIONAL PERFORMANCE REvIEW
After a difficult first half, which saw profits 
significantly lower than last year (in part due 
to lower display revenues at the two Mail  
print titles and to increased investment  
in our digital businesses, headcount and 
promotional activity) the second half of the 
year has seen a marked improvement with 
better performances from print display 
advertising, non-repeated net costs incurred 
last year following The News of the World 
closure and a reduction in newsprint prices 
from July, 2012.
Total revenues were down £15 million  
or 2%, due mainly to the impact of disposed 
businesses, printing contracts ending and 
lower display revenues from the two Mail 
titles. Improved revenues were seen from  
the Daily Mail cover price increases, Metro, 
MailOnline, Wowcher and the Evenbase 
digital recruitment businesses, resulting in  
total underlying revenues of £834 million, 2% 
ahead of last year. Total advertising revenues 
of £389 million, excluding acquisitions and 
disposals, were unchanged from last year. 
The reported fall in national print revenues, 
the growth of digital, the reduced price of 
newsprint and cost-savings following the 
closure of the press at Derby in the first half  
of the year resulted in operating profit for the 
year increasing by £2 million (+3%) to £78 
million. Operating margins rose by 0.4% to 
9.2%. Including a significantly improved 
performance from associate companies 
(principally Zoopla and Mail Today in India), 
profits of £81 million this year were £8 million 
(1 1%) better than last year. 
An exceptional operating charge of £60 
million (£35 million of which was non-cash) 
was made for restructuring and closure costs, 
the largest portion relating to print site 
restructuring and closures and to severance 
costs relating to the reduction in headcount 
as reported above. 
uK NEWSPAPER-RELATED OPERATIONS
Circulation revenues grew by £10 million (3%) 
to £353 million. Lower copy sales were offset 
by the full-year benefit of cover prices 
increases in the final quarter of the 201 1 
financial year and from the temporary price 
discounting by The Mail on Sunday last year, 
in an initiative to attract new readers 
following the closure of The News of the 
World in July 201 1. 
Advertising revenues were 2% lower at £332 
million, a strong performance by Metro and 
MailOnline in particular offset lower revenues 
on both Mail titles. Our three largest 
categories, retail, travel and financial saw 
revenues decline by 7%, 16% and 10% 
respectively, but there was a 6% growth in 
total from other categories. Overall trends 
have improved, with a 6% decline in the  
first half of the year but 2% growth in the 
second half.
Print advertising revenues declined by 6% this 
year, but digital revenue from the newspaper 
titles’ companion sites increased by 72% to 
£31 million.

Mail Newspapers 
BuSINESS DESCRIPTION
Mail Newspapers comprises the UK’s biggest 
selling mid-market newspapers, the Daily 
Mail and The Mail on Sunday. 
STRATEGy AND ACTIvITy
Mail Newspapers has defined its vision for  
the next three years as ‘More women, More 
engaged with More Mail’ . Whilst women  
are not the only audience, the Mail titles are 
uniquely placed with this audience to have  
a bias and scale that other newspapers  
can’t replicate.
Working cohesively with the existing and 
emerging digital businesses, Mail 
Newspapers is targeting revenue growth 
from both direct-to-business and direct-to-
consumer channels, including offering 
broader marketing solutions for clients. 
There has been a continued drive to reduce 
the cost base of both titles, yielding significant 
annual savings, which has included further 
rationalisation of production facilities, 
de-manning, lower newsprint usage, greater 
promotional efficiency and reduced 
distribution charges.
This year has seen the successful 
development of the Mail Rewards Club, now 
rolled out to seven days, and grown to 
750,000 members, to help support circulation 
whilst opening up a range of new direct-to-
consumer revenue opportunities. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 32
MARKET ENvIRONMENT
Print advertising continues to face  
a challenging market environment. 
Technology changes such as the rise  
of tablets and eReaders and increasing 
non-traditional entertainment and news 
sources continue to pose a challenge to the 
traditional print products. Mail Newspapers 
aims to tackle and capitalise upon these 
changes by increasing distribution through 
digital devices and by strengthening 
engagement with the brand outside  
of the traditional newspaper environment.
PERFORMANCE
Over the year, the Daily Mail increased  
its circulation revenue by 4% to £257 million, 
benefiting from the full-year impact of the 
July, 201 1 5 pence weekday cover price 
increase and also 10 pence Saturday edition 
increase in October, 201 1. Its share of the 
national daily newspaper market rose by 
0.6% to 21.6%, a new record. Average daily 
circulation declined by 5.4% to 1.96 million 
copies, but outperformed the rest of the  
daily market which declined by 8.5%. 
The Mail on Sunday’s circulation revenue 
remained broadly stable at £96 million. The 
title continued to grow its share of the total 
market, increasing share by 0.2% to 20.8%, 
despite the launch of Sun on Sunday in 
February. Average daily circulation declined 
by 6.7% to 1.85 million, against a market that 
contracted by 7 .7%. 
Print advertising revenues declined by 10%, 
after allowing for one fewer issue of The Mail 
on Sunday. There was, however, a marked 
improvement in revenue during the second 
half of the year, and particularly the final 
quarter when advertising declined by  
a more modest 5%.
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
Further cost savings are planned next  
year, most notably the transfer of Mail 
Newspapers’ main print facilities from Surrey 
Quays to Thurrock in the summer of 2013, 
which will yield material reductions in the 
underlying cost base and create greater 
efficiency of internal resources.
A paid-for tablet version of the Daily Mail  
and The Mail on Sunday, Mail Plus, will be 
launched in the first quarter of the new 
financial year.
MailOnline 
BuSINESS DESCRIPTION AND STRATEGy
MailOnline grew its audience significantly 
during the year to become the world’s 
largest online news site, surpassing The New 
York Times and reaching a new high of 106 
million browsers during August 2012, a 41% 
year-on-year increase. Daily unique browsers 
leapt by more than 50% to 6.4 million in 
September, 2012, of which 2.8 million were  
in the in UK and 1.7 million in the US. During 
the year, an Indian version of the site was 
launched supported by content from  
Mail Today.
ACTIvITy
The number of users accessing MailOnline  
on a mobile device has grown to now 
account for 34% of daily visits to MailOnline,  
in addition our iPhone, iPad and Android 
apps have gained UK market-leading levels 
of engagement with more than 445,000  
users every day.
Advertising revenue is growing more rapidly 
than our audience, up 74% year on year to 
reach £27 million. This growth comes from 
strong demand for premium advertising in 
the UK market, as well as increasing demand 
for MailOnline advertising inventory in other 
parts of the world, such as the USA, Canada 
and Australia. Mobile and video revenues 
are also showing strong growth. MailOnline 
was profitable in the UK in the second half  
of the year
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
Over the next year MailOnline will continue  
to increase investment to expand the 
editorial bureaus opened in New York and 
Los Angeles where our content is already well 
received. The existing team of video editors  
in the UK and US will be built upon to match 
the commercial appetite for video inventory 
as well as starting to test longer-term 
video-creation strategies.
Commercially the US sales team will be 
expanded to capitalise on increasing traffic 
and awareness in the US market. In the UK 
delivering even deeper partnerships with 
larger advertisers coupled with innovative 
advertising formats are expected to support 
MailOnline in continuing to outperform the 
market, with strong revenue growth 
expected to continue. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 33

Metro
BuSINESS DESCRIPTION
Metro is a consumer media brand targeting 
urbanites, a segment of hard-to-reach, 
on-the-move, attitudinally young urban 
professionals. The newspaper is the UK’s third 
largest daily, read by 3.6 million commuters 
every weekday, while metro.co.uk has 
7 .5 million unique browsers per month 
(September, 2012).
STRATEGy
‘Urbanites on the move get more from  
the city with Metro.’ Addressing changing 
consumption habits, Metro is investing in 
reaching more urbanites on the move, 
through new mobile platforms, on a more 
frequent basis. Four key products underpin 
this:
• Metro editions – interactive edition-based 
products designed for tablets and 
smartphones
• metro.co.uk – optimised responsive and 
adaptive experience for smartphone, 
tablet and web consumption
• Metro Play – gaming offerings with 
compelling gameplay and social 
interaction
• Metro unEdited – a content-sharing 
platform for urbanites
This investment will shift Metro to being a 
mobile-led, urbanite lifestyle business, 
focused on driving audience engagement, 
loyalty and brand strength.
ACTIvITy
Building new mobile and digital products 
and capabilities has been a key focus over 
the last six months. The successful launch of 
Metro’s tablet edition, which won Newspaper 
App of the Year, was built upon with the 
launch of further digital editions. A redesign 
of the print product alongside a detailed 
review of logistics processes for delivery of the 
newspapers, allowed Metro to deliver record 
readership levels (+1 1% year on year).
Metro’s focus on the Olympics helped deliver 
the most successful newspaper operation in 
the market, expanding its product suite 
across both print and digital platforms and 
carrying the two largest newspaper deals  
for the Olympics in the UK. The Games 
exceeded all revenue and profit targets  
for Metro, while taking the greatest share  
of revenue and volume in the national 
newspaper market.
MARKET ENvIRONMENT AND PERFORMANCE
Despite the challenging economic 
conditions, Metro continued to outperform 
the market. Unique access to distribution 
through its contracts with transport providers 
delivers a significant competitive advantage. 
The opportunity now is for Metro to convert 
this strong print position and consumer 
relationship onto mobile devices and to 
retain this advantage. Daily mobile audience 
grew 213% in the last 12 months to over 319 
thousand whilst the proportion of mobile 
traffic to metro.co.uk has increased from  
20% to 41%. Downloads of the digital edition 
products are now in excess of 1.2 million.
Metro grew its revenues +8% (print +8%  
and digital +39%) and its profits +14%  
(on a like-for-like basis excluding strategy 
investment of £2.1 million). 
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
Metro will pursue its focus on further mobile 
product development, the mobilisation of 
content across all platforms, the launch of 
Metro Play and marketing activity to drive 
customer acquisition, frequency and  
brand engagement.
The expectation for FY13 is that a general 
decline in the national press advertising 
market coupled with the absence of the 
Olympics will negatively impact on Metro’s 
print revenues but this will be offset by 
growing digital revenues. Metro will continue 
to invest in its strategic digital priorities  
during the year.
Evenbase
BuSINESS DESCRIPTION AND STRATEGy
The digital recruitment business was renamed 
Evenbase during the year, reflecting the 
wider scope and international reach of the 
enlarged group. The business now includes 
the flagship job board brands Jobsite and 
OilCareers; the leading candidate-sourcing 
provider Broadbean; recruitment 
partnerships with brands such as the UK’s 
National Health Service (NHS) and 
Jobrapido, the number two global job 
search engine in the world. Acquired in April, 
Jobrapido delivers over 850 million visits per 
year in more than 50 countries.
Market share of national titles 
increased again.
Strong growth in MailOnline 
visitors and revenue.
Profit higher due to digital 
growth, cover price benefits 
and cost efficiencies.
Continued portfolio 
management:
 – Disposal of motors and 
Teletext business and 
acquisition of Jobrapido.
 – Merger of Digital Property 
Group with Zoopla.
Wowcher developed into  
UK’s second largest daily  
deals business.
Key developments Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 34
The Evenbase vision is to transform from  
a network of UK-based jobs’ boards, to  
an international recruitment business. The 
acquisition of Jobrapido is a key step in this 
strategy, while OilCareers and Broadbean 
continue to make successful progress in their 
international expansion into the Middle East, 
North America and AsiaPac. This strategy 
moves Evenbase beyond the UK online 
recruitment listings sector into the broader 
global recruitment market, which offers  
a range of high-growth opportunities.  
The fast adoption of mobile by consumers  
is impacting the recruitment industry, 
presenting both opportunities and 
challenges. The key Evenbase brands 
experience 20–25% of site traffic coming  
from mobile devices – and Jobsite holds the 
UK’s number-two position for mobile traffic.
MARKET ENvIRONMENT
Competition for Evenbase includes job 
boards and international aggregators as  
well as country-specific players. Through  
the combination of its assets, Evenbase  
is positioned as the fourth largest digital 
recruitment group in the world with c.41 
million monthly unique users. The key Jobsite 
brand is positioned as one of the UK’s  
largest job boards.
ACTIvITy AND PERFORMANCE
During the year the job board portfolio was 
rationalised, exiting non-core job boards, 
allowing investment and management time 
to be focused on those brands which have 
greater growth prospects.
Evenbase launched a pay-per-download 
model for CV access and ‘ Jobsite White’ , a 
simple-to-use white label job board aimed  
at SMEs, trade publications and associations. 
This year saw 1 1% growth in client numbers 
and 7% growth in candidates on a like-for-like 
basis excluding Jobrapido. Underlying 
revenues have grown 14% year on year to 
£44 million, driven by product innovation and 
international expansion. Jobrapido revenues 
for the six months post acquisition were an 
additional £14 million. 
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
International expansion remains a key  
priority for the coming year. The acquisition  
of Jobrapido delivers an opportunity to 
accelerate global expansion and investment 
continues in expanding OilCareers and 
Broadbean in other countries. For candidates 
and clients there will be more new products 
to make the recruitment process more 
straightforward and efficient, enabling 
greater choice for candidates and providing 
clients with the tools to most easily match 
talent with opportunities.
Wowcher
BuSINESS DESCRIPTION AND STRATEGy
Wowcher is A&N Media’s daily deals and 
online discounts business offering a wide 
range of both local and national deals, now 
sending an average of 3.3 million emails per 
day. Wowcher.co.uk was launched by A&N 
Media in April, 201 1 and since that time has 
grown rapidly to become the number two  
in the UK market (source: Comscore, 
September, 2012). Wowcher targets affluent, 
urban female customers largely between  
the ages of 18–44 and focuses on delivering 
deals that appeal to this audience base.  
This affluent, differentiated and attractive 
demographic allows Wowcher to compete 
effectively on the basis of consumer quality, 
which has seen high levels of merchant 
satisfaction, 76% of all merchants choosing  
to run repeat deals with the business.
There is strong synergy between Wowcher 
and the wider set of A&N Media assets. The 
business is able to leverage the existing A&N 
Media customer database assets to extend 
the reach of its deals. At the same time the 
ability to offer additional media support  
to deals through both online and in printed 
promotion of deals acts as a strong brand 
differentiator to prospective merchants. 
Wowcher was launched during 201 1  
and has been a focus point for investment, 
particularly in marketing, over this year.  
On the back of this investment Wowcher  
has had a very strong first full year of operation, 
growing the subscriber database to more 
than 1.3 million at a low cost of acquisition 
and is now operational in 14 areas across  
the UK.  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 35
Directors’ Report
Governance
Financial Statements
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
Looking forward, Wowcher intends to  
extend its offering of discounted products 
and services to its subscriber base both 
broadening the breadth and quality of daily 
deals offered and the range of additional 
discount services that the platform provides. 
Wowcher is also building tools to encourage 
site loyalty and stickiness. These investments 
include the building of a market-leading 
rewards and points programme to incentivise 
repeat engagement and purchase. 
Alongside this, Wowcher is developing  
a suite of tools to improve personalisation 
and relevancy of deals to drive increased 
engagement and purchase propensity.  
The business will continue to invest in growing 
the database through a marketing strategy 
that seeks to attract this affluent female 
subscriber base through a blend of online 
and offline media channels.
Zoopla Property Group (ZPG)
BuSINESS DESCRIPTION
This year we merged our Digital Property 
Group assets with Zoopla to form the Zoopla 
Property Group in which A&N Media holds a 
52.3% stake. The combined business is aiming 
to emerge as a leader in the digital property 
space, delivering high volumes of leads to its 
estate agent and developer members. 
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
The technical and people integration of  
the business was completed at the end  
of the year. Over the next year there will be 
significant efficiency savings from bringing 
the businesses together, as well as building  
on the opportunity that the strong platform, 
combined customer reach and lead 
generation creates for revenue growth. 
Revenue growth in the period since merger 
has been 22% and we expect to see this 
increase as the combined strength of the 
Group’s assets are brought to full effect.
Profits from our share of ZPG were £4 million 
for the four months post completion.
Central and Eastern Europe
A&N International Media’s operating profits 
(excluding associates) grew by £0.2 million

grew by 5%, with print advertising revenues 
declining by 7%, but circulation and digital 
revenues growing by 2% and 14% 
respectively. Contract printing revenues have 
also grown strongly. Digital advertising now 
represents 58% of total advertising, up from 
52% last year. Headcount has been reduced 
by 5% and significant cost savings were 
made, profit margins improving by 2% to 14%.

ACTIvITy AND PERFORMANCE REvIEW
Northcliffe’s print portfolio continued to 
attract significant management focus in  
a year challenged by sluggish advertising 
markets and a change of national sales 
house. Advertising performances continue  
to be in line or slightly better than 
comparable local media businesses. Four 
daily paid-for titles in Exeter, Torquay, Lincoln 
and Scunthorpe have been converted  
to a weekly format over the past 15 months. 
During the financial year, Northcliffe sold the 
Chew Valley Gazette, closed a further  
10 non core-free titles and purchased  
‘The Topper’ free title in Nottingham.
Digital revenues
Northcliffe digital revenues grew by an 
underlying 6% and now represent 9% of total 
revenues. Revenues not associated with a 
print sale grew to account for 30% of digital 
income, up from 1 1% last year. The strength  
of the digital offering and continued 
audience growth has enabled revenue 
increases in key categories.
The Northcliffe Digital audience has 
continued to grow with unique users across 
the thisis and localpeople networks reaching 
seven million in September, a growth of 30% 
versus last year. Currently 30% of all visits are 
by mobile.
Newspaper sales
Reported newspaper sales revenues fell  
by 6% or £3.4 million. On a like-for-like basis 
(excluding a change in accounting 
treatment for distribution costs, daily to 
weekly switches and divestments), revenues 
were up 1%. Cover price increases were 
implemented across the majority of titles 
where prices had historically been below  
the industry average.
For the January to June, 2012 ABC period, 
circulation of the dailies was down 8.8% in 
line with the average decline experienced 
by the top four regional publishers. The 
weekly paid-for portfolio continued to 
perform ahead of the industry average.  
For the January to June, 2012 ABC period, 
circulation was down 7 .1%, outperforming  
the average of the top four regional 
publishers, which were down 7 .6%.

Print advertising
Excluding the title disposals, divestments  
and acquisitions noted above, advertising 
revenues are down 9% for the year 
(compared with a headline reported  
decline of 13%). 
Print revenue performance represents  
a mix of fortunes, stronger underlying local 
performance (-5%), offset by a weak national 
performance (-20%). In the first quarter of the 
year Northcliffe gave notice to change its 
national advertising sales house which 
resulted in some performance disruption 
during the period. Total recruitment category 
revenues declined by an underlying 19% 
(compared with a 31% decline in the prior 
year). Northcliffe’s rate and advertising 
package restructure mitigated the impact  
of continued low private sector demand  
and volume growth. Weak national property, 
motors and retail market performance has 
been compounded by national sales house 
disruption and underlying declines were  
-9%, -14% and -12% respectively. 
Costs
The company continued its restructuring  
and process innovation and delivered 
year-on-year cost savings of £32 million or 
15%. Restructuring costs of c. £10 million are 
treated as exceptional items this year. Total 
headcount reduced by a further 13%,  
or 325 people.
Staff costs fell by £9.4 million as the benefits  
of last year’s structural changes took effect  
in addition to further headcount reductions 
during the year. Production costs have 
reduced by £6.7 million or 1 6% and distribution 
costs by £6.8 million or 32%. Some savings 
were as a consequence of lower activity 
levels, however, more significant reductions 
have been made through the changes to 
the product portfolio, distribution changes 
and lower newsprint costs.
MARKET ENvIRONMENT 
As noted above, both the print advertising 
and circulation market places remain very 
challenging, but Northcliffe’s performance 
remains in line or slightly better than its peers.
Subsequent event
On 21st November, 2012, A&N Media 
announced the exchange of contracts  
for the disposal of the division to Local World  
in exchange for cash of £52.5 million and

Underlying decline in UK 
revenues of £13 million (6%).
Restructuring activities helped 
to deliver year-on-year cost 
savings of £32 million or 15%. 
Headcount reduces by a 
further 325 (or 13%) during  
the year.

ACCOuNTS
This Financial and Treasury Review focuses 
principally on the adjusted results* to give  
a more comparable indication of the 
Group’s underlying business performance.  
All year-on-year comparisons are on a 
like-for-like basis.
A discussion of restructuring and impairment 
charges and other items included in the 
statutory results is set out after the divisional 
performance review and in the segmental 
note. The adjusted results are summarised  
as follows:

Group revenue
#
 for the year was £1,960
 
million compared with £1,985
† 
million for the 
prior year, a decrease of 1% on a reported 
basis but an underlying increase of 3%. 
Revenues from the B2B segments totalled 
£899 million, 1% higher than last year, with  
an underlying increase of 7%. 
RMS delivered continued growth driven  
by its core modelling business. 
Strong growth at dmg::information with 
reported revenue up 9% at £253 million 
reflecting the execution of organic growth 
plans, complemented by bolt-on 
acquisitions. Underlying revenues grew by 
1 1% following last year’s disposal of Sanborn. 
dmg::events performed as expected 
delivering an underlying revenue increase of 
13%. Reported revenues declined following 
the sale of George Little Management (GLM) 
in September, 201 1 and the cycle of biennial 
shows which meant that one of the three 
large biennial events took place during the 
year compared with two last year.
Euromoney reported underlying revenue 
growth of 2% driven by a 5% increase in 
subscriptions revenue.
Consumer revenues
#
 of £1,060
 
million were  
3% down on £1,098
 
million in the prior year, 
but in line with last year on an underlying 
basis. Within Consumer, Associated’s 
underlying revenues were up 2% due to 
improved revenues from digital, as well  
as the benefit of cover price increases  
on circulation revenues.
Testing economic conditions continued to 
adversely affect Northcliffe’s revenues which 
were down 6% on an underlying basis.
An analysis of revenue is illustrated on the 
following charts, which show that the 
percentage of total revenue from print-
based products has fallen by 6% this year and 
is now 53% of total revenues, reflecting both 
digital growth and print decline. These also 
demonstrate that 63% of total revenue by 
source was generated by UK businesses, 
down 4% on the prior year. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 40
OperAti NG p r Ofit*
# 
Operating profit of £300 million was up £19 
million or 7% on the equivalent figure for  
the prior year. Overall operating margin 
increased from 14% to 15% following margin 
improvement from both the B2B and 
consumer businesses.
Operating profit is stated before charging  
£86 million of exceptional operating costs, 
principally within Associated. This charge 
includes reorganisation costs of £40 million, 
accelerated depreciation of property, plant 
and equipment of £39 million, principally 
relating to the proposed move to Thurrock 
and impairments of fixed assets of £7 million.
The charge for amortisation of intangible 
assets fell by £7 million to £39 million.  
The Group also made a charge for the 
impairment of intangible assets of £21 million, 
largely relating to a business in the financial 
sector of the business information segment.
73% of this year’s operating profit was 
generated from the Group’s B2B operations 
and 27% from Consumer, compared to 58% 
and 42% in 2008. These percentages have 
been calculated after allocating Head 
Office costs on the basis of revenues. More 
than half of the Group’s operating profits 
were again derived from outside the UK,  
with 51% coming from the US. 
The Group’s B2B companies increased their 
overall profit by £1 1 million or 6%. The average 
sterling:US dollar exchange rate for the year 
was £1:$1.58 (against £1:$1.61 last year). 
Within Consumer, profits increased by £6 
million or 10%. At Associated Newspapers, 
operating profit increased by £2 million  
or 3% to £78 million following a range  
of cost efficiencies. 
Northcliffe’s profits increased by £9 million  
or 54% following year-on-year cost savings 
and growth in digital revenues.
NET FINANCING COSTS
As the table below shows, net interest 
payable and similar charges (including 
deemed finance charges and interest 
receivable) fell by £8 million to £61 million due 
to lower average debt and management of 
the debt portfolio. Net finance costs included 
a £6 million charge for the premium on early 
redemption of £1 10 million of 7 .5% bonds  
due 2013.
There was a £3 million reduction in pension 
finance due to the lower pension fund deficit 
as at 2nd October, 201 1. Other investment 
revenue fell by £2 million due largely to a 
one-off dividend from an internet investment 
fund in the prior year.

JOINT vENTuRES AND ASSOCIATES
The Group’s share of the adjusted results  
of its joint ventures and associates rose by  
£8 million to £13 million. It includes income 
from dmg Radio Australia Pty Ltd and the 
Zoopla Property Group. 
OThER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS
The Group recorded other net gains on 
disposal of businesses and investments of 
£158 million, compared to £15 million last 
year. These include the sales of Evanta,  
the Group’s digital property businesses  
and the Group’s remaining 50% stake in  
dmg Radio Australia Pty Ltd.
Northcliffe Media was held for sale at 30th 
September, 2012 and is therefore treated  
as a discontinued operation together with 
the result from the Group’s investment in  
dmg radio Australia. Profit attributable  
to operations treated as discontinued 
amounted to £55 million (201 1 loss of  
£5 million).
RESuLT BEFORE TAx
The statutory profit before tax for the year was 
£206 million, after charging £57 million of 
amortisation charges and impairment losses 
and £41 million of net exceptional charges. 
TAxATION
The adjusted tax charge of £39 million (201 1 
£34
†
 million) is stated after adjusting for the 
effect of exceptional items. The adjusted tax 
rate for the year rose to 15.2% from 14.4% in 
201 1, largely due to a change in the mix of 
chargeable profits. The continued low rate 
reflects tax reductions from tax-efficient 
financing and tax-deductible amortisation  
in the USA that are expected to be in place 
for the next few years although the mix of 
chargeable profits is expected to continue  
to change.
There were net exceptional tax credits of  
£49 million, arising on disposals, assets held  
for sale, operating exceptional costs, the 
accelerated depreciation of property and 
equipment and the recognition of tax losses.
PROFIT AFTER TAx
Adjusted Group profit* after tax and minority 
interests was up 7% to £189 million. Statutory 
profit after was £225 million, up from £130
†
 
million, due to increased other gains and 
losses in the current year.
PENSIONS
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes provide retirement benefits for UK 
staff, largely in A&N Media. The deficit in 
these schemes has fallen from £336 million  
at the beginning of the year to £324 million  
at 30th September, 2012 (calculated in 
accordance with IAS 19). Corporate bond 
yields continued to fall over the period, (from 
5.2% to 4.4%) which resulted in a higher value 
of the defined benefit obligation. However, 
this has been more than offset by an increase 
in the schemes’ assets and funding payments 
into the main schemes of £64 million, in 
accordance with the funding agreements 
with the Trustees, which included £24 million of 
surplus properties, previously solely used by the 
regional newspapers. The property transfer, 
in combination with a £12 million funding 
payment made in October, 2012 satisfies the 
£36 million October, 2012 funding payment 
requirement previously agreed with the 
Trustees under the payment recovery plan.
In July, 2012 DMGT created a guarantee 
structure in collaboration with its principal 
defined benefit pension scheme, 
Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS). The 
structure provides HPS with a valuable 
contingent asset, a £150 million guaranteed 
loan note, and will reduce the need for 
additional cash contributions to HPS in the 
medium term. Whilst the loan note is treated 
as an asset of the scheme and reduces the 
actuarial deficit within the scheme, under  
IAS 19 it is not included as an asset and is 
excluded from the calculation of the £324 
million year-end deficit.
The defined benefit pension schemes are 
closed to new entrants, and measures were 
introduced in April 201 1 to reduce costs and 
risks, in particular to eliminate longevity risk  
on accrued pensions since that date, and 
help secure the schemes’ and employers’ 
financial health into the future. All new 
employees of A&N Media are now being 
offered a defined contribution pension plan, 
in line with our other newer and more 
internationally focused divisions where we 
have long considered this type of pension 
plan to be the most appropriate. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 42
CASh FLOW AND NET DEBT
Net debt has fallen by £106 million during the 
year from £719 million to £613 million and by 
£196 million since the half year. The Group 
generated operating cash flows of £339 
million, a 1 13% conversion rate of operating 
profits*. These funded capital costs at 
Thurrock of £39 million, capitalised software 
development of RMS’s Next Generation 
product of £18 million, taxation of £34 million, 
interest of £70 million, pension funding of £40 
million and dividends totalling £76 million. 
Operating cash flows are stated after capital 
expenditure of £42 million, excluding that on 
Thurrock and RMS’s Next Generation 
product, and exceptional operating items  
of £37 million. Net proceeds from disposals 
and acquisitions were £42 million. 
Acquisitions totalled £75 million and included 
Jobrapido for closing consideration of £29 
million; Intelliworks, Xceligent, PrepMe and 
Spring Rock within the dmg::information 
portfolio; Praedicat by RMS, and Global 
Grain Geneva and Global Grain Asia by 
Euromoney. Business disposals totalled £1 17 
million and included the sale of Evanta and 
the remaining 50% stake in dmg radio 
Australia in September. 
The Group’s principal debt remains in 
long-term bonds. At the year end, the Group 
had £725 million of bonds with repayments 
due in 2013 (£47 million), 2018 (£308 million), 
2021 (£171 million) and 2027 (£199 million).  
In December 201 1, the Group acquired £1 10 
million of the 7 .5% bonds, due 2013, and will 
consider acquiring further bonds where 
financially sensible.
The Group’s ratio of year-end net debt to 
adjusted profits* before interest, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) was 1.6 times, 
comfortably below the Group’s internal limit 
of 2.4 times and preferred level of around  
2.0 times, and well within the requirements of 
the Group’s bank covenants. The Group’s 
corporate credit ratings are BBB- from Fitch, 
and BB+ from Standard & Poor’s. 
During the year the Group cancelled surplus 
bank facilities of £90 million maturing in 
December, 2012 and March, 2013. The Group 
continues to maintain sufficient committed 
debt facilities to meet its foreseeable 
requirements. It had unutilised committed 
facilities of £298 million at the year end and 
surplus cash of £107 million.
OThER FINANCING
The Company acquired 7 .5 million ‘ A ’ 
Ordinary Shares in Treasury for £30 million, 
using seven million of them, valued at £32 
million, to provide shares under various 
incentive plans. Following these transfers, 
DMGT has 382.8 million shares in issue, 
including 19.9 million ordinary shares together 
with 10.2 million ‘ A ’ Ordinary Shares held in 
Treasury to meet further obligations that  
may arise.
TREASuRy POLICIES 
DMGT aims to have sufficient liquidity to meet 
both operational and capital cash flows and 
to impose the minimum cash constraints on 
the management and operation of the 
Group. Financial instruments, including 
derivatives, are used by the Group in order  
to manage the principal financial risks that 
arise in the course of business. These risks are 
liquidity or funding risk, foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk and counterparty risk. The 
instruments are used within the parameters 
set by the Investment & Finance Committee 
of the Board, and are not traded for a profit. 
The Group’s priority is to address the 
economic impact of financial risks using  
the most efficient or appropriate approach. 
This may result in IFRS accounting volatility.  
Full details of treasury policies are on  
pages 14 to 144.

Financial Statements
OvERvIEW
The Group has adequate committed  
debt finance to meet current trading 
requirements. The Group aims to have 70% to 
80% of its debt at fixed interest rates to reduce 
the impact of interest rate fluctuations. 
Foreign exchange risk on transactions is not a 
large issue for the Group as the majority of its 
businesses operate in the country in which 
they are located. In principle, the underlying 
currency of net debt after taking account of 
derivatives is managed in proportion to the 
EBITDA in each currency. More than half of 
the Group’s profits are expected to be 
earned from revenue billed in US dollars 
outside the UK. The Group’s foreign assets are 
only partially hedged by its foreign currency 
debt and economically its earnings are most 
exposed to movements in value of the  
US dollar. 
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s strategy for capital risk 
management is set out in note 33 to the 
Accounts.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have continued to adopt the 
going concern basis for the preparation of 
the accounts. This has been done since, after 
considering relevant information, they have  
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future (note 1).
ShARE Buy BACK
DMGT’s strong operational cash flow and 
disciplined business portfolio management 
has resulted in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 
1.6, falling to well below our stated internal 
limit of 2.4 times. The Board remains confident 
in the overall outlook for the Group and the 
operating cash flow that our businesses will 
generate. We believe that the creation of 
shareholder value over the long term requires 
a balanced approach to investing in growth 
and returning excess capital to shareholders 
whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
We will therefore continue to look for 
attractive acquisitions and actively manage 
our business portfolio while maintaining our 
dividend policy of growing dividends by 
between 5% and 7% in real terms over the 
economic cycle. In reviewing our capital 
management programme, the Board has 
also decided to utilise part of its authority  
to make on market purchases of the ‘ A ’ 
Ordinary Non-Voting Shares. We anticipate 
spending up to approximately £100 million 
over the coming year.
SALE OF NORThCLIFFE MEDIA
The announcement that the Group has 
reached agreement to sell Northcliffe Media

David Dutton
Chairman, Corporate 
Responsibility Committee
OuR APPROACh
The Corporate Responsibility (CR) Committee 
reports, through me, directly to the Board. 
Committee members include interested 
parties with relevant Group-wide 
responsibilities and senior nominees from  
our five business units. We act in an advisory 
rather than an executive capacity. 
We aim: 
• To minimise our negative impact on the 
environment. 
• To promote employee health and welfare. 
• To build civilised relationships with 
customers and suppliers. 
• To engage with local communities and 
wider society. 
• To target 10% reduction in CO
2
 emissions 
per £m of revenue over the next three years
• To give over £1.6 million in charitable 
donations
CR drives long-term performance
We start from the proposition that acting 
responsibly is first and foremost about 
securing the long-term future of our own 
company. 
This way of thinking comes naturally to us. 
With our heritage as a family-run business we 
have always evaluated performance in 
generational terms.
As a group we are committed to sustainable, 
long-term performance. Managing our 
businesses and brands responsibly, valuing 
our own people, suppliers and customers 
and respecting the communities we  
serve are essential prerequisites for our  
own success.
We believe that responsibility and 
performance are intimately interconnected. 
Embracing our responsibilities to society and 
the environment advances our own interests. 
Multiple programmes are more effective 
We manage a diverse portfolio of businesses 
and brands. As such, a one-size-fits-all CR 
policy would be counter-productive. 
Smart, highly skilled people run our 
companies. They are used to acting 
independently. They understand their  
own markets. 
Our various businesses have evolved distinct 
CR strategies to fit their cultures and 
underlying objectives. At group level we 
typically help them most by backing their 
judgement and providing resources. 
We try not to be prescriptive. Instead, we 
empower our businesses. We focus on 
equipping them with the knowledge, skills 
and, crucially, the permission to take 
effective action. 
A centre of excellence 
The Group’s diversity is a key source of 
strength. We identify the best transferable 
approaches by comparing our different  
CR programmes. 
We exchange experiences and record 
performance. We act as a sounding board 
and a forum for ideas. We find ways to 
improve and build on what’s already been 
achieved and we share our knowledge. 
Acting responsibly supports our objectives 
Our CR activities and responsible attitudes 
have a positive impact on long-term 
performance in at least three important 
respects:
• By consistently acting responsibly  
we help the Group to stay relevant in  
a changing world.
• They help us attract and retain talent. Most 
people want more than money from their 
working lives. They want to enjoy their work, 
meet challenges and make a difference. 
Our CR activities engage and motivate  
our people. 
• In a networked world, content providers 
succeed by staying at the heart of their 
communities. CR initiatives, particularly 
those that engage supply chain partners, 
instil a sense of common purpose. 
In the future, we will continue to share best 
practice across the Group and build on our 
strengths as a centre of excellence.

Getting behind Team GB
A&N Media’s donation to the 
Team 2012 appeal contributed 
to some outstanding 
performances by British 
athletes at London 2012. It also 
fired the starting gun for 18 
months of events and activities.
Staff met distinguished 
Olympians and Olympic and 
Paralympic hopefuls. Some 
tried their hands at goalball, 
judo and handball. They 
toured the Olympic Park and 
attended preview events. 
VIP access to Team GB House

ENvIRONMENT
We are progressively reducing our impact  
on the environment by lowering emissions, 
using energy more efficiently and minimising 
waste. Doing the right thing for the 
environment is saving us money and 
increasing our efficiency.
CO
2
 reporting
We are committed to comprehensive, 
transparent reporting of our environmental 
performance. 
For the sixth year in succession we have 
collected CO
2
 emissions data from each  
of our five business units. This data is collated 
and independently reviewed by the 
environmental consultancy, ICF International.
DMGT has been a signatory to the 
international Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
since 2008. We have now integrated our 
carbon data collection process with our 
financial reporting. This has streamlined 
administration and improved data reliability.
Our emissions are calculated following the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) 
methodology which was developed by the 
World Resources Institute and the World 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development. As per the methodology’s 
principles, we have updated this year the 
emission factors used in the calculations and 
used the most up-to-date figures. This  
resulted in a slight adjustment of previous 
years’ emissions.
Our carbon footprint is expressed in the 
tonnes of Carbon Dioxide equivalent and 
includes all the Kyoto Protocol gases that are 
of relevance to our business. Our footprint 
covers emissions from all our global 
operations and the following emission 
sources: Scope 1 and 2 (as defined by the

Our carbon footprint continued to shrink in 
2012. CO

 emissions stood at 91,600 tCO

(92,100 tCO

 in 201 1), a 20% decrease against 
our 2007 baseline (1 13,800 tCO

). 
This year we have set a challenging new 
target for the Group. We plan to reduce our 
emissions per £ of revenue over the next three 
years by 10% against the 2012 baseline. The 
2012 amount is 46.7 tCO

targetting a 10% reduction to 42.0 tCO

Reducing environmental impacts 
DMGT’s headquarters at Northcliffe House, 
also the London base of A&N Media and 
dmg::events, retains the prized ISO 14001 
international environmental standard. 
The transfer of our London printing 
production to a green field site in Thurrock  
will take place in the summer of 2013 and  
will transform performance, environmental 
efficiency and waste minimisation. This plant 
has been built to exacting environmental 
specifications. It has been designed to meet 
a BREEAM
1
 rating of Very Good. 
Promoting the green agenda
As a content-led business, perhaps the 
biggest environmental contribution we can 
make is to promote the green agenda.  
Big 5 has hosted the Gaia awards, 
celebrating environmental excellence  
in construction since 2008. 
EDR was recognised at the 2012 
Environmental Business Achievement awards 
with two honours. Commonground, its social 
network for environmental and commercial 
real estate professionals, won the Industry 
Leadership Award. PARCEL, a web-based 
platform for due diligence reporting won the 
Business Achievement Award for IT. At the UK 
National Business Awards, Landmark was 
shortlisted for the prestigious ICAEW 
Sustainability Award.
Minimising waste
The three areas where we generate most 
waste are paper, water and ink. In each area 
we continue to make progress across the 
supply chain.
Carpets are the largest disposable items at 
trade shows. dmg::events recycles carpets  
at all its trade events. AdTech USA, digital 
marketing’s largest trade show, negotiated 
an agreement with Freeman to supply and 
collect recycled carpets at our New York  
and San Francisco shows.
At RMS a Green Team meets bi-monthly to 
coordinate recycling initiatives. Simple 
measures can be surprisingly effective. By 
introducing mugs for hot drinks it halved 
paper cup consumption, from 10,000 cups 
monthly, in just four months. 
Our office-based divisions have limited direct 
environmental impact. 
We recycle paper in all our global offices. 
Speed dating at Northcliffe 
house
Media Trust helps charities  
get their voices heard. DMGT 
supported local charity The 
K&C Foundation hosted  
a speed dating evening for 
Media Trust at our London 
headquarters.
The evening matched  
nine media personnel with 
nine charities. Abi Slater, 
Communications Manager  
at DMGT, was one who found 
a match: “It was great to use 
my network of contacts to  
help a small charity.”
In 2006, a group of RMSers 
decided to help out for a day 
at their local Food Bank. 
The idea has caught on. In 
2012, more than 90 RMS staffers 
helped out with the American 
Red Cross, at the local Food 
Bank, gardening, making 
lunch and dancing with 
carehome residents.
“Helping Hands is a highlight  
of my year,” said one, “we’re 
doing simple things, but it’s 
always so appreciated. I get 
back to my desk energised 
and uplifted.”

Where the infrastructure supports it we 
embrace other waste management 
initiatives. Plastic, glass, metals, toner 
cartridges, mobile phones and IT equipment 
are all being recycled. 
We have extended our recycling 
programme for redundant office furniture  
to other businesses across the Group. Once 
again this year, this resulted in zero landfill.
PEOPLE
Our employees define who we are as a 
company. We pursue policies and practices 
to recruit and retain the best. We expect high 
standards of performance and behaviour.  
In return, everyone is entitled to respect  
and support. 
Policies and practices
Employees sign up to the Group Code of 
Conduct. In addition, we require our 
journalists to comply with the Editor’s Code as 
set out in the Press Complaints Commission. 
We aim to promote an inspiring, healthy and 
inclusive work environment in all our 
businesses. We support equality, diversity and 
inclusion, and have published our Code of 
Conduct on our website, DMGT.com.
We have set up a 24/7 Speak-Up service 
where employees can share grievances and 
concerns about misconduct. The service is 
managed independently by an external 
consultancy so they can be confident that 
their identities will be protected.
This year A&N Media produced a video 
explanation of its equality, diversity and 
inclusion policy. This short feature won two 
awards at the 2012 International Visual 
Communication Association (IVCA) awards. 
It won gold for best animation, graphics and 
special effects and won silver for best script.

health and wellbeing
Landmark’s adoption of the World Health 
Organisation’s Global Corporate Challenge 
is promoting a healthy workforce. 
Health was at the forefront too as life got  
a little hairier in November. Employees  
from across the Group joined the global 
Movember event, raising £25,000 for testicular 
and prostate cancer charities. The ‘Mo Bros’ 
gathered sponsorship and sprouted facial 
hair. Their ‘Mo Sista’ supporters organised 
fund-raising activities. Over 100 staff 
members from Kensington to California took 
up the challenge. One brave soul even 
agreed to a wax removal in exchange  
for a £100 donation.
Talent and engagement 
We want all our people to feel a sense of 
connection between their values and their 
work with us. DMGT businesses support 
employee-led initiatives with matched 
funding and by encouraging volunteering 
and pro bono work.
We have always promoted entrepreneurial 
activity. We nurture talent internally by 
encouraging individuals to develop their 
ideas into profitable opportunities. 
There was a step-change in our approach  
to encouraging entrepreneurs in 2012. 
A&N Media launched The Ideas Factory,  
a monthly contest to find the best business 
ideas. Staff with the best suggestions win 
cash prizes and professional support. They 
present business plans to a team led by the 
DMGT Chairman. Winning ideas may be 
adopted and brought to market. There  
is a separate budget for the professional 
development of successful participants. 
We communicate with our employees 
through multiple channels, including  
a group intranet, DMGT Chatter, our 
business- collaborative working platform, 
and a blog from the CEO. These channels 
keep employees informed about business 
developments that affect them both directly 
and indirectly. Specifically in the area of  
CR, there is a community of CR Champions 
who meet every quarter to share 
experiences and knowledge. 
In February, Sheena Pabari 
from A&N Media’s London HQ 
and Nicky Burton from the 
Tunbridge Wells office set off 
for Cambodia with United 
World Schools (UWS). They 
blogged their experiences: 
11.02.12
For the last couple of days 
we’ve been visiting Ol’ Tuch 
and the school being built 
here with the help of A&N 
Media’s donation. It is 
incredible to see how much 
this has changed the lives of 
these people. Activities today 
included Khamer – the 
Cambodian version of head, 
shoulders, knees and toes! 
Chaos, but very fun to watch!
18.02.12
Our final day of teaching. We 
introduced them to Play Doh! 
The boys made buffalos and 
mopeds, the girls made pots

In August, dmg::events

builds awareness of special 
needs and disabilities across 
the Pan-Arabian Gulf.

COMMuNITIES
We invest in communities as a Group and as 
individuals. We encourage all our people to 
engage with society and get involved with 
charitable projects. 
Charitable giving
Engagement starts at the top. We worked 
with the Leaders’ Quest social enterprise  
at our Chairman’s conference in Bangalore. 
Delegates visited seven charities in the area 
and a number of them elected to offer 
financial support. DMGT matched every 
pound donated.
Total donations in 2012 reached over £1.6 
million (201 1 £1.4 million). Although each 
business has its own mechanism for selecting 
good causes, they frequently support similar 
projects, reflecting our shared values. Group 
businesses support projects that tackle basic 
needs, youth and education, and talent and 
self-reliance.
Tackling basic needs
Euromoney Institutional Investor has 
supported a series of projects in Africa  
that tackle poor sanitation and lack of  
clean water. 
A £100,000 central donation, client support 
and fund raising have raised well over 
£200,000 to bring clean water and sanitation 
to Ethiopia’s slum dwellings in Kechene. 
In Kenya, Euromoney and DMGT have joined 
forces with the Haller Foundation to build 
water wells and rain-fed dams for hard-
pressed farmers and families in Mombasa.
Landmark Information Group is applying its 
data management skills to water resourcing 
in a partnership with the international charity 
WaterAid. It has donated £22,000 alongside 
DMGT to develop the Water Point Mapper,  
a free application which pinpoints water 
supply services in rural and urban locations 
across Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
Genscape employees raised over US$50,000 
and teamed up with Plan International in 
2010 to bring clean drinking water to Asiento 
Viejo, Nicaragua. The village water supply 
was contaminated with toxic levels of 
arsenic. Local people learnt how to make 
and maintain arsenic filters from local 
materials. A mini aqueduct was created.  
The project was completed in 2012. 
In London, Euro Week clients raised over 
£175,000 for Anchor House, a residential 
centre with workshops, training facilities  
and studio flats for homeless people. 
youth and education
Funds raised last year by Euromoney for the 
Little Rock School in Nairobi’s Kibera slum 
bore fruit in 2012 as construction of its new 
school building and accompanying 
orphanage got underway. On top of the 
£597 ,000 raised in 201 1 DMGT donated a 
further £10,000 in 2012 to sponsor a classroom 
there for a year.
Hobsons has worked with Plan International 
for seven years to build schools in some of the 
world’s poorest countries. In 2012, employees 
visited the latest in the Dominican Republic. 
DMGT supports youth through its membership 
of the Prince’s Trust. In October, 201 1 25 DMGT 
head office employees cycled the 45 miles 
from London to Windsor Castle on the Trust’s 
Palace to Palace bike ride, raising nearly 
£6,000 for the cause. 
Talent and self-reliance
Metro launched the Government-endorsed 
Creative Pioneers initiative in March as a joint 
venture with the Institute of Practitioners in 
Advertising (IPA). The scheme aims to find 
digital talent and creative entrepreneurs.  
A panel of experts placed the best entrants 
in three categories to work as paid interns 
and apprentices at participating businesses.
For London 2012, Landmark provided 
financial support for Olympic cyclist Jess 
Varnish and GB swimmer Jazz Carlin.
Now in its second year, the Scottish Daily Mail 
Drama Award helped three winning 
post-graduate productions appear at this 
years Edinburgh Fringe Drama Festival, two  
of which then made it to the London stage. 
Financial Mail on Sunday has been working 
with East Sutton Park open prison. It has taken 
on two recruits for work experience. It also 
supported the ‘Dress for Success’ initiative, 
which has helped people adjust to life out  
of prison.
PRIORITIES FOR 2013
Over the next financial year the CR 
Committee will focus on strengthening its 
capabilities as a centre of excellence. It is 
already putting in place a more formal 
process for capturing CR data and activities. 
This will enhance its ability to register and 
share best practice across the Group.
Taking on trachoma in Africa
Trachoma is endemic in 
Ethiopia, over nine million 
children between one and 
nine suffer from the condition. 
It thrives in hot, dry and dusty 
areas where there is limited 
access to clean water. 
Repeated infection can cause 
blindness. 
Euromoney Institutional 
Investor is working with the 
African Medical and Research 
Foundation and the blindness 
treatment charity ORBIS on a 
£1.5 million five-year project to 
eliminate trachoma in the 
Ethiopia’s South Omo region. 
The project will benefit over 
half a million people, mostly 
women and children. 
The campaign got off to a 
flying start. The Euromoney 
Awards dinner raised £482,000 
in a single evening. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 48

The Board remains committed to ensuring 
that we are aligned to best practice as it  
is appropriate to our strategy and Group,  
as well as ensuring that we continue to 
operate in the right way for our businesses, 
recognising the expertise that our Board 
members deliver and the importance of 
having a longer-term view. Looking ahead, 
we will continue to maintain our high 
standard of corporate governance as it is a 
key factor in our continued success. 
We ensure that the use of time in our Board 
and committee meetings, at both the Group 
level and in our businesses is balanced 
between discussion of strategy, financial and 
operational performance, oversight of risk 
management and internal controls, ensuring 
the safeguarding of our assets and keeping 
our Board and executive succession  
plans refreshed. 
key ac TiViTy o F The Boa RD
During 2012, strategy has been central to 
Board discussion. Each year, one Board 
meeting is dedicated entirely to the 
discussion of Group strategy and clarifying 
the framework for its strategic decisions. It is 
an opportunity for Directors to concentrate 
on strategy exclusively. The session is held in 
the locality of one of our businesses and 
between sessions Directors can visit specific 
companies, meet management and get 
greater insight into how they operate. 
Outside of this dedicated strategy session, 
the Board considers strategic matters in 
addition to operational reviews at each 
Board meeting.
com Posi Tion o F The Boa RD
Prompted by the Board we have focused  
on ensuring that the skills in the boardroom 
represents the profile of our businesses. Given 
that now over 50% of our profits are 
generated in the US and that we increasingly 
provide digital solutions, this has been 
reflected in recent Board appointments. 
During the year we appointed Silicon Valley 
based Heidi Roizen, who has unrivalled 
experience in the technology arena and 
who will give the Board insight and 
experience of an area that is key to the 
Group’s long-term success. Detailed 
biographies of each Director are included in 
the Report on pages 50 and 51.
com PLiance
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘Code’) applies a ‘comply or explain’ 
approach to the principles set out in the 
Code. The Board adopts a long-term 
approach to governance, which underlies 
how the Group operates and takes account 
of the Group’s heritage. Explanations in 
respect of areas where the Company does 
not fully comply with Code provisions are in 
the table on page 58.

acTiViTies
The principal activities of the Group are set 
out on pages 6 and 7 of this Annual Report 
and Accounts.
The analysis of revenue and operating profit 
for the years ended 30th September, 2012 
and 2nd October, 201 1 are included as Note 
3 to the Consolidated Income Statement.
BUsiness Re View
The information that fulfils the Companies Act 
requirements of the business review is included 
in the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 43. This 
includes a review of the development of the 
business of the Group during the year, of its 
position at the end of the year and of likely 
future developments in its business. Details of 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group are set out below.
Risk Potential impact mitigation
1) changes in our key markets
The information provided to our customers 
and the ways in which our businesses deliver 
this information are subject to constant 
change. This can result in structural market 
changes that have the potential to redefine 
or eliminate current markets served by our 
businesses. Technological innovations such 
as tablets and other mobile devices, cloud 
computing and the proliferation of social 
media impact all of our businesses. Our 
products and services, and their means of 
delivery, are also affected by competitor 
activity and changing customer behaviour. 
The impact is both positive and negative. 
Failure to identify and respond to changes in 
the key markets in which the Group operates 
increases the risk of being left behind by both 
competitors and our customers with a 
resultant direct impact on Group results. 
The transition from traditional publishing and 
print advertising to online and mobile has 
affected a number of businesses including 
Euromoney and Associated Newspapers. 
Conversely, new technologies present 
opportunities for the Group. An example of 
this is the success of the mobile and tablet 
apps by MailOnline and Metro. Both have 
proved successful in driving traffic and 
engagement. MailOnline has five times more 
UK app users than any other newspaper and 
Metro’s iPad app was named Newspaper 
App of the Year at the 2012 Newspaper 
Awards.
The Group’s strategy of diversification reduces 
the impact of technological and market 
changes to some degree. However, a number 
of recent global trends have impacted several 
of our businesses. 
The DMGT Leadership Team constantly 
monitor the markets in which DMGT businesses 
operate, the competitive landscape and 
technological developments. The 
autonomous culture of the Group encourages 
an entrepreneurial approach to the 
development of organic growth opportunities 
and new products. 
2) e xposure to a downturn in the  
global economy 
A significant although decreasing proportion 
of the Group’s revenue (especially in the UK 
newspaper divisions) is derived from 
advertising which is impacted by 
fluctuations in the wider economy. A similar, 
although reduced, effect has been seen in 
Group businesses that rely on non-
advertising revenues, especially in the 
financial and property markets. 
Advertising revenues have been heavily 
affected by the downturn in the global 
economy. 
A continued recession, or a further downturn 
in the economy or market sectors served by 
the Group, gives rise to a risk of not achieving 
forecast results.
Experience has demonstrated that the 
long-term strategy of diversifying the Group’s 
portfolio into business information and 
subscription revenue streams, along with 
investment in strong brands, makes the 
Group’s results both more strategically and 
commercially robust. 
We continue to manage costs around the

3) acquisition and disposal risk
As well as launching and building new 
businesses, an integral part of the Group’s 
strategy has, and will continue to be, the 
acquisition (and successful integration) of 
businesses that expand expertise whilst 
supporting existing products. The strategy 
also results in the disposal of businesses that 
no longer fit the Group’s investment criteria. 
Failure to identify acquisition targets could 
result in an opportunity cost to the business.
Equally, an unsuccessful integration of 
acquired subsidiaries, or an acquired business 
that fails to generate the expected returns, 
could result in the underperformance of the 
Group or impairment losses. This could also 
divert management time from other 
operational matters.
Our ability to achieve optimal value from 
disposals, as well as the failure to realise other 
anticipated benefits of a disposal could also 
impact financial results. 
The majority of acquisitions are in related 
markets and are smaller businesses with a high 
potential for growth. This reduces the risk from 
any one acquisition.
Acquisitions are approved by the Investment 
& Finance Committee, and managed by 
divisional and local management with 
oversight from the centre. Detailed due 
diligence is performed by internal teams and 
external advisors on all potential acquisitions.
The retention of key employees in the 
acquired business is often required as part of 
the purchase. Board level monitoring is 
performed post-acquisition.
Disposals, including the decision to divest, are 
overseen by the Board and the Group 
Finance Director.
4) Pension scheme shortfalls
Our defined benefit pension schemes are 
now closed to new entrants, although 
existing members still employed by the 
Group can continue to accrue benefits on a 
cash basis. Deficits identified by actuarial 
valuations completed in 201 1 are being 
addressed by means of a funding 
arrangement agreed with the trustees which 
will reduce the deficits over a period of 
13 years to 2023.
Reported earnings may be adversely 
affected by changes in our pension costs and 
funding requirements due to lower than 
expected investment returns or changes 
made to the risk profile of our investment 
portfolio.
Measures to mitigate the risks that impact the 
company’s balance sheet are under 
continuous review. Recent examples include:
–  benefits in the schemes are now accrued 
on a cash basis which reduces the risk of an 
increase to pension liabilities arising from 
improving longevity;
–  the Group provided the principal scheme 
with a £150 million guaranteed loan note to 
reduce the need for additional cash 
contributions; and
–  the Group has transferred a portfolio of 
properties to the schemes, valued at £24 
million, reducing the net cash required to be 
transferred to the schemes during the year. 
In addition, a Joint Working Party assesses and 
monitors de-risking options available to the 
schemes.
5) successfully managing change projects
At any given time, a number of active 
capital and IT projects are underway around 
the Group. The two most significant change 
projects continue to be RMS’s new software 
solution project, RMS (one), and A&N 
Media’s new print site at Thurrock. 
A successful project delivers improvements in 
product offerings, efficiency gains and cost 
savings. There is however, a risk of increased 
costs or lost revenues as a result of delays, 
unforeseen problems, loss of access to 
systems and data or production and  
delivery issues.
Every active capital project around the Group 
is subject to a rigorous planning process 
involving all key stakeholders. Significant 
capital projects are approved by the 
Investment and Finance Committee.  
Ongoing project management is in place to 
ensure that plans are delivered to timetable 
and specification. 
All key projects are monitored by the local 
board to ensure that risks and opportunities 
are managed throughout the process. The 
Group’s most significant projects are 
monitored by the Risk Committee. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 54

6) Data integrity, availability and security
The quality and availability of the 
information products that DMGT businesses 
provide to their clients are key to their 
success. This is true for many businesses in the 
Group, most notable within dmg::information 
and Euromoney. 
Information security has always been a key 
focus across DMGT. However, changing 
technology, mobile working, cloud-based 
systems, the consumerisation of IT and the 
growing use of social media create 
opportunities but also threats to information 
security and the protection of our data, and 
that of our customers. The threat of cyber-
attack from organised crime increases this 
risk further.
Any challenge to the integrity of information 
within a DMGT product could damage the 
reputation of that business, potentially 
resulting in lost revenues remediation costs. 
A similar impact would be felt if a product 
was unavailable for a time.
An information security incident or cyber-
attack resulting in the loss, theft, corruption or 
unavailability of sensitive information held by 
the Group could lead to operational and 
regulatory challenges, and could impact on 
financial results.
Information security breaches could have a 
reputational impact on the Group.
Every DMGT business understands that quality 
of data is key to the reputation and ongoing 
success of the Group. Quality controls 
including rigorous checks, review and 
restricted access to amend and publish exist 
in every business with information products. 
Availability is managed through detailed and 
tested business continuity plans.
Information security risks are managed locally 
by the individual businesses, with support from 
divisional management and DMGT Risk and 
Assurance. The Risk Committee monitors and 
oversees information security, data protection 
and cyber risks and controls around  
the Group. 
Businesses are expected to comply with the 
published information security policy and 
minimum baseline standards.
7) impact of a major disaster or outbreak  
of disease
There is a risk of disruption of Group 
operations as a result of a major disaster, 
outbreak of disease or other external threat. 
The Group’s operations are geographically 
diversified which limits the impact of any 
given incident. The largest locations are 
Northcliffe House and Harmsworth Quays in 
London, Euromoney’s offices in London and 
New York, and RMS’s headquarters in 
California. Northcliffe House is the Group’s 
headquarters as well as housing A&NM and 
some businesses within dmg::events. 
Harmsworth Quays is A&N Media’s main 
printing centre and a contingency location 
for Northcliffe House.
The success of the events and training 
businesses within dmg::events and 
Euromoney relies heavily on the confidence 
in, and ability of, delegates and speakers to 
travel internationally.
A major incident particularly in a key location 
could affect operation of the business at that 
location and impacts their ability to produce 
or deliver its products, which could reduce 
the demand for them or increase costs.
Any disaster which significantly affects the 
wider environment or the infrastructure in an 
area in which the Group operates could 
adversely impact Group results.
Significant disruptions to, or reductions in, 
international travel for any reason could lead 
to events and training courses being 
postponed or cancelled and could have an 
impact on the Group’s performance. 
 
Business continuity plans, which are tested 
regularly, are in place across all businesses. 
Contingency planning is in place in the events 
businesses and virtual events alternatives are 
being developed. Where appropriate, 
cancellation insurance is taken out. 
Recently the Group’s business continuity 
planning helped its offices in North East 
America to recover quickly and effectively 
from the significant disruption caused by 
Superstorm Sandy.
8) Reliance on key management and  
staff retention
DMGT is reliant on the talented and 
successful management and staff across all 
of its businesses. Many businesses and 
products are dependent upon specialist, 
technical expertise. 
The inability to recruit and retain talented 
people could impact the Group’s ability to 
maintain its performance and deliver growth.
When key staff leave or retire, there is a risk 
that knowledge or competitive advantage  
is lost.
The DMGT Human Resources Director works 
with divisional and executive management 
across the Group on a formal approach to 
talent management and succession planning. 
This includes payment of competitive rewards, 
employee performance and turnover 
monitoring and a variety of approaches to 
staff communication.
Succession planning and long-term incentive 
plans are in place for senior management. Annual Report 2012 strategic Report

9) commercial relationships, including 
volatility of newsprint prices
The Group is reliant on a number of 
commercial relationships with key customers, 
suppliers and third parties. Examples include 
large advertising agencies and major 
retailers in A&N Media, key venues and 
agents in dmg::events and Euromoney, and 
data providers in dmg::information and RMS. 
Additionally, newsprint continues to 
represent a significant proportion of our 
costs. Newsprint prices are subject to 
volatility arising from variations in supply and 
demand.
The loss of, or damage to, any key 
commercial relationship could have a 
material impact on the Group’s ability to 
produce and deliver its products. 
An increase in newsprint prices would impact 
the cost base of A&N Media.
 
Significant time and resources are dedicated 
to managing and developing these 
relationships to ensure they continue to 
operate satisfactorily.
The Group’s newsprint requirements are 
managed by a dedicated newsprint buying 
team and monitored by the board of 
Harmsworth Printing. Where possible, 
long-term arrangements are agreed with 
suppliers to limit the potential for volatility. 
10) compliance with laws and regulations
Group businesses are subject to legislation 
and regulation in the jurisdictions in which 
they operate. The key laws and regulations 
that impact the Group cover areas such as 
bribery and corruption, competition, data 
protection, privacy (including e-privacy), 
health and safety and employment law. 
Additionally, specific regulations from the 
Press Complaints Commission and the Audit 
Bureau of Circulation apply to the 
newspaper divisions.
The Group generates a significant  
amount of its revenue from publishing, be  
it newspapers, magazines, trade journals or 
information and data published online. As a 
result, there is an inherent risk of error which, 
in some instances, may give rise to legal 
claims (e.g. for libel). 
On 29th
 
November Lord Justice Leveson 
released his report from the inquiry into 
culture, practices and ethics of the press.
A breach of legislation or regulations could 
have a significant impact on the Group both 
in terms of additional costs, management 
time and reputational damage. Equally, the 
management time and cost of defending 
legal cases can be significant.
Increasing regulation of the newspaper 
industry could limit our editorial output and 
have a corresponding commercial impact 
on the business. 
Compliance with laws and regulations is taken 
seriously throughout the Group. The DMGT 
Code of Conduct (and supporting policies) 
sets out appropriate standards of business 
behaviour and highlights the key legal and 
regulatory issues affecting Group businesses. 
Divisional and local management are 
responsible for compliance with applicable 
local laws and regulations, with oversight from 
the Risk Committee.
All of our publications have controls in place, 
including legal review, to approve content 
that may carry a libel/legal risk. Journalists 
receive regular training on the PCC Code, 
Data Protection and the Bribery Act.
Controls are also in place surrounding 
compliance with the Audit Bureau of 
Circulation’s regulations and other regulatory 
bodies to which we adhere.
11) Treasury operations
The Group Treasury function is responsible for 
executing treasury policy which seeks to 
manage the Group’s funding, liquidity and 
treasury derivatives risks. More specifically, 
these include currency exchange rate 
fluctuations, interest rate risks, counterparty 
risk and liquidity and debt levels. These risks 
are described in more detail in Note 33 to 
the financial statements.
If the treasury policy does not adequately 
mitigate the financial risks summarised above, 
or is not correctly executed, it could result in 
unforeseen derivative losses or higher than 
expected finance costs.
The Group Treasury function undertakes high 
value transactions, hence, there is an inherent 
risk of payment fraud or error.
The Investment & Finance Committee is 
responsible for reviewing and approving 
Group Treasury policies which are executed 
by the Group Treasury function, overseen by 
the Deputy Finance Director. 
Segregation of duties and authorisation limits 
are in place for all payments made. The 
Treasury function is subject to an annual 
internal audit.
12) Unforeseen tax liabilities
The Group’s operations are global and 
therefore earnings are subject to taxation at 
differing rates across a number of 
jurisdictions. Whilst endeavouring to manage 
the Group’s tax affairs in an efficient manner, 
there will always be a certain level of 
uncertainty when provisioning for tax 
liabilities due to an ever more complex 
international tax environment.
Changing tax laws could increase tax 
liabilities and have an adverse impact on 
financial results.
Due to the diverse and global nature of the 
Group, internal or external factors could give 
rise to unplanned tax liabilities.
The team of in-house specialists, in 
conjunction with divisional management and 
external experts, review all tax arrangements 
within the Group and keep abreast of 
changing legislation. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 56

Following the year end the Group disposed 
of its central European online recruitment 
business and its Hungarian joint venture 
online motors businesses. Additionally on 
22 November, the Company announced it 
had exchanged contracts to dispose of the 
Northcliffe Media business to a new venture, 
Local World. Details are provided in Note 44.
Following a review of the Group’s capital 
management programme, the Board has 
decided to utilise part of its authority to make  
or market purchases of its ‘ A ’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares. The Company anticipates 
spending up to approximately £100.0 million 
over the coming year.

Details of allotments of share capital during 
the year, which arose solely from the exercise 
of options, are given in Note 37 .
At the Annual General Meeting on 8th 
February, 2012, the Company was granted 
the authority to purchase up to 10% of its  
own shares.
During the year, the Company transferred 
7 ,018,953 shares out of Treasury, representing 
1.88% of called up ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting 
Shares, in order to satisfy incentive schemes. 
The Company holds 10,188,174 shares in 
Treasury, with a nominal value of £1.3 million. 
The maximum number of shares held in 
Treasury during the year was 10,228,174 which 
had a nominal value of £1.3 million.
The Company also purchased 7 ,478,953 ‘A’ 
Ordinary Non-Voting Shares for holding in 
Treasury, having a nominal value of £934,869 
in order to match obligations under various 
incentive plans. The consideration paid for 
these shares was £30.1 million. Shares 
purchased during the year represented 2% of 
the called up ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Share 
capital at 30th September, 2012.
The Company has two classes of share 
capital. Its total share capital comprises 5%  
of Ordinary Shares and 95% of ‘ A ’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares. Full details of the 
Company’s share capital are given in 
Note 37 .
emPLoyees
Under the Group’s general policy of 
decentralised management, it is the 
responsibility of the management in each 
subsidiary to encourage the involvement 
and participation of employees in their 
company. The methods used vary company 
by company, but the linking to performance 
targets of a significant portion of 
remuneration is one widely used means.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to 
suitable applications from disabled persons 
for employment. If existing employees 
become disabled they will continue to be 
employed, wherever practicable, in the 
same job or, if this is not practicable, every 
effort will be made to find suitable alternative 
employment and to provide appropriate 
training. 
maTe RiaL con TRac Ts
Group companies undertake business with a 
range of customers and suppliers. There is no 
dependence on any particular contractual 
arrangement, other than those disclosed in 
Note 40 to the Accounts as regards ink and 
printing, where arrangements are in place 
until 2018 and 2022 respectively to obtain 
competitive prices and to secure supplies. 
As regards the Group’s principal commodity, 
newsprint, arrangements are made annually 
with a range of suppliers to ensure the 
security of supply at the best available prices, 
having regard to the need for the necessary 
quality. Particularly in the light of its strategy to 
create a diversified international portfolio of 
media businesses, the Group is not 
dependent on any suppliers of other 
commodities, nor for its revenue on any 
particular customer. Distribution 
arrangements are in place to ensure the 
delivery of newspapers to retail outlets.
Po Licy on P aymenT o F sUPPLieRs
The Group’s policy on supplier payments 
varies across its subsidiaries. These companies 
have no formal code or standard which 
deals specifically with the payment of 
suppliers. However, their policy is to ensure 
that the terms of payment, as specified by, 
and agreed with the supplier at the outset, 
are not exceeded.
The Company had no trade creditors at the 
year-end date. See page 183.
The Group’s average payment period, 
calculated on the basis of year-end trade 
creditors, is 74 days (201 1 70 days), although 
this is dependent on the year-end date and 
cannot therefore be regarded as meaningful.

Remuneration
com PLiance
The Company is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance. The 
paragraphs below and in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 66 to 80 describe how the 
Board has applied the principles set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’).
The Code, issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in June, 2010 is part of the Listing 
Rules and applied to the Company 
throughout the year and an updated version 
of the Code was released in September, 2012 
for subsequent reporting periods, which the 
Company will take into account for the 
forthcoming year.
The Company has substantially complied 
with the provisions of the Code throughout 
the year, except where the Board has 
determined that any provision is inappropriate 
to the particular circumstances of the 
Company. The areas in which the Company 
has not applied the Code during the year 
are explained below in summary and noted 
within the Report, as appropriate, and 
primarily arise from the composition  
of the Board.
In addition, the Chairman was not 
independent on appointment (Code 
provision A3.1). A formal review of each 
Director’s training requirements was not 
undertaken, however training requirements 
were addressed informally, by Director. 
Directors are encouraged to keep up to date 
and are provided with regular 
communications and regulatory updates to 
enable them to do so. The Company’s 
auditors, Deloitte LLP , has received the 
Company’s statement of compliance with 
the Code as required by the Listing Rules. 
Provision Area Details of non-compliance and mitigating circumstances
A4.1 Composition of the Board The Board has not identified a senior independent non-executive Director since it believes 
that to identify such an individual is potentially divisive to a unitary body, as this Board is,  
and disruptive to the role of the Chairman.
A4.2 Non-executive Directors The non-executive Directors did not meet as a group without the Chairman since his 
performance was assessed by the Remuneration Committee (without the Chairman  
being present).
B1.1 Composition of the Board Less than half of the Board are independent non-executive Directors. The Board believes 
that its current composition is appropriate taking account of the heritage of the Group, and 
that a good balance is achieved from its non-executive Directors in terms of skill and 
independence. However, the Board keeps this under review. Heidi Roizen joined the Board 
on 26th September, 2012 and is independent.
B2.1 Composition of the  
Nominations Committee
Independent non-executive Directors do not comprise a majority of the Committee’s 
members since Mr Balsemão is the only independent non-executive Director appointed. 
Nevertheless, the Board believes that the Committee operates well.
B6.2 Board Evaluation The Board has determined to continue to conduct its evaluation internally by means of a 
questionnaire, rather than through contracting external consultants every three years. The 
process is refreshed regularly and has proved valuable in driving the Board’s agenda.
C3.1 Composition of the Audit 
Committee
The Committee included two independent non-executive Directors rather than three 
during 2012. The Board believes that the Committee operated independently and benefits 
from the skill and experience of its then current composition. From November, 2012 there will 
be three independent non-executive Directors on the Committee as a result of Dominique 
Trempont’s appointment to the Committee.
D1.5 Service contracts and 
compensation
The service contracts of Messrs Morgan and Dacre exceeded the one-year recommended 
in the Code during the year. However, both have now reduced to one year as explained in 
the Remuneration Report on page 76.
D2.1 Composition of the 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee comprises one independent non-executive Director, rather than two as set

The Company is headed by a Board which 
comprised during the reporting period seven 
executive directors, including the Chairman 
and Chef Executive and seven non-
executive Directors, with Heidi Roizen joining 
at the end of the period on 26th September, 
2012 (as noted on page 49). Biographical 
details of each of the Directors are set out  
on page 50 and 51.

The Board normally meets five times a year 
and at such other times as are necessary. It 
discusses and approves the Group’s strategy. 
In addition, the Board receives reports and 
recommendations from time to time on any 
matter, which it considers significant to the 
Group. Most meetings include a presentation 
on one of the Group’s divisions or on specific 
topics. During the year, these included 
presentations on the development of RMS’s 
new software platform, RMS (one), 
dmg::events, Metro, dmg::information, on 
communications and a talent review. 
The Board met six times during the 201 1/12 
financial year, meetings were attended by all 
Directors, except that Mr Fallon was unable 
to attend four of them because of illness. 
Individual attendance by Directors is set out 
to the right.

The Board’s specific responsibilities are set out 
in a schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board which is published on the Company’s 
website at www.dmgt.com.
These are summarised below:
• Board and Committee appointments;
• the approval of financial statements and all 
information sent to shareholders;
• the setting of dividends;
• the setting of fees payable to Directors;
• approval of major acquisitions and 
disposals and capital expenditure; and
• review of Group pension schemes.
Other matters addressed by the Board are:
• approval of the Group’s strategy;
• approval of the Group’s annual budget; 
and
• ensuring maintenance of a sound system  
of internal controls and risk management.

The division of responsibilities between the 
Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive 
is understood and works well. The Chairman’s 
role is to lead the Board and oversee the 
Company’s operations and strategy 
including at a specific annual strategy 
meeting and is updated on progress at each 
meeting by the Chief Executive. The Chief 
Executive’s role is to manage the Company, 
develop strategy and ensure its successful 
implementation.
The Board believes that five non-executive 
Directors may be considered to be 
independent under the Code, namely  
Messrs Balsemão, Verey, Berry and Trempont 
and Ms Roizen. Each of Mr Balsemão and 
Mr Verey have been on the Board for 10  
and 9 years respectively and the Board  
has reviewed the independence of each, 
recognising that longevity of service is one of 
a number of factors to take into account. The 
Board is satisfied that each has continued to 
demonstrate independence in terms of 
character and judgement.
Messrs Hemingway and Gillespie are not 
regarded by the Board as independent 
under the Code because they have advised 
the Company over many years; nor is 
Mr Nelson because he is an advisor to the 
Chairman. Nevertheless, the Board believes 
that these non-executive Directors make an 
important contribution to its deliberations 
and have invaluable experience of the 
Company, its business and its staff.

Procedures have been established to  
ensure that the Board receives timely and 
appropriate information both for its meetings 
and regularly between meetings. All 
Directors are offered such training as is 
considered necessary, both on appointment 
and at any subsequent time. Heidi Roizen 
was appointed in late September. She has 
been provided with induction on 
appointment, including meetings with senior 
management across the Group and in 
respect of the Group’s business operations 
and with the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary in respect of 
governance matters. There is an agreed 
procedure for Directors to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, if necessary.

The Board has undertaken its annual 
evaluation of its own performance and  
that of its individual Directors. It reviewed its 
performance by reference to the schedule of 
matters reserved for it. The evaluation process 
took the form of a questionnaire sent to each 
Director, seeking his views on the Board’s 
mandate, membership, motivation,  
methods, monitoring and measurement. The 
Chairman reported the consensus view on 
performance to the Board at its meeting in 
September, enabling it to conclude that it 
had been effective in the year under  
review. No material changes to procedures 
were considered necessary although the 
Board remains concerned to ensure that it 
maintains a high standard of governance  
in all of its proceedings.

The Committee reviews the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board on any 
changes. During the year it nominated Heidi 
Roizen to the Board as a new independent 
non-executive Director. It determined from its 
search of international candidates centred in 
the US with a strong technology background, 
that Ms Roizen’s experience made her the 
preferred candidate. Heidi Roizen is based  
in Silicon Valley, California.
Her appointment has added to the 
technology and international experience 
represented on the Board, widening further 
the range of insights and perspectives 
brought to its deliberations.
External advice was taken, but advertising 
was not required in this instance. 
The Committee considered the benefits of 
diversity, including gender, during this search 
as recommended by the Code. 
Whilst supportive of the Davies 
recommendation, which is a focused 
aspiration, the Committee’s view is that the 
diversity discussion is broader than gender. It 
is about ensuring that there is an appropriate 
range and balance of skills, experience and 
background on the Board. Achieving this 
balance is a key determinant of any new 
Board appointment we make.
The Committee continued to review 
succession planning for both executive and 
non-executive Directors.

The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal controls. This system 
is designed to provide reasonable assurance 
over the safeguarding of assets and 
shareholders’ investment and the reliability of 
financial information. Any such system can, 
however, provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance of these matters. The 
Group operates on a divisional basis with 
each of the businesses described on pages 
22 to 37 of the Annual Report having 
autonomy as regards its operation and 
establishment of control systems. Overseeing 
the divisional structure is a central 
management team responsible to the Board. 
Certain functions are undertaken centrally, 
notably newsprint buying, insurance, treasury, 
tax, pensions, and risk and assurance 
(including internal audit).
The Directors confirm that they have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls for the period up to 
the date of the approval of the Accounts. 
The Board has not identified any significant 
failings or weaknesses during this reporting 
period. 
The Directors have excluded joint ventures 
and associates, principally Zoopla, from their 
assessment of internal controls over financial 
reporting because the Group does not have 
the ability to dictate or modify controls at 
these entities. Controls over the recording of 
amounts in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements relating to the 
investments has been assessed.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls, the Board has considered 
material controls (including those undertaken 
through its committees), including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and 
risk management systems as follows: 
1) o perations of the audit c ommittee
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, 
has responsibility for the review of internal 
financial controls. It fulfils this by: 
• by receiving regular reports summarising 
the results of internal audit reviews and 
management controls assurance work 
from the Head of Risk & Assurance. These 
include management’s response to any 
recommendations and the progress of any 
required actions;
• being made aware of the results of the Key 
Internal Controls certifications and reviews 
performed by Risk and Assurance; Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 62
• reviewing a summary of letters to 
management prepared by the Group’s 
external auditors following their audit 
procedures; and
• considering significant financial reporting 
issues and approving any changes to 
Group accounting policies, which are  
set centrally. 
2) Risk and assurance
Risk and Assurance carries out internal audit 
activities for the Audit Committee across the 
Group. It has a direct reporting line to the 
Audit Committee and operates under its 
internal audit charter which covers: its 
purpose and objective; its authority and 
scope; independence issues; standards of 
professional practice; performance 
monitoring; planning; and reporting. 
An annual plan is developed each year 
which considers every part of the Group’s 
operations. Input is received from divisional 
and executive management, the Audit 
Committee, external auditors, and with 
reference to past reviews and key risks. The 
Audit Committee approves the internal audit 
plan for the forthcoming year in September. 
Any necessary changes to the plan during 
the year are agreed with the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee.
Risk and Assurance schedule, plan and 
complete internal audit reviews in 
accordance with the annual plan across the 
year; working closely with local and divisional 
management to determine a detailed scope 
for each review. Audit findings are 
categorised according to their significance 
and the overall control environment is rated 
for each review. Audit findings are cleared at 
the completion of the fieldwork and a formal 
report is issued which includes agreed actions 
and the timescale for remediation of control 
weaknesses identified. Regular follow-up of 
audit points is completed by Risk and 
Assurance to ensure that management 
actions are completed within the  
timeframes agreed. 
The department also coordinates with a 
number of the divisions who undertake 
internal controls assurance reviews within 
their respective business. 
In addition to the schedule of reviews set out 
in the annual plan, an annual bribery and 
fraud risk assessment is completed by each 
key business in the Group detailing bribery 
and fraud risks and mitigating controls. Risk 
and Assurance follow up with divisional 
management to ensure that these controls 
are satisfactorily implemented. All divisions 
are adequate and are required to notify Risk 
and Assurance of any bribery or fraud issues 
identified. This allows action to be taken 
where it is felt that control weaknesses  
may exist. 
The Head of Risk and Assurance meets 
regularly with the Audit Committee chairman 
and, at each Audit Committee meeting, 
reports on the internal audit activity across 
the Group, including progress against 
completion of the annual plan, a summary of 
the findings of assurance reviews undertaken 
both by internal audit and by divisional teams 
and the results of follow-up reviews.
3) Confirmation of key internal controls
Each year operating businesses within the 
Group are required to confirm the operation 
of key internal financial controls to the Group 
Accounting department which, in turn, 
reports to the Finance Director. Risk and 
Assurance review these submissions and 
follow up on exceptions as appropriate.
4) Risk committee
The Risk Committee oversees the quality  
and formality of risk management processes 
across the Group. The remit and operation  
of the Risk Committee is described in more 
detail below. 
5) Review of relevant and timely financial 
information
Divisional and executive Boards regularly 
review relevant and timely financial 
information that is produced from the 
management information systems operated 
across the Group. This is supported by a 
framework of rolling 12-month forecasts as 
well as annual budgets that are approved  
at a divisional level by the Investment & 
Finance Committee. 
6) o perations of the investment and Finance 
committee
The evaluation of the benefits and risks of 
investment opportunities and financing 
proposals is undertaken by the Investment 
and Finance Committee. Above certain 
defined levels, however, the Board approves 
programmes relating to acquisition and 
divestment proposals and capital 
expenditure.
7) Senior Accounting Officer sign-off
The HMRC Senior Accounting Officer (SAO) 
rules require the SAO of qualifying companies 
(for DMGT this is the Group Finance Director) 
to certify that the Company (and its 
subsidiaries) have established and 
maintained appropriate arrangements to 
ensure that tax liabilities are calculated 
accurately in all material respects. As a result, 
Group Tax implemented a controls 
questionnaire and performed a series of 
controls reviews of UK businesses.

The oversight and management of significant 
risks around the Group is undertaken by the 
Risk Committee and it accords with the FRC 
Guidance and the Turnbull Guidance on 
internal controls, as updated, appended  
to the Code. 
The Committee comprises Messrs Morgan  
(its Chairman), Daintith, Dutton, Verey and 
Page, Deputy Finance Director of A&N 
Media. Mr Kass, the legal director of A&N 
Media, retired in December, 201 1. Ms Roizen 
and Ms Chapman, the General Counsel  
and Company Secretary, joined the Risk 
Committee from November, 2012. Mr Verey 
provides a non-executive perspective to the 
review of risk management processes within 
the Group, as well as providing a direct link to 
the Audit Committee.
The Committee met four times during the 
year and all meetings were attended by all 
serving members. Individual attendance  
by members is set out on page 62.
The Head of Risk and Assurance, Mr Ashby  
is Secretary to the Committee.
The Group adopts a prudent risk strategy, 
weighing opportunities for potential gain 
against threats to overall business objectives 
and profitability. Senior management 
addresses the opportunities and 
uncertainties relating to the business activities 
of the Group. The risk management process 
consists of the identification, evaluation and 
control of risks, which could threaten the 
achievement of the Group’s strategic, 
operational and financial objectives, as well 
as the active management of opportunities. 
The processes described below were in 
place throughout the year.
The Committee oversees the quality and 
formality of risk management processes 
across the Group. The Committee considers 
the Group risk register (a consolidation of 
divisional and central function risk registers 
with Group-wide risks overlaid) annually. In 
addition, the Committee reviews specific risks 
and monitors developments in relevant 
legislation and regulation to consider the 
impact these might have on the Group 
including on its system of internal controls. This 
year the Committee has focused on 
cyber-attack; the EU Privacy and Electronic 
Communications Regulations; risks from the 
use of social media; Bribery Act compliance; 
health and safety; fraud (as part of the 
annual fraud risk assessment); and business 
continuity planning. The Committee also 
followed up on the recommendations from 
the Editorial Process Review completed in 
201 1. Members of the Risk Committee 
maintain direct links with each of the main 
divisions through attendance at divisional 
board meetings as Directors of these boards. 
The Committee reports to the Board after 
each of its meetings to assist the Board in its 
determination of the overall effectiveness of 
the system of internal control and risk 
management.
aUDiT commi TTee
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, 
has responsibility for the review of financial 
risk management and of internal financial 
controls, as these directly relate to the quality 
of financial reporting. In addition, the 
Committee is mandated to:
•  review all public financial statements of the 
Company and of the Group, including the 
half year and annual financial statements, 
before such statements are submitted to 
the Board;
•  consider any appointment of external 
auditors to Group companies, to review 
audit fees and to consider any questions of 
resignation or dismissal of external auditors;
•  monitor and review the resources and 
effectiveness of internal audit (including 
approval of the appointment and removal 
of the Head of Risk and Assurance);
•  agree the internal audit programme for the 
forthcoming year; and
•  to consider a summary of Group internal 
audit reports and such individual reports as 
the Committee sees fit and corresponding 
management responses to any 
recommendations, and to monitor the 
progress of any required actions.
The Committee monitors the financial 
reporting process and the Group’s statutory 
annual audit. It also considers significant 
financial reporting issues, approves any 
changes to Group accounting policies and 
reviews a summary of recommendation 
letters to management prepared by the 
Group’s external auditors following their audit 
procedures.

The Committee comprises four non-
executive Directors: Messrs Verey (its 
Chairman), Hemingway, Berry and Nelson. 
The Code recommends that an audit 
committee should comprise at least  
three members, all of whom should be 
independent non-executive Directors. Only 
Messrs Verey and Berry are considered to be 
independent under the Code. Nevertheless, 
the Board believes that the Committee 
operated independently during the period. 
Mr Trempont joined the Committee with 
effect from 21st November, 2012 and is 
independent. Members’ qualifications are 
set out in their biographies on pages 50 and 
51. The Board is satisfied that Mr Nelson, senior 
partner of a firm of chartered accountants 
and Mr Verey, the Committee Chairman, 
have recent and relevant financial 
experience. Ms Chapman succeeded Mr 
Jennings as Secretary to the Committee from 
its November, 2012 meeting.
The Audit Committee met four times during 
the year and all meetings were attended by 
all serving members. Individual attendance 
by members is set out on page 63.
The Finance Director attended all meetings 
and the Chief Executive two meetings, each 
by invitation.
The Committee has implemented the 
procedures set out in the updated Guidance 
on Audit Committees, published by the 
Financial Reporting Council in December, 
2010, and updated September, 2012 which 
are within its control. It reviews the Group’s 
policy on whistleblowing.
As noted, the Committee has primary 
responsibility for making a recommendation 
to the Board on the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the external 
auditors, together with approval of their 
remuneration. As part of its role in ensuring 
the effectiveness of the audit process, the 
Committee also undertakes an annual 
assessment of the qualifications, expertise 
and resources of the external auditors.
The appointment of Deloitte LLP as the 
Group’s external auditors (incumbents since 
the last audit tender in 2001) is kept under 
annual review, and, if satisfactory, the 
Committee will recommend the 
reappointment of the audit firm. The 
appointment of Deloitte followed a formal 
tender process undertaken in 2001 and, 
rather than adopting a policy on tendering 
frequency, the annual review of the 
effectiveness of the external audit is 
supplemented by a periodic comprehensive 
reassessment by the Committee. The last 
such reassessment was performed in 2008/09, 
as with many suppliers, when having 
received assurances on the continued 
quality of the audit, the Committee 
determined to recommend the 
reappointment of the incumbent firm. As the 
appointment of the auditors is for one year 
only, being subject to annual approval at the 
Company’s AGM, there is no year-on-year 
contractual commitment to the current audit 
firm and, as such, the Committee may 
undertake an audit tender at any time at its 
discretion. 
Procedures exist to monitor the 
independence of the external auditors  
and include a policy on employment of 
former audit principals.
In performing its review, the Committee 
evaluated the adequacy of the audit firm’s 
key processes and controls in certain key 
areas including, but not limited to:
•  arrangements for ensuring independence 
and objectivity, including the rotation of 
key audit partners;
•  appropriateness of the planned audit 
scope and its execution;
•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the 
auditors in their handling of the key 
accounting and audit judgements; and
•  the quality of their reporting.
During the year, the Committee received 
reports from management on litigation 
matters, investor relations messages, 
correspondence with institutional 
shareholders, analyst and media reaction to 
the Group’s 201 1 preliminary announcement 
and half year and Annual Report, changes in 
the FTSE composition, going concern and on 
developments in international financial 
reporting standards.
The Committee also reviewed the annual 
internal audit plan, summaries of reports 
received and reviewed the effectiveness  
and resources of the Group’s internal audit 
function. In September, it carried out an 
annual review of its terms of reference and  
of its effectiveness and concluded that it did 
not need to recommend to the Board any 
substantive changes to its remit or operations. 
In September, the Board conducted its own 
review of the Committee’s performance and 
confirmed that the Committee had fulfilled its 
obligations and been effective in the year 
under review. Annual Report 2012 strategic Report

Euromoney Institutional Investor plc is subject 
to the requirements of the Code in its own 
right. As disclosed in its latest annual report, it 
has in place its own system of internal control 
and risk management processes which forms 
part of the Group’s overall framework of 
control. The joint ventures and associates of 
the Group are not included in the Group’s 
system of internal control described above.
On 18 April 2012, FTSE announced that 
DMGT’s ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares 
would no longer be eligible for inclusion in 
the UK Index Series. The Board of DMGT has 
considered at length, with the assistance of 
its advisors, the options available to it and the 
suitability of such options to meet the needs 
of its stakeholders to make the ‘ A ’ Ordinary 
Non-Voting Shares eligible for inclusion in the 
UK Index Series but no solution has to date 
been found. The FSA ’s recently issued 
consultation paper on ‘Enhancing the 
effectiveness of the Listing Regime and 
feedback on CP12/2’ makes it more difficult 
to envisage how the Company can regain its 
premium listing. It is unlikely, therefore, that 
the ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting Shares will 
become eligible for inclusion in the index in 
the foreseeable future. However, DMGT’s ‘ A ’ 
Ordinary Non-Voting Shares will continue to 
be standard listed and traded on the London 
Stock Exchange and to be a member of 
other important indices such as MSCI,  
STOXX, S&P and the FTSE Global Equity Index 
Series and DMGT will continue to maintain 
the highest standard of governance  
and disclosure.

During 201 1 the Committee reviewed its 
policy on the provision of non-audit services 
in light of the Ethical Standard, issued by the

The Audit Committee considers services 
under the three headings, set out in the 
Ethical Standard. The Committee determined 
that the policy continued to apply during the  
reporting period.
services where threats to Deloitte’s 
independence are considered low
The first category comprises pre-approved 
services where threats to Deloitte’s 
independence are considered low, typically 
where the engagement is routine in nature 
and the fee immaterial in the context of the 
total annual Group audit fee. In addition 
such pre-approved services include those 
which are audit related, as defined by the 
APB Ethical Standard. Services which may fall 
in this category include the review of the Half 
Yearly Report, reporting on regulatory returns 
and accountancy advice. 
services where there could be a perceived 
threat to independence
The second category is services where there 
could be a perceived threat to independence 
for which approval is required before they are 
undertaken. Non-audit services in these 
areas are considered by the Committee on 
an individual basis and are put out to tender 
where the amounts in question are 
significant. Non-audit services in this category 
would include those with a contingent fee 
arrangement. In these areas, the choice of 
firm is determined on the basis of professional 
expertise and competitiveness. 
services where there is a real threat to 
independence
The third category is services where there is a 
real threat to independence and from which 
the external auditors are therefore excluded. 
These services are specifically prohibited by 
the APB Ethical Standard and comprise: 
• internal audit and IT services where the 
external auditor would place significant 
reliance as part of its audit work; 
• valuation and tax services and litigation 
support where the respective valuation, 
calculations or estimation of the likely 
outcome would have a material effect on 
the financial statements;
• any services where the auditor would 
undertake the role of management or  
take on the role of advocate; and
• contingent fee arrangements where  
the outcome is dependent on a future or 
contemporary audit judgement relating  
to a material matter in the financial 
statements or on a new or uncertain  
tax law interpretation.
In addition to considering the non-audit fees 
to be incurred, the Committee also considers 
both the nature of the services to be 
performed and the safeguards required to 
maintain independence.
Non-audit fees payable to Deloitte LLP in the 
year amounted to £0.8 million, compared to 
£0.8 million in the previous year (note 5).

The Viscount Rothermere
Chairman, Remuneration  
Committee
Over the last year or so widespread concern 
has been expressed on the topic of 
executive compensation generally and 
particularly in relation to schemes which 
reward short-term thinking. Much of this 
concern is valid. 
It is more important than ever that the 
Remuneration Policy is fully aligned with the 
interests of long-term shareholders who want 
to see sustainable growth, businesses that 
respond to technological change and a 
policy of investing for the medium to long 
term and not for short-term returns at the 
expense of creation of long-term value. 
As the Company’s largest shareholder, my 
interests are fully aligned with other 
shareholders. Given this, it’s disappointing 
that the Company has received some 
criticism for the composition of its 
Remuneration Committee. The Committee is 
confident that its make-up ensures that it 
carries out all aspects of its role with proper 
and appropriate regard to long-term 
shareholders’ interests and that this 
alignment is, in fact, stronger as a direct 
consequence of its membership.
Following a detailed review of reward policy 
in 201 1, the Committee decided to further 
strengthen the alignment between the 
interests of the executives and shareholders, 
whilst ensuring that executive compensation 
is fair and easily understood.
Our objective was to combine the necessary 
attention to short-term performance by the 
addition of key business objectives into the 
annual bonus plan, with a stronger focus on 
the fundamentals that drive long-term 
growth, by lengthening the performance 
period to five years and creating a set of 
objectives against which to measure 
progress towards our strategic goals. 
My remuneration continues to follow the 
approach adopted in 2009, as set out in the 
key elements of remuneration table on 
page 70.
The Committee continued its practice of 
setting stretching annual bonus performance 
targets, thus ensuring pay is firmly linked to 
performance. When determining the annual 
pay review for Executive Directors, the 
Committee was mindful of pay elsewhere in 
the Group and shareholder feedback.

The following changes were

years;
• simpler set of LTIP 
performance measures 
linked to the achievement of 
strategic objectives;
• a reduction in annual LTIP 
award from 187 .5% of salary 
to 100% of salary;
• a portion of bonus depends 
on achievement or progress 
towards key strategic 
objectives. For 2012 this was 
20% of bonus; and
• actual bonus outcomes for 
2012 were just above target, 
reflecting good corporate 
performance.

Other activities of the Committee in 2012 
included:
• agreeing pay increases for the Executive 
Directors for the coming year with effect 
from 1st October, 2012 of 3%, except for 
Paul Dacre who has a contractual increase 
of the higher of RPI or 5%;
• agreeing an annual bonus payment for  
the year. The Board considers the 
performance of the Group  
in 2012 to be good and annual bonus 
payments for 2012 were slightly above 
target level;
• agreeing the vesting of the December, 
2009 LTIP award at 52.5% of maximum. 
The award vests in December 2012 based 
on results over the three-year period: 
1st October, 2009 to 30th September, 2012; 
• noting the latest forecast outcomes for the 
previous LTIP awards, the December, 2010 
award is currently estimated to be 20% and 
the 2006 and 2007 awards are estimated to 
be below threshold. A summary of previous 
awards and their estimated vesting can be 
found on page 75; and
• introducing a new provision, so that the 
Committee may decide to reduce or 
eliminate bonus awards, or require 
repayment of a bonus already received in 
the event of material misstatement of 
information or misconduct of the 
participant.
This year we have tried to improve the clarity 
and transparency of the report. Specifically, 
we have introduced a section which covers 
key outcomes for the year at a glance. In 
addition we have commented on the link 
between reward and the performance of 
the business in 2012.

The Committee also spends considerable 
time reviewing the incentive plans of our 
main subsidiaries. Developing the right 
incentives is a key part of ensuring that we 
have the right entrepreneurial culture and 
growth strategies in our various businesses.

Given the increasing importance of the role 
of remuneration and the Group’s desire to 
operate a variety of plans focused on the 
performance and needs of the individual 
businesses. We have recently appointed  
a new Group Reward Director Jane Allen 
who will provide additional internal  
resource to support the Committee and  
the wider management team. The Group 
Reward Director will also be Secretary  
to the Committee with effect from 
21st November, 2012.
The Committee receives regular updates on 
corporate governance as well as pay

in our local markets.

As in previous years, the Committee takes 
account of the views of shareholders and the 
largest shareholders were invited to meet 
with David Nelson in December 201 1 to 
discuss the proposed changes. The 
Remuneration Report received a majority 
vote in favour as did the new LTIP at the AGM. 
We sincerely hope to receive your continued 
support at the AGM on 6th February, 2013, for 
our approach that combines the necessary 
attention to short-term performance with a 
focus on the fundamentals that drive 
long-term value.
All of our work is aimed at ensuring the

talent to deliver against our strategic 
priorities; and
• increasing focus on technology and digital

Officers.
outcomes
The Committee agreed a bonus award of 
121.3% for the Viscount Rothermere, 62.6% of 
salary for Mr Morgan and 68.6% of salary for 
Mr Daintith.
The Committee also agreed a bonus award

Mr Dutton was £90,750.
Bonus deferral
In accordance with revised deferral levels, 
75% of the Viscount Rothermere’s bonus will 
be deferred into shares for three years. For 
Messrs Morgan, Daintith and Beatty, any 
amounts above on target bonus are 
deferred into shares for two years. There is no 
deferral applied to the bonus for Mr Dutton.
LTiP awards vesting in 2011
The LTIP awards made in 2007 did not meet 
the performance criteria in the period up to 
31st December, 201 1. Therefore the LTIP 
award did not vest. There was no LTIP award 
in December, 2008.
LTiP awards vesting in 2012
The 2006 LTIP award, the extended 
performance period of which ends on  
31st December, 2012, is unlikely to meet the 
threshold for vesting. See page 74 for further 
details.
The LTIP awarded in December, 2009 which 
will vest in December, 2012 for which the

The Rem UneRaTion c ommi TTee:  
Ro Le anD ac TiViTies
The Remuneration Committee responsibilities 
include Group remuneration policy and for 
setting the remuneration, benefits and terms 
and conditions of employment of the 
Company’s executive Directors and other 
senior executives. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s 
website.
The members of the Committee are  
the Viscount Rothermere, its Chairman, 
Messrs Berry and Nelson. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’) 
recommends that a remuneration 
committee should be composed entirely of 
independent non-executive Directors. The 
Board considers it appropriate that the 
Viscount Rothermere, as the Company’s 
largest shareholder, is a member of the 
Committee. He always leaves meetings in 
advance of any discussion of his own 
remuneration. While Mr Nelson is not 
considered to be independent under the 
Code, the Board does consider him to act 
independently as regards remuneration 
issues.
The Committee also reviews the Chief 
Executive’s recommendations for the 
remuneration packages of other senior 
executives, except those in Euromoney, and 
oversees the bonus arrangements which are 
reviewed by the Euromoney Remuneration 
Committee and long-term incentive 
arrangements. These are designed 
individually to reflect the targets and 
objectives of each division.
The Committee met five times during the 
year all of which were regular meetings. The 
meetings were attended by all serving 
members, except that the Viscount 
Rothermere did not attend part of one 
meeting, when matters affecting his own 
remuneration were discussed. Individual 
attendance by members is set out below. 
During the year, the Board approved that the 
Secretary to the Committee would now be 
the Group Reward Director.
The Committee seeks the recommendations 
of the Chief Executive, with regards to the 
remuneration of the other executive Directors 
and of other senior executives. He usually 
attends meetings of the Committee by 
invitation. It also seeks input from the Finance 
Director regarding financial performance 
and other issues, from the HR Director, Group 
Reward Director and from the Company 
Secretary. No executive is present when his 
own remuneration is being discussed.
During 2012, the Committee was advised by 
MM&K, a specialist remuneration advisor, 
who were appointed by the Committee. 
MM&K also provided the Company with 
advice on share schemes, provided market 
data of remuneration levels for other 
companies, particularly in the media field 
and advice on best practice.  
Phil Wills Associates were separately 
appointed by management and provided 
remuneration advice to the Committee. 
Neither advisers provided services to any 
other part of the Group. Freshfields, which are 
the Company’s legal advisor, also provided 
advice to the Committee.
In September 2012, the Committee 
conducted a formal review of its 
effectiveness and concluded that it had 
fulfilled its remit and been effective in  
the year.
DmGT’s execUTiVe DiRecTo R  
Rem UneRaTion P oL icy
The Committee seeks to structure 
remuneration packages on an individual 
basis appropriate to the level of responsibility 
that is generally designed to motivate and 
retain the individual. 
The Committee considers that a successful 
remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently 
flexible to take account of commercial 
demands, changing market practice and 
shareholder expectations. Ordinary 
shareholders are provided with the 
opportunity to endorse the Company’s 
remuneration policy on a regular basis 
through the annual vote on the 
Remuneration Report.
A significant proportion of each executive 
Director’s remuneration is performance 
related. 
Risk and reward
During the year the Committee reviewed 
and confirmed that the plans in operation 
throughout the Group did not incentivise 
excessive risk and in particular that the 
remuneration incentives the Company are 
compatible with its risk policies and systems.

Remuneration components
The Committee makes reference, where 
appropriate, to pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially 
when determining annual salary increases, 
and to external evidence of remuneration 
levels in other companies, particularly in the 
media field. It also makes reference to 
advice sought from external advisors. 
Basic F ees anD sa LaRy
Basic salaries are set by the Committee and 
reviewed annually. 
Bon Uses
Executive Directors are eligible for an annual 
bonus dependent on the achievement of 
targets which take account of corporate 
performance as well as key strategic 
objectives. These targets are reviewed 
annually and new objectives are set by the 
Committee for each Director at the start of 
the financial year. Details of the target and 
maximum bonus levels for each of the 
executives can be found on page 70. Details 
of the bonus awards for 2012 can be found 
on page 71 of this report.
LTiP 
The 2012 plan was approved by shareholders 
at the 2012 AGM and has a standard award 
of 100% of salary, for those Executive Directors 
who participate in the plan, although the 
plan rules approved by shareholders 
provides for maximum awards in exceptional 
circumstances of up to 300% of salary.
Performance conditions
The Committee recognises the difficulty of 
setting formula-driven financial goals at a 
Group level over an extended five-year 
period, as well as to the challenges of the 
overall economic environment in general 
and the print businesses in particular. 
The following criteria apply to the LTIP awards 
made in March, 2012, which will be assessed 
by the Committee at the end of 2016, who 
will then decide on the extent to which the 
LTIP awards will vest:
• growing the B2B businesses;
• continue to grow and invest in strong 
brands of digital consumer media – 
particularly MailOnline;
• growing sustainable earnings and 
dividends; and
• increasing the Company’s exposure to 
growth economies and to international 
opportunities.
The performance criteria reflect the priority  
of increasing shareholder value by driving 
long-term sustainable profit growth, whilst 
continuing with our investment in a  
digital business. 
The performance conditions for awards to be 
made in December, 2012 follow the same 
principles for the awards that were made in 
March, 2012. 
Awards that have been made under the 
2012 LTIP scheme are shown below.

Graphs
Graphs of the Company’s performance 
against each of its comparators for each  
of these periods are set out on page 75. 
These graphs have been plotted using the 
relative rankings of each comparator at  
the end of each month. As such, they are 
approximations to the actual rankings under 
the rules, which are calculated using a 
two-month average for the starting point 
and for each subsequent month. This can 
give different results between the table 
above and the graphs.
The graphs on page 74 compare the 
Company’s total shareholder return with  
that of the FTSE 100 index over a period of  
five years, as required by the Regulations.  
As a constituent of the FTSE 100 from 1999 to 
2006 and during 2007 and as a constituent  
of the media index throughout the period, 
the Directors regard both indices as the  
most appropriate indices for purposes of 
comparison of the Group’s performance. 
Additional graphs on that page illustrate 
performance over a 26-year period for  
which data is available. 
The graphs on pages 74 and 75 are

dates (which start in the 30th month  
following the date of grant of a particular 
option), the total shareholder return (TSR)  
of the Company must exceed that of the 
FTSE 100 index. Secondly, there must be  
real growth in earnings per share (‘eps’)  
over a period of three consecutive  
financial years.

Deferred Bonus scheme
Under the deferred bonus plan, an element 
of executive Directors’ bonuses are deferred 
into ‘nil’ cost options. The awards shown 
below were granted as part of this plan.
The ‘nil’-cost options granted during the year 
were derived from the Directors’ bonus in the 
prior year. After the date of approval of this 
Report, the ‘nil’-cost options earned in the 
current year will be granted.

Pensions entitlements and cash allowances
The Group operates a two-tier defined 
benefit pension scheme for senior 
employees. It is the Company’s policy  
that annual bonuses, payments under  
the Executive Bonus Scheme and benefits  
in kind are not pensionable.
Prior to 6th April, 2006 the Committee 
reviewed in detail the impact of the pension’s 
tax regime operating from that date. It 
developed a new policy, designed to be 
neutral in terms of cost compared to existing 
expenditure on pensions. This new policy 
incorporated the removal of the pensionable 
earnings cap for pension accruing after  
6th April, 2006.
Individual Executive Directors were affected 
very differently by these changes and for 
some it was not tax-efficient to accrue further 
pension for service from 6th April, 2006. 
However, it was for individual Directors to 
decide when to opt out of the scheme, in 
which case a cash allowance is paid. 
Annual cash allowances of 37% of salary are 
paid to each of the Viscount Rothermere, Mr 
Morgan and Mr Beatty, in lieu of continued 
membership of the DMGT Senior Executives’ 
Pension Fund. Mr Dacre was paid a similar 
allowance until December, 2009. 
Mr Daintith is paid an allowance of 30% of 
basic salary in lieu of membership of a 
Company pension scheme.
The Company does not make any pension 
contributions on behalf of Mr Dutton.
No Executive Directors are now accruing 
further pension in the DMGT Senior 
Executives’ Pension Fund. The normal 
retirement age under the Fund for this group 
is 60. 
Accrued entitlements under the DMGT Senior 
Executives’ Pension Fund are shown in the

Mr Dacre had a rolling contract which 
reduced to one year on 14th November, 201 1 
and reduced further on 14th November, 2012 
to the residual term until his sixty-fifth birthday 
on 14th November, 2013.
Details of these service contracts are set out 
in the table below.
Leaver provisions
In the event of earlier termination of their 
contracts, each Director is entitled to 
compensation equal to his basic salary, 
benefits, pension entitlement and, as 
appropriate, bonus or profit share for their 
notice period.
The contracts of Mr Morgan and Mr Daintith 
are subject to mitigation and, in the event of 
the Director obtaining alternative 
employment during the notice period, do 
not provide for further payment after such 
event. This mitigation does not apply to their 
pension benefit. Share options and LTIPs 
would be treated as for any member of the 
scheme, depending on the reason for 
termination of the contract.
Policy on external appointments
The Company allows its Executive Directors  
to take a very limited number of outside 
directorships. Individuals retain the payments 
received from such services since these 
appointments are not expected to impinge 
on their principal employment.
Mr Morgan was appointed to the Board of 
the City of London Investment Trust on 1st 
March, 2012 and receives a fee of £25,00 p.a. 
(£14,583 for the reporting period).

For each Director, the accrued entitlement at 30th September, 2012 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement,  
based on the salary of each Director at this date and pensionable service accrued to 5th April, 2006 or subsequent date of opting out of the Fund. A spouse’s/
dependant’s pension equal to two-thirds of the Director’s pension is incorporated and the Director can elect to receive the pension from age 50, subject to a 
discount if retirement takes place before 60. The pension, when in payment, will receive annual increases in line with inflation, which may be limited when inflation 
exceeds 3% per annum.
2 
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with UK legislation. The transfer values of the accrued entitlement 
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the 
Directors’ pension benefits.

  Mr Morgan began to take his pension benefits in March, 2010. Mr Morgan’s pension benefit in the above table relates to a pension in the DMGT Senior Executives’ 
Pension Fund for pensionable service between 8th May, 1989 and 31st August, 2000, when he transferred to the US. In addition, Mr Morgan has the following

Policy on non-executive  
Directors’ remuneration
The Board’s policy on non-executive 
Directors’ remuneration is to pay fees which 
reflect their responsibilities, are competitive 
with other companies and which align 
Directors’ interests with those of shareholders. 
The Board as a whole considers and 
approves the fees of the non-executive 
Directors with the exception of the Chairman 
whose fees are approved by the Committee.
The fees for the Chairman and non-executive 
Directors are paid at the annual rates shown 
in the table below:
Fees 1 Oct 11
Board Member 35,000

Audit Committee Chairman 25,000

Risk Committee Member 8,000

An increase in the base fee from £30,000 to 
£35,000 per annum was made from 1st October, 
2011 the first such increase for five years. 
During the year, the Directors reviewed the  
travel allowances to reflect the greater level 
of international travel required. Directors 
received travel allowance in 2012 of £4,000 
paid in respect of attendance at Board 
meetings involving more than 10 hours’  
travel. With effect from 1st October, 2012  
the Committee agreed a travel allowance  
of £4,000 will be paid for travel involving 
between 5 and 10 hours and £10,000 for 
Board meetings involving more than  
10 hours’ travel.
In addition the following fees were increased 
effective 1st October, 2012. Mr Nelson’s fee for 
his work in relation to the Remuneration 
Committee increased to £25,000; the fee for 
members of the Audit Committee increased 
to £14,000 and for the Audit Committee 
Chairman to £30,000.
n on-executive Directors’ terms of 
appointment
Non-executive Directors are appointed for 
specified terms and under the Company’s 
Articles of Association are subject to 
re-election by Ordinary shareholders at  
the Annual General Meeting following 
appointment, and thereafter at least every 
three years. The Board has adopted the 
provision in the Code that they be subject to 
annual re-election. Each appointment can 
be terminated before the end of the one 
year period, with no notice or fees due. The 
dates of the appointment or subsequent 
re-appointment of the non-executive 
Directors are set out in the next column.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended 30th September, 2012 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related Notes 1 to 44. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30th September, 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•  the Directors’ statement, contained within the Financial and Treasury review, in relation to going concern; and
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review;
•  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended 
30th
 
September, 2012 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Financial Statements 89
1) BASIS OF PREPARATION
DMGT is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is given on page 187 .
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies preparing their accounts under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared for the 52 weeks ending 30th September, 2012 (201 1 52 weeks ending 2nd October, 201 1).
The Group and its national and local media divisions prepare financial statements for a 52- or 53-week financial period ending on a Sunday near 
to the end of September. The Group’s remaining divisions prepare financial statements for a financial year to 30th September and do not prepare 
additional financial statements corresponding to the Group’s financial year for consolidation purposes as it would be impracticable to do so. The 
Group considers whether there have been any significant transactions or events between the end of the financial year of the other divisions and 
the end of the Group’s financial year and makes any material adjustments as appropriate. For the current period, the Group’s national and local 
media divisions’ financial period end coincided with that of the Group’s remaining divisions and consequently no adjustments were necessary. 
The significant accounting policies used in preparing this information are set out in Note 2.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the 201 1 Annual Report and Accounts, 
with the exception of a restatement of results, described below and as amended by the new accounting standards described below.
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiaries together with the Group’s share 
of all of its interests in joint ventures and associates. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the 
revaluation of financial instruments.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in  
the Financial and Treasury Review on pages 38 to 43, the Strategic Report on pages 10 to 37 and the Directos’ report on pages 52 to 57 .  
The Group’s funding arrangements, together with details of undrawn bank facilities, are disclosed in notes 32 and 33.
As highlighted in notes 32 and 33 to the financial statements, the company has long-term financing in the form of bonds and meets its day-to-
day working capital requirements through bank facilities which expire in April 2016. The current economic conditions create uncertainty 
particularly over the future performance of those parts of the business that derive a significant proportion of revenue from advertising. The 
Board’s forecasts and projections, after taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group is 
expected to operate within the terms of its current facilities. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will have access to adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Restatement of results
The adjusted and reported results of the Group have been restated to reflect a refinement of Hobsons’ approach to revenue recognition. Hobsons’ 
business model has evolved such that the provision of its Enrolment Management Technology (EMT) software services (currently around 47% of its 
annual revenues of approximately £64 million) is now predominantly provided in conjunction with a hosting service. To better reflect the underlying 
nature of the revenue contracts, software services provided in conjunction with a hosting service will now be recognised over the contract service 
period, rather than at the contract date of sale of the software licence. The recognition of revenue from existing hosting services will continue to be 
recognised over the contract service period. This change of accounting treatment has been reflected in the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements retrospectively and the impact on the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is as follows:

2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – CONTINUED 
The reported results of the Group’s share of results of joint ventures and associates have also been restated to reflect the Group’s share of results 
from the joint venture DMG Radio Investments Ltd as discontinued, following its disposal in August 2012. In addition the Group’s local media 
operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations following the transfer of the net assets of this business to assets held-for -sale. 
Further details are included in note 18.
Impact of new accounting standards
Standards not affecting the reported results or the financial position:
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any significant 
impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements:
• IAS 24 (2009) related party disclosures
The revised Standard has a new, clearer definition of a related party, with inconsistencies under the previous definition having been removed. 
This interpretation does not affect the reported results nor the financial position.
• Amendments to IFRIC 14 prepayments of a minimum funding requirement 
The amendments now enable recognition of an asset in the form of a prepaid minimum funding contribution.
• Annual improvements 
– IFRS 7: Encourages qualitative disclosures in the context of the quantitative disclosures required to help users to form an overall picture of the 
nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments. This improvement does not affect the Group’s reported results, financial position nor 
any of the Group’s disclosures at the year end.
– IAS 1: Clarifies that an entity may present the analysis of other comprehensive income by item in the statement of changes in equity or in the 
notes to the financial statements. The Group currently reflects this analysis in the notes to the financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of the consolidated financial information the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been 
applied in the consolidated financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU). 
Other than IAS 19 (Revised) Employee Benefits, their adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the amounts reported in the 
financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
IAS 19 (Revised) Employee Benefits, will impact the measurement of various components in the defined benefit pension obligation and 
associated disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. It is likely that following the replacement of expected returns on plan assets with a 
net finance cost in the Consolidated Income Statement, the profit for the period will be reduced and accordingly other comprehensive 
income increased. 
• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
• IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
• IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in other entities
• IFRS 1 1 joint Arrangements
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
• IAS 28 (Revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
• IAS 27 (Revised) Separate Financial Statements
• Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
• Improvements to IFRSs 201 1
• Amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 – Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent arrangement, measured at its 
acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted through the Consolidated Income Statement. All other 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. 
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that 
existed as of the date of the acquisition that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is a maximum of one year. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 91
Directors’ Report
Governance
Financial Statements 91
Business combinations achieved in stages
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at 
the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts arising from 
interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that were recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated 
Income Statement where such treatment would be appropriate if the interest were disposed of.
Purchases and sales of shares in a controlled entity
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity increases, the non-controlling interests’ share of net assets, excluding any allocation of 
goodwill, is transferred to retained earnings. Any difference between the cost of the additional interest and the existing carrying value of the 
non-controlling interests’ share of net assets is recorded in retained earnings.
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity decreases, but the Group retains control, the share of net assets disposed, excluding any 
allocation of goodwill, is transferred to the non-controlling interest. Any difference between the proceeds of the disposal and the existing 
carrying value of the net assets or liabilities transferred to the non-controlling interests is recorded in retained earnings. 
Disposal of controlling interests where non-controlling interest retained
Where the Group disposes of a controlling interest but retains a non-controlling interest in the business, the Group accounts for the disposal of a 
subsidiary and the subsequent acquisition of a joint venture, associate or available-for-sale asset at fair value on initial recognition. On disposal 
of a subsidiary all amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Business combinations occurring prior to 4th October, 2009
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, other than non-current assets and liabilities of disposal groups which are recognised at 
fair value less costs to sell. Where an adjustment to fair values relating to previously held interests (including interests which were equity accounted 
under IAS 28, Investments in associates) is required on achieving control, this is accounted for as an adjustment directly in equity.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. Where control is achieved 
in more than one exchange transaction, goodwill is calculated separately for each transaction based on the cost of each transaction and the 
appropriate share of the acquiree’s net assets based on net fair values at the time of each transaction.
The interest of non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Purchase and sale of shares in a controlled entity occurring prior to 4th October, 2009
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity increases, no adjustments are recorded to the fair values of the assets already held on the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The Group calculates the goodwill arising as the difference between the cost of the additional 
interest acquired and the increase in the Group’s interest in the fair value of the subsidiary’s net assets at the date of the exchange transaction. 
Any difference between the cost of the additional interest, goodwill arising and the existing carrying value of the non-controlling interest’s 
share of net assets is adjusted directly in equity.
Where the Group’s interest in a controlled entity decreases, which does not result in a change of control, the Group increases the non-
controlling interest’s share of net assets by the book value of the share of net assets disposed. Any profit or loss on disposal of the share of net 
assets to the non-controlling interest is calculated by reference to the consideration received, the book value of the share of net assets 
disposed and a proportion of any relevant goodwill in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position relating to the subsidiary.
Accounting for subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date 
control is obtained or up to the date control is relinquished, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling 
interests consist of the  amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and for acquisitions post 3rd October, 2010 
following adoption of IAS 27 (revised 2008), the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. 
Prior to the adoption of IAS 27 (revised 2008) losses attributable to non-controlling interests in excess of the non-controlling interest’s share in 
equity were allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a binding obligation and is  
able to make an additional investment  to cover such losses. When the subsidiary subsequently reports profits, the non-controlling interest does 
not participate until the Group has recovered all of the losses of the non-controlling interest it previously reported.
Interests in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint 
control, that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the  
parties sharing control. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 92
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – CONTINUED 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control 
over those policies.
The post-tax results of joint ventures and associates are incorporated in the Group’s results using the equity method of accounting. Under the 
equity method, investments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost as adjusted  
for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture and associate, less any impairment in the value of investment. 
Losses of joint ventures and associates in excess of the of the Group’s interest in that joint venture or associate are not recognised. Additional losses 
are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments 
on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
joint venture or associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount 
of the investment.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than Sterling 
are translated to Sterling using exchange rates prevailing on the period end date. Income and expense items and cash flows are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, 
the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the gain 
or loss on sale.
The Group records foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign operations within the translation reserve in equity.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded 
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each period end date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the period end date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate prevailing on the date when 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement for the period. 
Goodwill, intangible assets and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations after transition to IFRS are treated as part of 
the assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing rate. Goodwill which arose pre-transition to IFRS is not translated.
In respect of all foreign operations, any cumulative exchange differences that have arisen before 4th October, 2004, the date of transition to 
IFRS, were reset to £nil and will be excluded from the determination of any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill and intangible assets acquired arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill arising 
on an acquisition is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are 
translated at the closing exchange rates on the period end date.
Goodwill arising before the date of transition to IFRS, on 4th October, 2004, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired. Intangible assets 
are tested separately from goodwill only where impairment indicators exist. The Group has no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as 
cash-generating units (CGUs). If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit, pro-rated on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit, but subject to not reducing any asset below its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all of the Group’s CGUs are measured at the higher of value in use and fair value  
less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated by discounting future expected cash flows. These calculations use cash flow projections based on 
management approved budgets and projections which reflect management’s current experience and future expectations of the markets in 
which the CGU operates. Risk adjusted discount rates used by the Group in its impairment tests range from 8.5% to  23% post tax (1 1.3% to 30.7% 
pre-tax) (201 1 8.5 % to 10.0 % post tax 9.2 % to 10.7 % pre tax, 2010 8.5 % to 1 1.5 % post tax, 9.3 % to 12.3 % pre-tax), the choice of rates depending 
on the market and maturity of the CGU. The Group’s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital has not changed significantly from the  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 93

previous year. The projections consist of Board approved budgets for the following year, three year plans and growth rates beyond this period. 
The long-term growth rates range between  -3.0% and +3.0% (201 1 -3.0 % and +3.0 %, 2010 0.0 % and +3.0 %) and vary with management’s view of 
the CGU’s market position, maturity of the relevant market and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which it operates.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.  An internally-generated intangible asset 
arising from the Group’s development activity, including software for internal use, is recognised only if the asset can be separately identified, it is 
probable the asset will generate future economic benefits, the development cost can be measured reliably, the project is technically feasible 
and the project will be completed with a view to sell or use the asset. Additionally, guidance in Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) 32 has 
been applied in accounting for internally developed website development costs.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, when the asset is available for use, and 
are reported net of impairment losses. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is charged 
to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which it incurred.
Licences
Radio licences are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged to  the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight- 
line basis over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of service of the network, estimated by management to be 20 years.
Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. These costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives, being three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that are 
expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs and directly attributable overheads are capitalised as intangibles. 
Computer software which is integral to a related item of hardware equipment is accounted for as property, plant and equipment.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
At each period end date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement on a reducing balance or straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets from the 
date they become available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Publishing rights, titles and exhibitions 5 – 30 years
Radio licences 20 years
Brands 3 – 20 years
Market and customer related databases 3 – 20 years
Customer relationships 3 – 20 years
Computer software licences 2 – 5 years
Impairment of intangible assets
At each period end date, reviews are carried out of the carrying amounts of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher 
of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, value in use estimates are made based on the cash flows of the 
cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its net carrying amount, the net carrying amount of the asset 
or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods, for 
an asset other than goodwill, may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of that asset. In assessing whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods for an asset other than 
goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased, the Group considers, as a minimum, the following indications:
(a) Whether the asset’s market value has increased significantly during the period; 
(b) Whether any significant changes with a favourable effect on the entity have taken place during the period, or will take place in the near 
future, in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the entity operates or in the market to which the asset is dedicated; 
and 
(c) Whether market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have decreased during the period, and those decreases are 
likely to affect the discount rate used in calculating the asset’s value in use and increase the asset’s recoverable amount materially. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 94
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – CONTINUED
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings held for use are stated in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated 
depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. 
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets commences when 
the assets are ready for their intended use.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the 
term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than property, plant and equipment under construction using the straight-line 
method, over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years
Short leasehold premises the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 – 25 years
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land
Investment property
The Group transfers property from property, plant and equipment to investment property when owner occupation ends. Investment properties 
are stated in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent 
accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of these assets, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold properties 50 years
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The Group uses the Average Cost 
(AVCO) method in the national and local media divisions and the First In First Out (FIFO) method in the remaining divisions.
Pre-publication costs
Pre-publication costs represent direct costs incurred in the development of titles prior to their publication. These costs are recognised as work in progress 
on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to the extent that future economic benefit is virtually certain and can be measured reliably.
Marketing costs
Marketing and promotional costs are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term 
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and 
cash equivalents are as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
Revenue
Group revenue comprises revenue of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. Revenue is stated at the fair value of consideration, net of 
value added tax, trade discounts and commission where applicable and is recognised using methods appropriate for the Group’s businesses.  
Where revenue contracts have multiple elements (such as software licences, data subscriptions, hostings and support), the Company considers 
all aspects of the transaction to determine whether these elements can be separately identified. Where transaction elements can be separately 
identified and revenue can be allocated between them on a fair and reliable basis, revenue for each element is accounted for according to 
the relevant policy below. Where transaction elements cannot be separately identified, revenue is recognised over the contract period. 
The principal revenue recognition policies, as applied by the Group’s major businesses, are as follows:
• Subscriptions revenue, including revenue from information services, is recognised over the period of the subscription or contract.
• Publishing and circulation revenue is recognised on issue of publication or report. 
• Advertising revenue is recognised on issue of publication, over the period of the online campaign or on the date of broadcast. 
• Contract print revenue is recognised on completion of the print contract. 
• Exhibitions, training and events revenues are recognised over the period of the event. 
•  Software licence revenue is recognised on delivery of the software licence or over the period of the licence if support is unable to be  
separately identified from hosting and revenue allocated on a fair and reliable basis.
• Support revenue associated with software licences and subscriptions is recognised over the term of the support contract.
•  Long-term contract revenue is recognised under the percentage of completion method according to the percentage of work  
completed at the period end date.  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 95
Directors’ Report
Governance
Financial Statements 95
Operating profit before exceptional operating costs and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets
The Group discloses as operating profit, profit before exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets arising on business combinations, share of results from associates and joint ventures, other gains and losses, investment 
income and finance costs, but after amortisation of internally generated and acquired computer software. The Directors believe that this measure 
is useful to readers as it shows the results of the Group’s operations before contribution from joint ventures and associates and because it excludes 
one-off gains and losses on disposal of businesses, properties and similar items of a non-recurring nature.
Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses comprise profit or loss on sale of trading investments, profit or loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, impairment 
of available-for-sale assets, profit or loss on sale of businesses and profit or loss on sale of joint ventures and associates.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to 
the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments as determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and 
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Dividends are recognised 
as a distribution in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Borrowing costs
Unless capitalised under IAS 23 all borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Finance charges, including premiums paid on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs and discounts related to borrowings, are accounted 
for on an accruals basis and charged to the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest method.
Retirement benefits
As permitted by IFRS 1, First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial 
gains and losses in the pension schemes operated by the Group at 4th October, 2004 the date of transition to IFRS. Pension scheme assets are 
measured at market value at the period end date. Scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method and discounted at 
a rate reflecting current yields on high quality corporate bonds having regard to the duration of the liability profiles of the schemes.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised 
as an asset or liability on the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position. Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are taken to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous  actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. For 
defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out triennially. In accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries in assessing whether to recognise a surplus, the Group 
has regard to the principles set out in IFRIC 14.
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, including the current service cost, any past 
service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements. The interest cost less the expected return on assets is also charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement within net finance costs. 
Since the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit plans cannot be allocated to individual entities on a fair and reasonable basis, the 
scheme’s assets and liabilities are not attributed to reporting segments and the pension charge in each segment in the segmental analysis 
represents the contributions payable for the period.
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax for the year.
The current tax payable or recoverable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using the UK and foreign  tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset and stated net in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
or on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 96
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – CONTINUED
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising in investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Goodwill arising on business combinations also includes amounts corresponding to deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of acquired 
intangible assets. A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value 
of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each period end date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end date, and is not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and liability simultaneously and where the Group intends to net settle.
Financial assets
TRADE RECEIvABLES
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
AvAILABLE-FOR-SALE INvESTMENTS
Investments and financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are measured at fair value, 
including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either fair value through profit or loss or available-for-sale. Where securities are held-for-trading purposes, gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the  
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. 
The fair value of listed securities is determined based on quoted market prices, and of unlisted securities on management’s estimate of fair value 
determined by discounting future cash flows to net present value using market interest rates prevailing at the period end.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in 
the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments 
are set out below:
Capital market and bank borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the Group’s bonds are subject to fair value hedge accounting 
as explained below and this portion is adjusted for the movement in the hedged risk to the extent hedge effectiveness is achieved. Any difference 
between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the period end date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 97
Directors’ Report
Governance
Financial Statements 97
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a binomial pricing model which is calibrated using a Black-Scholes framework. The expected life used in the models 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each period end date for 
cash-settled share-based payments.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-based Payments to all equity instruments granted after 7th September, 2002 but not 
fully vested at 4th October, 2004 the date of transition to IFRS.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In addition to the judgement taken by management in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, management has made 
the following judgements concerning the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
Forecasting
The Group prepares medium-term forecasts based on Board approved budgets and three year outlooks. These are used to support judgements 
made in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements including the recognition of deferred tax assets in different jurisdictions, the Group’s 
going concern assessment and for the purposes of impairment reviews. Longer-term forecasts use long-term growth rates applicable to the 
relevant businesses.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of an impairment of intangible assets should be recorded 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the relevant cash generating units. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate 
the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and compare the net present value of these cash flows using a suitable 
discount rate to determine if any impairment has occurred. A key area of judgement is deciding the long-term growth rate of the applicable 
businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows (note 20). The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets at the period end 
date was £986.0 million (201 1 £1,035.2 million, 2010 £1,1 13.7 million) after a net impairment charge of £19.4 million (201 1 charge of £24.4 million, 2010 
reversal of £19.9 million) was recognised during the year (Notes 20 and 21).
Acquisitions and intangible assets
The Group’s accounting policy on the acquisition of subsidiaries is to allocate purchase consideration to the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired with any excess consideration representing goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired requires significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to cash flows and unprovided liabilities and 
commitments, including in respect to tax, are often used. The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination at 
fair values at the date of the acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions 
on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Additionally, management 
must estimate the expected useful economic lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly.
Contingent consideration payable
Estimates are required in respect of the amount of contingent consideration payable on acquisitions, which is determined according to formulae 
agreed at the time of the business combination, and normally related to the future earnings of the acquired business. The Directors review the 
amount of contingent consideration likely to become payable at each period end date, the major assumption being the level of future profits of the 
acquired business. The Group has outstanding contingent consideration payable amounting to £24.2  million (201 1 £1 1.8 million, 2010 £17 .8 million).
Contingent consideration payable is discounted to its fair value in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. For 
acquisitions completed prior to 4th October, 2009, the difference between the fair value of these liabilities and the actual amounts payable is 
charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as notional finance costs with remeasurement of the liability being recorded against goodwill. 
For acquisitions completed in the current period, movements in the fair value of these liabilities are recorded in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in Financing.
Contingent consideration receivable
Estimates are required in respect of the amount of contingent consideration receivable on disposals, which is determined according to formulae 
agreed at the time of the disposal and is normally related to the future earnings of the disposed business. The Directors review the amount of 
contingent consideration likely to be receivable at each period end date, the major assumption being the level of future profits of the disposed 
business. The Group has outstanding contingent consideration receivable amounting to £1.2 million (201 1 £1.6 million, 2010 £4.9 million).
Contingent consideration receivable is discounted to its fair value in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. 
For disposals completed prior to 4th October, 2009, the difference between the fair value of these liabilities and the actual amounts payable is 
charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as notional finance costs with remeasurement of the liability being recorded against goodwill. 
For acquisitions completed in the current period, movements in the fair value of these liabilities are recorded in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in Financing. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 98
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – CONTINUED
Adjusted profit
The Group presents adjusted earnings by making adjustments for costs and profits which management believe to be exceptional in nature by virtue 
of their size or incidence or have a distortive effect on current year earnings. Such items would include costs associated with business combinations, 
one-off gains and losses on disposal of businesses, properties and similar items of a non-recurring nature together with reorganisation costs and 
similar charges, tax and by adding back impairment of goodwill and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising on business 
combinations. See Note 13 for a reconciliation of profit before tax to adjusted profit. 
Share-based payments
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, 
calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of 
the options are the discount rate, the Group’s share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and  expected option lives. Management 
regularly perform a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest; this is dependent on the anticipated number of 
leavers. See Note 41 for further detail.
Taxation
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure which makes  
the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often 
dependent on the efficiency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to  resolve. The Group accounts for unresolved issues based on 
its best estimate of the final outcome, however, the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ 
significantly from the accounting estimates and, therefore, impact the Group’s results and future cash flows. As described above, the Group 
makes estimates regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to losses based on forecasts of future taxable profits which are,  
by their nature, uncertain.
Retirement benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension plans is determined using actuarial valuations prepared by the Group’s actuaries. This involves making 
certain assumptions concerning discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension 
increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions and the resulting 
estimates are reviewed annually and, when appropriate, changes are made which affect the actuarial valuations and, hence, the amount of 
retirement benefit expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the amounts of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The carrying amount of the retirement benefit obligation at 30th September, 2012 was a deficit 
of £324.4 million (201 1 £336.2 million, 2010 £271.4 million). Further details are given in Note 34.
3) SEGMENT ANALYSIS
The Group’s business activities are split into seven operating divisions: RMS, business information, events, Euromoney, national media, local media 
and radio. These divisions are the basis on which information is reported to the Group Board. The segment result is the measure used for the purposes 
of resource allocation and assessment and represents profit earned by each segment, including share of results from joint ventures and associates 
but before exceptional operating costs, amortisation and impairment charges, other gains and losses, net finance costs and taxation.
Details of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues are included within the Strategic Report on pages 
22 to 37 .
The accounting policies applied in preparing the management information for each of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s 
accounting policies described in Note 2.
Inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market prices other than the sale of newsprint and related services from the national media to the 
local media division which is at cost to the Group plus a margin where relevant. The amount of newsprint sold between segments during the 
period amounted to £20.7 million (201 1 £23.6 million). Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 99

Discontinued operations 18 9.3 (1.2)
18.8 3.7 
Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure. The tax charge is 
reviewed and measured on a Group total basis only.
A current tax credit of £0.6 million (201 1 £nil) and a deferred tax credit of £5.0 million (201 1 £17 .7 million) was recognised directly in equity (Note 
38 and 39).
The tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 25.0% (201 1 27 .0%) representing the weighted average 
annual corporate tax rate for the full financial year. The differences are explained below:

11) TAX – CONTINUED
Adjusted tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and non-recurring items (adjusted tax charge) 
amounted to a charge of £39.0 million (201 1 £33.7 million) and the resulting rate is 15.2% (201 1 14.4%). The differences between the tax credit and 
the adjusted tax charge are shown in the reconciliation below:

Adjusted tax charge on the profit for the year (39.0) (33.7)
In calculating the adjusted tax rate, the Group excludes the potential future deferred tax effects of intangible assets and goodwill (other than 
internally generated and acquired computer software) as it prefers to give the users of its accounts a view of the tax charge based on the 
current status of such items.
Tax on other exceptional items includes a charge of £1.9 million (201 1 £29.6 million) relating to the recognition of further tax losses and other 
temporary differences which are treated as exceptional due to their material impact on the Group’s adjusted  tax charge.

14) EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share of 67 .2 p (201 1 28.3 p) and diluted earnings per share of 65.1 p (201 1 27 .7 p) are calculated, in accordance with IAS 33, 
Earnings per share, on Group profit for the financial period of £202.4 million (201 1 £1 13.7 million) as adjusted for the effect of dilutive ordinary shares 
of £0.6 million (201 1 £1.0 million) and earnings from discontinued operations of £54.8 million (201 1 loss £5.2 million) and on the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, as set out below.
As in previous years, adjusted earnings per share have also been disclosed since the Directors consider that this alternative measure gives a more 
comparable indication of the Group’s underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings per share of 49.4 p (201 1 46.1 p) are calculated on 
profit for continuing and discontinued operations before exceptional operating costs, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, amortisation 
of intangible assets arising on business combinations, other gains and losses and exceptional financing costs after taxation and non-controlling 
interests associated with those profits, of £189.1 million (201 1 £176.6 million), as set out in Note 13 above, and on the basic weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

(i) The amount of goodwill which is deductible for the purposes of calculating the Group’s tax charge amounts to £nil.
(ii) The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated on an acquisition by acquisition 
basis using available data forecasts. The range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent consideration relating to acquisitions in the year  
is £nil to £42.9 million. Certain contingent consideration arrangements are not capped since they are based on future business performance 
(Note 35).
Directly attributable costs in relation to the above acquisitions amounted to £0.1 million.
The contingent consideration has been discounted back to current values in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations. In each case,  
the Group has used acquisition accounting to account for the purchase.
If all acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial period, Group revenues for the period would have been £1,761.1 million and 
Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £258.8 million. This information takes into account the amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets together with related income tax effects but excludes any pre-acquisition finance costs and should not be viewed as 
indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisitions had actually been completed on the first day of the financial period.
Total losses attributable to equity holders of the parent since the date of acquisition for companies acquired during the period amounted to 
£1.0 million.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the Group’s products in 
new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations.

During the period, the Group acquired additional shares in controlled entities amounting to £14.8 million (201 1 £2.7 million). In addition, the Group 
opted to receive a scrip dividend from Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC (Euromoney) amounting to £16.0 million (201 1 £14.2 million) thereby 
acquiring a further 0.6 % (201 1 0.5 %) of the issued ordinary share capital of Euromoney. Under the Group’s accounting policy for the acquisition of 
shares in controlled entities, no adjustment has been recorded to the fair value of assets and liabilities already held on the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position. The difference between the cost of the additional shares and the carrying value of the non-controlling interests share of 
net assets is adjusted in retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings in the period was a charge of £13.5 million (201 1 £4.3 million).

17) SUMMARY OF THE EFFECTS OF DISPOSALS
On October 14th, 201 1 the Group announced that it had agreed to merge the online property business of its Digital Property Group (‘DPG’), which 
includes FindaProperty.com and Primelocation.com, with those of Zoopla Limited (Zoopla) operator of Zoopla.co.uk. Zoopla is a privately owned 
company which has venture capital interests as its largest shareholders. Following the transaction, the Group retained a 52.25% interest in the newly 
merged entity; however since the Group has joint management control the investment in Zoopla has been equity accounted as a joint venture.

The Group’s policy on impairment of goodwill is set out in Note 2.
Further disclosures in accordance with paragraph 134 of IAS 36, Impairment of assets, are provided where the Group holds an individual goodwill 
item relating to a CGU that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15.0 % of the total net book value, in comparison with the Group’s total

Genscape has a carrying value of £72.6 million (201 1 £72.9 million, 2010 £73.1 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of 
£25.6 million (201 1 £24.3 million, 2010 £25.9 million). The carrying value of Genscape has been determined using a value in use calculation in line 
with IAS 36. The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including;
(i) Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2012. The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable.
(ii) Subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business.
(iii) A discount rate of 10.0%, and
(iv) Long-term nominal growth rates of 3.0%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £22.9 million. For this business the Directors 
performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU. For the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying value then the 
discount rate would need to be increased by 1.6 % or the long-term growth rate would need to be reduced by 2.3%.
BCA has a carrying value of £143.2 million (201 1 £148.4 million, 2010 £146.7 million) together with intangible assets with a carrying value of £62.8 
million (201 1 £71.8 million, 2010 £78.0 million). The carrying value of BCA has been determined using a value in use calculation in line with IAS 36. 
The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including;
(i) Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2012. The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable.
(ii) Subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business.
(iii) A discount rate of 8.5%, and
(iv) Long-term nominal growth rates of 3.0%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £176.2 million. For this business the Directors 
performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU. For the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying value then the 
discount rate would need to be increased by 10.2% or the long-term growth rate would need to be reduced by 12.7%.

(i) Mainly represents a reduction in the useful economic life of print assets in the national media segment following the Group’s decision to 
relocate its Surrey Quays South London print facility to a new site in Thurrock, Essex, together with the closure of the Derby and Stoke printing 
facilities. The change in estimate of the useful economic life will also result in accelerated depreciation estimated to be £12.4 million in the 
period to 29th September, 2013.
(ii) Included within exceptional operating costs in the current year is an impairment charge of £6.5 million in relation to property, plant and 
equipment. This relates to press equipment in the national media segment. Included within exceptional operating costs in the prior year is 
an impairment charge of £7 .3 million. £1.9 million relates to computer equipment in the national media segment and £5.4 million relates  
to properties held by the head office segment following an annual review of the Group’s property portfolio.
In July 2012 the Group announced the conditional sale of a part leasehold part freehold interest in its 14.57 acre Harmsworth Quays  
printing works site at Canada Water in South East London to British Land. All conditions are expected to be met well in advance of the  
proposed completion date in late 2013 when British Land will take possession of the site following the relocation of DMGT’s printing operations 
from Harmsworth Quays to Thurrock. No asset has been recognised for the excess of proceeds over carrying value on sale of this asset as  
this represents a contingent asset. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 128

During the year a number of the Group’s freehold properties ceased to be owner occupied and became subject to letting activity. In accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy these properties have been transferred out of property, plant and equipment and into investment property 
at net book value.
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties as at 30th September, 2012 was £7 .6 million (201 1 £25.0 million). This was arrived at by reference 
to market evidence for similar properties and was carried out by an officer of the Group’s property department. Property rental income earned 
by the Group from its investment properties amounted to £0.8 million (201 1 £0.5 million). Direct operating expenses arising on the investment 
properties in the period amounted to £0.4 million (201 1 £0.1 million). The leases have an expiry date of between one and five years. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 129

The investments above represent listed equity securities and unlisted securities, which are recorded as non-current assets unless they are expected 
to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets. The investments in listed securities have no fixed maturity or coupon 
rate and the fair value of these investments is based on quoted market prices. Since there is no active market upon which they are traded, other 
unlisted equity securities are recorded at cost less provision for impairment, as their fair values cannot be reliably measured. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 135

Committed Borrowing Facilities
The Group’s bank loans bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a margin based on the Group’s ratio of net debt to EBITDA. Additionally each facility 
contains a covenant based on a minimum interest cover ratio. EBITDA for these purposes is defined as the aggregate of the Group’s consolidated 
operating profit before share of results of joint ventures and associates before deducting depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill, 
intangible and tangible assets, before exceptional items and before interest and finance charges. These covenants were met at the relevant 
test dates during the period.
During the period the Group cancelled certain of its committed borrowing facilities amounting to £90.0 million which were surplus to the 
Group’s requirements.

The Group’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of the premia, direct issue costs, discounts and movements 
in hedged risks. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the effective interest 
method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £3.5 million (201 1 £3.8 million, 2010 £4.5 million), the unamortised premia £9.2 million (201 1 £10.5 
million, 2010 £13.6 million).
The fair value of the Group’s bonds have been calculated on the basis of quoted market rates.
Further details of the Group’s borrowing arrangements are set out in the Financial and Treasury Report on page 42.
Loan notes
The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates of approximately LIBID to LIBID minus 1%. The loan notes are repayable at the 
option of the loan note holders with a six-month notice period and are treated as current liabilities.
33) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISk MANAGEMENT
The Group is exposed to credit, interest rate and currency risks arising in the normal course of business. Derivative financial instruments are used 
to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes. Full 
details of the Group’s treasury policies are set out in the Financial and Treasury Review on pages 42 and 43.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital, defined as equity shareholders’ funds and net borrowings, to ensure that entities in the Group are able to 
continue as going concerns for the foreseeable future.
Debt management
The Group borrows on an unsecured basis and arranges its debt to ensure an appropriate maturity profile. The Group’s principal sources of 
funding are the long-term sterling bond market and committed bank facilities. The Group is mindful of its credit rating, currently BB and ensures it 
has sufficient committed bank facilities in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account the Group’s holding of cash 
and cash equivalents together with any distribution restrictions which exist. The Group aims to maximise the term and flexibility of indebtedness 
and retain headroom in the form of undrawn committed bank facilities of approximately £100.0 million. Additionally, the Group arranges its 
currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The Directors consider that the Group’s bond issuances together with its bank facilities will be sufficient to cover the likely medium-term cash 
requirements of the Group. 
Associates, joint ventures and other investments in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding requirements. In all cases such 
financing is non-recourse to the Company.
The Group’s interim internal target of Net Debt to EBITDA cover is 2.0 to 2.5 times whilst the limit imposed by its bank covenants is no greater than 
3.75 times. On a bank covenant basis the ratio uses the average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt. The resultant Net Debt to EBITDA 
ratio is 1.65 times (201 1 1.96 times, 2010 2.33 times). Using a closing rate basis for the valuation of net debt, the ratio was 1.62 times.
Cash and liquidity risk management
The Group monitors cash balances and ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet entities operational requirements. Short-term money 
market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to credit risk. 
Market risk management
The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.  Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 142

Interest rate risk management
The limit imposed by the Group’s bank covenants is at least 3 times EBITDA to net interest. The actual ratio for the year was 6.54 times (201 1 6.36 
times, 2010 4.91 times). 
The Group’s interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to changes in interest 
rates. Group policy is to have 70% to 80% of interest exposures fixed with the balance floating. This is achieved by issuing fixed rate sterling bond 
debt and entering into derivative contracts that economically swap fixed rate interest into floating rate. Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce 
the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist. The derivatives in place to meet Group 
policy are as follows:
(i) Fixed to floating interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the Group’s bonds. Changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognised in the 
income statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for movements in the hedged risk to the extent 
effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the income statement. These interest rate swaps amount to £108.9 million (201 1 £75.0 
million, 2010 £75.0 million) with the Group paying floating rates of between 0.63% and 1.86% (201 1 1.24% and 1.61%, 2010 1.24% and 3.60%).
(ii) Fixed to floating interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedging instruments; Changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognised 
in the income statement. These interest rate swaps amount to US$67 .0 million (201 1 US$nil, 2010 US$nil) with the Group receiving floating US dollar 
interest at rates of between 0.38% and 0.47%.
(iii) Cross currency fixed to fixed interest rate swaps. These amount to £158.4 million/US$288.0 million (201 1 £192.3 million/US$355.0 million, 2010 
£227 .6 million/US$ 435.0 million) resulting in the Group paying fixed US dollar interest at rates of between 4.40% and 6.07% (201 1 4.40% and 
6.07 %, 2010 4.40% and 6.07%), £nil/AUS$nil (201 1 £8.5 million/AUS$20.0 million, 2010 £8.5 million/AUS$20.0 million) with the Group paying fixed 
Australian dollar interest at nil% (201 1 6.22%, 2010 6.15% and 6.22%).
(iv) The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps. These amounted to US$100.0 million notional (201 1 US$100.0 million, 2010 
US$100.0 million) at a rate of 6.00% (201 1 6.00%, 2010 6.00%).
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement costs calculated 
using market rates of interest and exchange at 30th September, 2012. The fair value of long-term borrowings has been calculated by discounting 
expected future cash flows at market rates.
Foreign exchange rate risk management
Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in entities with functional currencies other than that of the parent 
company. The net asset exposures are economically hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where 
significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
The Group also designates currency swaps and forward contracts as net investment hedges, hedging the Group’s overseas investments.
Credit risk management
The Group’s principal credit risk relates to its trade and other receivables and non-performance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s customer base is diversified geographically and by division with customers generally of a good financial standing. Before accepting 
any new customers, the Group assesses the potential customers’ credit quality and sets credit limits by customer. The average credit period is 
43 days (201 1 42 days, 2010 44 days). The Group considers the credit risk of trade receivables to be low, although the Group remains vigilant in the 
current economic climate. The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although the Group does not hold collateral 
over any trade receivable balances. The Group makes an allowance for bad and doubtful debts specific to individual debts. This provision is 
reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historic payment profiles and past default experience.
The Group’s receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful debts and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Institutional counterparty risk
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks, described above, by the use of financial instruments. As a result, credit risk arises 
from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to those financial instruments, which are unsecured. The amount of this credit risk is 
normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged. The Group also has a credit exposure to 
counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents. Group policy is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at 
risk) with any ‘AA’ counterparty, £10.0 million for ‘A’ rated counterparties. 
Credit risk is controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks 
with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them. The Group has no significant concentration of risk with 
exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered low since the counterparties are banks with high credit 
ratings. Group policy is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at risk) with any “AA” counterparty, £10.0 million for “A” rated counterparties. 
The Group has no significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 143

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at the date the derivatives are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
fair value at each reporting date. The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as 
discounted cash flow and option valuation models. The Group designates certain derivatives as:
(i) Hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value hedges’); or
(ii)  Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (‘cash flow hedges’); or
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations (‘net investment hedges’)
To qualify for hedge accounting, each individual hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be designated and documented at 
its inception and throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedges
The Group’s policy is to use interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk 
with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value 
of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.

Cash flow hedges
The Group’s policy is to use certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from certain firm commitments 
or forecast highly probable transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Group entity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
If a hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the asset 
or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the 
initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is 
included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 30th September, 2012. All amounts deferred in equity at the year end are 
expected to impact the Consolidated Income Statement in the next 18 months when the related cash flows are expected to occur.
Net investment hedges
The Group seeks to manage the foreign currency exposure arising on retranslation of the reporting entity’s share of net assets of foreign operations 
at each reporting date by designating certain derivative financial instruments and foreign currency borrowings as net investment hedging instruments.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity in the translation 
reserve. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognised in equity to the extent that the hedging 
relationship is effective. Any ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the 
foreign operation.
All net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 30th September, 2012. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 144

Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting 
Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting represent forward contracts which provide a gain or loss equivalent to income tax payable or 
receivable on foreign exchange gains or losses incurred when intra group balances are translated to the closing rate at the year end. These 
contracts (‘Tax Equalisation Swaps’) are marked to market with the movement in fair value taken to income. Tax Equalisation Swaps are not 
capable of being designated as hedging instruments under IAS 39.

In managing the Group’s interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations. However, changes in 
foreign exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on the Group’s results. 
At 30th September, 2012, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in interest rates would have increased the Group’s finance costs by £1.2 million 
(201 1 £1.1 million, 2010 £1.0 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. This sensitivity has been calculated 
by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate swaps, at the year end date.
At 30th September, 2012, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in interest rates would have decreased the Group’s finance costs by £1.1 million 
(201 1 £1.3 million, 2010 £1.0 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. This sensitivity has been calculated 
by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate swaps, as at the year end date.
At 30th September, 2012, it is estimated that a 10.0% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have reduced the net loss taken to equity 
by £49.1 million (201 1 £55.6 million, 2010 £51.1 million) and increased the net loss taken to income by £nil (201 1 £nil, 2010 £nil). A 10.0% weakening 
of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net loss taken to equity by £53.6 million (201 1 £64.0 million, 2010 £62.4 million) and 
decreased the net loss taken to income by £nil (201 1 £nil, 2010 £nil). This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the foreign exchange 
change to the Group’s financial instruments which are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
At 30th September, 2012, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would lead 
to a decrease in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of £nil (201 1 £0.2 million, 2010 £nil).
At 30th September, 2012, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would lead

valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value 
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable ;
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted process (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ;
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices) ; and
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

34) RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates a number of pension schemes under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees. The total net pension 
costs of the Group for the year ended 30th September 2012 were £1 1.7 million (201 1 £16.5 million, 2010 £27 .7 million).
The schemes include funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, in addition to a number of defined 
contribution pension arrangements. The defined benefit schemes in the UK, together with some defined contribution plans, are administered 
by trustees or trustee companies. 
In compliance with recent legislation the Group is making arrangements for relevant employees to be automatically enrolled into the defined 
contribution pension plans.  The first staging date for the Group for automatic enrolment is expected to be July 2013.
For reporting years beginning on or after 1st January, 2013, a revision to the International Accounting Standard 19 – Employee Benefits (IAS19 R) 
will become effective. IAS19 R will first apply to the Group for the year ending 28th September, 2014. Had IAS19 R been applied at the year ended 
30th September, 2012, Finance Costs reported in the Consolidated Income Statement would have increased by £23.5 million (201 1 £25.1 million, 
2010 £22.5 million) with a corresponding decrease in the actuarial loss reported within Cumulative actuarial (loss)/gain in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income (SOCI).
Defined Benefit Schemes
(a) Background
The Company operates two main defined benefit schemes, the Harmsworth Pension Scheme (HPS) and the Senior Executive Pension Scheme 
(SEPF), both of which are now closed to new entrants. Existing members still in employment can continue to accrue benefits in the scheme on  
a cash basis, with members using this cash account to purchase an annuity at retirement. 
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the Scheme Actuary. The latest valuations of the main 
schemes were completed as at 31st March, 2010. As a result of these valuations, the Company agreed to make annual contributions of 10.0% or 
15.0% of members’ basic pay (depending on membership section) for HPS and 27 .0% of pensionable pay for SEPF. In addition, the Company 
has agreed Recovery Plans involving a series of annual funding payments amounting to £265.9 million over a period to end on 5th October, 
2023. In accordance with these agreements, a payment of £36.7 million was made on 5th October, 201 1 and a payment of £24.0 million was 
made on 28th September, 2012. A further payment of £1 1.6 million was made post year end on 5th October, 2012. The Company considers that 
these contribution rates are sufficient to eliminate the deficit over the agreed period. Both the ongoing contributions and Recovery Plan will be 
reviewed at the next triennial funding valuation of the main schemes due to be completed with an effective date 31st March, 2013. 
The Company also has a defined benefit obligation relating to the DMGT AVC Plan (the Plan) which is closed to further member contributions.  
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Plan, carried out with an effective date of 31st March, 201 1, showed a funding deficit of £5.6 
million. The trustees and the Company have agreed that this funding shortfall will be removed through the expected investment returns, with 
no further contributions required from the Company.
(b) Limited Partnership investment vehicle
The Company has enabled the trustee of the HPS to acquire a beneficial interest in a Limited Partnership investment vehicle (LP). The LP has been 
designed to facilitate payment of part of the deficit funding payments described above to the scheme over the next 15 years. In addition, the LP 
is required to make a final payment to the scheme of £150.0 million or the funding deficit within the scheme on an ongoing actuarial valuation 
basis at the end of the 15-year period if this is less. For funding purposes, the interest held by the trustee in the LP will be treated as an asset of the 
scheme and reduce the actuarial deficit within the scheme. However, under IAS19 the LP is not included as an asset of the scheme and therefore 
is not included in the disclosures below. In exchange for its interest in the LP , the trustee has allowed the standby letters of credit previously 
provided by the Company to be cancelled.  
The figures in this note are based on calculations using membership data as at 30th September 2012 along with asset valuations and cash flow 
information from the schemes for the year to 30th September, 2012. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 153

Deficit reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (324.4) (336.2) (271.4)
The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a company can 
recognise a pension surplus on its Statement of Financial Position. Having taken account of the rules of the schemes, the fact that the schemes 
remain open to new accrual, and the current and anticipated levels of service cost and cash contributions, the Company considers that 
recognition of surpluses in the schemes on its Statement of Financial Position is in accordance with the interpretations of IFRIC 14. In 2012, 201 1 
and 2010 all schemes were in deficit. 
The deficit for the year, set out above, excludes a related deferred tax asset of £74.6 million (201 1 £83.6 million, 2010 £73.3 million).

Long-term rate of return expected at 3rd October, 2010 (%) 7.90  4.40  7.00  4.40  6.60 
Equities include hedge funds and infrastructure funds that have the same long-term expected rate of return. 
The value of employer-related assets held on behalf of the schemes at 30th September, 2012 was £18.2 million (1.03% of assets), (201 1 £0.1 million 
– 0.00% of assets, 2010 £0.1 million – 0.00% of assets). 
The assumption for the expected overall rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class based on 
the proportion of assets held in each class at the beginning of the year. The expected return on bonds has been selected having regard to 
gross redemption yields at the start of the year. The expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of estimated risk 
premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields on bonds, and consensus economic forecasts for future returns. 
The actual return on plan assets was £182.2 million (201 1 £29.7 million, 2010 £188.6 million) representing the expected return plus the associated 
actuarial gain or loss during the year.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following table:

The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the period end date on high quality corporate bonds. All assumptions were selected 
after taking actuarial advice.  
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on ‘long cohort’ 
projections but with a minimum rate of improvement in future mortality rates of 1.5% per annum. Allowance is made for the extent to which 
employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement.  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 155

UK defined contribution plans
The Group has introduced a number of PensionSaver group personal pension plans that have replaced the trust-based defined contribution 
pension plans previously offered to employees. These plans create a consistent pensions savings vehicle across all Group divisions. 
The aggregate value of the group personal pension plans and the remaining trust-based defined contribution pension plans was £50.3 million 
(201 1 £39.8 million, 2010 £39.1 million) at the year end. The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounted to £1.9 million (201 1 
£3.4 million, 2010 £2.6 million).
Overseas pension plans
Overseas subsidiaries of certain Group divisions operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in North America and Australia. 
The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to £1.4 million (201 1 £2.7 million, 2010 £2.2 million).
Pension arrangements for executives
The Group operates a contributory defined benefit scheme for senior executives (including some executive Directors), details of which are 
included in the above disclosures. However, no executive Directors accrued further pension during the year. 
Stakeholder pension
DMGT provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for the other pension schemes operated by 
the Group. These arrangements will be superseded when automatic enrolment begins in 2013. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 157

The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated on an acquisition by 
acquisition basis using available data forecasts. The range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent consideration is £4.1 million to £59.1 million. 
Certain contingent consideration arrangements are not capped since they are based on future business performance.  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 159

analysed as follows:

North America 75.0 62.4 55.1
Australia 5.4 6.8 3.7 
120.0 125.4 115.6
These losses have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient suitable 
taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered probable that these assets will 
be recovered. Of these assets none have an expiry date.
Included in the credit to income of £15.1 million (201 1 £27 .2 million, 2010 £31.2 million) is a charge of £9.3 million (201 1 credit £1.2 million, 2010 credit 
£0.5 million) relating to discontinued operations.
Included in Other deferred tax are deferred tax assets of £1.7 million (201 1 £3.2 million, 2010 £3.4 million) in respect of capital losses and deferred tax 
liabilities of £1.7 million (2010 £3.2 million, 2010 £6.6 million) in respect of revaluations and rolled over gains and £0.4 million (201 1 asset £5.3 million, 
2010 asset £3.6 million) in respect of financial instruments. The £1.9 million charge to equity (201 1 credit of £1.7 million, 2010 £nil) relates entirely to 
financial instruments. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 160
36) DEFERRED TAXATION – CONTINUED
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £79.1 million (201 1 £72.9 million, 2010 £89.2 million) which relates to revenue losses where there is 
insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future. Of these assets none have an expiry date. There is an additional 
unprovided deferred tax asset relating to capital losses carried forward of £62.4 million (201 1 £63.1 million, 2010 £42.2 million). 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £1 17 .2 million (201 1 £79.8 million, 2010 £68.2 million) relating to the unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 30th September, 2012 represent only the unremitted earnings of 
those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of a dividend 
withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.

The two classes of shares are equal in all respects, except that the ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares do not have voting rights and hence their 
holders are not entitled to vote at general meetings of the Company. 
During the year the Company disposed of 7 ,018,953 ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares, in order to satisfy incentive schemes. This represented 1.88% 
of the called up ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting share capital at 30th September, 2012. 
The Company also purchased 7 ,478,953 ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares having a nominal value of £934,869 to match obligations under 
incentive plans. The consideration paid for these shares was £30.1 million. Shares repurchased during the period represented 2.0% of the called 
up ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting share capital at 30th September, 2012. 
At 30th September, 2012 options were outstanding under the terms of the Company’s 1997 and 2006 Executive Share Option Schemes, 
together with nil cost options, over a total of 4,929,968 (201 1 5,399,633, 2010 5,557 ,567) ‘A’ Ordinary Non-Voting shares.  Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 161

The revaluation reserve arose on the revaluation of the group’s available-for-sale investments. It includes £nil  (201 1 £3.3 million, 2010 £3.7 million) 
in relation to historic property valuations originally recorded under UK GAAP . These properties are no longer held at fair value but the historic 
revaluation amount will remain in the revaluation reserve until the properties are sold.

The Group’s most significant leasing arrangements relate to rented properties. The Group negotiates lease contracts according to the Group’s 
needs with a view to balancing stability and security of tenure and lease terms with the risk of entering into excessively long or onerous 
arrangements. Of the Group’s rented properties, the most significant commitment relates to the head office premises at 2 Derry Street, London 
W8 5TT. This lease expires on 25th December, 2022.
Commitments in relation to properties as at 30th September, 2012 have been restated to exclude future payments under non-cancellable

The Group entered into arrangements with its ink suppliers to obtain ink for the period to September 2018 at competitive prices and to secure 
supply. At the year end, the commitment to purchase ink over this period was £76.8 million (201 1 £91.2 million, 2010 £109.6 million).
The Group has entered into agreements with certain printers for periods up to 2022 at competitive prices and to secure supply. At the year end, 
the commitment to purchase printing capacity over this period was £68.6 million (201 1 £100.5 million, 2010 £130.8 million).
Contingent liabilities
As set out in note 34 the Group has issued standby letters of credit in favour of the Trustees of the Group’s defined benefit pension fund 
amounting to £nil (201 1 £53.6 million, 2010 £54.5 million) together with other guarantees of £2.4 million (201 1 £9.3 million, 2010 £8.1 million).
The Group is exposed to libel claims in the ordinary course of business and vigorously defends against claims received. The Group makes 
provision for the estimated costs to defend such claims when incurred and provides for any settlement costs when such an outcome is judged 
probable.
Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against the company and three of its employees in respect of an article published 
in one of the company’s magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995. The writs were served on Euromoney Institutional 
Investor PLC (Euromoney) on 22nd October, 1996. Two of these writs have been discontinued. The total outstanding amount claimed on the 
two remaining writs is Malaysian Ringgits 82.3 million (£16.6 million) (201 1 Malaysian Ringgits 82.0 million (£16.5 million)). No provision has been 
made for these claims in these financial statements as the Directors do not believe Euromoney has any material liability in respect of these writs.  Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 164
41) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group offers a number of share-based remuneration schemes to Directors and certain employees. The principal schemes comprise share 
options under the DMGT, Euromoney and within DMG Information, Risk Management Solutions (RMS), Genscape and Trepp Executive Share 
Option Schemes (ESOS), the Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan and the Company’s LTIP . Share options are exercisable after three years, 
subject in some cases to the satisfaction of performance conditions, and up to 10 years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the 
market value of the respective shares at the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of 
grant. Details of the performance conditions relating to the DMGT schemes are explained in the Remuneration Report on pages 71 and 76.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, IFRS 2 applies to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments made after  
7th November, 2002 that had not vested by 1st January, 2005.

The fair value of share options for each of these schemes was determined using a Black-Scholes model. Full details of inputs to the models, 
particular to each scheme, are set out below. With respect to all schemes, the share price volatility has been estimated, based upon relevant 
historic data in respect of the DMGT ‘A’ Ordinary share prices.
Expected volatility has been estimated, based upon relevant historic data in respect of the DMGT ‘A’ Ordinary share price. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability.
The Group did not re-price any of its outstanding options during the year.

RMS options were granted at market value. The options become exercisable after a four-year vesting period and lapse 10 years and  five years 
from grant date under the 2001 and 2005 option plan respectively. Previously, the stock issued under the plan was subject to a nine-month 
holding period, which has been subsequently removed during 2007 . The stock issued under the plan is subject to put or call options where DMGT 
has the right to settle in DMGT ‘A’ Ordinary Shares or cash. The options plan classification changed from a cash-settled plan in June 2005 to an 
equity-settled plan following this change of settlement feature of stock issued under the plan. After 30th September, 201 1 options under the 
2001 and 2005 plan will no longer be awarded.
During fiscal year 201 1 RMS introduced the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Under the EIP options and 
Restricted Stock Units (RSU) were awarded to Senior Management. Under the LTIP RSUs were awarded to key employees. The options and RSUs 
were granted at market value under both plans. The options vest based on the conditions of time and company performance at three and 
five years from date of grant. The options lapse after seven years from grant date. The RSUs under both plans vest annually over three years.
RSU expense is determined by the fair market value of RMS stock at the date of grant. The expense is amortised using an accelerated method. 
Under this method the RSUs are equally allocated to each of the three annual vesting components and the related expense is amortised over 
12, 24, and 36 months respectively.

Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2010 (CAP 2010)
The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 21st January, 2010. Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal 
elements – an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share, and a right 
to receive a cash payment. The awards will vest in two equal tranches. The first tranche of awards will become exercisable on satisfaction of the 
primary performance condition, but no earlier than February 2013 and lapse to the extent unexercised by 30th September, 2020. The second 
tranche of awards becomes exercisable in the February following a subsequent financial year in which adjusted pre-tax profits of the Euromoney 
Group again equal or exceed £100.0 million (increased to £105.0 million following the acquisition of NDR), but no earlier than February, 2014. 
The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary performance condition and an additional performance condition. The number of 
options received under the share award of the CAP 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 Company 
Share Option Plan (see below). The primary performance condition was achieved in the 201 1 financial year, two years earlier than expected, 
when adjusted pre-tax profits were £101.3 million. However, the internal rules of the plan prevent the awards vesting more than one year early so 
although the primary condition has been achieved the award pool will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference 
to their contribution to the growth in profits of the Group from the 2009 base year to the profits achieved in the 2012 financial year and these 
awards are expected to become exercisable in February, 2013.
The CAP 2010 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present value of expected 
future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise. The expected term of the option used in the models has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Company Share Option Plan (CSOP 2010)
In parallel with the CAP 2010, the shareholders approved the CSOP 2010 UK and Canada at the  AGM on 21st January, 2010. The CSOP 2010 UK 
was approved by HM Revenue and Customs on 21st June, 2010 and granted on 28th June, 2010. The CSOP 2010 UK option enables each 
participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the company at a price of £6.03 per share, the market value at the date of grant. The options will 
vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 2010 providing the CSOP option is in the 
money at that time and does not vest before 28th June, 2013. The CSOP 2010 Canada, granted on 30th March, 2010, enables each participant 
to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the company at a price of £5.01 per share, the market value at the date of grant. No option may vest after 
the date falling three months after the preliminary announcement of the results for the financial year ended 30th September, 2019 and the 
option shall lapse to the extent unvested at the time. The CSOP has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 2010 as set out above. 
The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010, the CSOP effectively a 
delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award. The CSOP 2010 option exercise price of £6.03 (UK) and £5.01 (Canada) will be satisfied by 
a funding award mechanism and results in the same net gain on the CSOP options (calculated as the market price of the company’s shares at 
the date of exercise less the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised) delivered in the equivalent number of shares to 
participants as if the award had been delivered using £0.0025 CAP options.

The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010, the CSOP effectively a 
delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award. The CSOP 2010 options have an exercise price of £6.03 (1), which will be satisfied by a 
funding award mechanism which results in the same net gain (2) on these options delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants 
as if the same award had been delivered using £0.0025 CAP options. The amount of the funding award will depend on the company’s share 
price at the date of exercise. Because of the above and the other direct links between the CSOP 2010 and the CAP 2010, including the 
identical performance criteria, IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ combines the two plans and treats them as one plan (vesting in two tranches). 
As such the long-term incentive expense recognised in the year for the CSOP 2010 and CAP 2010 options (including the charge in relation to 
the cash element) was £8.1 million (201 1 £15.9 million). 
 
1. Exercise price of Canadian CSOP is £5.01. 
2. Net gain on the CSOP options is the market price of the company’s shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price (£6.031) multiplied by 
the number of options exercised.  
* Exercise price excludes the effect of the funding award. 
Cash-settled options
Euromoney has liabilities in respect of three share option schemes that are classified by IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ as cash-settled. These 
consist of the cash element of the CAP 2010 scheme, options held by employees over new equity shares in Internet Securities Inc., a subsidiary 
of the Group, and, from 201 1, options held by employees over equity shares in Structured Retail Products Limited (previously Arete Consulting 
Limited), a subsidiary of the Group. The total carrying value at 30th September, 2012 included in the Statement of Financial Position is a liability of 
£14.6 million (201 1 £10.3 million). Of these schemes, options with an intrinsic value of £3,000 (201 1 £7 ,000) had vested but are not yet exercised.
The Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2004 (CAP 2004)
The CAP 2004 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 1st February, 2005. Each of the CAP awards comprises an 
option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share. The awards become 
exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on 30th September, 2014. The initial 
performance condition was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool (a maximum of 7 .5 million shares) was allocated between 
the holders of outstanding awards. One third of the awards vested immediately. The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 
and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009. The 
primary performance target was also achieved in 2009 and 1,527 ,152 options (including a true-up adjustment of 5,654) for the third (final) 
tranche of options in 2009 vested in February 2010. The additional performance condition was applied again to profits for the 2010 financial 
year for those individual participants where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranches had not been met 
303,321 and 244,152 options vested in February, 201 1 and February, 2012 respectively. For individual participants’ businesses where the 
additional performance conditions for the second and final tranche have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at least 75% 
of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending 30th September, 2012.  The Directors estimate 54,599 of options will 
vest in February 2013 following satisfaction of the additional performance test.  Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 172

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc for the year ended 30th September, 2012 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet, and the related Notes 1 to 16. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent Company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 30th September, 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or
•  the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1) BASIS OF PREPARATION
The separate financial statements of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation to 
fair value of certain financial instruments as described below, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). The following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies under UK GAAP , which have been applied 
consistently in both the current and prior year.
Profit for the financial year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been included in these 
accounts. The Company’s profit after tax for the year, calculated on a UK GAAP basis, was £236.3 million (201 1 loss £108.8 million).
Impact of amendments to accounting standards 
In the current year certain minor amendments to UK financial reporting standards were issued by the UK Accounting Standards Board. The 
adoption of these amendments has not had any impact on the Company’s accounting policies.
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible assets principally comprise purchased trademarks and are capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over the 
lower of their useful economic lives and a period of 20 years.
The Company tests intangible assets at the end of the first financial year after acquisition and where there is any indication of impairment, or 
more frequently if there are indicators that the intangible assets might be impaired. When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for 
all the Company’s income generating units (IGUs) are measured at their value in use by discounting future expected cash flows. These 
calculations use cash flow projections based on management approved budgets and projections which reflect management’s current 
experience and future expectations of the markets in which the IGU operates.  
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a 
straight line basis over its expected useful life. Some of the Company’s tangible fixed assets are artworks with a residual value at least equal to 
cost and therefore no depreciation has been applied in either the current or prior period on the basis that any change would not be material.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s reporting currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate 
prevailing on the date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in the income statement for the period. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment, where appropriate.  
Other investments are classified as either held for trading or available-for-sale and are measured at either fair value or at cost less provision for 
impairment where fair value cannot be reliably determined.
Where investments are classified as held for trading, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the 
period. For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the 
investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included 
in the net profit or loss for the period. Impairment charges are recorded in the profit and loss account when they occur.
Investments and financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the time frame established by the market concerned, and are measured at fair 
value, including transaction costs.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that 
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when 
they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.  Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation 
computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.  Deferred tax is not provided on timing 
differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries 
and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is not discounted. Annual Report 2012 Strategic Report 181

Financial instruments disclosures
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Trade debtors
Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Trade creditors 
Trade creditors are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.  
Capital market and bank borrowings 
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to net proceeds at inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. A portion of the Company’s bonds are subject to fair value hedge accounting 
and this portion of the carrying value is adjusted for the movement in the hedged risk to the extent hedge effectiveness is achieved. Any difference 
between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the  borrowing.
Equity instruments  
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to settle on 
a net basis, or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses various 
derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these risks. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s closed line integral policies, which are set out on pages 42 and 43  of the Financial 
and Treasury Review and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with 
the Company’s risk management strategy. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Company does not apply hedge accounting except for fair value hedges. Gains and losses arising on derivatives that form part of net investment 
hedge or cash flow hedge relationships in the consolidated financial statements are recorded in the profit and loss account in the Company.
Financial instruments – disclosures
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided in FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures which states that disclosure in respect 
of financial instruments is not required in parent company financial statements where such disclosures are included in publicly available 
consolidated financial statements.
Cash flow statement
The Company has utilised the exemptions provided under FRS 1 (Revised) and has not presented a cash flow statement. A consolidated cash 
flow statement has been presented in the Group’s Annual Report.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions of FRS 8 which states that disclosure of related party transactions is not required in the 
parent company financial statements when those statements are presented together with its consolidated financial statements. 
Share-based payments
The Company operates the Group’s LTIP and other Group share based payment schemes, details of which can be found in note 41 of the 
Group’s Annual Report.
Retirement benefits 
The Company contributes to defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes on behalf of its employees. These are managed on a 
Group basis and so the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the defined benefit scheme in which it 
participates on a consistent and reasonable basis. The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to 
individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers; the contribution rate 
charged to each employer being affected by the experience of the scheme as a whole.  The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined 
contribution scheme by the Company.  This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash 
contributions due in the period. 
Details of the financial position and key valuation assumptions of these schemes can be found in note 34 of the Group’s Annual Report. Daily Mail and General Trust Plc 182

The Company’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to offset the premia paid on settlement or redemption, direct issue costs 
and discounts. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the effective interest 
method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £3.5 million (201 1 £3.8 million), the unamortised premia £9.2 million (201 1 £10.5 million).
Details of the fair value of the Company’s bonds are set out in note 32 of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts. 
The bonds are subject to fair value hedging using derivatives as set out in note 33 of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts. Consequently, 
their carrying value is also adjusted to take into account the affects of this hedging activity.
The book value of the Company’s other borrowings equates to fair value.

1. The financial highlights relate to the Adjusted Income Statement covering the years 
ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 assuming a debt free acquisition of 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by Moneysupermarket.com Group 
PLC on 1 January 2006, from which date intangible amortisation commenced, and a 
share option charge which reflects the average charge over the vesting period of 
currently unexercised options. Further information on the Adjusted Income Statement 
is set out in the Financial and Business Review on page 22.
2. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by the Directors by making certain adjustments to the 
historical compensation levels of the Directors and senior managers, and share 
based bonus awards to employees on the listing of Moneysupermarket.com Group 
PLC. These adjustments reflect the Directors’ and senior managers’ profit share, 
discretionary bonus and related employer’s national insurance contributions. They 
also include charges relating to the issue of free shares to each eligible employee to 
the value of £3,000, charges relating to the conditional share award made to Gerald 
Corbett on listing and charges related to share based compensation relating to 
options issued prior to listing. Following listing, these elements of compensation no 
longer apply at these levels. Charges relating to the impairment of goodwill in 2008 
have also been added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA. For further information,

Travel and Home Services verticals continue to grow 
3.  As noted in the prospectus issued in connection with the listing of 
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC on 31 July 2007, the Group’s visitor numbers 
during the period between January and May 2007 were understated due to certain 
visitors not being assigned a unique global user ID. The issue was resolved in May 
2007 and has not impacted visitor numbers in the Insurance vertical after May 2007. 
The Group has not been able to quantify the exact extent of the understatement.
 The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors from 27 April 2008 
to the end of June 2008 following a release made in respect of the anti-virus 
software AVG. In assessing whether a webpage was safe it ‘followed’ every link or 
url displayed on an email or webpage to the destination website. This meant that 
many web based businesses including the Group recorded visitors from users of the 
AVG software who themselves did not technically visit the website. The 2008 visitor 
count has been adjusted for the estimated impact of this. AVG released a further 
update to its anti-virus software in early July 2008.

Our Model
For Customers
The Group attracts customers to its website in a number  
of ways including television and radio advertising, editorial 
comment in the press and on television programmes, and 
from search engines, such as Google, where the Group 
purchases sponsored listings for relevant keywords and 
focuses on enhancing the ranking of the Group’s website  
in the natural results listings.
The Group provides customers with a free online service 
enabling them to compare a wide range of products in the 
insurance, money, travel and home services markets and  
to find the product most suited to their needs. The Group’s 
website enables customers to compare products by price, 
product features and service. 
In addition to these comparison services, the Group helps 
and supports customers to research the product they wish 
to purchase. This includes news articles, guides, video 
blogs, web chats, and the ability to ask the views either 
directly of our employees or other customers in our forums. 
The Group also sends weekly Rate Alert and Fare Alert 
emails to customers, enabling them to keep up to date  
with the latest deals, offers and best buys on a wide  
range of products.
The Group invests significantly in innovation and product 
development to ensure that the customer experience is 
continually enhanced. Customers benefit from enhanced 
website functionality, improvements in existing products  
and the addition of new products and features.  05 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
For Product Providers
Our price comparison 
services offer a 
compelling proposition 
to both customers 
and product providers
The Group provides product providers access to 
significant volumes of informed customers who, having 
compared the market, are ready to make a purchase.  
This improves the focus and efficiency of their marketing 
spend and means the Group provides product providers 
with a cost effective distribution channel.
The significant investment by the Group in innovation  
and product development benefits product providers by 
delivering to them customers who are more likely to 
purchase their products.
The Group is remunerated by product providers either  
on a cost per click model, when a customer clicks 
through from the Group’s website to a product provider’s 
website, or on a cost per action model, when a customer 
completes an application for a product or purchases a 
product from the product provider, or a combination of 
the two models. 06 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Customer case study
Pam Cowen-Wright lives near  
Mold in North Wales and runs  
her own recruitment business.  
She recently saved £105 on the 
insurance for her Land Rover 
Discovery by using 
moneysupermarket.com.
Pam, 36, said: “I use 
moneysupermarket.com for  
everything as it’s so easy  
to use but most recently I used  
it for my car insurance. We always 
shop around when our insurance 
policies are up for renewal and this 
time I managed to save £105 by 
using moneysupermarket.com. 
You can save so much money with 
comparison sites and in today’s 
climate I think it’s more important 
than ever to be prudent and see 
where you can save money.” 
£105 
saved on car insurance
The Insurance vertical 
offers customers the 
opportunity to search for, 
and compare, insurance 
products in 15 channels 
including:
Car insurance •	
Buildings and contents insurance •	
Travel insurance •	
Life insurance •	
The Group continued to focus during the year on product 
development to ensure the customer experience was 
enhanced. This included:
Policy Wizard •	 – the Group launched a tool in the 
motor insurance channel, enabling customers to make 
changes to their policy details, for example, the level of 
policy excess, and compare the impact of this on the 
premium of multiple providers in real time. This 
significantly improves the usability of the motor 
insurance channel for customers.
New question set •	 – the Group revised the  
questions it asks customers during the year in its  
motor insurance and home insurance channels.  
This enables quote results to be more tailored to 
customers’ personal circumstances.
Home insurance instant email •	 – the Group 
launched a new facility in the home insurance channel 
to email customers a results table which is valid for  
30 days. This enables customers to return to the 
results table in a single click rather than having to 
complete a new quote, improving the usability of  
this channel for customers.
Comparison facility •	 – the Group launched a new 
comparison facility in the motor insurance and home 
insurance channels. This enables customers to 
compare the policy details of up to five products  
side by side, helping customers to compare  
different product features and to find the product  
most suited to their needs.  07 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Money
Customer case study
Jim and Dorothy Ogden rely on  
their savings to supplement their 
retirement income. It is therefore 
important that they earn as high a 
return as possible on their money,  
so they use moneysupermarket.com 
to keep an eye on savings rates.
Jim, a 79-year old retired civil 
engineer, said: “I’ve got a final salary 
pension but it hasn’t kept up with rises 
in the cost of living so we have to rely 
on our savings as well. The interest  
we earn on our savings used to be 
enough to supplement our pension, 
but it’s gone down so much recently 
that it’s getting harder and harder  
to get by without having to dip into  
our capital. 
We therefore need to keep an eye  
on savings rates to make sure we’re 
getting the best rate possible. 
moneysupermarket.com makes this 
easy as we can view all the leading 
rates and see how they compare with 
our existing accounts. If any of our 
accounts have lost their competitive 
edge we move our money to a  
better deal.”
The Money vertical offers 
customers the opportunity 
to search for, and compare, 
financial products in 14 
channels including:
Mortgages •	
Loans •	
Credit cards •	
Savings •	
Current accounts •	
Throughout 2008, the Group implemented a number  
of product developments to enhance the customer 
experience within the Money vertical. These included:
Customer reviews •	 – the Group introduced customer 
reviews allowing customers to view feedback from 
other customers on different products as part of  
the redevelopment of the credit cards, loans and 
savings channels.
New features •	 – the Group focused on improving the 
usability of the key Money channels. This included the 
introduction of features that allow customers to tailor 
their searches to suit their individual needs.
Decision support •	 – the Group identified different 
customer needs through customer research. This 
resulted in the development of a new support area 
within certain key Money channels which provides 
money saving advice, help and support and the  
option to receive a weekly rate alert email.
Customer journey •	 – the Group improved the 
customer journey within the Money channels in  
2008 including reductions in the number of steps 
customers are required to take in order to compare 
products, thereby enabling the customer to save  
more time. 09 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Travel
Customer case study
Al Prior, 47, is a consultant for an 
engineering software company. He 
travels to Europe on business regularly 
and uses travelsupermarket.com to 
find flight and hotel deals. 
Al said: “I use travelsupermarket.com 
a lot for business travel as I fly to 
Europe once every month or so. 
Because I have to be there at specific 
times for meetings, it’s not only price 
that I’m comparing. I also need to 
know that I can get there at the right 
time and travelsupermarket.com is 
great because I can see everything – 
flight times and cost – in one go, rather 
than having to go to all the websites of 
airlines individually. 
As well as flight searches, I also use 
the hotels channel regularly. I tend to 
stay in the same type of hotel, so if I’m 
going to a new place, I look for certain 
chains to see if they have a hotel that 
is conveniently located.”
The Travel vertical offers 
customers the opportunity 
to search for, and compare, 
travel products in 9 
channels including:
Flights •	
Package holidays •	
Car hire •	
Hotels •	
During 2008, the Group continued to focus on innovation, 
resulting in a number of enhancements over the course  
of the year, each aimed at improving the customer 
experience. These included:
Website redesign •	 – the Group commenced  
a major project to refresh the look and feel of 
travelsupermarket.com to make it more inspirational 
and to really excite customers about the prospect of 
travelling and holidaying. This was initially released to 
customers as an alternative or ‘beta’ version and will 
be fully live during 2009.
Trip Advisor •	 – the Group worked closely with  
Expedia to integrate their customer reviews and  
ratings into the hotels channel, enabling customers  
to check the suitability of their hotel choice before 
booking it.
Virtual Earth •	 – the Group worked closely with 
Microsoft to bring maps and geo coding to the hotels 
channel. This allows customers to view their hotel 
choice on an interactive map in conjunction with other 
useful information such as the location of museums, 
attractions and public transport.
Brochure details •	 – the Group integrated brochure 
information into the holidays channel allowing 
customers the opportunity to see a range of details 
about the holiday they are considering including 
photos, amenities and tour operator reviews. 11 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Customer case study
Hayley Mendis is a waitress in a busy 
Trafford Centre restaurant. The 26 year 
old lives in a nearby Manchester suburb 
with her partner and baby daughter, 
Tamsin, and likes to return to a warm 
house after her shift.
Hayley said: “Three months after I 
moved into my house, I got a big 
electricity bill in the mail and an even 
bigger gas bill. I was so shocked at the 
size of them that I took my bills to the 
library and searched on 
moneysupermarket.com for the best  
gas and electricity prices.
I signed up with npower which was the 
best value of all for my circumstances. 
Instead of paying £120 per quarter for 
electricity plus £140 per quarter for gas, 
I’m now paying a total of £60 per month 
on direct debit which will save me £320 
this year.
And if prices start falling, I’ll go to the 
library again and apply on 
moneysupermarket.com for a new 
cheaper deal.”

offers customers the  
opportunity to search for,  
and compare, home services 
products in the following  
4 channels:
Utilities •	
Mobile phones •	
Shopping •	
Broadband •	
During the course of the year, the Group implemented a 
number of product developments to the Home Services 
vertical aimed at enabling customers to find the product 
most suited to their needs. These included:
Shopping channel •	 – the Group launched its own 
shopping channel in September 2008 replacing  
a previous third party provided solution. This new 
channel provides further opportunities for customers  
to compare prices on a wide range of products 
including games consoles, TVs and computers, 
and to find the product most suited to their needs.
Broadband speed test •	 – the Group launched a  
free speed test service to customers in the broadband 
channel, allowing customers to measure the download 
and upload speeds they receive from their current 
broadband provider. This enables customers to  
check they are receiving the service they expect  
from their broadband provider.
Mobile recycling •	 – the Group launched a new  
service in the mobile phone channel, enabling 
customers to recycle their old mobile, to earn money 
and help the environment. 13 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Business Review
Chairman’s Statement
Our second year as a public company has been 
characterised by change both within and outside the Group. 
The credit crunch, or liquidity crisis in the banking 
system, spread and deepened during the year. We saw 
the failure of a number of banks, whilst others both in the 
UK and overseas required rescue packages from 
Governments and Central Banks. 
Against this economic backdrop and the deteriorating 
market conditions in the second half of the year, the 
Group recorded revenue growth of 10% to £178.8m for 
the year ending 31 December 2008 underpinned by 
strong visitor growth in the year of 32% to 120.1m 
visitors. These solid figures are in spite of a significant 
decline in revenue from the Money vertical in the second 
half of the year, due entirely to the credit crunch.
The diversity of our business has proved to be, and  
will continue to be, an important strength with the  
growth in the Insurance, Travel and Home Services 
verticals helping to offset declines experienced in  
the Money vertical. 
The worsening economic conditions and the turmoil in 
the credit and wider financial markets have resulted in  
the Group recording an impairment charge of £70.0m 
against goodwill in 2008. The Group is therefore reporting 
a statutory loss after tax of £59.1m for the year.
However, we remain strongly cash generative and ended 
2008 with a balance sheet containing no debt and a 
cash balance which increased during the year by £19.5m 
to £73.5m. Despite a 9% decline in adjusted EBITDA to 
£48.4m, this is a creditable set of results given the 
challenging market conditions experienced during  
the year.
In August 2008, we announced that we would implement 
an enhanced dividend policy paying approximately one 
half of adjusted net profits as dividends each year. In 
October 2008 we paid our maiden interim dividend of 
1.3p per ordinary share.
In line with this revised dividend policy, the Board 
recommends a final dividend of 2.2p per ordinary  
share, to be paid on 1 May 2009. If approved by 
shareholders, this will make a full year dividend of  
3.5p per ordinary share.
In last years’ statement I referred to the importance  
of improving our management process and upgrading 
the quality of our management team. The Group has 
grown rapidly in the last nine years, but is now of a size 
and complexity that requires a different management 
approach to that when the Group was in its 
entrepreneurial ‘super-growth’ phase. This is particularly 
so given the challenges of the credit crunch and the 
consumer recession.
In December, we announced that the Group’s founder, 
Simon Nixon, had decided to step down from his role  
as Chief Executive Officer on 25 February 2009. Simon 
became Executive Deputy Chairman on that date. In  
his new role, Simon will focus on strategic innovation  
and development.
It is a tribute to Simon’s vision and commitment that  
the Group has developed into the business it is today.  
On behalf of the Board and shareholders I would like to 
thank Simon for the immense contribution he has made 
to the development of the Group and look forward to 
working with him in his new role. 
In December we announced that Peter Plumb, who 
joined the Group earlier in the year, would join the  
Board as an Executive Director with effect from 
1 January 2009 and replace Simon as Chief Executive 
Officer on 25 February 2009. Peter is a tried and tested 
general manager in international, marketing-intensive 
businesses and brings with him a wide mix of skills and 
experience. He was previously UK managing director of 
dunnhumby Limited, the customer insights business and 
prior to that held senior positions with Disney, Dyson and 
PepsiCo. The Board is confident that Peter will steer the 
executive management team through the challenging 
market environment.
The Group has further strengthened the Board with  
the appointment of Graham Donoghue, the Managing 
Director of Travel, and David Osborne, the Marketing 
Director, as Executive Directors with effect from  
23 February 2009. Graham joined the Group in July 2008 
from TUI Travel plc where he was new media director and 
David joined the Group in February 2009 from easyJet 
where he was UK regional general manager.
These changes will help take the Group to the next  
stage of its development as we concentrate not only on 
growing the Group, but also running the business that we 
have better. Like many UK consumer facing companies, 
the immediate outlook is not good. We cannot assume 
that the effects of the credit crunch will suddenly lift  
and our business return to the levels of 2007. All of  
our verticals have begun the year down on the same 
period last year and are suffering from the effects of  
the recession. 
In the short term we must reconfigure ourselves for lower 
levels of demand. We are helped by the fact that most of 
our profit converts to cash, we have no debt and £73.5m 
of cash balances at the end of 2008. Our task is to 
improve what we have so we are well positioned when 
our markets eventually recover, which they will. 
In these challenging times, our results demonstrate the 
robust and diversified nature of our business. These 
results are to the credit of our employees and on behalf 
of the Board I would like to thank them for their hard work 
and commitment during the year. I would also like to 
thank my colleagues on the Board for their contributions 
during the course of the year. The Group remains well 
placed despite the current market conditions and this 
gives us all confidence for the future.

Business Review 
Chief Executive’s Report
In the year ended 31 December 2008, the Group has 
performed well despite the challenging trading conditions 
that have been driven by the tightening credit markets 
and downturn in the economy. Group revenue has 
increased year on year by 10% from £162.9m to  
£178.8m and the Insurance, Travel and Home Services 
verticals have all continued to grow helping to 
compensate for the decline seen in the Money vertical. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined in the year by 9% to £48.4m 
principally due to further investment in the Group’s online 
offering and the increased customer acquisition costs in 
the Insurance vertical. The Group remained strongly cash 
generative and ended 2008 with no debt and the cash 
balance increasing during the year by £19.5m to £73.5m. 
We believe this demonstrates the resilience of our 
diversified business model in these difficult economic 
times. 
Insurance is now the largest vertical in the Group, 
accounting for 43% of Group revenue. Revenue  
grew in the year by 38% to £77.7m (2007: £56.4m)  
albeit at a slowing rate as the year went on. This was 
driven both by improved commercial arrangements 
with providers and increased visitor numbers that were 
20% higher than in 2007. We maintained a strong market 
position in a sector which continued to show growth 
during the year despite the increasing level of competition 
from other online aggregators who spent significantly on 
television advertising and bid aggressively on search 
engines. We believe we still have the most complete 
insurance comparison engine in the UK offering our 
customers the widest choice of providers together with a 
very strong brand. 
During the course of 2008, and in particular in the second 
half of the year, the Money vertical felt the impact of the 
deepening global banking crisis. Revenue in the year 
declined by 10% to £68.3m (2007: £76.0m) as credit 
markets continued to tighten. With the UK consumer 
seeking to reduce debt and providers continuing to 
tighten their lending criteria, revenue declines were most 
notable in the loans and mortgages channels. Visitors to 
the Money vertical were however 27% higher in 2008 
than in 2007 demonstrating the value of the website to 
our customers, particularly in times of uncertainty.
The impact of the credit crunch and the worsening 
economic conditions were particularly felt in the secured 
loans market which contracted substantially. In July, 
Barclays took the decision to close its subsidiary First 
Plus to new business with effect from August. First Plus 
had provided the Group with an exclusive market leading 
product and represented approximately 10% of Group 
revenue at the time it closed to new business. Although 
the Group was able to replace some of the revenue lost 
following the withdrawal by Barclays, the continued 
tightening of the supply of available credit throughout the 
year meant that revenue from secured lending in the 
second half of the year was significantly lower than the 
first half.
Savings showed the strongest growth in the Money 
vertical with revenue increasing by approximately 80%  
in the year as customers sought to spread their cash 
balances across a number of accounts to take advantage 
of the protection afforded by the Financial Services 
Authority Compensation Scheme, and to find the best 
returns as interest rates fell.
The Travel vertical performed well with revenue increasing 
in the year by 27% to £19.1m (2007: £15.0m). Growth 
slowed over the second half of the year as customers 
sought to reduce discretionary expenditure. Revenue 
growth was driven by increased visitors to the vertical 
which were 32% higher in 2008 than in 2007. 
The Home Services vertical delivered a strong 
performance in 2008 with revenue increasing 63% in  
the year to £7.4m (2007: £4.5m). For a large part of the 
year, utility prices were increasing, prompting customers 
to shop around for the best available deal. The Home 
Services vertical is now well established and experienced 
visitor growth in the year of 97%.
In September 2008 the Group launched its own shopping 
channel. Whilst the Group has had a shopping channel 
on the website for some time, this was previously 
provided by a third party. This limited the Group’s ability 
to drive visitors to its website from search engines and 
therefore our ability to grow this channel. The Group now 
has its own product which gives an additional 75,000 
pages to be indexed by search engines, enabling results 
from our shopping channel to appear in the natural 
listings on search engines, increasing revenue.
Mortgage 2000, the Group’s offline business which 
specialises in supporting mortgage intermediaries 
continued to decline throughout the year reflecting  
the declining mortgage market. The Group is currently 
reviewing its options for this business.
The Group’s strategy in 2008
Despite the current challenging economic conditions,  
the Group remains well placed to respond to the 
continuing structural shift in consumers’ and providers’ 
behaviour as consumers spend increasing amounts of 
time online and their confidence in, and familiarity with, 
transacting over the internet increases.
We believe the Group provides the largest and most 
effective price comparison marketplace in the UK, 
matching providers with customers who, having 
compared the market, are ready to make a purchase,  
thereby improving the focus and efficiency of providers’ 
marketing spend. 17 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Business Review
Chief Executive’s Report continued
The Group’s strategy to capitalise on this structural shift 
has focused on three main areas in the last financial year:
Customer focus
The Group is committed to saving its customers time and 
money. This sits at the heart of the Group and its 
innovation and product development. Each new website 
development, new tool or new product that the Group 
launches is intended to save its customers time and 
money, support the customer in his or her purchasing 
decision or enhance the customer experience.
This constant focus on placing the customer first helps 
ensure that the Group remains at the front of customers’ 
minds and is central to how the Group is run.
Innovation and product development
The Group has continued to invest in innovation and 
product development in 2008 and will continue to do so. 
Customers see the benefits of this innovation in enhanced 
website functionality, improvements in existing products 
and the addition of new products and features. This focus 
on innovation and product development ensures that the 
customer experience is continually enhanced and the 
Group remains their first choice for price comparison in 
the UK. By enhancing the customer experience and 
providing support to customers in their purchasing 
decision, providers benefit from increased conversion 
rates and a more efficient marketing spend.
Examples of new products and services introduced in 
2008 include:
The launch of a ‘Policy Wizard’ tool in motor insurance •	
which enables customers to find the policy that exactly 
meets their needs and see prices update in real time. 
This significantly improves the usability of the motor 
insurance channel and will improve providers’ 
conversion rates.
The look and feel of the Travel website was refreshed •	
to make it more inspirational; to really excite customers 
about the prospect of travelling or holidaying and to 
make it more intuitive to use. This was initially released 
to customers as an alternative or ‘beta’ version and 
will be fully live during 2009.
The Group integrated hotel reviews from Trip Advisor •	
and added far more photos, videos and content into 
its Travel website.
The Group launched a new credit cards channel  •	
and enhanced the loans and savings channels,  
both of which now include expert, video and  
user reviews, all substantially improving the  
customer experience.
The Group extended the question set within its  •	
motor and home insurance channels to enable 
customers to obtain a more tailored quote for  
their personal circumstances.
In September 2008 the Group launched its own •	
shopping channel. This channel is already performing 
well and the Group is planning to further improve its 
functionality to make it a market leading proposition.
Brand awareness
Marketing and PR drive new customers to the Group’s 
website and ensure that the Group remains at the front of 
customers’ minds. The Group has continued to invest 
heavily in its brand as part of a highly focused marketing 
strategy. This has helped the Group to increase the 
number of visitors attracted to its website by 32% to 
120.1m (2007: 91.0m) and has helped to ensure the 
Group remains the UK’s leading price comparison 
website. The success of this strategy is reflected in  
the increased online brand recognition of 
moneysupermarket.com to 80% in September 2008  
from 73% in November 2007. 
The Group continues to supply best buy tables to the 
personal finance sections of a number of national 
newspapers including The Telegraph, The Times and  
The Independent and in 2008 spent £19.0m on television 
advertising (2007: £17.0m). With increased competition 
from other online aggregators, most notably in motor 
insurance, the Group’s brand remains one of its most 
important and valuable assets.

Business Review
Chief Executive’s Report continued
Before I outline the Group’s strategy in 2009, I would  
like to thank Simon for his help and support during my 
transition to Chief Executive Officer. I very much look 
forward to working with him in his new role, where he will 
continue to drive product development and innovation 
across the Group. 
The Group’s strategy in 2009
Simon’s Chief Executive Report described the Group’s 
strategy during 2008 and in particular the focus on 
customers, innovation and product development, and 
brand awareness. 
These cornerstones of the Group’s strategy in 2008, 
which have served the Group well in its development  
and growth to date, will continue to form a major part of 
the plans for 2009. However, the unprecedented global 
financial crisis and the subsequent UK recession means 
the Group faces a very different marketplace to that 
which it has encountered in the past. 
Our immediate task is to reconfigure our business for  
the lower levels of demand we are seeing due to the 
recession and to concentrate on managing our existing 
business better. 2009 will be a difficult year and we 
cannot assume 2010 will be any easier. More so now than 
ever, the Group must remain flexible and responsive to 
the changing market conditions and changing customer 
needs.
Accordingly, the Group’s priorities for 2009 will focus on 
the following areas, each of which interacts with the other 
as part of an overall strategy:
Marketing 
moneysupermarket.com and travelsupermarket.com are 
both market leading brands, with online brand recognition 
at their highest ever levels as a result of the major 
marketing and PR investment by the Group over the past 
three years. In 2009, the Group will continue to invest 
significantly in its brands and will focus on building more 
innovative and effective communication with its 
customers. Making the marketing investment and the 
Group’s brands work harder will be a major challenge  
for the business this year as we seek to optimise our 
marketing spend.
Innovation and product development
Continued innovation and product development remain 
key to the Group’s strategy in spite of the downturn. 
Customers are already benefiting from a more 
personalised search capability across the website, in the 
form of customer reviews, richer content and smart 
search tools and wizards. Such innovations not only save 
customers money but also time. 
The Group will continue to focus in 2009 on innovation 
and product development with the aim of saving 
customers more time and money. The Group will also 
invest in developing its existing systems, both to simplify 
the customer proposition and to make more of what the 
Group already has. 
The Group will further look at and test innovative new 
opportunities to utilise and leverage its core price 
comparison competencies in markets different to  
those in which the Group currently operates. 
Insight led
The Group will focus in 2009 on using its data better and 
developing tools and capabilities from which it can drive 
decision making. In a challenging market, it is essential 
that as an online business the Group uses every piece of 
information effectively.
As the Group becomes more analytical in its approach, 
the insight and knowledge it gathers about its business, 
customers and providers will enable the Group to 
optimise its decision making and to monitor its 
performance against its goals. This will ensure the  
Group is able to manage its business better in the  
short, medium and long term.
Customer focus
Saving customers time and money remains at the very 
heart of the Group’s philosophy and the Group will 
continue to focus on this during 2009 and beyond.  
The Group has started to build a single base of customer 
knowledge, and as a business, recognises the need to  
be much more inquisitive about customer behaviours and 
attitudes so that the Group can respond to them with 
better service and more tailored products. 
As the UK continues in recession and customers need  
to find more ways to save money, the Group’s focus on 
customers will be more important than ever.
Outlook in 2009
The short term outlook is not good. Revenue to date this 
year is significantly down on last year, entirely due to the 
recession. We will manage ourselves accordingly.
However, the Group has many important strengths, 
including a diversified business, market leading brands, 
high brand recognition with customers and a motivated 
workforce. I am confident that the successful execution of 
the Group’s strategy in 2009 will position the business for 
long term sustainable growth.

Financial and Business Review
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (the ‘Company’) was formed as a new holding company on 14 March 2007 
and it acquired Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) on  
22 June 2007. Accordingly the Group is presenting group results for the year ended 31 December 2008 and the 
period ended 31 December 2007. These have been presented on pages 54 to 74. Revenue in 2008 was  
£178.8m (2007: £88.3m), and after an impairment charge of £70.0m, generated a net loss after tax of £59.1m 
(2007: profit £9.4m).
The Group is also presenting below an Adjusted Income Statement for the years ended 31 December 2008  
and 31 December 2007 to show what the financial results would have been had the Company acquired 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited on 1 January 2006. The Directors believe that this will allow 
users of the financial information to gain a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business. 
This is consistent with the presentation made last year. The Adjusted Income Statement forms the basis of the 
commentary contained in the Financial and Business Review presented below unless otherwise stated.

Notes
Basis of preparation
The adjusted results show the trading results of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2008 and  
31 December 2007 adjusted for the following assumptions:
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the Company occurred debt free  •	
on 1 January 2006.
The charge for share options is the average expected charge over the vesting period of options still to be •	
exercised following the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007.
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share figures which have been included are based on an 
adjusted net profit figure assuming that the number of ordinary shares and options in issue at 31 December 2007 
had been in issue since 1 January 2007. Options and shares issued since 28 December 2007 have been included 
in the adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation on a pro rata basis. The adjusted earnings per share 
calculations assume a 30% tax rate for 2007 and a 28.5% rate for 2008.
The Directors regard an adjusted EBITDA figure as being the most meaningful profit measure for this period.  
The following adjustments have been made to the Adjusted Income Statement:
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the Company gave rise to £207.2m of •	
intangible assets. These are to be written off over a period of 3-10 years with a charge of £25.2m per annum to 
be recorded in each of the first three years. This has been shown within administrative expenses as a charge of 
£25.2m in the 2008 and 2007 Adjusted Income Statement.
With effect from the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007, Directors’ and senior managers’ compensation •	
was revised and the individuals entered into new service agreements. Directors’ and certain senior managers’ 
profit share, discretionary bonus and employer’s national insurance contributions have been added back in 
calculating adjusted EBITDA in 2007 to reflect the fact that following the listing on 31 July 2007 these elements 
of compensation no longer apply to these individuals. No adjustments are required for the year ended 31 
December 2008.
Share option charges relating to options granted to Directors, senior managers’ and other employees of  •	
the Group before the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007 have been added back to calculate adjusted 
EBITDA. Prior to the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the Company, 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited issued share options to employees on terms that will not be 
offered moving forwards. On listing, the Company also issued ‘free’ shares to the value of £3,000 as a ‘bonus’ 
to each eligible employee as part of its Share Incentive Plan scheme. On listing, the Company also entered into 
an agreement with Gerald Corbett under which Gerald Corbett purchased 117,647 ordinary shares in the 
Company and provided he completes three years service as Chairman of the Company from listing and  
he retains the ordinary shares he purchased, he will be entitled to subscribe at nominal value for 235,294 
ordinary shares in the Company. 
The Company made conditional share awards under the terms of the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan on •	
28 December 2007 and on 4 March 2008.
The Group has performed an impairment review during the year resulting in an impairment charge against •	
goodwill of £70.0m which has been added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA. Further details of the calculation 
performed are provided on pages 67 and 68. 24 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Overview of financial performance
Revenue grew by 10% to £178.8m (2007: £162.9m) and adjusted EBITDA fell by 9% to £48.4m (2007: £52.9m). 
The internet business generated £172.5m of revenue representing an increase of 13% on 2007. Revenue growth 
was impacted by the credit crunch which reduced the supply of credit to the market in general and reduced 
revenue year on year in the Money vertical. Revenue in all of the other internet verticals grew compared with last 
year. The intermediary business generated £6.3m of revenue representing a decrease of 41% on 2007. The 
intermediary business also suffered as a result of lower lending volumes in the UK mortgage market. The Group  
is currently considering a number of options in respect of the intermediary business.
Gross margins fell slightly compared with last year from 67% to 65%. Gross margins benefited from a favourable 
sales mix, as the lower margin intermediary business contributed 3% of Group revenue in 2008 compared to 7% 
in 2007. The Group was able to maintain its direct-to-site revenue as a proportion of total revenue over the period. 
During the third quarter customer acquisition costs increased substantially in the Insurance vertical which reduced 
gross margins overall. However these returned to more normal levels in the fourth quarter.
The adjusted cost base before depreciation increased by 23% from £55.7m to £68.4m. Distribution costs, which 
consist primarily of TV advertising, increased by 10% on last year to £21.6m. Although the Group advertised 
across all of its verticals, more of the spend was targeted at insurance, this being both the most competitive 
market segment and the fastest growing in absolute terms. 
The Group has further strengthened its online brand recognition which increased to 80% in 2008 as measured by 
a YouGov survey regularly commissioned by the Group.
Adjusted administrative expenses increased by 34% over the period. Total adjusted staff costs increased by £7.6m 
to £30.4m in 2008. The Group reduced its permanent headcount over the period, and particularly the second half 
of the year, from 647 to 555 reflecting declining revenue in the Money vertical and a downsizing of the workforce in 
the intermediary business. The Group invested approximately £3.3m in third party resource in the Money vertical 
to transfer its technology from ASP to ASP.net to ensure its core technology remained current and ‘supported’ by 
Microsoft and to improve the look, feel and functionality of a number of the key channels. This work was 
completed in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Other administrative costs, including irrecoverable VAT, increased by £3.0m accentuated by a change in sales mix 
towards sales which were exempt from VAT, notably insurance, together with the introduction of a second data 
centre to provide business continuity management capability in the first quarter of 2008.
The Group reshaped its operations in Germany and invested £2.2m in 2008 against £0.7m in 2007, launching 
operations in the Money vertical in January 2009 through the website www.marktvergleich.de.

1  During 2008 the Group undertook an exercise based on additional information made available to it to reallocate impression-based advertising 
revenue between the Money and Insurance verticals in 2007 consistent with the results presented for the year ended 2008. As a result of this 
exercise £2.0m previously shown in the Money vertical in other revenue has been reallocated and recorded in other revenue in the Insurance 
vertical in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007.
 
Internet business
The UK internet business accounted for 97% of Group revenue in the year ended 31 December 2008. The 
Directors use key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to assess the performance of the internet business against the 
Group’s strategy. These are reviewed on a regular basis. The principal KPIs for the internet business are as follows:
Visitors
The Group measures the number of visitors to its website as the number of unique visitors per day per channel, 
measured on a cumulative basis using cookie-based tracking methodologies.
Transactions
The Group measures transactions at the point in time that the customer leaves the Group’s website having clicked 
through to a third party website, or in some cases having completed an application form hosted on the Group’s 
website.
Revenue per visitor (‘RPV’)
The Group measures the total revenue (including click and other internet revenue) divided by the number of visitors 
defined above.
Revenue per transaction (‘RPT’)
The Group measures the click based revenue divided by the total number of transactions defined above. 26 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

The relative performance of each of the internet verticals is discussed below:
Money
The Money vertical currently offers customers the ability to search for, and compare, products for, amongst other 
things, business finance, credit cards, current accounts, mortgages, loans, debt solutions and savings accounts. It 
also includes elements of the Group’s lead business (PAA) and advisory business (MCAT) together with advertising 
revenue that derives from financial products.

1.  The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors from 27 April 2008 to the end of June 2008 following a release made in respect 
of the anti-virus software AVG. In assessing whether a webpage was safe it ‘followed’ every link or url displayed on an email or webpage to the 
destination website. This meant that many web based businesses including the Group recorded visitors from users of the AVG software who 
themselves did not technically visit the website. The 2008 visitor count has been adjusted for the estimated impact of this. AVG released a further 
update to its anti-virus software in early July 2008.
2.  During 2008 the Group undertook an exercise based on additional information made available to it to reallocate impression-based advertising 
revenue between the Money and Insurance verticals in 2007 consistent with the results presented for the year ended 2008. As a result of this 
exercise £2.0m previously shown in the Money vertical in other revenue has been reallocated and recorded in other revenue in the Insurance 
vertical in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007.
Total revenue in the Money vertical decreased by 10% from £76.0m to £68.3m and click based revenue  
by 6% from £60.8m to £57.4m. Visitor growth of 27% has been offset by a decline in RPV of 29% in the year.  
The Group noted during the year, and in particular the second half of the year, that lenders significantly tightened 
their lending criteria. Indeed a number of providers withdrew from the market completely as the credit crunch 
began to deepen, reducing the supply of available credit. This impacted all of the credit based channels but most 
markedly the secured loans channel, which also suffered as home equity declined with the falling housing market. 
First Plus, a subsidiary of Barclays, which was the Group’s largest single provider by revenue in 2007 closed to 
new business in August 2008. First Plus represented approximately 10% of Group revenue at the time it closed  
to new business. 
Revenue generated from savings grew significantly year on year as customers sought both to maximise their 
returns on investments and reduce exposure to individual banks amidst the uncertainty that arose following the 
collapse of a number of financial institutions. The overall impact of the change in sales mix away from debt 
products towards savings products, together with the reduced availability of credit, was to reduce the average 
RPT and consequently RPV. 
Other revenue, which includes revenue from the sale of leads through PAA, commission based sales through 
MCAT for mortgages and loans, and advertising revenue, declined 28% over the year. Leads and commission 
based revenue fell in line with the declining credit markets. Revenue from advertising declined relative to 2007 
following a deliberate reduction in the space made available for impression-based advertising, aimed at improving 
the user experience on the website.

1.  As noted in the prospectus issued in connection with the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007, the Group’s visitor numbers during the period 
between January and May 2007 were understated due to certain visitors not being assigned a unique global user ID. The issue was resolved in 
May 2007 and has not impacted visitor numbers in the Insurance vertical after May 2007. The Group has not been able to quantify the exact 
extent of the understatement.

exercise £2.0m previously shown in the Money vertical in other revenue has been reallocated and recorded in other revenue in the Insurance 
vertical in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007.
Total revenue in the Insurance vertical grew by 38% from £56.4m to £77.7m and click based revenue by 43% to 
£66.6m. RPT increased by 28% to £4.49 as a number of contracts with providers were migrated from a pure  
cost per click to a cost per action arrangement over the course of 2007 and 2008. This has allowed the Group to 
benefit from improved conversion rates as a result of better search functionality on its website and improvements 
made to provider websites. A number of significant enhancements to the website were made in the fourth quarter 
including the launch of the ‘Policy Wizard’ in motor insurance, which enables customers in real time to make 
changes to policy details and compare the impact this has on pricing across multiple providers simultaneously. It is 
anticipated that the Group will continue to benefit from these improvements in 2009. Other revenue increased by 
14% to £11.1m over the period. 
The insurance comparison market remains the most competitive that the Group currently operates in. Advertising 
and in particular television advertising spend in the insurance comparison market increased significantly over the 
period. In response to this, the Group increased its spend in the Insurance vertical to protect its market share 
whilst only marginally increasing Group television advertising spend over the prior year. Customer acquisition costs 
from search engines also increased significantly in the third quarter which is traditionally a competitive period for 
the motor insurance industry. Customer acquisition costs returned to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. The 
increased marketing expenditure in 2008 lowered the relative contribution in the Insurance vertical compared  
to 2007. 28 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

other things, airport parking, car hire, flights, hotels and package holidays.

1.  The Group recorded a substantial increase in its reported visitors from 27 April 2008 to the end of June 2008 following a release made in respect 
of the anti-virus software AVG. In assessing whether a webpage was safe it ‘followed’ every link or url displayed on an email or webpage to the 
destination website. This meant that many web based businesses including the Group recorded visitors from users of the AVG software who 
themselves did not technically visit the website. The 2008 visitor count has been adjusted for the estimated impact of this. AVG released a further 
update to its anti-virus software in early July 2008.
Total revenue in the Travel vertical grew by 27% from £15.0m to £19.1m and click based revenue by 29% from 
£13.1m to £16.8m. Visitors grew by 32% over the period whilst RPV fell by 4%. Revenue from the flights channel 
was impacted in the year by the continued popularity of the low cost branded carriers, a number of which do not 
pay commissions to the Group. 
Revenue growth slowed in the second half of the year as customers began to reduce their levels of discretionary 
spend. This impacted the flights and hotels channels in particular. Package holidays and car hire revenue 
continued to grow strongly throughout the period. Other revenue grew 18% to £2.3m driven by increased  
visitor numbers.
The Group ceased television advertising activity in the Travel vertical for the majority of the second half of the year 
in response to the weakening market conditions and only recommenced activity in the post Christmas period.  
Full year television advertising expenditure in the Travel vertical was £2.2m lower than the previous year. 29 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

update to its anti-virus software in early July 2008.
Total revenue in the Home Services vertical grew by 63% from £4.5m to £7.4m. Revenue grew particularly strongly 
in the utilities channel aided by the rising prices in the electricity and gas markets. The Group’s shopping channel 
launched in September 2008 and this helped drive the significant year on year increase in visitors of 97% to the 
Home Services vertical. RPV and RPT are significantly lower in shopping than the other channels in the Home 
Services vertical and the change in sales mix has resulted in a fall in both KPIs compared with 2007. 
Germany
During 2008 the Group refocused its operations in Germany. Launched in October 2007, the German operation 
originally concentrated on motor insurance using a third party provided solution to test the market. Whilst the initial 
reaction from customers was broadly positive, the third party technology was not sufficiently flexible to allow rapid 
development, particularly to the front end customer offering, and was therefore discontinued. The Group invested 
in its own proprietary technology in the second half of 2008 developing a loans channel which commenced trading 
in January 2009 at www.marktvergleich.de.
Key contractual arrangements
Moneysupermarket.com Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, is party to contracts and other arrangements 
which the Directors judge are essential to the Group’s business.
As with any internet business the Group is dependent upon its ability to attract customers to its website either  
directly or through paid search or portal partners, and revenue generated from commercial arrangements  
with its providers.
The Group uses television advertising to attract customers to its website directly. The Group incurred costs  
of £19.0m relating to television advertising in 2008. The Group has contracts with a number of media agencies  
to acquire advertising inventory from commercial television companies. The Group typically has a commitment  
of between 6 and 10 weeks expenditure at any one time. Television costs represent 88% of distribution costs.  30 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
Business Review 
Financial and Business Review continued
The Group uses search engines to acquire traffic via paid search. The Group spent £38.3m on paid search in 
2008. Although there are a number of search engines that operate in the UK, Google is the dominant search 
engine and accounts for the majority of the Group’s spend in this area. The Group has had contracts with a 
number of media agencies in the year to manage search engine marketing. The Group has no forward 
commitment to search engines and manages its spend on a real time basis.
The Group does not consider any of the contracts it has with portal partners to be material.
The Group has a number of contracts with providers which are based either on a cost per click basis or a cost  
per action basis or a hybrid of the two. It also has a number of commercial arrangements based on the number  
of page impressions served in the case of banner advertising. Following the cessation of trade with First Plus in 
August 2008 the Group does not consider it has any material contracts with providers in any one channel.
The Group does however frequently deal with providers across a range of different channels managed under 
different contracts, often to different parts of the same organisation, and occasionally through third party media 
agencies. At this consolidated channel level the largest individual provider represented approximately 4% of  
Group internet revenue.
During 2008 there was consolidation in the financial marketplace with the number of independent organisations 
reduced. The brands under these group umbrellas are usually run independently and the marketing budget 
managed separately. The largest group represented approximately 9% of Group internet revenue. 
Acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited
On 22 June 2007 the Company, at that time controlled by Simon Nixon, purchased the entire issued share  
capital of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. This was funded partly by a cash payment of  
£162m to one of the founder shareholders, Duncan Cameron, and partly by a share-for-share exchange.  
This transaction has had a number of impacts on the Financial Statements and will also impact on  
subsequent periods.
Goodwill and intangibles
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited gave rise to £125.0m of goodwill and  
the recognition of £207.2m of intangible assets. Individual intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives 
(which are in the range of 3-10 years) with a charge of £25.2m per annum in the first three years in the full year 
accounts. A charge of £13.3m has been included in the accounts covering the period from 22 June 2007 to  
31 December 2007, and a full year’s charge of £25.2m has been included in the Adjusted Income Statement for  
the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 and the Statutory Income Statement for the year 
ended 31 December 2008.
On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible 
assets for impairment. For the current period, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in 
use, and this was calculated by reference to the cash flows taken from the Group’s forecasts, discounted to their 
present value by a discount rate reflecting not only the time value of money but also additional risks specific to the 
Group and the industry in which it operates, and the limited visibility inherent in the current economic environment.
As a result of this exercise, the Group concluded that it should recognise an impairment charge against goodwill  
of £70.0m in 2008, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill balance to £55.0m. No impairment was deemed 
necessary against the other intangible assets. Further details of this exercise and the resulting impairment are 
provided in note 12 to the Financial Statements on pages 67 and 68. 31 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
Treasury and funding
The Company raised £180m from the proceeds of the listing on 31 July 2007. Approximately £178m of the 
proceeds raised were used to fund the costs of the acquisition by the Company of Duncan Cameron’s shares in 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited including all related costs and expenses of the acquisition, the 
raising and draw down of debt finance and the costs of the listing. The Company acquired £14.3m of cash at the 
acquisition and has continued to generate cash from operations. The Company had cash balances of £73.5m at 
31 December 2008 and no debt. The Company has invested its cash over the period predominantly in instant 
access cash deposits and short-term deposits of no more than three months, and in light of the events which 
occurred in the banking sector over the past year, now holds balances with a larger range of different UK and Irish 
institutions. As such the interest earned has closely followed movements in the Bank of England base rate.
Dividend
The Directors have adopted a progressive approach to dividend payout and initially had a dividend payout of 
approximately one third of adjusted net profit each year, with one third of the annual amount payable as an interim 
dividend and two thirds as a final dividend. The Group announced on 27 August 2008 following a review of its 
cash position that it would increase its annual dividend payout to approximately one half of adjusted net profit, to 
be paid on a broadly similar basis.
The Board is recommending a final dividend, subject to shareholder approval, consistent with the policy above in 
respect of the year ended 31 December 2008. This equates to £11.1m and represents 2.2p per ordinary share. 
Together with the interim dividend of 1.3p per ordinary share paid on 17 October 2008, this gives a total dividend 
for the year of 3.5p per ordinary share. The total cost of the dividend for the financial year will be £17.6m. The 
ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 25 March 2009, with a record date of 27 March 2009 and a payment date 
of 1 May 2009. Shareholders have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing 
shares in the Company through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Tax
The Group tax charge of £8.1m in the Group Income Statement on page 54 represents an effective tax rate of 
–16%. This is significantly below the prevailing rate for the period of 28.5%. The current year has been impacted by 
a number of items. The Group has disallowable expenses in the year of £76.0m (including £70.0m of goodwill 
impairment), and a further £1.2m of losses have arisen in the year relating to the German operation, for which a 
deferred tax asset has not been recognised. The Group has also recognised a deferred tax charge of £2.5m 
representing the revaluation of the deferred tax asset held in relation to share options. In future, the Group expects 
the underlying effective rate of tax to revert to close to the standard UK corporation tax rate of 28%.
Loss per ordinary share
Basic statutory loss per ordinary share for the period to 31 December 2008 was 11.8p (2007: earnings per share of 
3.0p). Details can be found in note 9 to the Financial Statements on page 66. Adjusted basic earnings per ordinary 
share decreased from 7.5p to 6.9p per share. The adjusted earnings per ordinary share is based on adjusted 
EBITDA after deducting depreciation and adding estimated interest income for each period to calculate an 
adjusted profit before tax. A tax rate of 28.5% (2007: 30%) has been applied to calculate adjusted profit after tax.

Business Review 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The tables below summarise the material financial and operational risks to the Group 
and how the Group seeks to mitigate them in the day-to-day running of the business.
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Significant worsening in credit markets Financial institutions may reduce the  
quantum of lending and tighten their 
acceptance criteria for customers seeking  
to obtain credit. This may reduce Group 
revenue. Providers may increase their focus 
on customer retention and not acquisition. 
This may reduce commissions available to 
price comparison websites.
The Group has invested heavily in its Smart 
Search technology which matches customers 
with providers offering products that are 
suitable to their particular credit 
circumstances. This enables the results and 
information presented to customers to reflect 
price for risk and reflects lenders’ appetites to 
lend to different customer risk categories, 
increasing the relevance of the results 
presented, helping to protect Group revenue.
Significant consolidation of providers Consolidation of providers may continue in 
response to the poor credit markets. This  
may reduce competition for business with 
customers having less choice and may  
reduce commissions available to price 
comparison websites. 
The Group will continue to improve its search 
functionality and deliver new relevant 
customers to providers at demonstrably lower 
acquisition costs compared with other media.
Security of cash balances The Group holds significant cash balances.  
A failure of a major financial institution with 
whom the Group places significant deposits 
may result in a material loss to the Group.
The Group has diversified its cash holdings 
across a number of institutions. At the end of 
2008, the Group held cash balances with five 
financial institutions with a maximum balance 
of £31.5m with any one institution.
Revenue assurance Reduction of or a failure to recognise revenue 
from contracted providers where the Group is 
remunerated on a cost per action basis.
The Group will continue to perform 
independent reviews using third parties to 
gain assurance that the Group is being 
correctly remunerated for the sales it 
introduces to contracted providers.
Investment in new areas Capital invested in new products and services 
or new geographies fails to make a return.
Investments in new areas typically leverage 
existing expertise and experience built up over 
many years. Capital requirements are relatively 
low and investment is managed in stages 
such that it is not finally committed until there 
is good visibility of a return.
Financial services and other markets 
regulation and taxation
The business model in financial services or 
other lines of business may be compromised 
by changes to existing regulation or the 
introduction of new regulation, or changes  
to the tax legislation, particularly value  
added tax.
The Group has a team of regulatory specialists  
who work with the business to ensure that  
it remains compliant with existing regulation 
and informed of impending regulation. The 
Group has embraced regulation to date and 
shares the vision of the regulators generally  
to make the market more transparent to the 
end customer.
The Group continues to monitor ongoing 
European Union developments in respect of 
the review of the provision of financial 
intermediary services with regard to value 
added tax and any relevant case law in this 
area as it emerges.
Financial risks 33 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Competitive environment Loss of market share and erosion of margins 
from increased competition.
The Group continues to focus on building 
market leading products to improve its 
proposition to customers. This includes 
investment in customer retention tools and 
technology including CRM initiatives which 
deliver additional features and functionality to 
customers.
Brand perception Reduction in customer loyalty with existing 
customers and an inability to attract new 
customers if the business fails to maintain  
its position as a leading price comparison 
website.
Continued investment in television advertising 
reinforced through press activity will maintain 
the Group in customers’ minds. Rigorous 
checking of the website through audit and 
review will maintain the accuracy of the 
information displayed. Additional investment in 
initiatives increases transparency to the 
customer helping to protect brand values. 
Capacity and functionality of IT  
and systems infrastructure
Failure to provide adequate service levels to 
customers or maintain revenue generating 
services.
The Group maintains two separate data 
centres with n + 1 redundancy in relation to its 
core infrastructure to ensure that service is 
maintained in the event of a disaster at the 
primary data centre.
Retention of key management Lack of necessary expertise or continuity to 
execute strategy.
Existing key management and new hires  
are tied in through attractive equity incentive 
packages and rewarding career structures.  
In addition succession plans are being 
developed in 2009 for key members of  
the management team which will be  
regularly reviewed.
Reliance on search engine paid  
search and natural listings
Reduction in gross margin through reduction 
in revenue derived from search engine 
optimisation or failure to manage search 
engine marketing campaigns appropriately.
The Group will continue to invest in 
sustainable search engine optimisation 
activities which adhere to search engine 
guidelines. A new software solution was  
introduced during the year to assist in 
managing the profitability of search  
engine marketing campaigns.
Economic environment Reduction in visitors and revenue from a 
recession as customers seek to reduce levels 
of discretionary expenditure. 
The Group continues to focus on building a 
wide range of market leading products to 
meet customers needs. Customers seeking to 
reduce levels of discretionary expenditure will 
also be looking to obtain ‘best’ value from 
compulsory products and services. The 
diversification of the Group both in the number 
of verticals that it operates in and the range of 
products and services it provides in each 
vertical should lessen the impact of a 
recession upon the Group although it cannot 
entirely mitigate against it.

Corporate Responsibility
Corporate Responsibility Report 
The Group operates with an underlying awareness of its wider 
responsibilities to society.
Communities and charities
In addition to the Group’s Charity of the Year, during 2008 the 
Group launched a new initiative called .Community aimed at 
harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of its employees to  
benefit the communities in which it operates.
The .Community initiative is focused on helping charities within a 
few miles of the Group’s offices in Ewloe and so support is targeted 
primarily in Flintshire and Cheshire. From the inception of the  
.Community scheme the Group has set aside £7,680 in 2008 and 
expects to set aside £2,000 per month in 2009 via the Charities  
Aid Foundation. The .Community initiative is administered by the 
Group’s employees who identify causes and make donations.
Since its launch in August 2008 the .Community scheme has 
already supported the following charities:
Miles of Smiles
The Club House, Mold
St John’s Ambulance Cheshire Young Carers
Chester Gang Show (Scouts and Guides)
Denbighshire Home Start
Delyn Women’s Aid
In addition to the .Community initiative, the Group continues to 
select and support a charity on an annual basis. The 2007/08 
Charity of the Year was Brain Injury Rehabilitation and Development 
(BIRD). BIRD is a Chester based charity which provides a unique 
programme to aid the rehabilitation of people with neurological 
impairment. Over the course of the year employees raised £9,976 
for BIRD with the Group donating £13,042 making a total donation 
in the year of £23,018.
Employees have selected the Hospice of the Good Shepherd  
for the Group’s 2008/09 Charity of the Year. The Hospice, which  
is on the outskirts of Chester, exists to provide highly specialised 
palliative care for people living with advanced diseases from the 
communities of Chester, Deeside, Ellesmere Port and rural 
Cheshire. During the year, employees raised £2,227 for the Hospice 
with the Group donating £3,760 making a total donation in the year 
of £5,987.
Environment
The Group strives to reduce energy and raw material usage  
to support environmental and financial performance.
The Group has launched a new initiative called Team Green to 
focus on environmental and sustainability improvements in the  
way the Group operates. The team is focusing on recycling and 
energy use within the Group as well as other areas such as local 
and ethical sourcing.
The Group has chosen not to set environmental key performance 
indicators due to its relative size and the limited impact it has on  
the environment. The Group does however participate in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project.
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement and 
consultation and places emphasis on keeping its employees 
informed of the Group’s activities via its intranet which was 
launched in 2008, regular briefings and the circulation to 
employees of relevant information including corporate 
announcements. This also helps to achieve a common  
awareness amongst employees of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the Group. 
The Group also operates an employee forum through which 
nominated representatives ensure that employees’ views are taken 
into account regarding issues that are likely to affect them. An 
employee opinion survey process is also in place to ensure that 
employees are given a voice in the organisation and that the Group 
can take action based on employee feedback.
The Group is committed to an equal opportunities policy.  
The Group aims to ensure that no employee is discriminated 
against, directly or indirectly, on the grounds of colour, race,  
ethnic and national origins, nationality (citizenship), sex, sexual 
orientation or gender, marital status, disability, religion or belief, 
being part time or on the grounds of age.
The Group recognises the importance of health and safety and the

colleges, work experience and placements are offered to a number

placements positive, challenging and relevant to participants’ 
current studies and their future job prospects.

up to 49,680,606 of its own ordinary shares either to be cancelled or retained as treasury shares. As at 24 February 2009 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of this report), the Company had not purchased any of its own ordinary shares in the market.
Directors will seek authority from shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for the Company to purchase, in the market,  
up to 50,485,606 of its own ordinary shares either to be cancelled or retained as treasury shares. The Directors will only use this power 
after careful consideration, taking into account the financial resources of the Company, the Company’s share price and future funding 
opportunities. The Directors will only purchase such shares after taking into account the effects on earnings per share and the interests  
of shareholders generally.
Research and development
Innovation is important to the future success of the Group and to the delivery of long term value to shareholders. The Group’s research 
and development expenditure is predominantly associated with computer and internet software systems. Successfully developed 
software is used to develop new products and to improve and extend the functionality and scope of the Group’s internet operations.

adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Financial Statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.

In accordance with Article 105 of the Company’s Articles of Association, each of Peter Plumb, Graham Donoghue and David Osborne will 
retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election at that meeting. Their biographical

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
The Group Financial Statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and the 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such Financial Statements that references in the relevant  
part of that Act to Financial Statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company Financial Statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and  
of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently. •	
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. •	
For the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU. •	
For the Company Financial Statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to  •	
any material departures disclosed and explained in the Company Financial Statements.
Prepare the Financial Statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company  •	
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and those regulations.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities pursuant to Disclosure and Transparency Rules 4.1.12
The Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
The Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accountancy standards, give a true and fair •	
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole.
The business review includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and •	
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
The names and functions of the Directors of the Company are set out on pages 34 and 35 of the Annual Report.
Internal control
The Corporate Governance Report and Audit Committee Report on pages 42 to 46 includes the Board’s assessment of the Group’s 
system of internal controls and consideration of the guidance issued by the Turnbull Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants  
of England and Wales.
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and consults with them on matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This ensures employees’ views can be taken into account in making 
decisions which are likely to affect their interests. Consultation is achieved through the Group’s intranet which was launched in 2008, 
regular team meetings and circulation to employees of results announcements and other corporate announcements. This also helps to  41 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
achieve a common awareness amongst employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the Group. 
This year, the Group launched formal bi-annual business performance updates for all employees and an employee forum through  
which nominated representatives ensure that employees’ views are taken into account regarding issues that are likely to affect them.  
An employee opinion survey process was also launched this year to ensure that employees are given a voice in the organisation and  
that the Group can take action based on employee feedback.
All employees are able to participate in the Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Share Incentive Plan which gives employees  
the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares in the Company using money deducted from their pre-tax salary on a monthly basis.  
This helps to encourage employee interest in the performance of the Group.
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity to all employees without discrimination and applies fair and equitable 
employment policies which seek to promote entry into and progression within the Group. Appointments are determined solely by 
application of job criteria, personal ability, behaviour and competency.
Disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for vacancies, with due regard to their skills and abilities. Procedures ensure 
that disabled employees are fairly treated in respect of training and career development. For those employees becoming disabled during 
the course of their employment, the Group is supportive so as to provide an opportunity for them to remain with the Group, wherever 
reasonably practicable. 
Further details of policies and initiatives are given in the Corporate Responsibility Report on page 36.
In the opinion of the Directors, all employee policies are deemed to be effective and in accordance with their intended aims.
Borrowings
The Group did not have any borrowings during the financial year ended 31 December 2008.
Financial risk management
It is the Group’s objective to manage its financial risk so as to minimise the adverse fluctuations in the financial markets on the Group’s 
profitability and cash flow. The specific policies for managing each of the Group’s main financial risk areas are detailed in note 17 to the 
Group Financial Statements on pages 70 and 71.
Political and charitable donations
During the financial year ended 31 December 2008, the Group did not make any political donations and made charitable donations of 
£24,482 (2007: £4,726).
Creditor payment policy
It is Group policy to agree terms and conditions for its business transactions with suppliers. Payment is made in accordance with  
these terms provided the supplier meets its obligations. The average number of trade creditor days outstanding for the Group at  
31 December 2008 was 49.5 days. The Company is a holding company and had no trade creditors at 31 December 2008.
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant  
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and each such Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information, and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.

re-appointment is contained in the notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will be put to shareholders at that meeting.

Annual Report 2008
Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Report 
The Board of Directors (‘Board’) of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (‘Company’) is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and supports the principles laid down in the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in June 2006  
by the Financial Reporting Council (‘Combined Code’). This Corporate Governance Report describes how the principles of the  
Combined Code are applied by the Company and reports on the Company’s compliance with the Combined Code’s provisions. 
The Board considers that the Company has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code throughout the year ended  
31 December 2008 and to 24 February 2009 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report) except as  
set out below. 
Board of Directors
The Board currently has eight members, comprising the Non-Executive Chairman, Gerald Corbett, two Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley, and five Executive Directors, Simon Nixon, Paul Doughty, Peter Plumb, Graham Donoghue 
and David Osborne. Michael Wemms has been designated as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. All of the Directors bring 
strong judgement to the Board’s deliberations. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors contribute external expertise and 
experience in areas of importance to the Group and they also contribute independent challenge and rigour to the Board’s deliberations. 
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2008, half of the Board excluding the Chairman, comprised Non-Executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent.
The Board considers that all the Directors are able to devote sufficient time to their duties as Directors. Biographies of the Board are set 
out on pages 34 and 35 including details of the significant commitments of the Chairman. The Board is satisfied that these appointments 
do not conflict with the Chairman’s ability to carry out his duties and responsibilities effectively for the Group. 
The Board considers that Gerald Corbett was independent on appointment as Chairman and considers Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley 
to be independent, being independent in character and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, 
or could appear to affect, their judgement. When determining the Chairman’s independence on appointment, the Board had regard to his 
share award (‘Share Award’). Under the Share Award, Gerald Corbett purchased ordinary shares in the Company on the listing of the 
Company on 31 July 2007 (‘Listing’) at £1.70 per ordinary share to the value of £200,000 and provided he completes three years’ service 
as Chairman of the Company from Listing and retains the ordinary shares he purchased on Listing during that three year period, he will  
be entitled to subscribe at nominal value for two times the number of ordinary shares he purchased on Listing. The Board believes that  
the number of ordinary shares subject to the Share Award is not sufficient to have an impact on his independence and thus concludes 
that the Chairman was independent on appointment. Shareholder approval was obtained prior to the entry by the Company into the  
Share Award.
To enable the Non-Executive Directors to more freely discuss the performance of the Group’s management, the Chairman meets with  
the Non-Executive Directors at least once each year without the Executive Directors present.
The Directors have direct and unrestricted access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. Both the appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary are matters for the Board as a whole. The Company Secretary is responsible for good information  
flow, ensures that Board procedures are followed and provides advice to the Board on corporate governance. Directors can, where they 
judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors, obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
Directors have the right to require that any concerns they may have are recorded in the appropriate Board or Committee minutes.
The practice of the Company is to appoint Non-Executive Directors for specified terms of three years, subject to a maximum of up  
to 12 months’ notice within that period and also subject to re-election and to Companies Act provisions relating to the removal of a 
Director. Each of the Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, currently holds a letter of appointment reflecting this.
The service agreements of each of Simon Nixon, Paul Doughty, Peter Plumb, Graham Donoghue and David Osborne provide for  
12 months’ notice to be given by either the Director or the Company.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that new Directors appointed by the Board must retire and submit themselves for  
re-election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. Each of Peter Plumb, Graham Donoghue  
and David Osborne were appointed by the Board after the 2008 Annual General Meeting and will offer themselves for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Company’s Articles of Association further require that all Directors must retire and submit 
themselves for re-election at least every three years. 
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are not combined, ensuring a clear division of responsibility at the head of the 
Company. The division of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is clearly established, set out in 
writing and has been approved by the Board.
All members of the Board take collective responsibility for the Group’s performance. The Board has a formal schedule of matters  
reserved to it for decision making and matters delegated to Committees of the Board which are available on the Group’s website  
at www.moneysupermarket.com. The Board determines the Group’s strategy; risk management policies; business plan and annual 
operating budget; acquisitions and disposals and other major investments and capital projects; accounting policies and changes thereto; 
dividend policy; shareholder communications; prosecution, defence or settlement of material litigation; remuneration policy; the terms of 
reference of Board committees; and Board structure, composition and succession. 43 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
Board members are given appropriate documentation in a timely manner in advance of each Board or Committee meeting. This normally 
includes a detailed report on current trading and full papers on matters where the Board or Committee will be required to make a decision 
or give its approval. Specific business related presentations are given when appropriate.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and approval each year by the Board of business plans and the annual budget.  
The Board receives reports on performance against the business plan and budget and reviews any significant variances each time it 
meets. This information enables business performance to be monitored, evaluated, discussed and challenged where necessary and 
enables informed, sound decisions to be made.
Save for matters reserved for decision making by the Board, the Executive Directors are responsible for the day-to-day running of  
the Group, carrying out the agreed strategy adopted by the Board and implementing specific Board decisions relating to the operation  
of the Group.
The Company provides Directors’ and officers’ insurance cover for the benefit of Directors in respect of claims arising in the performance 
of their duties.
Conflicts of interest
Following the changes made to the Company’s Articles of Association at the 2008 Annual General Meeting and the subsequent 
introduction of section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 on 1 October 2008 which gave boards the statutory power to authorise  
conflicts of interest, formal conflict management procedures have been prepared and approved by the Board. In the future, the 
Nomination Committee will be responsible for reviewing annually any conflict authorisations granted by the Board and will make 
recommendations to the Board as to their continuation, and any changes to any terms or conditions or other limitations which may  
have been applied. Conflicts were authorised in 2008 by the Board in compliance with the formal conflict management procedures.  
It is the Board’s intention to report annually on the Company’s procedures for ensuring that the Board’s powers of authorisation of 
conflicts are operated effectively and that the procedures have been followed.
Relationship Agreement
The majority shareholder of the Company is Simon Nixon. The Company and Simon Nixon entered into a relationship agreement on  
11 July 2007 to regulate the ongoing relationship between them (‘Relationship Agreement‘). The principal purpose of the Relationship 
Agreement is to ensure that the Company is capable of carrying on its business independently of Simon Nixon, and that transactions  
and relationships with Simon Nixon are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms.

Board and Committee attendance
The Board meets regularly to review the operation and performance of the Group. If and when required, meetings in addition to the 
scheduled meetings are held either in person or by telephone conference. The Board normally meets on at least eight occasions in each 
financial year.
The attendance record of the Directors at Board and Committee meetings during the financial year ended 31 December 2008 is set out in 
the following table:

Total number of meetings held      9 4 2 6
The Executive Directors of the Company may attend meetings of the Committees at the invitation of the Chairman of the  
respective Committee.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the workings of the Board and is not involved in day-to-day operational issues. He sets the 
agendas in consultation with the Executive Directors and Company Secretary. The Chairman periodically holds meetings with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors being present.
Performance reviews and Directors’ development
The Board has established a formal process for the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual 
Directors. Questionnaires were prepared which provided the framework for the evaluation process. Each Director completed the 
questionnaires commenting on the performance of the other Directors, the Board and each Committee and submitted the completed 
questionnaires for collation. Utilising the responses to the questionnaires, the Chairman has conducted interviews with each Director and 
assessed their individual performance. The Chairman has carried out an evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole and of 
each Committee and, led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the Non-Executive Directors have met and assessed the 
performance of the Chairman taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. The conclusions of those evaluations have been 
presented to the Board by the Chairman and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. The evaluation process is designed to cover 
Board processes, the structure and capability of the Board, strategic alignment, Board dynamics and the skills brought to the Board by 
each Director. 
The Chairman and Company Secretary are responsible for preparing and implementing an induction programme for Directors, 
including guidance as to their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the Company and business familiarisation.  
Business familiarisation involves Directors visiting the Company’s offices and giving the Directors the opportunity to meet the executive 
management team and other senior managers in the business. They also have the opportunity to discuss organisational, operational  
and administrative matters. Every Director has access to appropriate training as required following their appointment.
Shareholder relations
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining good relationships with shareholders. Senior executives, including the Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regularly meet with analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them informed  
of significant developments and to develop an understanding of their views which are reported back to the Board. Formal presentations  
are given to analysts and investors covering the full year and half year results. The Company Secretary deals with questions from  
individual shareholders.
The results and results presentations, together with all information reported to the market via the regulatory information service, press 
releases and other shareholder information, are published on the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com to be viewed and 
accessed by all shareholders.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, Michael Wemms, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve, or for which such  
contact is inappropriate.
All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and at all other times, by e-mailing 
or writing to the Company. The Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees will be available to answer questions at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Shareholders may also contact the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or, if more appropriate, 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director to raise any issue with one or all of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Company will prepare separate resolutions on each substantially separate issue at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.  
The result of the vote on each resolution will be published on the Group’s website after the Annual General Meeting and will be  
announced via the regulatory information service. 45 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system  
of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management are:
A comprehensive annual business planning and budgeting process, requiring Board approval, against which the Group’s actual •	
performance and any significant variances are reviewed by the Board.
A schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s approval to ensure it maintains control over appropriate strategic, financial, •	
organisational, compliance and capital investment issues.
An organisation structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority. •	
A clearly defined control policy and procedures for matters including appropriate authorisation levels. •	
An executive management team which has the responsibility for identifying and evaluating risks facing the Group and for putting  •	
in place procedures to manage and monitor those risks.
An annual two day strategy event to identify, evaluate and appropriately manage the key risks facing the Group using an external •	
independent facilitator.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives:
Reports from the external auditors in relation to the Financial Statements and the material financial reporting judgements contained  •	
in them.
Reports from the external auditors in relation to the system of internal control and the testing by the external auditors of that system. •	
The Audit Committee has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management during 
the financial year ended 31 December 2008. The Board considers that in the context of the control environment described above,  
the Group’s system of internal control and risk management is effective and satisfactory.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Directors consider that during the financial year ended 31 December 2008 and to 24 February 2009 (being the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of this report), the Company complied with the Combined Code except as follows:
A.3.2 – During the financial year ended 31 December 2008, at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, comprised Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. With effect from the appointment of Peter Plumb as an Executive Director on 1 January 2009 to succeed  
Simon Nixon as Chief Executive Officer, and the appointments of Graham Donoghue and David Osborne as Executive Directors on  
23 February 2009, at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, does not comprise Independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
Company has commenced the process, with the assistance of an external search company, to appoint additional Independent  
Non-Executive Directors.
B.2.1 – The Remuneration Committee comprises Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley, both of whom the Board has determined to be 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, and Gerald Corbett. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee does not currently comprise at 
least three Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Company has commenced the process, with the assistance of an external search 
company, to appoint additional Independent Non-Executive Directors. It is currently anticipated that at least one of the appointees will 
become a member of the Remuneration Committee.
C.3.1 – The Audit Committee comprises Rob Rowley and Michael Wemms, both of whom the Board has determined to be Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, and Gerald Corbett. Accordingly, the Audit Committee does not currently comprise at least three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company has commenced the process, with the assistance of an external search company, to appoint 
additional Independent Non-Executive Directors. It is currently anticipated that at least one of the appointees will become a member of the 
Audit Committee.
D.1.1 – As a result of regular feedback provided to the Board by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  
following their dialogue with major shareholders, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director believes he is aware of the views  
of major shareholders. Unless requested by major shareholders, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director does not attend 
meetings with them.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee presents a separate report in relation to the 
financial year ended 31 December 2008.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three Non-Executive Directors, 
Rob Rowley (Chairman of the Audit Committee), Gerald Corbett 
and Michael Wemms. Rob Rowley and Michael Wemms are 
considered by the Board to be independent. Gerald Corbett  
was considered by the Board to be independent on appointment. 
Biographies of the members of the Audit Committee are set out on 
pages 34 and 35. Rob Rowley is a qualified accountant and was 
formerly finance director of Reuters plc and chairman of the audit 
committee at Prudential plc. He is currently chairman of the audit 
committee at Liberty International plc. The Board is satisfied that 
Rob Rowley has recent and relevant financial experience.
Operation of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met on four occasions during the financial 
year ended 31 December 2008. Details of the attendance at Audit 
Committee meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance 
Report on page 44.
The Chief Financial Officer, together with the external auditors,  
will normally attend meetings at the invitation of the Chairman of  
the Audit Committee. At each Audit Committee meeting, the 
external auditors are invited by the Audit Committee to advise them 
of any matters which they consider should be brought to the Audit 
Committee’s attention without the Executive Directors present. 
 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit Committee. 
The members of the Audit Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. The external 
auditors may also request a meeting with the Audit Committee if  
they consider it necessary.
The Audit Committee’s duties include:
Reviewing the Group’s Financial Statements and the material •	
financial reporting judgements contained in them.
Reviewing the Group’s internal control and risk  •	
management systems.
Advising the Board on the appointment and removal of the •	
external auditors and the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors.
Developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the •	
external auditors to supply non-audit services. 
Considering the requirement for an internal audit function. •	
Reviewing the Group’s whistleblowing procedures. •	
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are published on the 
Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com and are available 
in hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
The Audit Committee undertakes its activities in line with an annual 
work plan. The Audit Committee agrees the scope of the audit 
work and discusses the results of the full year audit and half year 
review each year. 
In order that the Board is kept fully informed of the Audit 
Committee’s work, the Chairman of the Audit Committee reports 
on the Audit Committee’s work at the next Board meeting. The 
Board also receives a copy of the minutes of each meeting of the 
Audit Committee.
During the year, the Audit Committee approved a new formal 
whistleblowing procedure whereby employees may, in confidence, 
disclose issues or concerns about possible malpractice or 
wrongdoing by the Group or any of its employees without fear of 
reprisal. This includes arrangements to investigate such matters 
and for appropriate follow-up action.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal  
control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee monitors and undertakes an annual review  
of the effectiveness of, and the framework for, the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management. This includes annual 
consideration as to whether there is a need to establish an internal 
audit function.
The Audit Committee undertook a review of the effectiveness of, 
and the framework for, the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls during the year. The external auditors were engaged to 
review and test the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control and to assist the Audit Committee in its review of the 
effectiveness of that system. The Audit Committee received 
comprehensive reports from the external auditors at each Audit 
Committee meeting on the results and progress of this review and 
the tests undertaken by the external auditors.
During the financial year ended 31 December 2008, the Audit 
Committee considered the need to establish an internal audit 
function and concluded that the control systems are sufficient for 
the size and complexity of the Group such that an internal audit 
function is not required at this time. This will be reviewed in 2009.
Review of the work of the external auditors
Subject to the annual appointment of the external auditors  
by shareholders, the Audit Committee regularly reviews the 
relationship between the Group and the external auditors.  
This review includes an assessment of their performance,  
cost-effectiveness, objectivity and independence.
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate relationship is maintained between the Group and  
the external auditors. The Group has implemented a policy of 
controlling the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditors in order to maintain their independence and ensure that 
their objectivity and independence is safeguarded. This control is 
exercised by ensuring that all non-audit services are subject to the 
prior approval of the Audit Committee. During the year, the Audit 
Committee approved the appointment of other accountancy firms 
to provide non-audit services to the Group and anticipates that this 
will continue in 2009. 
The Audit Committee, having considered the external auditors’ 
performance during their period in office, recommends their 
re-appointment. A full breakdown of the audit and non-audit related 
fees is set out in note 5 to the Group Financial Statements on page 
64. The Audit Committee discussed the level of fees and 
considered them appropriate given the current size of the Group. 
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the level and scope of 
non-audit services undertaken by the external auditors does not 
impair their independence and objectivity.

Directors, Gerald Corbett (Chairman of the Nomination Committee), 
Michael Wemms and Rob Rowley. Rob Rowley and Michael 
Wemms are considered by the Board to be independent.

for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of 
the Board, considering the size, structure and composition of the 
Board and, where necessary, considering and recommending  
to the Board persons who are appropriate for appointment  
as Directors.
The Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board. The 
process involves the Nomination Committee interviewing suitable 
candidates who are proposed by either existing Board members or 
by an external search company. Careful consideration is given to 
ensure appointees have enough time available to devote to the role 
and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the 
Board is maintained. 
When dealing with the appointment of a successor to the 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director will  
chair the Nomination Committee instead of the Chairman.
When the Nomination Committee has identified a suitable 
candidate, the Chairman of the Nomination Committee will  
make a recommendation to the Board with the Board making  
the final decision.
During the year, the Nomination Committee reviewed the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board together with the 
size, structure and composition of the Board, and considered the 
appointment of additional Executive Directors of the Company 
including the appointment of a Chief Executive Officer to succeed 
Simon Nixon.

Resources Director may attend meetings of the Nomination 
Committee.

available in hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has written letters of 
appointment. Their respective letters of appointment set out their 
expected time commitment to the Company. Each of the Non-
Executive Directors has undertaken that they have sufficient time to 
meet what is expected of them.
In order that the Board is kept fully informed of the Nomination 
Committee’s work, the Chairman of the Nomination Committee 
reports on the Nomination Committee’s work at the next Board 
meeting. The Board also receives a copy of the minutes of each 
meeting of the Nomination Committee.

Determining awards under the Company’s share schemes. •	
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are published on the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com and  
are available in hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
Advisors
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from MM&K Limited, who are independent remuneration consultants,  
in connection with remuneration matters including market comparison salary benchmarking data and best practice, and the development 
of the Group’s performance related remuneration policy. MM&K Limited has no other connection or relationship with the Group. MM&K 
Limited provided no other services to the Group during the financial year ended 31 December 2008.
Remuneration policy and objectives
The remuneration policy with respect to the Executive Directors has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative  
to UK listed companies of similar size and scope.
The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration in a form and amount necessary 
to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of appropriate calibre and experience which is essential to the future success of the 
Group. The importance of aligning the interests of the Executive Directors with the creation of shareholder value over both the short term 
and long term is key to this objective. The Remuneration Committee believes that this requires:
The provision of mid-market base salaries with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance provided stretching •	
and demanding performance conditions are met.
A reward structure that places an appropriate emphasis on short term and long term performance to support operating performance •	
and to reward sustained longer term performance.
The Company believes that in order to meet its remuneration objectives, the remuneration of Executive Directors should comprise a 
balance between fixed and variable (performance related) pay elements with a significant proportion of potential total remuneration 
comprising performance related elements.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the remuneration policy to ensure it is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes  
in the Group’s business operations and environment, and recognises key developments in remuneration practice and alignment to 
shareholders’ interests. Consequently, the policy set out in this report has applied during 2008 and will apply in 2009. In determining the 
remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining base salary increases.  49 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
Components of remuneration
The potential components of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors consist of a number of separate elements, namely 
base salary, a performance related bonus, pension contributions, car allowance, Long Term Incentive Plan, Share Option Scheme and 
Share Incentive Plan. In addition, Paul Doughty is to participate in the Simon Nixon Scheme which is described further on page 50.
Base salary
The base salary positions the role and the individual fairly within a competitive market range derived from a peer group of UK listed 
companies. Salaries for the Executive Directors are reviewed annually to take account of market movement, individual contribution  
and increases elsewhere in the Group. 
Performance related bonus
Targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 2008 and were aligned to internal targets, strategic business 
objectives for 2008 and to shareholders’ interests. 
Target bonuses were payable for the achievement of performance measures based on adjusted EBITDA set at appropriately stretching 
levels combined with the achievement of certain objectives based on a balanced scorecard approach. Up to 125% of base salary for 
Simon Nixon and 100% of base salary for Paul Doughty were payable for the achievement of target performance. For the achievement  
of performance greater than target, the bonus amounts increased on a straight line basis according to a set formula. In the financial  
year ended 31 December 2008, Simon Nixon earned a bonus of 40% of base salary and Paul Doughty earned a bonus of 33% of  
base salary.
Following a review of incentive arrangements, the Remuneration Committee has decided that the same overall structure as applied in 
2008 should continue in 2009. Target bonuses will be paid for the achievement of performance measures based on adjusted EBITDA set 
at appropriately stretching levels combined with the achievement of certain objectives based on a balanced scorecard approach. Up to 
125% of base salary for Peter Plumb and 100% of base salary for each of Paul Doughty, Graham Donoghue and David Osborne will be 
payable for the achievement of target performance. For the achievement of performance greater than target, the bonus amounts will 
increase on a straight line basis according to a set formula. Simon Nixon will not participate in the Group’s performance related bonus 
scheme in 2009.
Pension contributions
The Company operates a contributory money purchase pension scheme for the benefit of the Executive Directors. In all cases, base 
salary only is pensionable. During the financial year ended 31 December 2008, the Company matched pension contributions up to 1%  
of base salary for the benefit of the Executive Directors. In 2009 the Company will match pension contributions up to 8% of base salary  
for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
Car allowance
In 2008, the Company provided a car allowance of £7,200 per annum for each of the Executive Directors. From 1 January 2009, the 
Company provides a car allowance of £14,000 per annum for each of the Executive Directors. The amount of the car allowance is 
reviewed annually.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Conditional free share awards are made by Appleby Trust (Jersey) Limited, as trustee of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust, following 
recommendations made by the Board. The levels of award and the performance conditions are recommended and reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee annually. The awards normally vest at the end of a three year period, subject to the achievement of the 
performance conditions and continued employment. Awards lapse to the extent that the performance conditions are not achieved. The 
maximum award that can be made to an employee in any financial year is the equivalent of 200% of an employee’s annual base salary, 
calculated on the basis of the market price of the Company’s shares at the date of grant.
In the financial year ended 31 December 2008, awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan were made to one employee of the Group and 
were made over shares worth 55% of that employee’s annual base salary. No awards were made to the Executive Directors in the year. 
For 100% of the award to vest, the Company must achieve at least 100% of its cumulative adjusted EBITDA target for the financial years 
2008 to 2010 (inclusive). Vesting starts at 50% of the award for achievement of 90% of the cumulative adjusted EBITDA target and 
increases on a straight line basis up to achievement of 100% of the target. No award will vest for performance below 90% of the target.
The Remuneration Committee chose a cumulative adjusted EBITDA target as the performance target for this award under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan as this measure is aligned to internal growth targets and shareholders’ interests. The Remuneration Committee will meet 
once the results for the three year plan period are available to ascertain whether the performance conditions have been satisfied as 
determined by the audited financial results of the Company and its subsidiaries for the financial years 2008 to 2010 (inclusive).
The Remuneration Committee has decided for 2009 to revise the performance targets of the Long Term Incentive Plan. As a result, 
performance targets will be based on a combination of an adjusted EBITDA target and total shareholder return relative to a selected peer 
group of companies. The Remuneration Committee has chosen this combination of targets to provide closer alignment of the Long Term 
Incentive Plan with underlying Group financial performance and shareholder interests. 50 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Share Option Scheme
Prior to the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007 (‘Listing’), the Group operated the Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited 
Share Option Scheme. All options under this scheme were granted prior to Listing and the Group does not intend to grant any further 
options under this scheme. The options vest over a three year period from the date of grant subject to continued employment and will 
lapse on the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the date of grant and the date the option holder ceases to be employed by the Group.  
There are no performance conditions applicable to this scheme as it is a historic scheme used prior to Listing principally as a means of 
retaining key employees. 
Share Incentive Plan
The Company’s HMRC approved all employee Share Incentive Plan provides all employees with the opportunity to purchase ordinary 
shares in the Company on a monthly basis using money deducted from their pre-tax salary.
Simon Nixon Scheme
As disclosed in the prospectus issued in connection with the Listing of the Company, Simon Nixon is to establish an additional incentive 
scheme under which he will personally grant options over 1,413,199 ordinary shares held by him in favour of Paul Doughty. One tranche  
of the options will vest on 31 July 2009 subject to Paul Doughty’s continued employment with the Group. The remaining tranche of the 
options will vest based on satisfaction of Group related performance targets and individual related performance targets for the financial 
year 2008 and for the first 6 months of 2009, subject to his continued employment with the Group. 
The purpose of this scheme is to further incentivise the achievement by Paul Doughty of exceptional performance and to align his interests 
with the interests of shareholders.
Service agreements
The current policy is for Executive Directors’ service agreement notice periods to be normally no longer than 12 months.
The service agreements of the current Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors include the

1. Executive Directors are appointed on 12 month rolling contracts.
Peter Plumb’s service agreement contains a temporary provision which states that, if his employment is terminated by the Company as a 
result of a change in control, wrongful dismissal or redundancy before 1 November 2011, he will be entitled to the sum of £225,000 less 
the market value of any shares received or receivable by him pursuant to his participation in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan and 
less any tax payable on such sum, in addition to his 12 month notice period. Thereafter Peter Plumb’s notice period will revert to the 
normal 12 months which reflects the Company’s general policy on such matters.
Subject to the above, there are no special provisions for Executive Directors or Non-Executive Directors with regard to compensation  
in the event of loss of office. In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being terminated, the Remuneration Committee 
would, having regard to the individual’s circumstances, pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individual’s duty to 
mitigate their loss.
The service agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office address.
Other appointments
Executive Directors may only accept outside appointments on external boards or committees with the prior approval of the Board.

addition to his directorship of companies in the Group, Peter Plumb is a director of The Naked Fruit Company Limited.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but instead have letters of appointment for a three year term. The current 
policy is for Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment notice periods to be normally no longer than 12 months. Each of the  
Non-Executive Directors currently has a letter of appointment reflecting this.
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors consists solely of fees. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and the remuneration of the other Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors. The Non-Executive 
Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, pension, share option or other incentive schemes.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of 
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
We have audited the Group and Company Financial Statements (the ‘Financial Statements’) of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (the 
‘Company’) for the period ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Company Balance 
Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes. These Financial Statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the Company Financial Statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities on page 40.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view, and whether the Financial Statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial Statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report 
includes that specific information presented in the Financial and Business Review that is cross referred from the business review  
section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to 
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Financial Statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements, and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial Statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
1 Corporate information
The Group Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (“Company”), a company incorporated in England, and its 
subsidiaries for the period ended 31 December 2008 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on  
24 February 2009. The Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 75 to 79.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements represent 
the six months and nine days ended 31 December 2007. The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the 
Directors deem appropriate, given the Group’s positive cash position and lack of debt.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the  
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ  
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that 
have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described 
in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes:
Notes 3 and 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment •	
Note 13  revenue recognition •	
Note 13 provision for doubtful debts •	
Note 14 accruals •	
Note 18 share-based payments •	
Basis of consolidation
These Group Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Group Financial Statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Foreign currency
The Group Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. The functional 
currency of the foreign operation Icero GmbH is the euro. The income and expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at 
an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred. The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into 
sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date. The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a 
separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the 
exchange rate at that date. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue
Internet business
The Group generates fees from internet lead generation (click based revenue), commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through 
a variety of contractual arrangements. The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is 
generated. Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer. Advertising revenue is 
recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Intermediary business
Commissions are recognised on completed transactions in the period that a transaction completes.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment. 59 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use. The estimated useful 
lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment (including IT equipment)  3 years
Fixtures and fittings  5 years
Office equipment  5 years
The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method. The excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is recognised in the 
balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for 
impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All the Group’s intangible 
assets (other than goodwill) have been identified as having finite useful lives. As such, they are amortised on a straight line basis over their 
useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The 
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at each financial year 
end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Income Statement in the expense category 
consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Market-related 10 years
Customer relationships  7 years
Customer lists  3 years
Technology  3 years
Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services,  
for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer 
relationships. For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately. Relationships with 
high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the 
reputation of the brand. Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented 
technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less 
costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the 
Income Statement when incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in SIC 32. Expenditure that 
does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Income Statement. 60 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Financial Statements
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Cash Flow Statement.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows certain Group employees to acquire shares of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC; these awards  
are granted by Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking 
into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Income Statement as the 
related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
Net finance income
Net finance income comprises interest payable and interest receivable, which are recognised in the Income Statement as they accrue 
using the effective interest method.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in 
which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; 
the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of 
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised.
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the prior period as 30% of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which were generated 
upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in 
future periods. At the prior period end, this liability was revalued at the enacted corporation tax rate of 28%, this being the rate at which 
the liability will unwind. This liability will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit 
recognised in the Income Statement in accordance with IAS 12.
Group management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits •	
for other stakeholders; and
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. •	 61 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2008
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in  
the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital all 
components of equity are taken into account, i.e. share capital and retained earnings and reserves (where applicable).
The Group manages its cash balances by depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk. The Group has no 
debt as at 31 December 2008 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements; management of capital therefore focuses 
around its ability to generate cash from its operations. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the 
amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The Group 
believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a 
position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Accounting standards issued but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 31 December 2008 
but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group:
IFRS 8 – Operating Segments ○ introduces the ‘management approach’ to segmental reporting. IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory  
for the Group’s 2009 Financial Statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly 
reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources  
to them. Currently the Group presents segment information on a business and geographical segment basis (see note 4). The Group 
expects to present its segmental reporting on a different basis in the future.
IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes ○ addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer 
loyalty programmes for their customers. It relates to customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits for 
awards such as free or discounted goods or services. IFRIC 13, which becomes mandatory for the Group’s 2009 Financial Statements, 
is not expected to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 – Presentation Of Financial Statements ○ requires presentation of all non-owner changes in equity either in  
a single statement of comprehensive equity, or in an income statement plus a statement of comprehensive equity. The amended 
standard, which will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 with earlier adoption permitted, will 
require a change in the presentation of the Group’s Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs ○ requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, 
construction, or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset, removing the option to recognise the costs as an 
expense. The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The Group currently holds no 
borrowings, so the standard is expected to have no impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 – Cost Of An Investment In A Subsidiary ○ requires changes to the accounting for a non-
controlling interest in and the loss of control of a subsidiary. The amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on  
or after 1 July 2009, and apply retrospectively, except in certain circumstances, are not expected to have any impact on the Group 
Financial Statements.
Amendment to IFRS 2 – Share Based Payments: Vesting Conditions And Cancellations ○ changes the definition of vesting 
conditions within IFRS 2 to clarify that vesting conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions, with other 
conditions considered non-vesting. Under the amendment, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in measuring the grant date fair 
value of the share based payment and there is no true-up of equity-settled arrangements for differences between expected and actual 
outcomes. Therefore if all vesting conditions are met, then the entity will recognise the grant date fair value of the equity-settled share 
based payment as a compensation cost, even if the counterparty does not become entitled to the share based payment due to a failure to 
meet a non-vesting condition. The amendment applies retrospectively to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, with earlier 
application permitted. The Group does not expect the amendment to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 – Presentation Of Financial Statements ○ provides 
exemptions from the requirement to classify as a liability financial instruments under which an entity has an unavoidable obligation  
to deliver cash. The exemptions apply to two categories only of instruments issued by an entity, being puttable financial instruments,  
or an instrument or components of instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to another party a pro rata share of  
the net assets of the entity only on liquidation. The amendments set out detailed definitions and circumstances that must be met  
before these exemptions are available. The amendments to IAS 32 lead to consequential amendments to IAS 1, IFRS 7 and IFRIC 2. 
The amendments to IAS 32 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, with earlier adoption permitted.  
The Group does not currently hold any financial instruments falling within the scope of the amendment, and therefore does not  
expect the amendment to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition And Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items ○ addresses the two 
situations where the IASB considered that diversity existed or was likely to exist, being the designation of one-sided risk in a hedged 
item, and the designation of inflation in a financial hedged item. The amendment does not replace existing guidance, but simply 
provides additional application guidance to clarify the existing principles in relation to what items can qualify for hedge accounting, 
assessing hedge effectiveness and designating financial items as hedged items. The amendment is effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2009, and is not expected to have any impact on the Group Financial Statements.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the European 
Union and require adoption by the Group in future accounting periods. 62 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

The fair value adjustments to intangible fixed assets represent the fair values calculated by an independent third party as attributable to 
the Group’s marketing related intangible assets, customer relationships, customer lists and technology. The deferred tax liability 
represents the tax effect which will result from the amortisation of the intangible assets, calculated at 30% of their fair value. The deferred 
tax asset and trade payables adjustment represent the recognition of the tax effect of share based payments. 
The goodwill recognised on the acquisition is attributable mainly to the skills and technical talent of the acquired business’ workforce and 
expectations of the Group’s future performance.
The total cash element of the acquisition was £164,765,000 and comprised a cash payment and costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition. £162,000,000 was paid to acquire 40% of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and there were £2,765,000  
of costs associated with the acquisition.
At the same time, shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, representing 15% of share capital, with fair value of 
£60,750,000 were exchanged as part of the acquisition.
Subsequently, the 45,500 Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited shares owned by Simon Nixon were exchanged for 85,498 B 
ordinary shares in Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC. As this was a transaction between parties under common control, it is outside of 
the scope of IFRS 3 and the shares have been recorded at book value at the date of transaction.

The consideration has resulted in the recognition of a merger reserve for 15% of the fair value of assets acquired of £60,750,000, a merger 
reserve of £16,923,000 for 45% of the book value transferred from a company under common control, and a revaluation reserve of 
£65,345,000 representing 45% of the fair value of the intangible assets transferred from a company under common control. Subsequent 
to the impairment of goodwill discussed in note 12, £36,300,000 of these reserves has been released to retained earnings.

From the date of acquisition, Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited contributed £18,869,000 to the net profit of the Group 
during 2007.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of 2007, the profit for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2007 would have 
been £17,406,000 and revenue from continuing operations would have been £162,882,000.

therefore been estimated at 28.5%.
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses arising from the results of a foreign subsidiary of £1,185,000 (2007: £477,000). A deferred tax asset has not  
been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and they have  
arisen in a foreign subsidiary that may not make a profit in the immediate future.  66 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period attributable to ordinary equity holders of the 
Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

The amortisation charge for the period is included within administrative expenses in the Income Statement.
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the 
intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for 
these assets. Since the goodwill and intangibles have historically constituted approximately 90% of the Group’s net assets balance, the 
Group has tended to use its quoted market price to provide assurance over the value, or indicate impairment of, its assets. At the balance 
sheet date and prior to any impairment, the market capitalisation of the Group represented 92% of the total carrying value of the goodwill 
and intangible assets (2007: market capitalisation exceeded carrying value by 70%). Whilst not directly comparable, the quoted market 
price acts as an indicator of impairment, and in light of this, the Group has performed a thorough assessment during the period to 
consider whether its non-current assets are impaired.
Impairment testing of goodwill
On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. Given 
the worsening economic conditions and the turmoil in the credit and wider financial markets, the impairment testing has been performed 
on the following basis.
For the current period, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the 
cash flows taken from the Group’s forecasts as detailed below.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group has one significant cash generating unit (CGU), the internet segment, to which all of  
the goodwill has been allocated. The segment is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.  
The present value of its future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions applied:
Cash flows for year 1 represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2008, and are based upon the •	
Group’s approved budget for 2009. The main assumptions underlying the 2009 budget relate to visitor numbers and revenue per 
transaction/visitor. The budget reflects the general downturn in the consumer economy and expected lower levels of credit available to 
consumers and lower levels of discretionary expenditure in general.
Subsequent cash flows for future years assume 0% growth in earnings from those forecast for 2009. Management believe this reflects •	
the tightening of lending criteria, withdrawal of products by providers, and the general downturn in the economy. No reliable third party 
estimates of long term growth rates exist given it is a relatively new business model.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated in the calculations. •	
A pre-tax discount rate of 16% has been used in the forecast. This reflects the increased risk and uncertainty inherent in the current •	
economic climate, the lack of confidence with which the near future can be forecast, and the additional risks specific to the Group  
and the industry in which it operates.
When the economy begins to recover a different set of assumptions may be more appropriate. 68 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Impairment testing of goodwill
The analysis performed calculates the value in use of the internet segment as £237.2m, indicating that the segment’s assets are impaired 
as follows:
        £000
Value in use of internet segment        237,249
Representing: 
Carrying value of tangible non-current assets        (13,596)
Carrying value of other intangible non-current assets        (168,688)
Implied book value of goodwill        54,965
Carrying value of goodwill        (124,965)
Impairment of goodwill        (70,000)
An impairment loss of £70.0m has been recognised in the year and therefore there is no difference between the carrying amount  
and recoverable amount of the goodwill balance as at the balance sheet date. An increase of 1% in the discount rate, with all other 
assumptions held constant, would give rise to an additional impairment charge of £14.5m. A decrease of 1% in the value of cash flows 
generated, with all other assumptions held constant, would give rise to an additional impairment charge of £2.4m. 
Impairment testing of other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment
For impairment testing purposes, all of the Group’s intangible, and other non-current, assets are also assigned to the internet segment. 
With reference to the testing described above, the value in use of £237.2m assigned to the internet segment indicates that neither the 
other intangible, nor other non-current, assets are impaired. At an individual level, management believe that the assumptions relating to 
each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives.

17 Financial instruments
Interest rate risk
There is no significant exposure to interest risk as the Group has no borrowings.
The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK and Irish banks. Interest earned therefore closely follows 
movements in Bank of England base rates. A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in annual pre-tax profit of £735,000 
based on Group cash, cash equivalents and financial instruments at 31 December 2008. At the balance sheet date, £31,542,000 was 
invested with Bank of Scotland, this being the most invested with any one bank. 71 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Cash and cash equivalents     2.84% 73,465 6.07% 54,015
Credit risk
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is monitored on an ongoing basis by the credit control team and finance management. By 
value, over 90% (2007: 90%) of the Group’s revenue comes from blue chip companies. Most of the remaining provider base is subject to 
payment terms of one week collected by direct debits. At the balance sheet date, the five largest trade receivables, by provider, accounted 
for 19% (2007: 16%) of the total trade receivables balance of £16,074,000 (2007: £19,906,000) and the largest individual balance was 
£986,817 (2007: £618,147).
Fair values
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are principally short term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially different from 
their carrying value.
18 Share-based payments
Unapproved option scheme
Grant 1
On 22 May 2007 the holders of unapproved options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited agreed to have their unapproved 
options replaced with options in the Company on similar terms to those that operated under the original scheme. Options over 1,460 
shares were originally exchanged. Following the share sub-division on 9 July 2007 where each ordinary share was converted to 5,000 
ordinary shares, the shares under option were subject to a similar sub-division. Following this, there were therefore 7,300,000 options in 
issue that related to the options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, exchanged for options in the Company.
These options were originally issued in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited on 9 May 2005 and vested on the earlier  
of a trade sale or a flotation provided that in the event of a flotation the options had been held for three years. The exercise price is  
6p per share.
Grant 2
On 18 and 22 June 2007 the Company issued further unapproved options that entitled key management personnel and senior employees 
to acquire shares in the Company. Options were originally granted over 1,243 shares, which following the sub-division referred to above, 
became 6,215,000 shares.
Options vest on the earlier of a trade sale or, subject to a flotation, equally over a three year period on subsequent anniversaries from the 
date of issue. The exercise price is 6p per share.
Grant 3
Post the sub-division of shares referred to above, on 10 and 21 July 2007 the Company issued further unapproved options that entitled 
key management personnel and senior employees to acquire shares in the Company. Options were originally granted over 105,000 
shares. Options vest on the earlier of a trade sale or, subject to a flotation, equally over a three year period on subsequent anniversaries 
from the date of issue. The exercise price is 6p per share.
Share Incentive Plan scheme (SIP)
Upon listing, the Company granted £3,000 of ordinary shares at the price of £1.70 to each eligible employee free of charge. If an employee 
leaves within one year of listing, all of these ordinary shares are forfeit; between one and two years of listing, 50% are forfeit; between two 
and three years of listing, 20% are forfeit; and after three years of listing, none are forfeit. 948,184 shares were issued under the Share 
Incentive Plan scheme in 2007.
Long Term Incentive Plan scheme (LTIP)
On 28 December 2007, the Company made awards under the Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan for  
senior employees.
Under the plan, shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the achievement of a cumulative adjusted EBITDA figure for 
the three financial years from 2008 to 2010.
During the year, a further 36,643 share options were granted under the scheme. 72 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Chairman’s share award
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman of the Company, purchased 117,647 ordinary shares on the listing of the Company at the initial offer price of 
£1.70. Subject to him retaining these shares for three years and provided that he completes three years’ service as Chairman he shall be 
entitled to subscribe at nominal value for twice the number of shares he purchased on the listing.
Simon Nixon Scheme
During the year, Simon Nixon established an additional incentive scheme under which he personally granted options over 633,504 
ordinary shares in the Company held by him in favour of one former employee of the Group. Options over 487,311 ordinary shares vested 
on 8 October 2008 and were exercised by the former employee on that date. Options over the remaining 146,193 ordinary shares were 
dependent on the satisfaction of Group related performance targets for the year ended 31 December 2008 and have lapsed. Shares 
transferred under the scheme upon the vesting and exercise of the options were funded by Simon Nixon personally. It is anticipated that 
similar arrangements will be established in the future for Paul Doughty and certain other employees or former employees.

The Group provides office space and services to Abacus Permanent Limited and Virtual Processing Limited, companies in which  
Simon Nixon controls over 90% of the voting shares. The Group recharges these two companies rent and associated services at the 
same levels as it recharges wholly owned subsidiary companies. These rates are based on notional open market rents for similar offices  
in the locality. In addition the Group provides payroll services for these related companies, fully recovering salaries paid. In the normal 
course of trade with these related companies the Group both charges and is charged for mortgage procuration fees. The level of these 
fees is at arm’s length and mirrors the going rates in the open market.

Icero GmbH  – – 2,017 663
The minority interest share of the loss for the period was £118,500. No liability has been recognised in the balance sheet, as there is no 
requirement for the minority interest to fund their share of the losses.
On 6 September 2007, Tim Heidfeld was appointed a Director of Icero GmbH, a company that was at that time a wholly owned  
subsidiary of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. On 27 December 2007, Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited 
entered into a shareholder’s agreement with Tim Heidfeld pursuant to which Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited transferred 
to Tim Heidfeld 10% of the shares of Icero GmbH in consideration for the payment by Tim Heidfeld to Moneysupermarket.com Financial 
Group Limited of €2,500. The shareholder’s agreement includes a contractual obligation on Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited to acquire all the shares in Icero GmbH held by Tim Heidfeld during the period 2010 to 2012 in predetermined tranches. The 
consideration to be paid by Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited for the acquisition of the shares in Icero GmbH held by  
Tim Heidfeld will be determined by the financial performance of Icero GmbH during the financial years 2009 to 2011. No liability has been 
recognised at the balance sheet date, as the consideration to be paid cannot be reliably measured. The contingent consideration will be 
recognised when payment becomes probable. According to the shareholder’s agreement, the maximum consideration that can be paid 
by Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited to Tim Heidfeld for the acquisition of his 10% shareholding in Icero GmbH is 
€12,500,000. For the achievement by Icero GmbH of financial performance less than the target financial performance, the consideration 
payable by Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited to Tim Heidfeld for the acquisition of the shares held by him in Icero GmbH is 
determined by a formula set out in the shareholder’s agreement. 
On 25 April 2008, Rob Budden was appointed a Director of Foom.com Limited. On that date, Rob Budden subscribed for 40 ordinary 
shares of £1 each in the capital of Foom.com Limited, representing 20% of the issued share capital of Foom.com Limited. On that date, 
Rob Budden entered into a shareholder’s agreement with Making Millionaires Limited regulating their relationship as shareholders in 
Foom.com Limited.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The profit after tax for 
the Company was £2,190,000.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS1 5(a) and consequently no cash flow statement is presented for the Company.
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows certain employees of the Group to acquire shares in the Company. The fair value of options granted is 
recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using 
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as 
an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving 
the threshold for vesting. Subsidiaries are recharged for the amount recognised as share based payments relating to awards for their 
employees. The fair value of the recharge is recognised over the vesting period.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the Company’s 
shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the shareholders’ right to receive 
payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
2 Share-based payments
The analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in the Group Financial Statements in note 18.
3 Staff numbers and cost

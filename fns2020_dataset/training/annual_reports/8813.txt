revenue, contract wins and geographical spread. 
Operating in growing markets, it is a top five 
player in the global independent ground and cargo 
handling sector with over 100 stations worldwide.

business with around 30% of the newspaper and 
magazine wholesale distribution market in the UK, 
and has a record of investment in innovation and 
customer service delivery.
Both divisions operate in distinct B2B sectors where 
success depends on providing an efficient, high 
quality, time critical service to their customers and 
partners.  Our Business Divisions

Menzies Distribution
1 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 “ John Menzies is a strong, profitable company, and both 
its divisions are leaders within their respective markets. 
Menzies Aviation has excellent growth potential and 
Menzies Distribution remains highly cash generative.”  
WILLIAM THOMSON, CHAIRMAN
Chairman’s Statement
Results
2006 has been a year of contrast for the Group. 
Menzies Aviation delivered another year of record growth, 
delivering a third consecutive year of 25% or more growth 
in profits. This market leading performance is a credit to 
the excellent team we have at Aviation. The division is on a 
strong growth curve and I look forward to further substantial 
progress through organic and acquisitive expansion.
Menzies Distribution has experienced tough trading conditions 
which impacted on profitability. This division however remains 
a strong cash generative business, and management actions 
in repositioning and adapting to a rapidly changing market 
continue.
At Group level, underlying profit before taxation decreased  
by 9%.
Dividend
To reflect the confidence your Board has in the future 
performance of the Group, your Board is recommending  
a final dividend of 14.4p per share, making a full year dividend  
of 20.5p – an increase of 5%.
Board
Patrick Macdonald is to step down from his role as Chief 
Executive with effect from 20 March. Over the last four years 
he has transformed and developed the Company to a point 
where the new management teams and operating disciplines 
which he has put in place are now sufficiently robust to 
implement successfully the key strategic goals set by the 
Group Board for the divisions. Today’s reorganisation marks 
a further logical step in the development of the Company. 
I would sincerely like to thank Patrick for his significant 
contribution in making the business what it is today. I am 
delighted he will remain available to us until the end of April.  
I wish him all continued success in the future.
 
As a result of this change Craig Smyth, Managing Director, 
Menzies Aviation, and Ellis Watson, Managing Director,  
Menzies Distribution, join the Board. They will continue to  
be responsible for running their respective divisions each  
with their own Operating Boards. Paul Dollman, Group Finance 
Director, assumes responsibility for the Corporate Head Office 
and will sit on both Operating Boards. Paul, Craig and Ellis will 
all report to me.
As I previewed in my statement last year, Octavia Morley 
joined your Board in April and after 11 years’ valuable service, 
Michael Walker left your Board in May. An evaluation of the 
Board, which was extended to its committees, was carried  
out last year and, based on the results of that process, I remain 
confident that the composition of the Board is appropriately 
balanced and structured to meet the ambitions and challenges 
of our business.
Staff
The performance of the Group during the last year reflects  
the resilience and strength of our staff. It is their dedication 
and commitment that stands this Group apart from its peers, 
and I wish to express my gratitude to them.
Pension Fund
I am pleased to report that the Pension Fund was returned to 
surplus at the year end. Paul Dollman, Group Finance Director, 
who is chairman of the Trustees, will be stepping down from 
this role at the end of the month, handing over to Professor 
Ian Percy who is independent. This reflects best practice in 
Pension Fund governance.
John M. Menzies
We were all greatly saddened when our Life President  
and former Chairman died last month. He chaired the 
Company for 46 years until 1997 and was a pivotal figure  
in transforming the way the Company was run, particularly  
the news distribution operations. He provided leadership  
and vision, and played an instrumental role in determining  
the strategic direction of the Group. He will be sorely missed 
by all those who knew and worked for him.

Strategy
Looking forward both businesses will continue to focus on 
customer service, innovation and tight financial discipline.  
They both have clear strategies.
The key priorities of Menzies Aviation are:
Organic growth at existing stations, by maintaining  
a strong focus on delivering great service at the right  
price while keeping costs lean.
Organic growth by opening new stations to achieve 
network density in key regional markets.
Acquisitive growth to accelerate our achievement  
of network density.
Developing and exploiting cross-sell and key account 
opportunities across the network.
Maximising our position in this high-growth sector.
The key priorities of Menzies Distribution are:
Accelerating our programme to remodel the cost base  
and protect the strong cash generation of the business.
Strengthening our clear No2 market position by working 
more closely with our retailer and publisher customers to 
benefit the consumer.
Developing innovative new products, services and revenue 
streams.
A relentless focus on improving customer service, 
productivity and operational excellence.
Prospects
John Menzies is a strong, profitable company, and both  
its divisions are leaders within their respective markets. 
Menzies Aviation has excellent growth potential and  
Menzies Distribution remains highly cash generative.
I am confident that the medium-term outlook for the Group  
is positive.

Chief Executive’s Review
Overview
During 2006 a strong performance from Menzies Aviation 
was insufficient to offset tough market conditions in Menzies 
Distribution.
Menzies Aviation delivered strong profit growth for the third 
consecutive year, despite experiencing softer markets in cargo 
in the second half of the year. This market leading set of results 
justifies the Board’s increasing confidence in this business.  
We continued to build the business in 2006 through a balanced 
mix of organic and acquisitive growth. Across the network we 
won a net 28 new contracts. We completed 8 acquisitions in 
North America, Europe and Australia. We also announced a very 
exciting joint venture which will start operations at two airports 
in India in 2008.
Despite taking significant and rapid action to reduce costs,  
trading at Menzies Distribution was adversely affected by 
changing consumer habits and preferences. We believe these 
changes are structural and partly driven by the proliferation 
of new digital choices available to consumers. These include 
broadband internet, MP3 players, multi-channel TV, electronic 
games, etc. We have seen the most impact on monthly magazines 
and partworks. We are investing in new technology to raise 
productivity, including automated magazine packing and returns 
processing systems. We have also strengthened our clear No2 
position in the sector with two acquisitions.
Strategy
I am pleased that the table below shows how we have delivered 
against our stated objectives for 2006. A further review of each 
division and their developments can be found on pages 6 to 20. 
“ Over the last four years and through a period of significant 
market change, John Menzies has become a much more 
dynamic and robust business. Each division’s strategy is 
clear and their leadership teams are now ready to take full 
responsibility for operational delivery.”

Businesses
3. Grow from Strength
What we set out to do in 2006:
4 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 5 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 4 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 5 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006
Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information We have been following our three-step strategy for some time: 
1 Get the Basics Right; 2 Build Scaleable Businesses; 3 Grow from 
Strength.
Menzies Aviation has clearly benefited from this strategy and 
is now building confidently from strength as it targets further 
acquisitive and organic growth.
Menzies Distribution remains a strong, cash generative business 
and is repositioning and adapting to the structural changes in  
its market, principally by focusing relentlessly on the cost base. 
I am confident they are both well positioned to prosper.
People
Our business relies 365 days a year on our people, who work 
through all hours and conditions to deliver a world class service 
to our customers. I would like to thank them for their innovation, 
integrity and commitment. This is what differentiates us from  
our competitors. Without them, we have no business.
To support our dedicated staff, we have developed and rolled 
out a new Leadership Training programme across both operating 
divisions. The programme has successfully raised leadership 
performance levels and has been well received within the 
businesses.
The two strong divisional leadership teams are key to the future 
success of the Group. Craig Smyth and Ellis Watson are actively 
developing their management teams to ensure we continue to 
build the businesses and adapt to changing market conditions  
– to be leaders rather than followers of market change. In 
particular, we have strengthened the management structure  
in Menzies Aviation to support the continuing high growth  
rates the business anticipates delivering in the future.
Looking ahead
I remain very positive about the growth prospects for  
Menzies Aviation as it focuses on growing quality earnings.  
We have developed a business model differentiated from  
the competition with a series of innovative products we  
are uniquely capable of delivering across our network.
In a market that continues to be tough, I am confident that 
the measures being implemented to reduce cost and improve 
productivity at a much higher rate in Menzies Distribution will 
make it leaner and fitter for the future. 
We announced, just before the year end, our all-Ireland  
joint venture with Eason & Son Limited, conditional on certain 
regulatory and other approvals. This exciting venture will put  
us in a position to work with publishers and retailers alike to 
extend our service offering. 
Over the last four years and through a period of significant 
market change, John Menzies has become a much more dynamic 
and robust business. Menzies Aviation is delivering on its high 
growth potential internationally while Menzies Distribution is 
repositioning and adapting to a rapidly changing market with 
speed and energy. I am proud of the achievements of the strong 
teams we have built at both divisions. Each division’s strategy 
is clear and their leadership teams are now ready to take full 
responsibility for operational delivery.

as completing eight acquisitions. We have successfully turned

Cash flow and investment
As expected, as we increased investment in both 
divisions, free cash flow was down £21.0m to £3.2m. 
In addition, Menzies Aviation invested £27.8m in eight 
acquisitions during the year and at Menzies Distribution, 
we acquired two independent UK wholesalers for £9.2m.
The Group further strengthened its pension fund  
during 2006 with an additional payment of £5.7m 
over and above the regular pension payment of £5.4m, 
making a total contribution of £11.1m. Overall, the 
pension fund ended 2006 with a small IAS19 surplus.
The Group’s net debt at the end of 2006 was £77.0m.
Exceptional items
Profit before tax and basic earnings per share reflect a 
number of exceptional items, with a net gain of £3.0m.
The exceptional gains comprise a £5.8m benefit from 
a change to the calculation of pension liability accruals 
and a £2.5m gain from the sale of an investment in an 
independent wholesaler. The exceptional costs comprise 
£3.1m of spend relating to the integration of acquisitions 
and to rationalisation at Menzies Aviation, and £2.2m  
of rationalisation costs at Menzies Distribution.

Performance in 2006
Menzies Aviation had another excellent year. Growth in 
revenue and underlying operating profit has been driven by  
a combination of contract wins, with net gains of 28 contracts, 
geographic expansion, particularly in Spain, and acquisitions.

Case Study: Operational excellence
One of the challenges resulting from the rapid growth of Menzies Aviation has been to quickly integrate new businesses 
into the network while maintaining service consistency. The COMPLETE programme is designed to meet that challenge 
by establishing a framework of business principles and performance metrics in order to drive operational excellence and 
standardise business processes and working practices. As the business continues to develop COMPLETE will help ensure 
that customers receive the same standards of service delivery wherever we operate.
One of our customers is a major European airline for which we provide a mix of ground and cargo handling services  
at 10 locations in Western Europe, North America and Africa . They had this to say about us:
“ Over the years we have continued to be impressed by Menzies’ commitment  
and service levels. Their on-the-ground teams are well trained and they are supported  
by good equipment, quality IT and commercially-minded account managers.”

a cargo handler in North America, total cargo tonnes were  
up 41%.
We also experienced some foreign exchange pressures during 
2006, especially with the weaker US dollar. 
In order to ensure a strong infrastructure to support further 
expansion, we invested in additional people and systems, 
particularly within the central commercial and network 
standards functions and at regional management level.
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 
EMEA continues to be our most profitable region. Further 
progress was made with contract wins including easyJet at 
Belfast and VLM at London City. At AMI, our wholesale freight 
forwarding business, profitability was significantly improved 
driven by cost reduction and revenue gains. The UK and 
Netherlands cargo businesses remained broadly flat despite 
weaker volumes and the loss of Emirates in the UK.
We made three acquisitions:- Malmo Main Air Cargo AB, which 
establishes our first presence in Scandinavia; Top Service SRL, 
a passenger services provider at Romania’s second airport, 
Timisoara; and Express Baggage (Heathrow) Limited, a provider 
of luggage repatriation services to major airlines at Heathrow 
and five regional locations across the UK. These acquisitions 
have been successfully integrated and trading has been in  
line with our expectations.
We have expanded geographically, particularly in Spain, 
where, in a joint venture with Ferrovial, we have won ground 
handling licences at six airports and have secured a number of 
important contracts including Ryanair, easyJet and Lufthansa.
Americas
We made significant progress in our underlying USA ground

• delivering synergies
• developing a multi service product offering.
We made two acquisitions in Australia during 2006:-  
Perth Cargo Centre Pty Limited, a cargo handling business;  
and Australian Airsupport Pty Limited, a ground handling 
business in Brisbane. Together with our existing businesses  
in Melbourne and Sydney, we now have operations in each  
of the four key Australian gateways.
We secured two exclusive ten year joint venture contracts  
for cargo handling at the new Hyderabad and Bangalore 
airports which are being built as part of India’s airport  
renewal programme. These are scheduled to commence 
operations in 2008.

Business objectives
Menzies Aviation has five key priorities:
Organic growth at existing stations, by maintaining  
a strong focus on delivering great service at the right  
price while keeping costs lean.
Organic growth by opening new stations to achieve 
network density in key regional markets.
Acquisitive growth to accelerate our achievement  
of network density.
Developing and exploiting cross-sell and key account 
opportunities across the network.
Maximising our position in this high-growth sector. 
We will continue to invest in supporting the infrastructure  
to underpin growth and ensure delivery of consistent levels  
of service.

1.  The acquisition of Aeroground Inc which operates from 9 locations  
in North America early last year increased the volume of cargo we 
handled in this region by over 400,000 tonnes.
2.   We extended our geographical footprint to Scandinavia when we 
purchased Malmo Main Air Cargo AB in Sweden, which has handled  
over 20,000 tonnes since September. 
3.  The addition of Perth Cargo Centre Pty Ltd to our Australasia network

Case Study: Investment
The new HS magazine packing technology being installed in a number of our branches is a semi automated, 
multi-title horizontal picking line. The software-driven system greatly increases efficiency and accuracy of 
planning and picking/packing ensuring on-time and accurate delivery to customers.
In September last year, www.i-Menzies.com was launched allowing our retailer customers to access account 
information at their convenience and submit changes to their orders online – providing greater flexibility and 
saving customers both time and money. Enhancements are planned to provide still greater functionality.
“ The ease of access along with time and cost saved on telephone calls to my supplying branch 
has been the biggest benefit. Added to this, being able to view and print my paperwork and 
change orders online has made the service a real asset in managing my business.”

sales fell by 35%. Although gross profit from weekly magazine 
sales was flat, lfl sales rose by 3% as some consumers moved 
from monthly to weekly titles.
Newspaper volumes continued their steady decline but 
this reduction was offset by a number of price increases, 
particularly on Sunday titles.
The contract renewal process for magazines and newspapers  
is now substantially complete and we are pleased that  
we have secured this business on five year contracts.  
As anticipated, this has resulted in some margin reduction.
Stickers performed well due to World Cup 2006 and the

Underlying operating profit

 for the division fell by 23%

Acquisitions and joint ventures
Menzies Distribution acquired two independent newspaper 
and magazine wholesalers during the year – Chester 
Independent Wholesale Newsagents Limited and North West 
Wholesale News Limited. The operational integration of these 
businesses was successfully completed during 2006 and this 
has reinforced our position as the No2 in the marketplace.
Just before the year end we entered into a conditional joint 
venture agreement with Eason & Son Ltd (Eason). The deal  
is subject to certain regulatory and other approvals. The joint 
venture will see Menzies and Eason combine their newspaper 
and magazine distribution businesses in Northern Ireland and 
the Republic of Ireland. We expect the venture to start during

Menzies Distribution (continued)
Following the development of a new integrated system ‘i-Mag’, 
we have successfully centralised our magazine allocation 
function from branches into the Edinburgh Head Office. This 
has delivered cost efficiencies and, through better controls, 
has led to higher compliance with customer service metrics.
3) Branch network reconfiguration
The new magazine packing systems have enabled us to further 
re-engineer our branch configuration and extend our ‘hub and 
spoke’ network, whereby the smaller ‘spoke’ branches only 
perform newspaper packing with magazine packing managed 
from the larger ‘hub’. Successful ‘hub/spoke’ implementations 
comprised Cambuslang/Dumfries and Chester/Preston.
Office of Fair Trading
The OFT has recently announced that there will be a further 
delay to issuing a final opinion on a framework for assessing 
how newspaper and magazine agreements comply with 
competition law. During 2006, we significantly strengthened 
our position as the No2 player in the market and remain 
confident that we can meet the changing service requirements 
of the industry.
Cost initiatives
We have invested in our cost reduction programme during  
the year and this helped deliver cost savings in real terms of 
£2.7m during 2006, up from £1.1m in 2005. This programme 
has concentrated on 3 areas:
1) Shop floor productivity
New magazine packing systems have been installed at our 
york, Chester, Leeds, Dundee and Cambuslang branches and 
we have successfully trialled new equipment for processing 
returns at our Dundee branch.
Our Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) programme has 
been an important tool for management in seeking further 
efficiencies in the cost base, aiding the delivery of significant 
cost savings in 2006.
2) Centralisation of functions
We have set up a new regional contact centre in Sheffield 
which covers almost 6,000 customers and has delivered 
significant cost savings.
delivering a world class  
level of customer service
Case Study: Customer service
In 2006, we worked closely with Sainsbury’s to implement and roll out across 132 Menzies-served stores a  
new web-based magazine returns management system. The system involves the use of handheld Personal Digital 
Assistants which scan barcodes to capture data about each title such as its issue information, on sale and recall 
dates. The system automates the manual process of checking if a magazine is due for returning to Menzies or  
can remain on sale, helping to ensure Sainsbury’s don’t lose money on potential late returns. 
“ We are really happy with the expertise and commitment Menzies provided when we 
introduced the technology into our stores, and remain very satisfied with the ongoing 
magazine scanning service they provide using the PDAs in our stores.” 
Phil Carroll, Senior Buyer – Newspapers & Magazines, Sainsbury’s

Strengthening our clear No2 market position by working 
more closely with our retailer and publisher customers  
to benefit the consumer.
Developing innovative new products, services and

productivity and operational excellence. 
To remodel the cost base, we will roll out new equipment for 
processing returns at fifteen branches in 2007. Our continuous 
process improvement (CPI) programme will continue with the 
emphasis on productivity measures and benchmarking. We 
plan to centralise our newspaper allocations function once 
our new system, ‘i-News’, has been implemented. A second 
contact centre at Linwood is scheduled for opening in the

With effect from 1 May 2006, the main UK pension scheme 
changed from a final pensionable salary scheme to an average 
salary scheme and employee contributions were increased. 
Benefits accrued to current active members prior to 1 May 2006 
are now linked to future price inflation rather than future 
salary increases. The impact of these changes was a reduction 
of £5.8m in the present value of the scheme liabilities in 
respect of past service.
During the year the Group contributed cash of £11.1m, 
comprising regular payments of £5.4m and an additional 
payment of £5.7m in June 2006. Subsequent to the year end,  
a further additional payment of £4.3m was made. The market 
value of invested assets increased by 14% in the year to 30 
December 2006, mainly as a result of strong investment 
growth in the equity component of the assets.
The present value of scheme liabilities decreased by 10%  
over the same period, mainly as a result of an increase in  
the corporate bond rate from 4.8% in 2005 to 5.3% in 2006.

Underlying operating profit    36.9
The results for the year include the following one-off  
and/or material items, which the Group considers should  
be highlighted:
(a) the past service pension credit results from changes  
to the main UK pension scheme, which have been 
explained above;
(b) the Group transferred its 20% shareholding in an 
independent distribution business to another wholesaler 
in return for an interest in certain magazine distribution 
contracts in the south-west London area, generating  
a non-cash gain of £2.5m;
(c) the rationalisation costs result from an in-depth review 
of existing business costs, comprising asset write-downs 
and staff costs, and the integration costs relate to new 
businesses, mainly in the US; 
(d) under IFRS, previously capitalised goodwill is no longer 
amortised. However, these results include an impairment 
charge of £1.8m, reflecting the remaining life of the current 
licence at Menzies Macau Aviation Services Ltd;
(e) IFRS requires the price paid for a business to be allocated 
between goodwill and other intangible assets. Accordingly, 
the Group has a new category of fixed asset in 2006 and 
the amortisation charge for the year has been highlighted 
as a new cost;
(f) IFRS operating profit is shown after deducting the Group’s 
share of the tax charge in the joint ventures and associates 
but is added back in this table to present a clearer trading

Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Business Review:
Group Financial Review (continued)
Other finance income is the net financial return from the 
pension scheme under IAS19. The amount has increased due 
to the additional cash contributed by the Group during 2006 
and the higher returns on invested assets.
Taxation
The effective underlying tax rate for the year was 23.2% 
compared with 23.6% in 2005 and is analysed as:
    %
Tax due at UK rate    30.0
Non tax-deductible items    1.3
Unrelieved overseas losses    4.9
Overseas rate impact    0.2
Utilisation of tax losses    (4.5)
Adjustments in respect of prior years    (8.7)
Underlying tax rate    23.2
The tax rate on underlying earnings continues to be below the 
standard UK rate as a result of the realisation of carry-forward 
overseas tax losses, the creation of overseas deferred tax 
assets on brought-forward losses and the resolution of prior 
year matters.
Tax paid during the year was £8.5m. Payments are expected  
to be slightly lower than this for the year to December 2007.
The tax effect of the exceptional items is a charge of £1.1m. 
Goodwill and other intangible asset amortisation of £2.2m 
does not attract any tax relief. 
Acquisitions and Intangible Assets
During the year the Group acquired ten new businesses.  
The consideration paid, in excess of the fair value of the net 
assets acquired, has been allocated between goodwill and 
other intangible assets, mainly customer contracts.
Capitalised goodwill amounts to £48.5m compared to £38m  
in 2005. This goodwill is no longer amortised but rather is 
subject to an annual impairment review. 
Contracts capitalised in the year amount to £20.5m. 
Amortisation periods for these contracts are business-stream 
dependent and vary from zero to ten years. Where the 
contracts are not amortised, they are subject to an annual 
impairment test at cash-generating unit level, generally 
considered to be ‘station’ level.
Property, plant and equipment 
Purchases of property, plant and equipment totalled:
   Plant & 
  Property Equipment Total 
   £m £m £m
Distribution   0.4 9.1 9.5
Aviation   0.4 15.5 15.9
  0.8 24.6 25.4
During the year Distribution invested some £9m in new 
technology.
Aviation’s capital expenditure mainly comprised equipment  
to service new contracts. 
Working Capital
Working capital movement is analysed as follows:
  2006  2005 
  £m  £m
Inventories  1.0   (1.9)
Trade and other receivables  0.4  (3.2)
Trade and other payables  (13.7)  0.9
  (12.3)  (4.2)
The negative movement in working capital is all due to trade 
and other payables. This was mainly a combination of the 
timing of the year-end, the effect of acquisitions and foreign 
exchange rate movements. 
Treasury operations
From a Treasury perspective the main financial risks faced  
by the Group are liquidity, interest rate fluctuations and 
foreign exchange exposures. The Board has approved policies 
for each of these risks, which are managed on a day-to-day 
basis by Group Treasury. The purpose of these policies, which 
remained unchanged throughout the year, is to ensure that 
adequate funds are available to the Group at all times and 
that financial risks arising from the Group’s operating and 
investment activities are carefully managed. Accordingly, 
Group policy is not to enter into transactions of a speculative 
nature. 
The Group Treasurer reports formally on a monthly basis to 
a Treasury Committee under the chairmanship of the Group 
Finance Director and operates within scope and authorisation 
levels specified by the Board.
Liquidity: operations are financed by a mixture of shareholders’ 
funds and bank borrowings. The objective is to ensure a mix 
of funding methods offering flexibility and cost effectiveness 
to match the needs of the Group. Surplus cash is currently

substantial institutions with high credit ratings. In addition 
to its fully drawn down term loans of £31.1m the Group 
has £42.5m of unutilised committed facilities, which are 
committed to November 2009. 
Interest rate fluctuations: the Group’s policy is to arrange  
core debt with fixed rate borrowings. The term bank loan of 
£31.1m is fixed at 6.23% and is repayable between 2007 and 
2020. Foreign currency bank borrowings totalling £36.6m are 
floating at rates ranging from 4.28% to 5.875%, which mature 
within the next 34 months. Other borrowings and cash 
deposits are at variable rates.
Foreign exchange exposures: the Group’s exposure to 
currency risk at a transactional level is minimal, with day-to-
day transactions of overseas subsidiaries largely carried out  
in local currency.
The Group’s exposure to balance sheet translation risk in 
respect of its overseas net investments is minimised by 
borrowings in the functional currency of the investment  
and by use of derivative financial instruments, which have  
the effect of converting sterling borrowings into borrowings  
of the functional currency.
Approximately 13% of Group turnover and 45% of assets 
are denominated in overseas currencies. The Group does not 
actively hedge exchange rate movements on the translation 
of overseas profits except where those profits are effectively 
matched by foreign currency interest costs.
The majority of Menzies Aviation’s stations are located  
outside the UK and operate in currencies other than sterling. 
The rates of exchange to sterling for those currencies which 
have principally affected the Group’s results were:
 
 Average  Average 
 for year to Year end for year to  Year end 
 December  30 December December 31 December 
 2006 2006 2005 2005
US$ 1.853 1.957 1.824 1.717
Euro 1.468 1.484 1.462 1.455
Credit risk: the Group is exposed to credit related losses in 
the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial 
instruments, but mitigates such risk through its policy of 
selecting only counterparties with high credit ratings.
Further disclosure in respect of the above is included in  
Note 16 to the Accounts.
The management of the business and the execution  
of strategy are subject to a number of risks.
Risks are formally reviewed by each division on an annual 
basis. A formal Group-wide review of risks is also performed 
annually by the main Board and appropriate processes and 
controls are put in place to monitor and mitigate these risks. 
The key business risks affecting the Group are as follows:
Safety
This is the risk of safety incidents occurring within the 
business. Both divisions have dedicated health and safety 
teams who regularly visit operational sites monitoring health 
and safety issues and driving improvements. They also 
monitor legislative and regulatory changes. We work with 
industry bodies to lead improvements and to benchmark our 
performance. Monthly health and safety reports are tabled  
at divisional and main Boards.
Changing business environment
This is the risk that we do not respond to a changing business 
environment. In Menzies Distribution, 2006 saw a significant 
change to consumer behaviour which adversely impacted 
monthly magazine and partwork sales. At Menzies Aviation, 
there was a tightening of security measures in the UK during 
the year, particularly relating to on-flight baggage. A strategy 
review exercise, which involves a full examination of market 
conditions, is held each year prior to budget setting. Board 
reports from each Managing Director, reviewing all aspects 
of market conditions, are tabled for discussion each month. 
Customer surveys have been introduced in both divisions 
which we will repeat regularly.

We are trading ahead of last year despite the continuing 
softness in cargo volumes and the weaker US dollar.  
We expect to see further growth in 2007.
We have won a number of contracts since the year end, most 
notably British Airways ground and cargo handling in Sydney; 
Virgin cargo handling in Chicago; Lufthansa ground handling 
in Houston; and easyJet ground handling at London Gatwick, 
Glasgow and East Midlands.
Our joint venture to handle cargo at the new Hyderabad and

newspaper and magazine revenues have been flat in the first 
10 weeks of 2007. As previously indicated, we have accelerated 
cost saving initiatives and we expect to deliver further cost 
savings in real terms in excess of £3m in 2007.
Group
We expect the Group to trade in line with our expectations 
during 2007. As the Group continues to move towards the 
higher rated aviation services market, we believe we are  
well placed to increase shareholder value.

Investment decisions
This is the risk of making the wrong corporate portfolio 
investment decisions. A weekly investment review meeting  
is held to review significant capital expenditure decisions and 
all acquisitions and disposals. Projects are measured against  
a number of strict financial criteria such as payback, net 
present value and internal rate of return. Recommendations 
from the investment review meetings must be ratified by the 
main Board. All potential acquisitions are subject to rigorous 
due diligence involving internal and external specialists.
People development
This is the risk that we do not successfully develop our people 
and lose key management. To mitigate this risk, the Group has 
introduced a leadership development programme and a regular 
360° appraisal process. A number of incentive schemes linked 
to the Group’s results have been designed to help retain key 
managers.
External shock
This is the risk of the business being impacted by a major 
external shock, such as terrorism, disease or natural disaster. 
To mitigate this risk, we have emergency response procedures 
in place at both divisions which deal with communication 
guidelines, customer liaison, staff safety, contingency actions 
and escalation procedures. In each division we have developed 
strong leadership teams with broad experience of dealing with 
a wide variety of operational issues.

The principal ESG risks to the Group include:
failure to retain and develop key staff; 
failure to provide safe systems of work for staff;
failure to have systems in place that prevent the 
occurrence of environmental hazards arising from  
our operations;
failure to manage risks that can damage corporate  
image and reputation; 
failure to ensure that the Group’s operations are  
conducted on a lawful, sound and ethical basis and  
in compliance with Group Policies and Procedures;
failure to carry out adequate due diligence or business 
planning on joint venture partners/acquisitions.
A description of the Company’s internal control system  
for the management particularly of financial risks is in the 
Corporate Governance report on pages 30 to 34. An analysis 
of the key business risks facing the Group appears in the 
Business Review on pages 19 to 20. 
 
Although the remuneration of executives is not directly 
related to attainment of ESG objectives, our bonus 
arrangements allow senior managers to base a proportion  
of performance related pay for executives on achieving 
personal goals such as improving staff turnover rates or 
improving injury or aircraft incident rates. These flexible 
arrangements apply to station managers at Aviation and 
branch managers at Distribution.

Introduction
Environmental, social and governance responsibility is 
fundamental to the ongoing success of the Group. 
We acknowledge the impact our business activities have  
on the environment and communities in which we operate, 
and have systems in place to identify, analyse and manage key 
risks arising from our operations. This includes ensuring that 
we comply with relevant environmental legislation. 
We recognise that as an employer we have a responsibility 
to our employees for their safety and welfare whilst at work. 
This responsibility extends to their training and development, 
as well as to setting appropriate standards for their dealings 
with customers and suppliers. We take business conduct 
seriously, and have policies and guidelines in place which set 
standards concerning ethics, sound business practices and 
wider governance issues.
Board responsibility and management framework
The Board member with overall responsibility for environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) risks is the Chief Executive, 
supported by the two divisional Managing Directors. This 
responsibility also specifically includes employees and health 
and safety. Significant ESG issues arising in or affecting our 
businesses are discussed at each Board meeting. 
The Company recognises that being a socially responsible 
company adds to and enhances the Company’s overall value, 
both short and long term. For example, mishandled ESG 
risks can be damaging to the Company’s reputation as an 
employer, supplier or business partner. The financial costs from 
mishandled ESG risks can affect the Company’s profitability. 
The Board therefore has systems in place, including access 
to adequate information, to identify and assess ESG risks, 
and to ensure that these risks, and our exposure to them, are 
managed appropriately.

together to set policy, agree standard operational procedures 
and communicate regular safety awareness information to  
the field organisation. 
With operations in over 100 airports worldwide, our priority 
has been to standardise safety processes over the past  
year. One key feature of MORSE is that it incorporates an 
intranet-based network reporting and investigation system  
for the recording of all incidents, including near misses,  
to UK standards with follow-up action taken so that lessons  
are learned and shared. Additionally, a new Incident Review 
Board chaired by the Managing Director meets quarterly  
to review major (category A) incidents, shifting the  
emphasis on prevention rather than cure.
MORSE has been rolled out to the new businesses we acquired 
during 2006 and is now part of standard operating procedures 
across our global network.
Menzies Distribution
The most common types of injuries in this business are those 
sustained from manual handling, slips and trips, and moving 
objects. 
During the year, the division adopted stage 1 of the MORSE 
system developed by Menzies Aviation and a poster campaign 
was launched in all our branches, covering: vehicle safety, 
separating transport and people activities, accident reporting, 
protective equipment and manual handling.
The division has over the years greatly improved its vehicle 
movement practices, separating workplace vehicle movements 
from people movements, and has significantly reduced 
the opportunity for accidents. Our practices were highly 
commended in 2005 by the Freight Transport Association  
and the Health & Safety Executive. 
Our ‘pack-by-light’ newspaper allocation system has enabled 
standardisation of pack sizes, reducing our exposure to lifting 
injuries.
In terms of motor and vehicle related incidents, Distribution 
continually keeps its fleet under review to ensure that the 
most appropriate vehicles are used, for driving/training 
purposes, loading/unloading and accessing routes for making 
deliveries. Consideration is also given to environmental impact 
when choosing fleet suppliers.
All staff receive health and safety training relevant to the tasks 
they perform. CD based training materials are also available, 
including our driver training programme which covers safety  
as well as advanced driving skills to maximise fuel savings. 
Health and Safety
Introduction
Good health and safety practices are integral both to employee 
welfare and to the success of the Group. We are continually 
reviewing our procedures and our training in order to develop 
and adopt methods of working which reduce the likelihood  
of accidents occurring. 
 
Both divisions operate in a time critical environment: 
newspaper deliveries work to a tight schedule, with any 
delay losing sales for ourselves and our customers. Ground 
handling operations focus on aircraft, where any slip can delay 
departure or damage a customer’s aircraft.
Reports on health and safety performance are the first 
operating item at all meetings of the Group Board, the 
Executive Committee, and at Divisional Board meetings.  
They include injury statistics and trends as well as lessons 
learned, training performance, contacts with regulators  
and legislative changes.
The Group’s health and safety policy statement, which is 
published on our website, focuses on establishing a suitable 
environment, providing proper training, and communication 
and consultation with employees.
Each division has a specialist health and safety manager,  
who is supported by local management. 
 
Following the success of our first ever Group-wide health  
and safety conference in 2005, this event was repeated  
last year, with all our health and safety managers attending, 
sharing best practice, as well as their practical solutions to  
the everyday problems they experience worldwide. 
Menzies Aviation
The division has a comprehensive safety management 
programme called MORSE (Menzies Operating Responsibly 
Safely and Effectively), which focuses on:
Personal Injury.
Aircraft Damages.
Damage to Equipment.
Emergency Response.
Security Awareness.
Avoiding the Cost of Carelessness.
The MORSE safety management system and network safety 
team provides a dedicated resource within each region to 
support the field organisation and ensure we maintain a 
strong safety compliance focus. The network team works

Recruitment and Equal Opportunities
The Board expects the Group to conduct its operations 
based on sound ethical practices which are open and free 
from discrimination and harassment, and will not tolerate 
discrimination in any form. It has adopted and disseminated 
appropriate policies and procedures, including clear  
guidelines on matters such as competition law, bribery  
and whistleblowing. 
The principles of equal opportunities are recognised through 
published employment policies which are designed to attract, 
retain and motivate quality staff and to give full consideration 
to the employment of disabled people and to staff who become 
disabled, including providing support and retraining to enable 
them to continue their employment. Full consideration is also 
given to age discrimination laws, and our policies and practices 
encourage recruitment and promotion based on merit, 
irrespective of factors such as: age, gender, race, religious 
beliefs or sexual orientation. 
Reward
The Group recognises that its continuing success depends  
on the quality and motivation of its employees. It aims to 
ensure that its remuneration practices are competitive, 
enabling it to attract, retain and motivate executives who  
have the experience, skills and talents to operate and develop 
its businesses to their maximum potential. 
Incentives
Employees are able to develop a direct interest in the financial 
performance of the Group through its savings-related share 
option scheme, which is open to all UK employees, of whom 
some 1,400 are members. Options are granted over the 
Company’s shares at a discount of 20% from the prevailing 
market price at the time of grant at an aggregate value based 
on savings of up to £250 per month over three years. Some 
800 employees (57% of those eligible to participate) took up 
their invitation and subscribed to the 2006 sharesave scheme 
in which some 500,000 shares are now held under option.
Injury and incident reporting
Both divisions utilise key performance measures to monitor 
trends and to improve our performance in this area. However, 
our two divisions operate in very different sectors, so comparing 
injury or incident statistics between them or overall figures 
against figures published by comparator companies would  
be meaningless. 
Menzies Aviation had 29 (2005: 27) injuries reportable under 
UK RIDDOR with an equivalent rate per 100 FTE employees 
of 1.2. This compares to a rate of 1.8 in the HSE’s transport 
sector. 
Menzies Distribution had 62 (2005: 50) incidents during the 
year that resulted in injuries reportable under UK RIDDOR, 
which is equivalent to an injury rate per 100 FTE employees  
of 1.62 – again below the HSE’s transport sector figure of 1.8. 
The total figure includes the two businesses we acquired 
earlier last year. 
In respect of Menzies Aviation’s overseas operations, there is 
no comparable UK RIDDOR, as each country where it operates 
has different reporting requirements. However, under the 
MORSE incident reporting system, all injuries are reported 
under different categories depending on seriousness, where 
category A would be for the most serious incidents. 
Category A level is not the same as UK RIDDOR, but it  
includes major/serious incidents involving fatality, serious 
harm, dangerous occurrence or aircraft damage, including 
significant misses. 
To provide some context, there were 76 category A incidents 
altogether reported during 2006 (2005: 69), including, 
regrettably, one fatality following a serious accident where 
an employee fell between the Elevated Transfer Vehicle 
and adjoining cargo pallets. Of the 76 incidents, 45 involved 
aircraft damage and 31 involved personal injury. This total 
of 31 includes injuries reported under UK RIDDOR that were 
serious enough to be classed under MORSE as being category 
A incidents.
Another significant figure that we monitor is number of 
incidents involving aircraft damage per 1,000 turns handled, 
which is an industry recognised measure. In 2006, our incident 
rate per 1,000 aircraft turns for category A aircraft damage  
was 0.10 (2005: 0.12) which compares against an IATA 
published benchmark figure of 0.67 and IAHA’s figure  
for 2006 of 0.15 per 1,000 turns.

(continued)
The results of the Group-wide survey carried out in the 
second half of 2005, involving all 14,800 employees, was 
communicated to staff early in 2006. Staff feedback and  
the action points identified by management were shared  
with employees through video broadcasts, location visits  
by management and briefings by local managers.
Environment
Environmental Policy
The Board acknowledges its responsibilities for ensuring that 
environmental risks arising from the activities of its businesses 
are properly identified, managed and controlled, and that its 
businesses are compliant with all local laws, as well as with 
best practice – the latter where it is practicable.
Each of our two divisions has its own environmental 
policy, which has been approved by the divisional boards 
and is integrated within existing management structures 
and implemented through normal business practices and 
procedures.
These environmental policies address the following areas:
allocating roles, responsibilities and resources; 
complying with legislation and best practice;
monitoring, verification and auditing of compliance;
data collection, analysis and reporting;
risk identification, assessment and management;
communication and dissemination of information; 
adopting technology and working practices that are 
modern, environmentally friendly and energy efficient;
working with customers and suppliers to address 
environmental issues affecting our businesses.
At Group level, environmental issues affecting the  
businesses are reported by each Managing Director to the 
Executive Committee and by the Chief Executive to the  
Board. Environmental risks associated with new businesses  
are always assessed as part of our due diligence process  
on all acquisitions. Our operating procedures are reviewed 
following reporting of any significant actual or near miss 
incidents involving safety issues or environmental hazards. 
Operational management also have to certify periodically 
compliance with local environmental regulations. There  
were no incidents last year which posed a significant 
environmental risk to the Group’s operations, and systems  
are in place to prevent their occurrence. These systems  
are reviewed periodically.

For staff in the UK, the Group offers many benefits. One 
programme introduced last year through “you-at-work” 
entitles employees to benefit from various discounts. Another 
scheme allows staff to opt to receive part of their pay in 
tax-free childcare vouchers. Other benefits offered to staff, 
dependent on grade and location, include: private medical care, 
subsidised staff restaurant, gym membership, and a company 
car or car allowance.
Training 
All executives and managers, from the Chief Executive 
downwards, undergo annual Personal Development Plan 
assessments. Leadership Development Programmes were 
introduced in September 2006, together with trials of 
pilot schemes for the introduction of one-to-one coaching 
programmes. 
All new employees are given induction training designed to 
ensure that they can fulfil their tasks safely, particularly where 
this involves lifting. All the Group’s commercial vehicle drivers 
are given driver training designed to help them to drive safely, 
economically and with consideration to those around them. 
Each division has resources made available to it to ensure the 
training needs of its staff carrying out particular functions and 
tasks are fully met.
Managers are also encouraged to foster a work-based culture 
based on values espoused as part of a campaign launched in 
2005, promoting and providing guidance on ethical business 
practices and professional conduct concerning dealings with 
all our stakeholder groups such as customers, suppliers and of 
course employees. These “Integrity Guidelines” are supported 
by Board policies and reinforced in workshops and for example 
through our employee communication programme.
Communication and Consultation
A comprehensive internal communication programme 
exists to ensure that all employees throughout the Group 
are kept informed about the direction and performance of 
their own division and of the Group as a whole. The Group’s 
final and interim results are communicated to all employees, 
supplemented by presentations being made during location 
visits by the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, or 
divisional management.

Menzies Aviation 
The division operates various vehicles in connection with  
its activities. Typically, these are on and off airport activities 
and include: bussing, trucking (cargo between airports) and  
air freight couriering by AMI.
The on airport activities involve use of specialist Ground 
Servicing Equipment (“GSE”) for both our ground and cargo 
handling businesses. Other than passenger steps and baggage 
or cargo carts (“dollies”), which need to be towed, most 
GSE can be driven and run on diesel or LPG. These include: 
hydraulic loaders, aircraft push back tugs, conveyor belt 
loaders, and tow tractors which pull passenger steps and 
dollies. This equipment is not designed to travel long distances 
so the mileage is low. 
We also operate a fleet of forklift trucks for warehouse  
activity in our cargo handling operations. Of these forklift 
trucks, 84% run on LPG. As an estimate, our cargo handling 
operations at Manchester airport in the UK (a typical station) 
produced 10 tonnes of CO 2 emissions in 2006. If replicated 
across our stations with cargo handling operations, this 
equates to 480 tonnes of CO 2 in total for this part of our 
business. Our ground handling operations worldwide are 
estimated to have produced 440 tonnes of CO 2 emissions  
in total last year.
Our “Connect” bussing operation at London Heathrow  
has a fleet of 68 single deck passenger buses that transport 
some 20,000 workers daily to and from off airport sites to the 
airport, including Terminal 5 construction workers. This service 
is under contract to BAA who supply our buses with fuel. 
Accordingly, these figures and associated CO 2 emission levels 
are disclosable for CSR purposes by BAA. For information, 
however, the volume of CO 2 emitted from this operation  
in 2006 was 3,250 tonnes. 
Our UK trucking operation involves a fleet of twenty 38 tonne 
articulated units with trailers which transport cargo between 
airports, mainly in the UK and Ireland. Total mileage for 2006 
was c. 2,200,000 miles, equivalent to 2,700 tonnes of CO 2 
emission (including those for AMI – see below). The division 
also has trucking operations in the USA and in Sweden, most 
of which are provided through subcontractors. Estimated CO 2 
emissions from these operations total c. 1,170 tonnes.
 
AMI’s business consists of mainly forwarder handling and 
courier and air freight wholesaling. The transfer of freight  
and courier packages to and from airports is handled by our  
UK trucking operations.

Menzies Distribution
The business operates 437 vehicles ranging from transit 
vans to 26 tonne articulated commercial vehicles. 47% of our 
fleet are transit vans. A further 1,147 vehicles are operated 
by contractors in the newspaper and magazine distribution 
process. Our fleet comprises diesel only vehicles and is 
supplied by 6 suppliers, the largest being Ford who supplies 
47% of our fleet on a leased basis. Lease terms typically run 
for between 3 and 5 years, so we operate a modern fleet.  
All new additions to our fleet since January 2007 run on  
Euro IV engines.
Third party contractors carry out some 66% of our delivery 
mileage. The same focus on costs and health and safety, 
which influences Distribution’s own choice of vehicles, affects 
its choice of subcontractor. Those who can optimise delivery 
mileages and have modern, well-maintained vehicles that are 
most suitable for the task are selected.
 
Fuel cost is a significant overhead in our Distribution business 
and we have over the years looked at ways to minimise this: 
for example, by looking at the way we plan our delivery routes 
and run patterns, and also investing in driver training. These 
initiatives have been a success – both have received industry 
recognition and awards.

(continued)
For magazines, we are responsible for cleansing the unsold 
copies of polythene wrapping and cover mounted gifts where 
this is required to facilitate the subsequent de-inking process. 
Thereafter we manage a logistics service to consolidate 
unsold copy from all of our branches, primarily feeding into 
UPM Shotton for conversion into future newsprint. All unsold 
magazine products which are not required for re-sale are 
consigned for paper recycling. In 2006, some 60,000 tonnes  
of unsold magazines were processed for recycling. 
 
The division also handles unsolds of other products such as 
collectible partworks and sticker collections. These are sent 
back to publishers for subsequent reuse. 
 
The waste elements stripped from magazines to cleanse 
pre recycling are currently consigned to landfill. Menzies 
Distribution is active in industry initiatives aimed at reducing 
the volumes of such material to landfill and supporting 
initiatives to increase consumer awareness of the magazine 
recycling opportunity. 
Waste
At Menzies Distribution, packaging waste, namely cardboard 
and polythene, and office paper are by-products of our 
activities. We have waste compactors installed in 17 hub 
branches. The total volume of waste uplifted in 2006 was 
5,460 tonnes (2005: 3,466 tonnes) of which 11% (2005: 0.3%) 
is recycled and the remainder sent to landfill.
In terms of unsold or “returned” products handled, under 
our contracts with newspaper and magazine publishers, we 
are responsible for the collection of unsold copies from retail 
outlets. For magazine publishers, we are further responsible 
for recycling unsold magazines, whereas newspaper publishers 
retain the responsibility for managing the flow to recycling  
of unsold newspaper copies. 
Newspaper publishers outsource the physical uplift and 
recycling from our premises via third party agents with whom 
we work closely to integrate an efficient transition from 
our processes to their collection. In 2006, we facilitated the 
consignment to recycling of 104,000 tonnes of newsprint.
 
Case Study:
Charitable giving
“ Like ourselves our JV partner, Menzies Aviation, truly believes that we can make a 
difference helping young, poor children overcome their disadvantages in life from 
neglect and abuse through a better education, proper diet and health care. Our joint 
sponsorship of the San Miguel Parish School, which has properly equipped classrooms, 
a library, chapel and dining, computing and sports facilities, has helped give more than 
300 children in Lima a better start in life. Menzies’ generous financial sponsorship over 
the years has helped make this possible.”

Community Investment
The Group employs more than 15,000 people in 23 countries 
all around the world, many of whom participate in various 
forms of charitable, voluntary and other community related 
work. We are therefore supportive of these initiatives,  
and encourage and support these through the work of  
our Community Investment team. 
Each year the Board approves a budget for charitable 
donations of around one percent of gross dividends for 
the previous financial year, which in 2006 was £112,000. 
Donations are made through either the John M. Menzies 
Community Fund or the Charities Fund.
The John M. Menzies Community Fund supports the work  
of our employees whether engaging in voluntary work or other 
charitable or community-related projects. It makes individual 
cash awards of up to £350 per employee, or £700 per team 
of employees, undertaking a charitable or community project. 
Such awards are made in consultation with the Managing 
Directors of each business. During 2006, some 22 projects  
were supported by this Fund.
The Charities Fund is the Company’s main channel for 
supporting charitable causes or investing in community 
projects. Its activities are managed by a Charities Committee, 
which is chaired by the Chief Executive and meets quarterly 
each year. Altogether, the Charities Fund receives over three 
hundred applications every year from very diverse charities 
and projects, both local and international.
Applications are received throughout the year and donations 
are approved by the Charities Committee. In 2006, some 91 
organisations benefited from charitable donations made.

Corporate Governance Statement
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. 
The Company has applied throughout the year under review all the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code of Corporate 
Governance 2003 (the “Code”), other than the provisions concerning committee independence explained below.
The Board
Composition
The Board currently consists of eight directors, six of whom are non-executive (including the Chairman) and two executive. The 
roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined. Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial 
term of three years, and all directors are required under the Articles to retire and offer themselves for re-election at least every 
three years.
Independence
Three of the non-executive directors, David Coltman, Iain Robertson and Octavia Morley, are independent under the terms of the 
Code, where the number required for smaller companies is two. Michael Walker retired as a director and as Senior Independent 
Director on 25 May 2006, and David Coltman was appointed Senior Independent Director in his place. 
Dermot Jenkinson and Ian Harrison are not independent under the terms of the Code due to their shareholding and length of 
service. However, they continue to provide an invaluable source of advice and support to the Board and its committees. They not 
only represent the continuing involvement of the founding Menzies family, but also contribute effectively to the Board and the 
work of its committees. They bring to the Board a breadth of skills and experience from their knowledge of the Company, and 
from their backgrounds in business and general management. 
At least two of the members on each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are independent (being a majority) including 
the chairman of these committees. The Nominations Committee only has one independent member and in this respect it is not 
fully compliant with the Code. However, the Board feels that given the current challenges faced by, and the continuing changing 
shape of, the Company, the current structure and composition of the Board and of the Nominations Committee is appropriate.

A description of the Board’s committees is provided below, and the chairman and membership of each committee can be found 
in the Directors’ biographies on pages 28 and 29.
The Board met ten times in 2006 and has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. These include: 
strategic plans, the approval of financial statements, acquisitions and disposals, major non-recurring projects and major capital 
expenditures. It also delegates specific responsibilities with written terms of reference to the Board Committees detailed below. 
Information of an appropriate quality is issued in a timely manner to assist the Board in performing its duties. New directors 
receive an appropriate induction tailored to their needs. All members of the Board have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice as appropriate at the expense of the Company.

Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information At least one meeting of the Board each year is held at an operating division’s offices, and directors are encouraged to visit  
both divisional operations at other times, and to undertake such activities and training as is appropriate or may be required  
or desirable in order to carry out their duties.
Board Performance Evaluation
The Board is supportive of the principles and provisions of the Code on Board Performance Evaluation, and first undertook a 
rigorous process of performance evaluation of the whole Board and of its individual members in December 2004/January 2005, 
with the assistance of external consultants.
 
The Board’s policy is to conduct performance evaluations internally on an annual basis, using external consultants to refresh  
the process every 3 – 5 years.
A formal performance evaluation was undertaken during 2006 using specially designed questionnaires, and the process  
was extended to include its committees. The results of the questionnaires were reviewed by the Board and the Chairman  
also met with Board members individually. 
The non-executive directors held one meeting last year without the Chairman being present at which his performance was 
reviewed. 
Communication with Shareholders
The Board has developed a comprehensive programme to ensure that effective communication with shareholders, analysts and 
the financial press is maintained throughout the year. Through its annual and interim reports, results and other announcements, 
as well as through presentations to institutional shareholders and the dissemination of information via the Group’s website at 
www.johnmenziesplc.com, the Board seeks to present its strategy and performance in an objective and balanced manner. 
Shareholders attending the Annual General Meeting are invited to ask questions during the meeting and also to meet the 
directors after the formal business of the meeting has concluded. The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees  
are also available to answer questions from any shareholder at the meeting. Full details of proxy votes cast on each resolution  
are made available to shareholders at the meeting and, in keeping with best practice, are made available on the Company’s 
website after the meeting.
The Board receives reports at each of its meetings on any meetings held with shareholders or analysts, and the Chairman  
and Senior Independent Director are also available for contact by shareholders at any time. 
Board Committees
The Board has established committees with defined terms of reference. The Board’s policy on the membership of its  
committees is that all non-executive directors should contribute and to keep membership fresh one member of each  
committee be changed every two years. Accordingly, no change to existing committee membership is proposed for 2007.  
The Nominations, Remuneration and Audit Committees each consist of three non-executive directors. The chairmen of the  
Audit and Remuneration Committees will be chosen from directors who are independent under the terms of the Code, and 
it is the Board’s intention that they will serve for three years. The inclusion of Dermot Jenkinson on the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees and of Ian Harrison on the Audit Committee respectively does not comply with the Code and an 
explanation is given above. 
The Board has also delegated operational matters to an Executive Committee. 
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee has terms of reference modelled closely on those set out in the Code, and its responsibilities 
include recommending new Board appointments and succession planning. The Chief Executive normally attends each meeting.  
A copy of the terms of reference is available on the Company’s website. 
The Board as a whole is responsible for making new appointments to the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations 
Committee and for nominating recommended candidates for election by shareholders on first appointment and thereafter  
for re-election at relevant intervals.

Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Governance
(continued)
The Committee at one of its meetings held in 2006 reviewed the structure, balance and composition of the Board and its 
committees, and concluded that these remained appropriate.
Remuneration Committee
The Report on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 35 to 40 details the constitution and role of the Remuneration Committee,  
and how the principles of the Code relating to directors’ remuneration have been applied. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board in the execution of its responsibilities for corporate governance and internal control,  
and has adopted terms of reference modelled closely on those set out in the Code. The Group Finance Director and certain  
senior financial executives as appropriate, together with representatives from the internal and external audit teams, attend  
each meeting. A copy of the terms of reference is available on the Company’s website. 
A full description of the work of the committee, including details of how it has discharged its responsibilities, appears below. 
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and consists of the executive directors together with the managing 
director of each division and certain senior executives. It is responsible for the implementation of strategy and plays a central 
role in planning, budgeting, and risk identification and management within the Group’s operations. It normally meets twelve 
times a year.
The members of this Committee are shown on page 29.
Internal Control
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control, which covers financial, operational and compliance 
controls together with risk management. Whilst no system can provide absolute guarantee and protection against material loss, 
the system is designed to give the directors reasonable assurance that problems can be identified promptly and remedial action 
taken as appropriate. The directors, through the Board’s review of risk and the work of the Audit Committee, have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control for the accounting period under review and consider that it accords with revised 
guidance. There were no material weaknesses in the Group’s system of internal control relating to financial control during the 
year.
The key features of the Group’s internal control system are:
Control Environment
A key factor in the Group’s approach to internal control is the recognition of the need for risk awareness and the ownership 
of risk management by executives at all levels. Each operating division has its own Board. A Statement of Group Policies 
and Procedures sets out the responsibilities of these Divisional Boards, including authority levels, reporting disciplines and 
responsibility for risk management and internal control. Certain activities, including treasury, taxation, insurance, pension  
and legal matters are controlled centrally with reports reviewed by the Board as appropriate. 
Risk Identification and Review
Key identified risks, both financial and non financial (the latter including environmental, social and governance “ESG” risks),  
are reviewed by the Board as well as at operating Divisional Board level on an ongoing basis, with a formal annual review 
of risks and controls taking place, supported by the Group’s Controls Assurance provider (described further on page 33). The 
Executive Committee also reviews each division’s performance, strategy and risk management. Annual compliance statements 
on internal control are certified by each Divisional Board. A Treasury Review Committee meets regularly to review the adequacy 
of the Group’s facilities against potential utilisation and commitments, as well as to monitor and manage the Group’s exposure 
to interest rate and currency movements. Further details on how the Board manages ESG risks in particular is given in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 21 to 27.

Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information PB John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 33 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006
Financial Reporting
There is a comprehensive Group-wide system of financial reporting. Figures reported include profit, cash flows, capital 
expenditure, balance sheet and relevant performance indicators. Each operating division prepares an annual budget which is 
approved by the Board. Thereafter a formal re-forecasting exercise is undertaken at least twice during the year. Actual monthly 
results are monitored against budget, forecasts and the previous year’s results. Any significant variances are investigated and 
acted upon as appropriate.
Investment Appraisal
There are clearly defined investment guidelines for capital expenditure. All such expenditure is subject to formal authorisation 
procedures, with major proposals being considered by the Board. Post investment appraisals are conducted for all material capital 
projects.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee plays a critical role within the Company’s system of internal control and risk management and a full 
description of its work is given below.
A description of the remit and work of the Audit Committee
The members of this committee, together with biographical information, are identified on page 28. 
The Committee has delegated authority from the Board for ensuring adherence to the Code provisions and related guidance 
concerning the following matters which it is responsible for:
•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements and reviewing significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates 
contained within them;
•  reviewing the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems, including control over financial reporting; 
•  reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function, including the business risk programme; 
•  reviewing the Group’s policies and practices concerning business conduct, ethics and integrity and on whistleblowing; and 
•  overseeing all aspects of the relationship with the external auditors, including their appointment, the audit process, the 
supply of non audit services and monitoring their effectiveness and independence. 
The Committee met four times in 2006 and a full report of its activities and of findings and recommendations from each 
meeting is given to the Board.
During the year, the Committee formally reviewed and approved (prior to the Board) draft annual and interim reports (including 
the statements on internal control and the work of the Committee), associated preliminary and interim results announcements 
and the two trading statements made by the Company. This aspect of its work focused on key accounting policies, estimates and 
judgements, including on significant or unusual transactions or changes to these. In doing so the Committee reviewed the reports 
of management and the controls assurance (internal audit) provider and took into account the views of the external auditors. 
The Committee also reviewed the Group’s internal control structure, approved the scope of work of and fees for the controls 
assurance provider and debated whether the internal audit function should be brought in-house. It concluded that due to the 
complexity of the Group’s business and the international nature of the aviation business, the internal audit function was best 
served by continuing to outsource to Deloitte, given their global spread and resources. 
Findings from the internal audit programme (on financial and key non financial risks) and areas identified for improvement 
are reviewed by the Committee and prioritised for action by management. The Committee reviews follow-up reports from 
management to ensure that any weaknesses identified in internal audit reports submitted to it are fully addressed and that 
improved procedures are adopted. 
The Committee also reviewed the work of management on updating the Group’s Business Risk register, which involved assessing 
key risks at Group and Divisional level according to their significance, likelihood and impact, as well as the Company’s exposure 
to and management of these risks. After taking into account reports from the controls assurance provider, the Committee was 
satisfied that management had appropriate risk management strategies and systems in place to address these.

Corporate Governance
(continued)
The Committee reviewed and approved the audit plan as well as the findings of the external auditors from its review of the 
interim announcement and its audit of the annual financial statements. It also assessed the effectiveness of the external 
auditors and of the audit process through meetings and interviews with management and key finance staff. As part of this, 
it keeps under review the objectivity and independence of the external auditors and the nature and extent of the non-audit 
services which they provide. These services consist mainly of acquisition-related due diligence, where their knowledge of the 
Group’s business processes and controls makes them best placed to undertake this work cost-effectively on the Group’s behalf. 
The external auditors do not deal with the Group’s tax affairs. The Committee believes that the level and scope of these  
non-audit services does not impair the objectivity of the auditors.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) determines the remuneration of the Chairman, the executive directors and the 
managing directors of each division on behalf of the Board. It has formal Terms of Reference set by the Board modelled on the 
Combined Code, which are displayed on the Company’s website. 
The Committee’s membership is shown on page 28 and no change is proposed for 2007. David Coltman will therefore continue 
to chair the Committee until the expiry of his three year term, subject to the requirement to retire by rotation. The Company 
Secretary is the secretary of the Committee.
Patrick Macdonald, Chief Executive, attends meetings as appropriate. Paul Dollman, Group Finance Director, who also has 
responsibility for executive remuneration, attends meetings as appropriate. Research commissioned from Kepler Associates was 
used by the Committee in its determination of executive bonus payments and review of executive remuneration. No legal advice 
was sought by the Committee during the year.
Members of the Committee have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to be decided and no 
day-to-day involvement in the running of the business of the Group.
The Board extended its review of its own performance to the performance of the Committee during the year. The evaluation 
questionnaires from each Committee member indicated that there were no significant matters concerning the operation of the 
Committee that needed addressing. 
Annual General Meeting
A resolution to approve this report will be tabled at the AGM. The Chairman of the Committee is available to answer questions 
from shareholders on the decisions of the Committee. 
Remuneration Policy and Practice
The Group recognises that its continuing success depends on the quality and motivation of its employees. The Group aims to 
ensure that its remuneration practices are competitive, thereby enabling it to attract, retain and motivate executives who have 
the experience, skills and talents to operate and develop its businesses to their maximum potential. 
The Committee applies these principles with regard to the executive directors and to the managing directors of each division, 
and also reviews the policies underlying the remuneration of senior executives. Directors’ salaries are maintained at competitive 
levels for comparable positions based on information provided by Kepler Associates reflecting, where appropriate, the 
international nature of the business. Additional rewards for success are built into the remuneration package through incentives 
designed to share with these directors any increasing profitability of the Group and increased wealth generated for shareholders. 
The Company introduced new incentive arrangements, including various share incentive plans, in 2005. In considering and 
determining suitable remuneration packages for the executive directors the Committee has given full consideration to the 
relevant best practice provisions set out in the Combined Code. The Committee also determines the extent to which all 
performance targets are met, using research findings as described above.
The Committee was asked to review the Company’s remuneration and incentive structures for executive directors and other 
senior executives towards the end of last year. It was felt by the Board that the Company’s existing incentive schemes did not 
operate as well as was intended. On the Committee’s recommendation, the Board is proposing to adopt a new 2007 Divisional 
Performance Share Plan (“DPSP”) to augment the Company’s existing share incentive plans as part of the Company’s policy 
of ensuring that its remuneration practices remain competitive. Executive directors and other senior executives will only be 
awarded conditional shares either under this new plan or the 2005 Performance Share Plan and not both.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration 
(continued)
The DPSP is the same in practically all respects as the 2005 Performance Share Plan, except that the performance conditions 
are based on the achievement of targeted Divisional Financial Results (“DFR”), rather than Total Shareholder Return. The DFR are 
set at threshold and stretch level; at the stretch level, the performance target has been externally verified by Kepler Associates 
as being equivalent to achieving upper quartile performance. For Menzies Distribution, the DFR are based on operating profit, 
reduction in operating costs and income from new revenue streams, and for Menzies Aviation the DFR are based on operating 
profit. 
Further details of the DPSP are set out on pages 88 to 89, with a summary provided on page 86.
Basic Salary and Benefits
Salaries are reviewed annually, on appointment, or on change in position or responsibility. In addition to salary, the executive 
directors may receive additional benefits covering car allowance, private medical insurance and life cover. Patrick Macdonald also 
receives a cash allowance in place of any pension entitlement above the ‘earnings cap’. 
Annual Bonus Scheme
The executive directors participate in a discretionary bonus scheme which is subject to the achievement of challenging  
Group and individual business and personal targets designed to encourage excellent performance. Bonus payments are  
non-pensionable. 
The 2006 bonus scheme contained performance targets that were de-linked from budget, and include Threshold, Target and 
Stretch levels derived from a review of the historical and projected performance of the Group and its peers together with an 
analysis of analysts’ expectations. The Stretch level represents upper quartile performance. 
The calculation of bonus awards was also de-linked from salary, with payment of £75,000 on achieving Target for the  
Chief Executive and £50,000 for the other executive director, increasing on a straight line basis to a maximum payment of three 
times these amounts for performance between Target and Stretch. 
Bonus entitlement commences at Threshold and increases on a straight line basis. Up to 20% of any entitlement is dependent 
on the extent to which identified personal key result areas are achieved.
Bonus awards for 2006 performance were made to Patrick Macdonald (£40,500) and Paul Dollman (£28,800). 
Bonus Co-investment Plan
Executive directors may elect to invest up to 50% of their annual bonus in shares of the Company which qualify for an award  
of up to 2:1 matching shares dependent on achieving a performance target set prior to election. 
The performance target for the 2006 Plan is for real 3%-8% per annum EPS growth above the Group’s 2005 EPS over the three 
years to December 2008, with the number of shares vesting being calculated on a straight-line basis from a nil award at 3% to  
a full award at 8%. Any dividends accrued on shares which vest are paid in cash on vesting.
Patrick Macdonald and Paul Dollman purchased shares under the Plan in 2006, and the John Menzies Employee Benefit Trust 
holds sufficient shares to cover any shares which may vest.
Performance Share Plan 
Executive directors and the managing directors of each division are awarded a number of conditional shares annually under the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) as determined by the Committee. The number of shares involved is reviewed each year but has 
not changed since the plan was introduced in 2005. The maximum number of conditional shares which may be awarded to any 
individual under the rules of the plan in any year is 100,000.
The shares awarded in 2006 will vest after three years if the Company’s TSR is equal to or outperforms the FTSE 250 Index TSR 
for the three years to December 2008. The number of shares to vest will be based on the extent of any outperformance, with 
shares vesting on a straight line basis up to 100% of the award for performance at 30% above the Index’s TSR. Any dividends 
accrued on shares which vest are paid in cash on vesting.
Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 36 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 37 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 36 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 37 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006
Executive directors and the managing directors of each division will only be awarded a number of conditional shares under either 
the proposed Divisional Performance Share Plan or the existing PSP and not both. 
The John Menzies Employee Benefit Trust holds sufficient shares to cover any shares which may vest under both this PSP and the 
proposed new plan.
Share Options
Prior to the introduction of the above share schemes in 2005, share options were granted to each executive director normally 
on an annual basis at a level of one times salary. All grants were discretionary, and awards could be varied depending on specific 
circumstances. 
Paul Dollman and Patrick Macdonald were granted options at three times salary during 2002 and 2003 respectively, reflecting 
market conditions at the time of their recruitment, and awards of one times salary in 2004. These awards were subject to  
EPS-based performance conditions which have now been fully met. 
Service Contracts
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company, the dates of which are listed in the table of remuneration 
below. The Group’s practice on notice periods is that they should be for an initial period of two years following appointment, 
reducing thereafter to 12 months’ notice, with any termination payment restricted to the actual loss incurred by the director.  
All executive directors who served during the year have or had service contracts on this basis. 
The Remuneration Committee considers that the notice periods stated above are reasonable and in the interests of shareholders 
having due regard to prevailing market conditions and practice among companies of comparable size.
Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Chief Executive on 
an annual basis and takes account of market rates based on independent advice as required. The non-executive directors and the 
Chairman do not have service contracts, being appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to review thereafter, and do 
not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, share or pension schemes. 
Performance Graph
The following graph compares the Company’s total shareholder return for the five years to December 2006 with the equivalent 
performance of the FTSE 250 Index. The directors consider that, given the scale and global spread of the businesses within the 
Group, the most appropriate comparison is with this index.

Notes
(*)    Other than where indicated, all the above options were granted under the Company’s executive share option schemes with 
the exception of those items marked * which have been granted under the savings-related share option scheme. The cost  
to the Company of these employee share-based plans is shown in note 20 to the accounts.
(a)  The gain, measured as the difference between the option exercise price and the closing market value of the shares involved

made by Paul Dollman on exercise of his 2,680 and 606 savings-related options was £7,426 in aggregate. 
(b)  The performance conditions attaching to these options have been met in full. The options are exercisable on a sliding scale  
if growth in headline earnings per share exceeds RPI plus 3%-8% per annum in the three years to December 2005, adjusted 
to normalise pension and tax charges. 
(c)   The performance conditions attaching to these options have been met in full. The options are exercisable on a sliding scale  
if growth in headline earnings per share exceeds RPI plus 3%-8% per annum in the three years to December 2006, adjusted 
to normalise pension and tax charges.
(d)  Award of conditional shares during the year under the Performance Share Plan, subject to performance conditions as noted 
above, at a market price of 530p (2005: 582p), vesting on the day on which the Company announces its preliminary results

(e)  Award of conditional matching shares during the year under Bonus Co-investment Plan, subject to performance conditions 
as noted above, at a market price of 530p (2005: 595p), vesting on the day on which the Company announces its preliminary

Pensions 
Scheme Benefits
The executive directors are members of the Menzies Pension Fund, a contributory defined benefit scheme which provides 
pension on retirement at age 60 of up to two-thirds of pensionable earnings, or the ‘earnings cap’ if lower, together with 
additional benefits as below. Pensionable earnings are based on salary excluding bonuses.
Unfunded Arrangement 
The pensionable salaries for Patrick Macdonald and Paul Dollman are restricted as a consequence of the ‘earnings cap’.  
Patrick Macdonald has elected to receive a salary supplement in lieu of his unapproved pension entitlement. Paul Dollman has  
an unfunded pension undertaking from the Company to provide in total the same level of pension as if the ‘earnings cap’ did  
not apply. This entitlement is effective from his date of appointment as a director. 
Pension details are as follows:

Notes:
(a)  Accrued pension entitlements are the amounts which would be paid at normal retirement date if the director left service  
as at 30 December 2006, with no allowances for increases in the period between leaving service and normal retirement date. 
The entitlements disclosed above include unfunded benefits. 
(b)   Transfer values represent the value of the assets which the pension scheme (together with the Company where appropriate) 
would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring its liability in respect of the directors’ pension 
entitlements. They do not represent sums payable to individual directors.

(c)   Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with ‘Retirement Benefit Schemes (GN 11)’ published by the Institute  
of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. This methodology determines the values attributable to the deferred pensions  
for younger members by reference mainly to the UK All-Share Index and for members nearing normal retirement date mainly 
to the Gilts Over 15 Years Index and the Index-linked Over 5 Years (5% inflation) Index.
(d)  The unfunded transfer value at 30 December 2006 relating to Paul Dollman, calculated on a cash equivalent transfer value 
basis, totalled £244,700. 
(e)  The total of the transfer values for unfunded pension entitlements as above, held on the Company’s balance sheet at  
30 December 2006 for current and former directors, calculated on an IAS 19 basis, totalled £710,114, from which an annual 
pension of £15,915 p.a. is paid to former directors.

annual re-election. The directors who retire and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) are William Thomson, David Coltman, Dermot Jenkinson and Ian Harrison. 
All four directors have undergone a formal performance evaluation and the performance of each continues to be effective  
and to demonstrate commitment to their role including commitment of time for Board and committee meetings and their  
other duties.William Thomson, who is Chairman, has extensive leadership skills and experience, and provides highly valued  
advice and support to the executive management team. David Coltman, who is Senior Independent Director, has international 
experience and commercial expertise and knowledge particularly in the aviation sector. Dermot Jenkinson contributes from  
his breadth of experience gained from his knowledge of the Company and through a wide range of general management roles.

management. The latter two also represent the interests of our major shareholder.

Directors’ Responsibilities and Going Concern
The directors are required by law to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the

Group for the financial year then ended.
In preparing the financial statements the directors are required to:
• maintain adequate accounting records;
•  apply suitable accounting policies in a consistent manner and make reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates where 
necessary;
•  comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union;
• prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
The directors are satisfied that, after making appropriate enquiries, the Group has adequate resources to continue in business  
for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements. The directors 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of John Menzies plc for the 
year ended 30 December 2006 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, 
the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Recognised Income and 
Expense and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.  
We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are 
set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This 
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report  
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.  
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review that  
is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
Combined Code (2003) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does 
not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Business Review, 
the Corporate Governance Statement, the Directors’ Report and the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing  
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

1. Introduction and accounting policies
The Group prepared its consolidated financial statements  
for 2005 under UK GAAP, supplemented with pro-forma IFRS 
financial information. This was to comply with the Companies 
Act 1985 (as amended November 2004) and was a result  
of the accounting year commencing on 26 December 2004,  
prior to the IFRS adoption date of 1 January 2005.
The Group now presents its first full-year IFRS-compliant 
Report and Accounts. Comparative IFRS financial information 
is presented for the year ended 31 December 2005, as the date 
of transition to IFRS for the Group was 26 December 2004, 
being the first day of the comparative period. UK GAAP to IFRS 
reconciliations are also presented in this Report and Accounts. 
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985  
no income statement is presented for the Company. 
A summary of the more significant accounting policies,  
which have been consistently applied, is set out below. 
The following new standards, amendments to standards  
and interpretations have been issued but are not effective  
for 2006 and have not been adopted early:-
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and IAS 1 
‘Amendments to Capital Disclosures’, both effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. The Group has 
assessed the impact of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1, and 
will apply IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 for annual periods 
beginning 1 January 2007. These Standards are for disclosure 
purposes only and will have no effect on reported results. 
IFRIC 7 ‘Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29’, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 
2006. None of the Group’s subsidiaries has a functional 
currency affected by hyperinflation. Management does  
not expect the interpretation to be relevant for the Group.
IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 May 2006. IFRIC 8 relates to transactions which 
involve the issue of equity transactions where the identifiable 
consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity 
instruments issued. The Group will apply IFRIC 8 from 1 
January 2007 but management does not expect it to have  
any impact on the Group’s operations.
IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’, effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006. 
Management believes that this interpretation should not 
have a significant impact on the reassessment of embedded 
derivatives as the Group already assesses whether embedded 
derivatives should be separated using principles consistent 
with IFRIC 9.
Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts, which have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention and in accordance with EU 
Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS, incorporate the accounts 
of the Company and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates from the effective date of acquisition or to  
the date of deemed disposal. 
IFRS 1
IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards’ requires that accounting policies be adopted that 
are compliant with IFRS and that these policies be applied 
retrospectively to all periods presented. IFRS 1 does, however, 
contain the option to take advantage of certain exemptions  
to retrospective application.
The Group has elected to take the following permitted 
exemptions:
(a) the acquisition accounting of business combinations 
completed prior to the transition date has not been 
restated. The net book value of goodwill as at the 
transition date has been treated as the deemed cost  
of goodwill under IFRS;
(b)  the net book value at the transition date of those tangible 
fixed assets that were revalued prior to the transition date 
has been treated as deemed cost;
(c) IFRS requires the tracking of all cumulative foreign 
exchange adjustments taken to reserves. These amounts 
are reversed upon any subsequent disposal of the business 
to which it relates. The cumulative translation differences 
at the transition date are assumed to be zero;
(d) the provisions of IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payment’ have been 
applied only to awards made after 7 November 2002.
In addition, the Group has adopted ‘Amendments to  
IAS 19 Employee Benefits’. The Group has selected the  
option available within this standard, similar to FRS 17 under 
UK GAAP, for immediate recognition of all actuarial gains and 
losses outside of the Income Statement in the Statement  
of Recognised Income and Expense.

1. Introduction and accounting policies 
(continued)
Revenue
Distribution – revenue is recognised on the weekly invoiced 
value of goods sold, excluding value-added tax.
Aviation – cargo revenue is recognised at the point of 
departure for exports and at the point that the goods are 
ready for despatch for imports. Other ramp, passenger and 
aviation-related services income is recognised in accordance 
with when the service was performed. Revenue excludes 
value-added and sales taxes, charges collected on behalf  
of customers and intercompany transactions.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, including 
acquisition expenses, less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at the 
following rates:
Freehold and long leasehold properties – over 50 years
Short leasehold properties – over the remaining lease term
Plant and equipment – over the estimated life of the asset.
Inventories
Inventories, being goods for resale and consumables, are 
stated at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value.
Pensions
The operating and financing costs of pensions are charged  
to the income statement in the period in which they arise  
and are recognised separately. The costs of past service 
benefit enhancements, settlements and curtailments are also 
recognised in the period in which they arise. The difference 
between actual and expected returns on assets during the  
year, including changes in actuarial assumptions, is recognised  
in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice  
of qualified actuaries. 
With regard to defined contribution schemes, the income 
statement charge represents contributions made.
Taxation
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable  
in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method,  
on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an 
asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. Deferred 
tax arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction, other than a business combination, that 
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting 
nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised. Deferred tax 
liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent 
tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible 
temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax losses 
and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates and tax  
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the 
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is 
settled. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income 
statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly  
in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess  
of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, associate  
or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill acquired  
is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at 
least annually by assessing the recoverable amount of each 
cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. When the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures and 
associates is included within the carrying value of the 
investment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 26 December 2004  
(the date of transition to IFRS) has been retained at the 
previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for 
impairment at that date.
Contracts
The fair value attributed to contracts at the point of acquisition 
is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows 
to be generated from that asset at the risk-adjusted weighted 
average cost of capital for the Group. This amount is included 
in intangible assets as ‘contracts’ and amortised over the 
estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Separate values are 
not attributed to internally generated customer relationships.
Contract amortisation is business-stream dependent. At 
Distribution, contracts capitalised are not amortised due to 
the very long-term nature of the business in the UK. These 
contracts are, however, tested annually for impairment using 
similar criteria to the goodwill test. At Aviation, contracts are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years as this period 
is the minimum time-frame management considers when 
assessing businesses for acquisition.
Development costs
Development expenditure incurred on individual projects 
is carried forward only if all the criteria set out in IAS 38 
“Intangible assets” are met. Following the initial recognition  
of development expenditure, the cost is amortised over  
the project’s estimated useful life, usually three years.
Computer software
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer 
software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs that are directly attributable to the production of 
identifiable and unique software products controlled by  
the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits 
exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible 
assets. Direct costs include the costs of software development 
employees. Costs are amortised over their estimated useful 
lives.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised in the 
balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at  
the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is recorded in the balance sheet as a finance lease 
obligation. The lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges (charged to the income statement) and  
a reduction of the lease obligations. 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to  
the income statement on a straight-line basis over applicable 
lease periods.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash 
at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown 
within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency assets and liabilities of the Group are 
translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. The trading results of overseas subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates are translated at the average exchange 
rate ruling during the year, with the exchange difference 
between average rates and the rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date being taken to reserves.
Any differences arising on the translation of the opening net 
investment, including goodwill, in overseas subsidiaries, joint 
ventures and associates, and of applicable foreign currency 
loans, are dealt with as adjustments to reserves. All other 
exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses forward contracts and cross-currency swaps 
as derivatives to hedge the risk arising from the retranslation 
of foreign currency denominated items.
The Group has derivatives which are designated as hedges of 
overseas net investments in foreign entities (net investment 
hedges) and derivatives which are designated as hedges of the 
exchange risk arising from the retranslation of highly probable 
forecast revenue denominated in non-local currency of some 
of our overseas operations (cash flow hedges).

1. Introduction and accounting policies 
(continued) 
In all cases, the derivative contracts entered into by  
the Group have been highly effective during the reporting 
period, and are expected to continue to be highly effective 
until they expire. As a result, all derivatives have been 
recorded using hedge accounting, which is explained below.
All derivatives are initially recorded on the balance sheet at fair 
value either on transition from UK GAAP at 26 December 2004 
or on the date they are entered into if that is a later date.  
All derivatives are subsequently measured at fair value, which 
is calculated as the present value of all future cash flows from 
the derivative discounted at prevailing market rates.
Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of net 
investment hedges are recorded in equity, and are only 
recycled to the income statement on disposal of the overseas 
net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash 
flow hedges are recorded in equity until such time as the 
forecast transaction occurs, at which time they are recycled 
to the income statement. If, however, the occurrence of the 
transaction results in a non-financial asset or liability, then 
amounts recycled from equity would be included in the cost  
of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction 
remains probable but ceases to be highly probable then, 
from that point, changes in fair value would be recorded in 
the income statement within finance costs. Similarly, if the 
forecast transaction ceases to be probable then the entire fair 
value recorded in equity and future changes in fair value would 
be posted to the income statement within finance costs. 
Any ineffective portion of movements in the fair value of 
hedging instruments is recognised in the income statement 
within finance costs.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the 
future. These estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The Board has considered the critical 
accounting estimates and assumptions used in the Accounts 
and concluded that the main area of significant risk which 
may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year is in respect 
of the assumptions used to calculate pension benefits. The 
assumptions include corporate bond yields, investment return, 
price and salary inflation and mortality assumptions. Full 
details of assumptions used to calculate the pension assets 
and liabilities are found in Note 4.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those one-off and/or material items 
which the Group considers should be highlighted due to their 
scope and nature.
Dividend distributions
Final ordinary dividends are recognised as liabilities in the 
accounts in the period in which the dividends are approved  
by the Company’s shareholders.
Financial risk factors
The Group is exposed to financial risks: liquidity risk, interest 
rate fluctuations, foreign exchange exposures and credit risk. 
These are more fully discussed in the Business Review on 
pages 18 and 19.

Pension schemes
With regard to the principal Group-funded defined benefit scheme in the UK (the Menzies Pension Fund), to which the employees 
contribute, the charge to the income statement is assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice from Aon Consulting 
(“the Actuary”) using the projected unit method. Certain Group subsidiaries operate overseas and participate in a number of 
pension schemes, which are largely of a defined contribution nature. The income statement charge for defined contribution 
schemes represents the contributions made.

5. Underlying performance
(a) Exceptional items – £3m
Pension credit – £5.8m
With effect from 1 May 2006, the principal Group-funded defined benefit scheme in the UK changed from a final pensionable 
salary scheme to an average salary scheme and employee contributions were increased. Benefits accrued to current active 
members prior to 1 May 2006 are now linked to future price inflation rather than future salary increases. The impact of these 
changes is a reduction of £5.8m in the present value of the scheme liabilities in respect of past service.
Gain on exchange of contract rights – £2.5m
During the year, the Group transferred its 20% shareholding in T Cox & Son (Tonbridge) Limited to another wholesaler in return 
for an interest in certain magazine distribution contracts in the south-west London area. The fair value of the contractual rights 
acquired and the shares disposed are considered to be equivalent, and both are estimated at £2.5m. As the shareholding had  
no carrying value in the Group’s balance sheet, there is effectively no cost of disposal to offset against the interests received.  
As a result, a non-cash gain of £2.5m is created.
Rationalisation and integration costs – £5.3m
Costs of rationalising excess capacity, comprising asset write-downs and staff costs, and integration costs for new businesses.
(b) Intangible amortisation – £2.2m
Goodwill impairment – £1.8m
As permitted under the transitional requirements of IFRS 1, the acquisition accounting of business combinations completed  
prior to the transition date has not been restated. As a result, assets which were previously capitalised as goodwill have not 
been reclassified as other intangible assets. Accordingly, these financial statements include an impairment charge of £1.8m 
(2005: £1.8m) reflecting the remaining life of the current licence at Menzies Macau Aviation Services Ltd. A further charge  
of £0.3m in 2005 related to an adjustment under IAS 12 for tax loss utilisation in the Netherlands.
Contract amortisation – £0.4m
A new charge for 2006 (Note 11) on the application of IFRS to acquisitions.
The taxation effect of the exceptional items is a charge of £1.1m.

8. Taxation (continued)
(d) Factors that may affect future tax charges      
The Group has estimated tax losses carried forward, which arose in subsidiary companies operating in the undernoted 
jurisdictions, that are available for offset against future profits of those subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets have not been 
recognised in respect of these losses as they have arisen in subsidiaries that have either been loss-making for some time  
or where it is unclear that profits will be available to fully utilise the losses.  
  Losses
  £m Expiry
USA 20.4 Carry forward indefinitely
Netherlands 5.8 Not earlier than 1 January 2012
Hong Kong 7.0 Carry forward indefinitely
Republic of Ireland 0.9 Carry forward indefinitely
Germany 19.1 Carry forward indefinitely
Australia 1.9 Carry forward indefinitely
         
The Group has capital losses in the UK of approximately £23.2m, that are available for offset against future taxable gains arising 
in the UK. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses.       
  
A deferred tax asset of £0.5m has been recognised in relation to losses carried forward by a subsidiary operating in the USA,  
in circumstances where that subsidiary has incurred losses in the current and preceding years. The deferred tax asset has been 
recognised on the basis of the US acquisitions during the year, which have a history of profitability, and future projections.  
       
A deferred tax liability of £0.7m (2005: £0.7m) has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of an associate.

Dividends on equity shares:

 – Interim paid in respect of 2006, 6.1p (2005: 5.8p) per share     3.6   3.4
    11.6   10.9
Dividends of £0.1m (2005: £0.1m) were waived by employee share trusts (Note 21) during the year.
In addition, the directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the full year to 30 December 2006 of 14.4p per ordinary share, 
which will absorb an estimated £8.5m of shareholders’ funds. Payment will be made on 29 June 2007 to shareholders on the register 
at close of business on 1 June 2007.
Preference share dividends have been reclassified as interest payable.

The weighted average number of fully paid shares in issue during the year excludes those held by the employee share trusts 
(Note 21). The diluted weighted average is calculated by adjusting for all outstanding share options which are potentially 
dilutive, i.e. where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the shares during the year.

and exceptional items.

Impairment test for goodwill and contracts
Goodwill
Goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment. Management assesses the value-in-use of the asset  
based on forecast pre-tax cash flows from each cash-generating unit over a ten-year period discounted at 8%. 
Contracts
Contract amortisation is business-stream dependent. At Distribution, contracts capitalised are not amortised due to the very 
long-term nature of the business in the UK. These contracts are, however, tested annually for impairment using similar criteria  
to the goodwill test. At Aviation, contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years as this period is the minimum 
time-frame management considers when assessing businesses for acquisition.

20. Share capital (continued)
Company Share Option Schemes
The Company operates the following share-based payment arrangements:
(a)  Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”)
Options under the ESOS may be granted to executive directors and senior employees of the Group on an annual basis  
and mature only after three years upon which they become exercisable. The exercise period is usually seven years from maturity  
and special rules apply to employees who leave the employment of the Group due to ill health, retirement or redundancy. 
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of shares under option at the date of grant.
Options granted under the ESOS adopted in September 2000, are subject to performance conditions and lapse if these are not 
achieved. The performance hurdles require that for each annual grant three-year growth targets set by the Board are achieved. 
Growth is typically measured by growth in underlying earnings per share (“EPS”) as compared to RPI plus between 3% and  
8% per annum over three years, adjusted to normalise pension and tax charges. 
(b)  Savings-related Share Option Scheme
The Company operates a savings-related share option scheme which is open to all eligible UK employees. Typically, employees 
who are eligible to participate include full and part-time employees who work at least 16.5 hours per week, after any probationary 
period. Annual grants of options are made in October each year and become exercisable after three years. Employees enter into 
a savings contract with the Yorkshire Building Society, who administer the scheme. The options are granted at a 20% discount of 
the share price at the date of grant and lapse if not exercised within six months of maturity. Special provisions apply to employees 
who leave their employment due to ill health, redundancy or retirement.
(c)  Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Under the PSP, the Board can grant executive directors and senior employees of the Group selected by the Remuneration 
Committee an award of conditional shares. The shares will vest at the end of three years if Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
reaches targets set by the Board. If percentage growth in the Company’s TSR for the three financial years is greater than the TSR 
for the FTSE250 Index by 30% or more, then the percentage of the award vesting is 100%. If the growth is greater than the TSR 
for the FTSE250 Index but less than 30% greater, then the percentage of the award vesting will be calculated on a straight-line 
basis. If growth is equal to or less than TSR for the FTSE250 Index, then the percentage of the award vesting is nil. There will be 
no retesting of performance targets.
Awards may be made by the Board at any time but no award will be made more than 10 years after the adoption of the PSP.  
At the end of each three-year performance period, the Remuneration Committee will notify each participant of the extent to 
which the performance targets have been met and the number of shares that will vest. Shares will be met from existing issued 
shares held under employee benefit trusts. Participants will also be paid an amount equal to the net dividends on those shares 
which actually vest which would have been paid during the performance period.
The conditional shares are not transferrable and lapse immediately if the participant leaves the employment of the Group, 
although special rules apply in the case of particular circumstances such as death, ill health, redundancy or other circumstances 
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. No participant may be made an award of more than 100,000 shares in any 
year. Share awards are valued using scenario-modelling.
(d)  Long-Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”) 
The terms under which share awards are made under the LTIS to senior employees are the same as for the PSP, other than as 
follows. The shares will vest at the end of three years if underlying EPS reaches targets set by the Board. If the percentage real 
EPS growth in the Company’s underlying EPS for three financial years is greater than RPI + 8% p.a. or more, then the percentage 
of the award vesting is 100%. If the EPS growth is greater than the RPI by between 3% and 8% p.a., then the percentage of the 
award vesting will be calculated on a straight-line basis. If EPS growth is RPI + 3% p.a. or less, then the percentage of the award 
vesting is nil. There will be no retesting of performance targets.

(e)  Bonus Co-investment Plan (“Plan”)
The Plan offers executive directors and other senior executives selected by the Board the opportunity to invest part of their 
annual cash bonus for a financial year in the Company’s shares entitling them, provided certain performance targets are met,  
to a grant of additional matching shares in the ratio of up to 2:1. The maximum amount of the annual cash bonus which may  
be eligible for matching is 50%. The net of tax amount is applied in the purchase of shares.
The first bonus award which qualified for investment in shares under the Plan was the award for the financial year ended 
December 2004 and the last qualifying bonus award will be for the financial year which commences 10 years after the adoption 
of the Plan.
Performance targets are based on real growth in earnings measured over three financial years. If the percentage growth in the 
Company’s EPS is RPI + 8% or more, then the number of matching shares that will vest is 2. For EPS growth of between RPI + 
3% p.a. and RPI + 8% p.a., the number of matching shares vesting will be calculated on a straight-line basis. No matching shares 
will vest for EPS percentage growth of RPI + 3% p.a. or less.
Similar provisions apply in respect of dividends, transferability of rights and leavers.
(f)  Shadow Option Scheme
The Company also operated a cash-settled Shadow Option Scheme for certain senior executives up to 31 December 2004. Grants 
were made on a discretionary basis normally once a year. The Shadow Option price was the market price at the date of grant and 
the shadow options mature after three years. The period for exercising was restricted to six months after the date of maturity, 
after which the shadow options lapse. Discretionary provisions were applied to leavers. 
The performance targets applied were also based on three year real earnings growth. The 2004 shadow options are exercisable 
in 2007 if the percentage EPS growth exceeds RPI + 3%-8% p.a., with any gain capped at 300p per shadow option. 
Fair values of share options
Options are valued using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions are included in the fair value 
calculations.
The fair value per option granted after November 2002 and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected 
period to vesting. The risk-free rate of return is the zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed 
award life. 
* Based on the daily 12-month trailing dividend yield averaged over the 12 months prior to valuation date.
** The difference between the fair value and IFRS 2 charge per option is due to adjustments for forfeiture risk.

Resolution 7 – Adoption of a new Divisional Performance Share Plan
Following an in-depth review of our remuneration and incentive structures, we are recommending the adoption of a new 
divisional share incentive plan primarily for senior executives. The main features are set out below and a summary of the rules 
can be found on pages 88 to 89.
It was felt by the Board that the Company’s current incentive schemes did not operate as intended at the divisional level. 
Following a review by the Remuneration Committee, the Board is recommending that a new 2007 Divisional Performance Share 
Plan (“DPSP”) be adopted to augment the Company’s existing share incentive plans as part of the Company’s policy of ensuring 
that its remuneration practices remain competitive. Executive directors and other senior executives receiving an award of 
conditional shares under this DPSP will not also receive awards under the existing 2005 Performance Share Plan.
The performance conditions are based on the achievement of targeted Divisional Financial Results (“DFR”) at threshold and 
stretch level; at the stretch level, the performance target has been externally verified as being equivalent to achieving upper 
quartile performance. For Menzies Distribution, the DFR are based on operating profit, reduction in operating costs and income 
from new revenue streams, and for Menzies Aviation the DFR are based on operating profit. 
The main features of the DPSP are as follows:
•  Annual grants of conditional shares which vest if actual DFR of the relevant division outperform target DFR. For the first 
cycle of the plan the following vesting conditions are proposed:
 –  No shares vest unless actual DFR for the final year of the 3-year performance period beat the threshold target.
 –  100% of shares vest for performance over the final year of the 3-year period exceeding the stretch target.
 –  Pro rata vesting in between.
•  The Remuneration Committee will review the appropriateness of these performance conditions at the beginning of each cycle.
•  An amount equal to net dividends accrued over the performance period will be paid at vesting but only on shares which  
actually vest.
Copies of the Rules of the proposed 2007 Divisional Performance Share Plan will be available for inspection at the registered 
office of the Company, and at the offices of Maclay Murray & Spens LLP at 1 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AB, from 19 April 
2007 to (and including) the date of the Annual General Meeting during normal business hours on any day (Saturdays, Sundays 
and public holidays excepted) and will also be available at the Roxburghe Hotel, 38 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh for at least 15 
minutes before the Annual General Meeting until its conclusion.
Resolution 8 – Communications by Electronic Means and Amendment to Articles of Association
This resolution is being proposed in light of the new provisions about company communications, including electronic 
communications (for example via the Company’s website or by email), which have recently been introduced by the Companies 
Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”). The Companies Act 1985 (as amended) (the “1985 Act”) allowed companies to use electronic 
communications in certain contexts, for instance, to send annual accounts and notices of meetings to shareholders. Currently, 
following shareholder approval in 2000, the Company’s Articles of Association permit the Company to communicate with 
shareholders by electronic means as permitted under the 1985 Act, although not by publishing documents on the Company’s 
website. 
The new provisions in the 2006 Act apply more generally to all types of company communications made pursuant to the 2006 
Act. The authority that is being sought by Resolution 8 is consistent with the new arrangements under the 2006 Act and with 
the provisions of the UKLA’s new Transparency Rules which contain additional requirements for listed companies in relation to 
electronic communications. The Resolution also seeks shareholder approval to changes to the Company’s Articles of Association 
to reflect the new arrangements. 
The authority and amendments to the Articles will not of themselves force either the Company or any individual shareholder 
to send or receive notices, documents or information by electronic means. They will, however, allow the Company to 
approach shareholders for their individual agreement to use electronic mail and/or publication on its website for Company 
communications.

Shareholders will at all times be able to request hard copies of any document published electronically and they will be able  
to revoke their consent to the Company communicating with them electronically at any time.
Copies of the existing Articles of Association of the Company and the proposed amended Articles of Association will be available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office, and at the offices of Maclay Murray & Spens LLP at 1 London Wall, London  
EC2Y 5AB, from 19 April 2007 to (and including) the date of the Annual General Meeting during normal business hours on any 
day (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) and will also be available at the Roxburghe Hotel, 38 Charlotte Square, 
Edinburgh for at least 15 minutes before the Annual General Meeting until its conclusion. 
Resolution 9 – Authority to allot shares for cash free from pre-emption rights
This resolution proposes, on the same basis as last year, to disapply pre-emption rights of shareholders on the allotment of 
equity securities for cash up to a limit of 5% of the issued ordinary share capital, being shares to an aggregate nominal value of 
£740,694. The authority under this resolution would expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or 23 August 2008, 
whichever is earlier.
Resolutions 10 and 11 – Authority for the Company to purchase its own shares
The directors consider that it would be advantageous for the Company to renew the authority to purchase its own ordinary 
and 9% cumulative preference shares in case the opportunity presents itself where such course of action would be in the best 
interests of shareholders generally.
Under the terms of these special resolutions the maximum number of shares to be purchased is 5,925,553 ordinary shares 
(representing 10% of the issued ordinary share capital) and 1,394,587 9% cumulative preference shares. The minimum price 
payable is the par value of 25p per ordinary share and £1 per 9% cumulative preference share. The maximum price payable is 
an amount equal to 105% of the average middle market quotations in respect of the ordinary shares and 110% of the average 
middle market quotations in respect of the 9% cumulative preference shares (both as shown in the London Stock Exchange  
Daily Official List) for five business days prior to the date of purchase.
This authority will only be exercised where in the opinion of the Board it is likely to result in an increase in earnings per share  
and would be in the best interests of shareholders generally. Any shares purchased by the Company under this authority will  
be cancelled, unless the shares are purchased by the Company to hold as treasury shares.
These authorities would expire on the date of the next Annual General Meeting or 23 August 2008, whichever is earlier.
Proxy Form
A proxy form, which covers all resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting, is provided for use by holders  
of ordinary shares and should be read in conjunction with the Notice of Meeting. Completed forms of proxy should be returned 
as soon as possible but in any event no later than 12.15pm on Tuesday 22 May 2007. Completion of a proxy form will not prevent 
a shareholder from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting if he/she so wishes.
Appointment of a proxy through CREST 
To appoint one or more proxies or to give an instruction to a proxy (whether previously appointed or otherwise) via the 
CREST system, CREST messages must be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number 3RA50) not later than 48 hours before 
the time appointed for holding the meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined 
by the timestamp generated by the CREST system) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message. For further 
information on CREST procedures, limitations and system timings please refer to the CREST Manual. The Company may treat as 
invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35 (5) (a) of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001.

Introduction
The John Menzies plc 2007 Divisional Performance Share Plan offers executives the opportunity to benefit from the success  
of the Company, as measured by the achievement of target Divisional Financial Results (“DFR”). The DFR for Menzies Distribution 
are based on Operating Profits, Cost Savings and Income from New Revenue Streams, and for Menzies Aviation are based on 
Operating Profits. The DFR relate to the Division of the Company by which the executive who benefits through the award of 
shares is employed.
Shares will vest at the end of three years if DFR reaches targets set by the Board.
The following summarises the main features of the Plan and its operation.
1. Eligibility
Executive directors and senior employees of the Company or its subsidiaries who are selected by the Remuneration Committee 
(for Directors) or the Board (for other executives) are eligible to participate in the DPSP.
2. Grants of Awards 
The Board may, normally within 42 days of the preliminary announcement of the Company’s results, grant to executives an award  
of conditional shares under the rules of the DPSP. An Award Certificate will set out the number of conditional shares being awarded 
and the Performance Targets which will determine the extent to which the number of shares stated in the Award Certificate will vest.
3. Performance Targets
Performance Targets will normally relate to a period of three financial years (‘the Performance Period’), and are intended to be 
challenging. A Threshold and a more demanding Stretch Performance Target for each set of DFR will be set by the Board before 
awards are made. The Stretch Performance Target for each Division has been verified by external remuneration consultants to be 
equivalent to upper quartile performance. Targets will normally be based on improvements to performance measured against DFR 
at the end of the period relative to the DFR at the beginning of the period. The Performance Targets for the first period will be:
      
DFR at the end of the third financial year to December 2009      Percentage award vesting
 
Less than the Threshold Performance Target     Nil
Equal to or greater than the Stretch Performance Target    100%
Greater than the Threshold Performance Target but less than the   To be calculated on a straight line basis, 
Stretch Performance Target        with the total number of shares vesting 
rounded down to the nearest whole number.
 
4. Commencement, Duration and Amendment of the DPSP
The first award under the DPSP will be made 42 days after the adoption of the DPSP by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General 
Meeting. No award may be made more than 10 years after the adoption of the DPSP.
The DPSP may be altered at any time provided that no alteration is made which adversely affects the participants without their 
consent, and no amendments to the advantage of participants or to the definitions of those eligible, Performance Targets or 
Divisional Financial Results may be made without shareholder consent. 
5. Vesting of Shares
The Remuneration Committee (for Directors) or the Board (for other executives) will notify each participant as soon as practicable 
after the end of the Performance Period of the extent to which the Performance Targets have been met and the number of 
shares which will be awarded or vest (if any) for the Performance Period. The Company will thereafter procure the transfer of 
the appropriate number of these vested shares which will represent the post-tax value of this award. The Company will pay the 
relevant income tax on the award, by sale on the participant’s behalf if agreed of the appropriate number of the total vested shares.
The value of the vested shares shall be calculated using the quoted share price at the close of the day prior to which the above 
notification is dated, and the date of the transfer shall be the date of the notification for the purposes of any announcement  
of this dealing in the Company’s shares. 
Summary of the Principal Features 
of the John Menzies plc 2007 Divisional Performance Share Plan
Statements Business Review Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 88 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 89 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 88 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006 89 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2006
6. Dividends
Within 42 days of the transfer of the vested shares, the Company will pay to each participant an amount equal to the net 
dividends which would have been paid during the Performance Period on those shares which actually vest.
7. Taxation
Income tax and national insurance contributions are due on any shares which vest, at the date of vesting, and on any dividend 
payment. All payments or transfers of shares under the DPSP will be made on a net of tax basis as appropriate.
8. Loss of or Limitations on Rights
If a participant leaves the employment of the Group, rights attaching to all shares held for him/her under the DPSP shall 
immediately lapse, although special rules apply on leaving due to ill health, retirement, redundancy, disposal/change of control 
of the Company, death, or in other circumstances where the Remuneration Committee (for Directors) or the Board (for other 
executives) deems it appropriate. Under these special rules, they may determine whether and if so, how many shares will vest, 
taking into account the Performance Targets and how much of the Performance Period has elapsed. 
No share will be transferred to a participant while his/her employment is suspended on grounds of gross misconduct or where 
any statutory, regulatory or other legal provision restricts the Company or the executive from dealing in shares.
No award may be assigned or transferred (except to personal representatives on the participant’s death).
9. Other Matters
9.1 Limit of awards
The maximum annual award for each participant will be limited to 100,000 shares. No more than 10% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company shall be issued pursuant to the DPSP and any other employees’ share scheme in a 10 year period, 
and no more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company shall be issued pursuant to the DPSP and any other 
discretionary executive share option scheme in any 10 year period. 
9.2 Rights 
The inclusion of a participant in this Scheme or the terms of an Award shall not afford the participant any rights or additional 
rights to compensation or damages in consequence of the loss or termination of his/her office or employment with the Group 
for any reason whatsoever (including wrongful or unfair dismissal), or from the lapsing of any share awards. Awards will not be 
pensionable.
9.3 Variation of Share Capital
The number of shares in any award may be adjusted on any variation of the share capital of the Company in such manner as the 
Remuneration Committee deems to be fair and reasonable.
9.4 Change of Control
In the event of a takeover of the Company, awards will vest immediately subject to determination by the Remuneration 
Committee of the extent to which the Performance Targets have been met as at the date of change of control.
9.5 Interpretation 
In the event that there is any difference in the interpretation of the Rules in this Summary and the Rules themselves, then the 
Rules take precedence. Participants may request a copy of the Rules at any time.

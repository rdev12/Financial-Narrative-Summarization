What We Do
Founded in 1987 by the current CEO Andrew Shepherd, the Omega 
business is focused on selling a wide range of specialist products, 
primarily in the immunoassay, in vitro diagnostics (IVD) market within 
three segments: Allergy and Autoimmune, Food Intolerance and 
Infectious Disease.
We’re committed 
to addressing global 
health challenges
How we work
We identify major 
health challenges...
...we form partnerships 
to help find solutions... 1 2
The Company’s global reputation 
stems from its beginnings as a 
manufacturer of tests for a range of 
infectious diseases such as syphilis, 
tuberculosis, dengue fever, chagas 
disease and malaria. This reputation 
led to the opportunity to commercialise 
a ground-breaking CD4 technology.
Partnership with Burnet Institute in 
Australia resulted in Omega securing 
an exclusive global licence to a unique, 
simple, lateral flow point-of-care device 
confirming patient CD4 count is above or 
below 350 cells μl. This has the opportunity 
to greatly reduce the number of patients 
lost to care as a result of the length of 
time between testing and treatment.

Chairman’s Statement
The Group has taken a number of positive 
steps, both during the ﬁnancial year and 
since the year-end.
Achievements during the ﬁnancial year
 – Pre-launch of Visitect
®
 CD4 in 
Washington, US and Cape Town, 
South Africa.
 – Commencement of direct selling 
operations in India and exclusive 
distribution agreement for Food 
Detective
®
 signed with Super Religare 
Laboratories.
 – Award of grant funding of up to £0.15m 
from Scottish Enterprise.
 – Registration of Food Detective
®
 in China.
 – Increase in average revenue per 
Genarrayt
®
 system (excluding Spain) 
by 19% to £12,885.
 – Food Detective
®
 sales exceed £1m 
for the ﬁrst time.
Achievements since the year-end
 – Agreement intending to appoint 
Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings plc 
(“IDS”) as exclusive allergy distributor 
in IDS’ core markets.
 – Appointment of Bill Rhodes as 
a non-executive director.
 – Grant of US patent for CD4.
 – Successful institutional placing raising 
£4m before expenses.
Financial performance
Turnover
Turnover for the Group showed a slight 
increase on the prior year at £11.26 million 
(2012: £11.12 million). Our Food Intolerance 
division grew turnover by 13% with continued 
growth in Genarrayt
®
 revenue, with France 
becoming the largest market by sales. 
Food Detective
®
 also performed well, 
exceeding the £1m sales barrier for the 
ﬁrst time. As reported at the half-year 
stage, the Allergy and Autoimmune division, 
particularly in Germany, was affected by 
the weaker pollen season and Euro exchange 
rate. A part recovery in the second half meant 
that turnover reduced by 7% for the year. 
Infectious Disease turnover was broadly 
unchanged, showing a slight decline 
of 1%, due mainly to a loss of revenue 
(approximately £0.2 million) following 
a ban of blood-based TB tests by 
the Indian government.
Visitect
®
 CD4 remains 
a signiﬁcant near-term 
opportunity for the Group 
and continues to attract 
substantial interest from 
the wider HIV/AIDS 
healthcare community.
In summary

Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements
Gross proﬁt
Gross proﬁt amounted to £7.05 million 
(2012: £7.00 million) and the gross margin 
was practically unchanged at 62.6% 
compared to 63.0% in the previous year. 
This level of gross proﬁt was in line with 
expectation as the Food Intolerance and 
Allergy/Autoimmune divisions generate 
similar levels of gross proﬁt.
Adjusted Proﬁt before Taxation
The Group generated an adjusted proﬁt 
before tax (“adjusted PBT”) of £0.78 million 
compared to £1.00 million in the previous 
year. The reduction was mainly due to 
two reasons; ﬁrstly, the effect of increased 
costs associated with the direct subsidiary 
operation in India occurring at the same 
time as the loss of revenue from TB tests 
referred to above; and secondly, due to 
a reduced contribution from the Omega 
GmbH allergy business in Germany, for 
the reasons referred to above. There is 
a reconciliation between adjusted PBT 
and statutory PBT below the income 
statement on page 31.
Taxation 
The Group continues to beneﬁt from 
an enhanced level of R&D tax allowances. 
Due to the increase in capitalised development 
expenditure, which qualiﬁes for the 
aforementioned tax allowances, there is a 
tax credit of £0.31 million in the year compared 
to £0.05 million in the previous year.
Adjusted EPS
Given the tax credit situation above, the Group 
achieved an adjusted proﬁt after tax of £1.09 
million (2012: £1.05 million) resulting in adjusted 
earnings per share of 1.3p (2012: 1.2p). 
Balance sheet
Assets
 Intangible assets increased to £10.35 million 
(2012: £9.14 million) reflecting the level of 
capitalised development expenditure, offset by 
amortisation of intangible assets. There have 
been no impairment charges against goodwill 
or intangible assets throughout the year.
 Inventory levels increased marginally to 
£1.83 million (2012: £1.69 million) and reﬂect 
the additional need to carry inventory within 
our Indian subsidiary.
 Cash at the year-end reduced to £0. 16 million 
(2012: £1.16 million) reﬂecting the level of 
investment in development activity and loan 
repayments collectively exceeding cash 
generated from operating activities.
Liabilities
 Trade and other payables increased 
to £1.68 million (2012: £1.45 million).
 Total borrowings and other ﬁnancial liabilities 
reduced to £1.35 million (2012: £1.43 million) 
due mainly to repayment of loans of £0.5m 
and settlement of an IDS-iSYS licence fee 
instalment of £0.13 million, offset by the 
creation in the year of the liability for the ﬁnal 
licence fee payment of £0.5 million due to IDS.
Funding
During the ﬁnancial year, the Company 
negotiated an increase to its overdraft facility 
from £0.7 million to £1.7 million, repayable 
on demand. The facility was renewed at the 
beginning of May for one year, prior to the 
institutional placing announced on 24 May 
2013. Further to the approval of shareholders 
given at the general meeting on 10 June, 
the Group raised £4 million before expenses 
through the issue of 23,529,412 new ordinary 
shares at 17p per share. The placing was 
oversubscribed and we are very grateful for 
the support of existing and new shareholders 
alike. The additional funds will enable us 
to implement our main strategies below.
Product strategy
Visitect
®
 CD4
Feedback from the global HIV/AIDS 
healthcare community continues to underpin 
the signiﬁcance of the opportunity represented 
by the Company’s Point-of-Care (“POC”) 
Visitect
®
 CD4 test. Subject to a successful 
completion of the technology transfer from the 
Burnet Institute to the Company, a large part of 
the placing proceeds (see Funding above) will 
be used both to scale up the manufacturing 
and inventory-build of CD4 to meet the 
potential demand that undoubtedly exists 
for a POC product solution and to undertake 
in-country ﬁeld evaluations that are planned 
with major organisations, active in the HIV/AIDS 
arena. The early feasibility work undertaken 
to develop a smartphone App reader is also 
promising in scope and applicability in parts 
of the world where Visitect
®
 CD4 is expected 
to have most impact. This remains the most 
signiﬁcant near-term opportunity for the Group 
to achieve growth in shareholder value and is 
expected to lead to a longer term strategy for 
POC product opportunities in emerging and 
developing world infectious diseases.
Allergy automation
The Group remains focused on launching 
a panel of approximately 40 allergy tests 
on the automated IDS-iSYS instrument 
by the end of March 2014 and the recently 
announced achievement of ﬁnalising the 
assay protocol on which all remaining 
development will take place, along with 
the intention to appoint IDS as distributor 
in their core markets of the UK, Germany, 
France, the Nordic regions and the US 
means we remain committed to building 
a signiﬁcant presence in the growing 
automated allergy testing market.
Market strategy – BRIC focus
The IVD industry as a whole has seen a 
slowdown in growth during 2012 as the 
major European, US and Japanese markets 
have experienced increased pressure on 
reimbursement levels and cuts in national 
health expenditure. By contrast, the emerging 
markets, particularly India and China, have 
continued to experience double-digit growth 
rates. The Group’s decision to set up its 
own subsidiary in India nearly two years ago 
appears prescient against this backdrop and 
is expected to achieve growth both with our 
existing Food Intolerance products and the 
recently launched Allergodip
®
 doctor’s ofﬁce 
test. Both China and Brazil are top-ﬁve 
markets, ranked by sales of Food Detective
®
 
and the relationship with HOB Biotech in 
China is expected to deliver further growth 
in this market.
Board and employees
I am very pleased that we have been able 
to attract and appoint Bill Rhodes as a 
non-executive director to the Board and 
look forward to working with him, given 
his knowledge and experience built up 
over many years, particularly with Becton 
Dickinson, as we implement our strategies 
outlined above. Mike Gurner has decided 
to retire and step down from the Board 
with immediate effect. I would like to thank 
Mike for his contribution over the many years 
since the Group became a public Company 
and I, on behalf of the Board, wish him all 
the best in his retirement.
Outlook
More than half of Group turnover is generated 
in the UK and Europe, predominantly through 
the Food Intolerance and Allergy/Autoimmune 
divisions. The economic uncertainty in this 
region has led to a slowdown in growth in 
European IVD markets and the ability to grow 
our own business is not immune from the 
broader landscape. In Germany in particular, 
the reimbursement picture remains uncertain 
and the early pollen season has once more 
suffered from some of the wettest weather 
seen in Northern Germany for many years. 
Sales in the Middle East have also got off to 
a slower start, in part, linked to the political 
situation. To counter risk in these areas, we 
have a strategy to focus on the emerging BRIC 
markets and our success in growing revenue 
in the year ahead will be dependent on 
whether sales into these higher growth 
territories can compensate for the pressures 
being experienced in Europe and elsewhere.
Beyond the immediate term, our ability to 
drive growth will be best delivered through the 
successful commercialisation of the CD4 test 
and automated allergy tests on the IDS-iSYS 
instrument. A signiﬁcant amount of progress 
has been made in the past year and it is now 
time to deliver on these strategies.

Strategy and KPIs
Omega aims to deliver organic growth from recently acquired 
products, markets and technologies. Omega will also continue 
to pursue acquisition opportunities that are earnings enhancing 
or strategically placed in major growth markets.
A robust strategy for 
tackling worldwide 
health issues
Group strategy
acquisitions
global 
partnerships
signiﬁcant  
growth
The acquisition of the business and certain 
assets of the in vitro allergy diagnostics 
business of Allergopharma Joachim Ganzer 
KG in December 2010 provided the Group 
with access to the high value allergy 
testing market.
In March 2011 the Group entered into an 
exclusive Patent Licence Agreement with 
a subsidiary of Immunodiagnostic Systems 
Group plc (IDS) enabling Omega to develop 
a range of allergy immunoassays on 
IDS’s automated system (IDS-iSYS). 
Combined with Omega’s experience in 
assay development, this forms a strong 
platform for allergy testing.
The global allergy market is currently 
estimated at $0.5 billion per year with 
a compound annual growth rate of 8%. 
The acquisition and partnership represent 
a signiﬁcant opportunity for revenue 
generation in this area.

Chief Executive’s review
The Group has seen a marginal increase 
in revenue for the year to £11.26 million, 
slightly ahead of last year’s ﬁgure 
(2012: £11.12 million). 
It is pleasing to have managed to retain 
proﬁtability in turbulent economic times. 
Our decision to go direct in the Indian 
market has been vindicated with a strong 
performance from the new team. With 
Visitect
® 
CD4, we have been making steady 
progress, with the technology transfer process 
nearing completion and the latest results 
looking very encouraging. In addition, our 
allergy test development programme with 
the IDS-iSYS instrument has also made 
good progress.
Food Intolerance
The Food Intolerance market has 
continued to grow despite the obvious 
pressures on consumer spending in 
Europe and the segment has continued 
to perform very well with sales growing 
by 13% to £4.39 million for the year ended 
31 March 2013 (2012: £3.90 million).
Sales of Food Detective
®
 grew by 
27% to £1.25 million (2012: £0.98 million) 
with Poland continuing to remain as the 
Group’s largest market for this product. 
The number of countries where we have 
now sold product has continued to increase 
to 72 (2012: 68) with an increase in volumes 
to 85,214 kits (2012: 60,782). The top ﬁve 
markets account for just over 50% of sales 
with good growth in China and Brazil which 
ﬁts with the Group’s strategic focus on 
BRIC countries. Product registration in 
China ﬁnally concluded in December 2012 
and as a result, we expect sales in China 
to increase. The signing of an exclusive 
distribution agreement with Super Religare 
Laboratories, India’s largest independent 
laboratory chain, should also lead to 
good sales growth going forward.
Sales of Genarrayt
®
 reagents have 
increased by 18% to £1.84 million (2012: 
£1.56 million) with France overtaking Spain 
to become the largest single market by 
sales. Revenue per instrument (excluding 
Spain) increased by 19% to £12,885 
(2012: £10,783) and 11 Genarrayt
®
 systems 
(2012: 13 systems) were sold in the year 
bringing the total global placements to 
119 systems.
Sales of Foodprint
®
 tests through the 
CNS testing laboratory have grown to 
£0.61 million (2012: £0.48 million). The 
testing services for food intolerance and 
The ‘game changing’ growth 
potential of the Visitect
®
 CD4 
product is expected to make 
a major impact in Global 
Health markets as this test 
satisﬁes a current unmet 
clinical need.
In summary
–  CD4 technology transfer nearing completion
 –  iSYS Allergy programme on track to launch 
40 allergen test menu by end of March 2014
 –  Appointment of Bill Rhodes as a 
Non-Executive Director
 –  Oversubscribed Fundraising to raise £4 million 
in cash before expenses

other related tests have shown an increase 
in business to £0.65 million (2012: £0.62 million). 
The progress with registration of Food 
Detective
®
 in the United States has 
continued to be slow and the FDA has 
recently conﬁrmed that they will require 
either a 510(k) or PMA application to be 
ﬁled. The 510(k) route is considered to be 
the more unlikely option due to the lack of 
a suitable predicate device. As such, the 
timeline to registration remains uncertain. 
The whole business area of Food Intolerance 
testing in the US is under review and other 
additional routes to market are being 
explored, particularly for the Genarrayt
®
 
laboratory testing system which we believe 
has good potential and could be subject to 
a less onerous regulatory environment.
Allergy and Autoimmune
This segment has seen a reduction in sales 
of 7% to £4.16 million (2012: £4.48 million).
Sales for Omega Diagnostics GmbH 
(‘Omega GmbH’), our German subsidiary, 
fell by 7% to £3.59 million (2012: £3.86 
million). As reported at the interim results, 
the ﬁrst half saw a weaker pollen season 
due to unseasonably wet weather. A weaker 
Euro also contributed to the lower result. 
This segment performed better in the 
second half, helped by the launch of an 
Indian version of Allergodip
®
. The Company 
has also launched a new liquid format of 
the Allergozyme
®
 product range which is 
expected to contribute to Omega GmbH’s 
export performance in the new ﬁnancial year.
Sales of autoimmune tests reduced by 7% 
to £0.57 million (2012: £0.62 million). We 
previously reported that the current range 
of autoimmune test kits were limited to small 
labs with manual test systems. Continued 
consolidation in developed country laboratory 
markets mean that they require even more 
automation and menu driven solutions which 
has outpaced our own ability to invest in 
developing revised kit formats. Therefore 
the decision was taken to direct resources 
to the IDS-iSYS project. However, in India, 
a market dominated by many small, manual 
testing laboratories with less dependency 
on automated systems, we have seen an 
increase in business and we expect to see 
further growth in the new ﬁnancial year.
Infectious Disease/Other
Sales of infectious disease products fell 
slightly by 1% to £2.71 million (2012: £2.75 
million). This is despite the loss of annual 
sales of approximately £0.2 million in India 
due to a Government ban on the import 
of blood-based TB tests. The market 
for the current range still remains highly 
competitive but we believe that the 
CD4 opportunity will be the step change 
in activity and focus required to transform 
this segment.
CD4
The CD4 test, branded as Visitect
®
 CD4, was 
pre-launched at the 19th International AIDS 
Conference, AIDS 2012, in Washington DC, 
US on 22-27 July 2012 and the response 
to the product was extremely encouraging 
with a high level of interest being shown by 
various Governments, Non-Governmental 
Organisations (NGOs) and large multinational 
diagnostics companies. From the responses 
received we believe that we are closest to 
bringing a CD4 Point-of-Care test to market 
amongst other groups working in this area. 
This ﬁrst to market advantage will add extra 
impetus to the introduction of the commercial 
product when it becomes available.
The project to transfer the technology from 
the Burnet Institute to Omega is in its ﬁnal 
stages and, despite it taking longer than we 
ﬁrst envisaged, we are now in the process 
of selecting the ﬁnal, highly scalable 
manufacturing protocol. Evaluation sites in 
HIV Reference Laboratories in the UK, US 
and India are already established as well as 
a ﬁeld trial site in Mozambique and other 
countries through various NGOs.
Visitect
® 
CD4 was also showcased at the 
African Society for Laboratory Medicine 
meeting in Cape Town, South Africa in 
December 2012 and the response to 
the product mirrored that in Washington. 
This meeting also gave us the opportunity 
to gain further intelligence as to the market 
potential for the product. The global CD4 
need is expected to grow substantially over 
the next 8 years as countries scale up their 
HIV/AIDS treatment programmes. The number 
of tests is expected to rise from current 2012 
levels of just over 30 million to nearly 60 million 
tests by 2020.
The recent grant of a US Patent for the CD4 
technology also underlines the strong IP 
position for the test which extends the 
current patent protection in South Africa 
and the member states of the African 
Intellectual Property Organisation, with 
patents pending in many other territories.
We have also been looking to enhance the 
value of our Visitect
®
 CD4 product offering 
by responding to requests from Key Opinion 
Leaders to provide a ‘connectivity solution’ so 
that results can be transmitted from rural test 
sites to city-based Ministry locations. Although 
the test does not need an instrument to read 
the result, we have recently completed a 
feasibility study in using a smartphone camera 
to capture the result and then to transmit the 
result to management centres. While removing 
any operator subjectivity in interpreting the 
results, it could also provide additional beneﬁts 
such as disease demographic studies and 
supply chain logistics, a common problem 
found in resource-poor countries.
Distribution network 
Sales growth has been recorded in most 
geographic regions of the world with the 
exception of Europe which reduced by 1% 
to £6.41 million (2012: £6.48 million) and the 
Africa/Middle East region which dropped 
by 4% to £1.56 million (2012: £1.63 million). 
These reductions were more than offset by 
good growth in the Asia/Far East markets 
with sales rising by 9% to £1.44 million 
(2012: £1.32 million) and in the North 
American market by sales rising 6% to 
£0.35 million (2012: £0.33 million). Sales 
to South/Central America rose by 16% 
to £0.51 million (2012: £0.44 million).
BRIC Strategy
In the year, we have further concentrated 
our efforts on expanding our business in 
the BRIC group of countries and we have 
met with some success. In Brazil we 
increased sales by 10% to £0.29 million 
(2012: £0.26 million); in China we increased 
sales by 49% to £0.18 million (2012: £0.12 
million) but in Russia sales decreased by 
31% to £0.10 million (2012: £0.15 million) 
which was due to the timing of contract 
deliveries and the introduction of 
competitive automated systems.
Direct sales in India commenced at the end 
of July last year and the team has achieved 
an impressive sales performance which, 
when aggregated with the ﬁnal sales made 
by the old distributor in the three months of 
April-June 2012, meant total Indian sales 
of approximately £0.40m for the year. This 
compares to a prior year like-for-like sales 
ﬁgure of approximately £0.20 million (which 
excludes the TB product sales noted earlier).
Discussions have also been taking place 
with other IVD companies with a view to 
representing them in the Indian market 
and two distribution agreements have 
already been signed with others in 
early stage discussions.  12

Research and development
IDS-iSYS
During the year, our development efforts 
have focussed on a core set of assays with 
the ﬁrst group of 10 allergens completing 
optimisation. However, during that process, 
certain imprecision issues were identiﬁed 
with the assay protocol which, whilst taking 
longer to resolve than ﬁrst anticipated, have 
now been resolved. This protocol will now 
be used throughout the remaining 
development programme and the claim 
support phase with the ﬁrst 10 allergens 
has now commenced. The previous 
problem with the sourcing of sufﬁcient 
patient serum samples has now been 
resolved with enough material in stock 
to undertake the optimisation and claim 
support work for a further 30 allergens. 
Therefore, with the reproducibility of the 
chosen protocol, overall, we now anticipate 
launching a panel of 40 allergens by the 
end of March 2014.
In our last Annual Report we commented 
on efforts to either source or develop a 
multiplex testing platform for allergen 
speciﬁc IgE testing. Whilst those initial tests 
were encouraging, no further efforts have 
been made on this project as we decided 
to concentrate our development resources 
on the iSYS programme. 
Infectious Disease
At the same time as we licensed the 
CD4 test from the Burnet Institute we also 
licensed a second test technology for 
a POC test for detecting active Syphilis 
infection which is a major public health 
problem in developing countries. Progress 
with the technology transfer of this product 
has not advanced due to the time, effort 
and concentration being expended on CD4. 
We expect to renew our efforts with this test 
upon completion of the technology transfer 
of the CD4 test.

Outlook
The new ﬁnancial year presents some 
challenges for the management team 
in terms of market and overall economic 
conditions. With new product introductions 
into key markets such as India and further 
growth in Food Intolerance in China and 
Brazil we expect to be able to respond 
positively to these challenges. The ‘game 
changing’ growth potential of the Visitect
®
 
CD4 product is expected to make a major 
impact in global health markets as this 
test satisﬁes a current unmet clinical need.
Over the last year, we have been given 
deep insight into the NGO/Aid-related business 
sector which is where the Visitect
®
 CD4 test 
is targeted. Until now, this sector has not been 
at the forefront of our commercial focus but 
we are reviewing this part of our strategy with 
a view to identifying other opportunities that 
would ﬁt into this sector. One such opportunity 
that may exist is in the area of HIV Viral Load 
testing, an area which is highly complementary 
to CD4 testing.
We have been delighted at the support 
received from existing shareholders and 
new investors for our recent oversubscribed 
fundraising and while there are challenges 
in the Eurozone countries, we believe our 
continued focus on new products such as 
CD4 and the BRIC markets should result 
in further proﬁtable growth.

Segmental Review: Infectious Diseases
The Company is pursuing an exciting new opportunity represented 
by its new Point-Of-Care (POC) Visitect
®
 CD4 test. POC testing for 
CD4 could transform the way that care and treatment are provided 
to HIV-positive patients particularly in developing countries.
Infectious Diseases: 
a change in activity 
and market focus
Turnover in the Infectious Disease division 
was effectively ﬂat with sales of £2.71 million, 
compared to £2.75 million in the prior year. 
This result is despite the loss of TB sales in 
India due to a government ban on the import 
of all blood-based TB tests and which, in 
the prior year, accounted for approximately 
£0.2 million of the Company’s revenue. 
The market for the current range still remains 
highly competitive but we believe that the 
CD4 opportunity will be the step change 
in activity and focus required to transform 
this segment. The increased level of 
administration costs incurred through the 
Indian subsidiary has resulted in adjusted 
PBT falling to £0.17 million from £0.32 million 
the year before.

 CD4: Point-Of-Care HIV testing
HIV is a major global health challenge affecting 
approximately 33 million people with ﬁve million 
new cases per year, mainly in the emerging 
and developing world, and is the primary 
cause of disease burden in twelve countries, 
including South Africa and India where we 
have people present. 
The Burnet Institute has developed a test that provides an 
affordable solution, using a format similar to a home pregnancy test. 
Implementation of the Visitect
®
 CD4 will directly increase the availability, 
access, scope and coverage of CD4 testing beyond the urban centres 
to reach the rural majority in emerging and developing countries. 
Substantially increasing the number of people with access to CD4 
testing will reduce morbidity and mortality, decrease hospitalisation 
and loss to treatment.

Segmental Review: Allergy & Autoimmune and Food Intolerance
A competitive 
automated allergy 
system and the ﬁfth 
year of consecutive 
growth in Food 
Intolerance sales
Segmental review: Allergy 
and Autoimmune
Turnover in the Allergy and Autoimmune 
division fell by 7%, with sales of £4.16 million 
compared to £4.48 million in the prior year. 
Sales in Germany fell by 2% in constant 
currency terms due to a weaker pollen 
season, with a further 5% reduction due 
to a weaker euro, on average throughout 
the year, against sterling as compared with 
the year before. Therefore, sales through 
Omega GmbH were £3.59 million compared 
to £3.86 million a year earlier. Sales of 
autoimmune products also fell by 7% 
to £0.57 million (2012: £0.62 million). 
Approximately £50k of restructuring costs 
related to this division and, alongside the 
reduced sales, led to an adjusted loss before 
tax of £20k (2012: proﬁt of £134k). This 
segment performed better in the second 
half, helped by the launch of an Indian 
version of Allergodip
®
. The Company has 
also launched a new liquid format of the 
Allergozyme
®
 product range which is 
expected to contribute to Omega GmbH’s 
export performance in the new ﬁnancial year.

The Food Intolerance division continued 
to perform well with growth in turnover of 
13% to £4.39 million (2012: £3.90 million). 
Genarrayt

 reagent sales continued to rise 
across the installed instrument base with 
a 19% increase in average revenue per

placements to 119. Total reagent sales grew 
to £1.84 million with France becoming the 
number one market, ranked by sales, ahead 
of Spain. Sales of Food Detective

IDS-iSYS update
Since the beginning of April 2012 (when six allergens had been 
optimised), a further four allergens were optimised by the end of 
November 2012, at which point, it was decided to concentrate on 
ﬁnalising the assay protocol, whilst building up sufﬁcient quantities 
of patient serum samples for the next 30+ allergens to be optimised. 
The assay protocol has now been ﬁnalised and sufﬁcient stocks of 
patient sera now exist. The work still to be done includes claim 
support of the ﬁrst group of ten allergens followed by optimisation/
claim support of the remaining allergens groups to meet the 
planned target of launching a panel of 40+ tests by March 2014.
The main revenue stream will be from allergy test sales to new and 
already installed analyser customer base, either directly or through 
appropriate distribution channels. The fundamental change in strategy 
is the amendment of the IDS licence agreement which now allows 
Omega to appoint IDS as an exclusive distributor in IDS core markets 
(UK, Germany, France, Nordic countries and US). This will allow 
access to a pre-installed base of approximately 340 instruments 
and an established service engineer’s base. This agreement with 
IDS will allow accelerated market penetration.

Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
Financial performance
Turnover for the Group increased marginally 
by 1% to £1 1.26 million (2012: £1 1. 12 million). 
The Food Intolerance division increased 
turnover to £4.39 million (2012: £3.90 million) 
with Genarrayt
®
 reagent sales per instrument 
of £12,885, compared to £10,783 in the 
previous year and Food Detective
®
 kits 
generating revenue of £1.25 million (2012: 
£0.98 million). Allergy and Autoimmune 
turnover fell to £4. 16 million (2012: £4.48 million) 
due mainly to a weaker euro against sterling, 
as compared to the prior year, but also due 
to wet weather, as reported at the half-year, 
affecting the pollen season resulting in fewer 
patient visits to doctors. Turnover in the 
Infectious Disease division reduced slightly 
to £2.71 million from £2.75 million in the 
year before.
Gross proﬁt has remained fairly constant at 
£7.05 million (2012: £7.0 million) and similarly, 
gross margin has been maintained at 62.6% 
(2012: 63.0%).
Administration costs have reduced 
marginally by £22k to £4.45 million (2012: 
£4.47 million). An increase of £0.15 million 
relating to costs incurred in being fully 
operational through Omega Dx (Asia) in 
India has been offset by a reduction, mainly 
relating to uncapitalised development/
technical expenditure of approximately 
£0.27 million. One-off restructuring costs 
of approximately £0.1 million were incurred 
during the ﬁrst half of the year. 
Sales and marketing costs have increased 
by £0.28 million to £2.30 million (2012: £2.02 
million). £0.26 million of this increase reﬂects 
a full year’s charge in the current year for four 
UK-based headcount positions recruited at 
varying stages in the prior year; one at Director 
level, one at Business Development director 
level and two product manager positions. The 
remaining increase of £18k reﬂects additional 
sales force costs incurred in India.
Adjusted proﬁt before tax reduced by 
22.5%, to £0.78 million (2012: £1.0 million). 
A reconciliation between statutory proﬁt 
before tax and adjusted proﬁt before tax is 
shown at the foot of the income statement.
Taxation
There has been a signiﬁcant increase in 
the tax credit position resulting in a credit 
of £306k (2012: £48k) in the year. Of this credit, 
£16k relates to HMRC rebates and the majority, 
of £290k, relates to movements in deferred tax. 
The deferred tax asset has grown signiﬁcantly, 
mainly reﬂecting an increase in tax losses 
carried forward as a result of enhanced tax 
credits available on development expenditure. 
The deferred liability has increased during the 
year as a result of a timing difference arising on 
capitalised development expenditure. Prior year 
adjustments to the tax charge arise when there 
are differences between estimated ﬁgures 
chargeable to tax and ﬁnal tax computations.
Our recent equity placing 
to raise £4m was completed 
very successfully and was 
signiﬁcantly over-subscribed.
In summary
–  Successful equity placing to raise £4m completed 
and over-subscribed
–  Growth of 13% in Food Intolerance sales
 –  Increase in average revenue per Genarrayt

Earnings per share
Adjusted proﬁt after tax (“PAT”) of £1.08 million 
(2012: £1.05 million) is arrived at by taking 
adjusted proﬁt before tax of £0.78 million 
(2012: £1.0 million) plus the tax credit of 
£0.30 million (2012: £48k). 
Adjusted earnings per share amounted to 
1.3p (2012: 1.2p) and is arrived at by taking 
the adjusted PAT of £1,085k and dividing 
by 85,268,960 (2012: 85,238,7 46) being the 
weighted average number of shares in issue 
for the year. Statutory proﬁt for the year 
amounted to £582k (2012: £527k) which 
resulted in earnings per share of 0.7p 
versus earnings per share of 0.6p in the 
previous year. 
Operational performance
Food Intolerance
The Food Intolerance division continued to 
perform well with growth in turnover of 13% to 
£4.39 million (2012: £3.90 million). Genarrayt

reagent sales continued to rise across the 
installed instrument base with a 19% increase 
in average revenue per instrument to £12,885 
(2012: £10,783) in all markets excluding Spain. 
A further 1 1 systems were installed in the year 
increasing total placements to 119. Total 
reagent sales grew to £1.84 million (2012: 
£1.56 million) with France becoming the 
number one market, ranked by sales, 
ahead of Spain.
Sales of Food Detective
®
 performed 
strongly with an increase in turnover of 
27% to £1.25 million (2012: £0.98 million) 
with another exceptional performance 
in Poland where sales grew by a further 
£0.1 million to £0.3 million. The overall 
average price per kit (excluding China) 
also increased to £22.01 from £21.64 the 
year before, showing a level of resilience 
in a consumer market environment.
The Foodprint
®
 laboratory recorded another 
year of revenue growth of 26% with sales 
up to £0.61 million (2012: £0.48 million).
The adjusted PBT for this division grew to 
£1.23 million from £1. 14 million the year before.
Allergy and Autoimmune
Turnover in the Allergy and Autoimmune 
division fell by 7%, with sales of £4.16 million 
(2012: £4.48 million). Sales in Germany fell 
by 2% in constant currency terms due to 
a weaker pollen season, with a further 5% 
reduction due to a weaker euro, on average 
throughout the year, against sterling as 
compared with the year before. Therefore, 
sales through Omega GmbH were £3.59 
million compared to £3.86 million a year 
earlier. Sales of autoimmune products also 
fell by 7% to £0.57 million (2012: £0.62 million). 
Approximately half of the restructuring costs 
referred to earlier (so approx. £50k) related 
to this division and, alongside the reduced 
sales, led to an adjusted loss before tax of 
£20k (2012: proﬁt of £134k).
Infectious Disease/Other
Turnover in the Infectious Disease division 
was effectively ﬂat with sales of £2.71 million, 
compared to £2.75 million in the prior year. 
This result is despite the loss of TB sales 
in India due to a government ban on the 
import of all blood-based TB tests and 
which, in the prior year, accounted for 
approximately £0.2 million of the Company’s 
revenue. The increased level of administration 
costs incurred through the Indian subsidiary 
has resulted in adjusted PBT falling to £0.17 
million from £0.32 million the year before.
Corporate costs
Net centralised costs include costs not 
allocated to any speciﬁc division and, where 
the Group makes internal arrangements 
to fund divisions via intercompany loans, 
interest is charged to the speciﬁc division 
and the corresponding interest income is 
netted off through Corporate costs. Net 
centralised corporate costs for the year 
of £0.60 million were in line with last year 
(2012: £0.58 million).
Treasury operations
Currency management
The Group continues to transact operations 
in three main currencies being sterling, euros 
and US dollars. In the case of transactions 
in euros and US dollars, the Group may 
be exposed to ﬂuctuations in the rates of 
exchange against sterling. Where possible, 
the Group operates a natural hedge by 
entering into transactions of both a buying 
and selling nature that limits the risk of 
adverse exchange rate losses. The Company 
generates a net surplus of US dollars from 
its trading activities. The exchange rate 
between sterling and the US dollar has 
been relatively stable throughout the year 
such that a translation loss of £1k (2012: 
£1k) was recorded on US dollar borrowings 
held throughout the ﬁrst half of the year 
but now repaid in full, along with a loss 
on trading operations of £2k (2012: £22k) 
included within Administration costs.
The Group’s net investment in and funding 
of Omega GmbH is in euros, which will give 
rise to foreign exchange variations from 
one period to another. In the year, a foreign 
exchange gain of £27k (2012: loss of £271k), 
which has arisen due to a stronger euro 
(as measured at year-end rates), has been 
included within other comprehensive income.
Interest rate management
During the ﬁrst half of the year, the Group 
operated certain derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments for its sterling and US dollar 
borrowings. In the case of its sterling loan, 
the Group operated an instrument to cap 
interest at 5.5% and in the case of the US 
dollar loan, the Group operated instruments 
to cap the interest rate based on US Libor at 
5% and one to operate a ﬂoor rate on US 
Libor of 2.25%. These instruments terminated 
on repayment of the associated borrowings. 
During the year, there was a fair value 
adjustment gain through the income 
statement of £1k (2012: £3k). 
Cash ﬂow and net debt
Net cash ﬂow generated from operations 
improved signiﬁcantly to £1.01 million (2012: 
£0.69 million), despite a reduction in operating 
proﬁt, through a more efﬁcient handling 
of working capital. The Group spent a net 
£1.49 million (2012: £1.20 million) on investing 
activities, of which £1.18 million (2012: £0.75 
million) was on intangible assets and £0.31 
million (2012: £0.45 million) was on property, 
plant and equipment. Loan repayments 
included the ﬁnal repayments of the bank 
loans taken out in 2007 and a ﬁrst instalment 
of £0.36 million was repaid in September 2012 
on the vendor loan note. Cash balances at 
the year-end amounted to £0.16 million 
(2012: £1.16 million) and the net debt position 
was £0.69 million (2012: £0.14 million).
Financing
Just after the year-end, the Company 
renewed its £1.7 million overdraft facility 
on the same terms as before and it remains 
annually renewable and repayable on 
demand. In June, approval was received 
in General Meeting for the allotment of 
23,529,412 new ordinary shares at 17p 
per share which were admitted to trading 
on AIM. This follows a successful equity 
placing to existing and new institutional 
shareholders to raise £4 million (before 
expenses of approximately £0.24 million). 
The placing was oversubscribed and we 
are grateful for the good level of support 
shown for the Group’s strategy. This leaves 
the Group with a very strong cash position.
Capital management
The ﬁnancial performance of the Group 
is measured and monitored on a monthly 
basis through a combination of management 
reporting and KPIs. The Group manages its 
working capital requirements to ensure it 
continues to operate within the covenant limits 
applicable to any borrowing facilities whilst 
safeguarding the ability to continue to operate 
as a going concern. The Group funds its 
operations with a mixture of short and 
long-term borrowings or equity as appropriate 
with a view to maximising returns for 
shareholders and maintaining investor, creditor 
and market conﬁdence. The use of funds for 
acquisitions is closely monitored by the Board 
so that existing funds are not adversely 
impacted by such activity and the Board 
reviews and approves an annual budget to 
help ensure it has adequate facilities to meet 
all its operational needs and to support future 
growth in the business.

Directors’ Report 24
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
Employees
The Group encourages communication with its employees and favours an environment where staff can put forward their ideas, 
suggestions and concerns on any matter that involves them. The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment 
made by disabled people, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Where an employee becomes disabled in the course 
of their employment, where possible, arrangements will be made for appropriate retraining to match their abilities with their duties.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board meets regularly to review operations and to discuss risk areas. The Corporate Governance Report contains details 
of the Group’s system of internal control. Note 22 to the ﬁnancial statements contains details of ﬁnancial risks faced by the Group.
The Board considers the following to be the non-ﬁnancial risks:
General economic conditions
The Group may be faced with changes in the general economic climate in each territory in which it operates that may adversely affect the 
ﬁnancial performance of the Group. Factors which may contribute include the level of direct and indirect competition against the Group, 
industrial disruption, rate of growth of the Group’s sectors and interest rates. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by conducting 
operations on a broad geographic basis and by introducing new technologies to remain innovative.
Regulatory risk
The manufacturing, marketing and use of the Group’s products are subject to regulation by government and regulatory agencies in many 
countries. Of particular importance is the requirement to obtain and maintain approval for a product from the applicable regulatory agencies 
to enable the Group’s products to be marketed. Approvals can require clinical evaluation of data relating to safety, quality and efﬁcacy 
of a product. The Group seeks to mitigate regulatory risk by conducting its operations within recognised quality assurance systems and 
undergoes external assessment to ensure compliance with these systems.
Acquisition risk
The success of the Group depends upon the ability of the Directors to assimilate and integrate the operations, personnel, technologies 
and products of acquired companies. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by selecting companies that meet certain selection criteria 
and by conducting a detailed due diligence review.
Eurozone risk
Recent turmoil in the economic conditions in Europe increases the risk of one or more countries exiting the eurozone. This could lead to 
currency devaluation in those countries which could lead to adverse economic impacts elsewhere. Approximately one third of the Group’s 
revenue is derived in Germany where the euro is the functional reporting currency. The Group does not currently have operations located 
in any other European country. However, in the event of a country’s exit from the eurozone, potentially higher volatility of the euro could 
lead to a reduction in the reported trading results of our German operation when translated into sterling. The Group mitigates risk in 
countries such as Spain and Italy, where it has trading relationships, with tighter credit control procedures and credit limits where 
necessary.
Development risk
The Group is undertaking an increased level of development activity than in the past with the aim of launching new products in the future. 
There is no guarantee that development activity will lead to the future launch of products. Such development activity can meet technical 
hurdles that are unable to be overcome and market and competition activity can render the output from development activities as obsolete. 
The Group seeks to mitigate the risk around development activities by ensuring that development programmes are planned in accordance 
with recognised industry quality standards, managed by people with the requisite skills. The Company also continues to monitor industry 
trends and customer needs to ensure its development targets remain relevant.
Donations
The Group made no charitable donations in the year (2012: £Nil) nor any political donations (2012: £Nil).
Auditors
The auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in ofﬁce and a resolution for their re-appointment will 
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on page 23. Having made 
enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of these Directors conﬁrms that:
 − to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information (that is, information needed by the Group’s auditors 
in connection with preparing their report) of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
 − each Director has taken all the steps a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.

The Board currently comprises: one Non-executive Chairman; two Non-executive Directors; and three Executive Directors, who are the 
Chief Executive, the Finance Director and the Sales and Marketing Director. David Evans, Non-executive Chairman, and Michael Gurner 
and Bill Rhodes, both Non-executive Directors, are considered by the Board to be independent in character and judgement. Michael Gurner 
is the senior independent Non-executive Director. The Board meets at regular intervals and is responsible for setting corporate strategy, 
approving the annual budget, reviewing ﬁnancial performance, agreeing the renewal of and any new banking/treasury facilities and approving 
major items of capital expenditure. The Board is provided with appropriate information in advance of Board meetings to enable it to discharge 
its duties effectively. Bill Rhodes was appointed to the Board as a Non-executive Director on 1 May 2013. 
During the ﬁnancial year, the Board met on ten occasions. Of the ten meetings David Evans and Jag Grewal attended eight, Michael Gurner 
attended nine and Andrew Shepherd and Kieron Harbinson attended all ten.
The Chairman has additional non-executive directorships of the following companies:
 − Epistem Holdings plc
 − Momentum Biosciences Limited
 − Scancell Holdings plc
 − EKF Diagnostics plc
 −Cytox Limited
 − Venn Life Sciences plc
 − Diagnostic Capital Limited
 − Lochglen Whisky Limited
 − St Andrews Golf Art Limited
 − Horizon Discovery Limited
 − Spectrum Limited (Rainbow Seed Fund)
 − OptiBiotix Health Limited
 − Marine Biotech Limited
 − Collbio Limited
 − Integrated Magnetic Systems Limited
 − Healthcare Opportunity Investments plc
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has met on two occasions during the year and once since the year end. The Committee is comprised of David Evans, 
as Chairman, and Michael Gurner and has primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring that the ﬁnancial 
performance of the Group is properly measured and reported on, and for reviewing reports from the Group’s auditors relating to the 
Group’s accounting and ﬁnancial reporting, in all cases having due regard to the interests of shareholders. The Committee shall also 
review preliminary results announcements, summary ﬁnancial statements, signiﬁcant ﬁnancial returns to regulators and any ﬁnancial 
information contained in certain other documents, such as announcements of a price-sensitive nature. Bill Rhodes has been appointed 
to the Audit Committee and will replace Michael Gurner who is stepping down from the Board on 1 July 2013.
The Committee considers and makes recommendations to the Board, to be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the Group’s external auditors. The Committee also oversees the 
relationship with the external auditors including approval of remuneration levels, approval of terms of engagement and assessment of their 
independence and objectivity. In so doing, they take into account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements and the relationship 
with the auditors as a whole, including the provision of any non-audit services. Ernst & Young LLP have been auditors to Omega Diagnostics 
Limited (ODL) since 2000 and were appointed as auditors to the Group following completion of the reverse takeover of ODL in September 2006.
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls and has considered the need for an internal 
audit function. At this stage of the Group’s size and development, the Committee has decided that an internal audit function is not required, 
as the Group’s internal controls system in place is appropriate for its size. The Committee will review this position on an annual basis.
The Committee also reviews the Group’s arrangements for its employees raising concerns, in conﬁdence, about possible wrongdoing in 
ﬁnancial reporting or other matters. The Committee ensures that such arrangements allow for independent investigation and follow-up action.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has met on three occasions during the year. The Committee is comprised of Michael Gurner, as Chairman, 
and David Evans and has primary responsibility for determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration of the Company’s Chief Executive, 
Chairman, Executive Directors, Company Secretary and such other members of the Executive management as it is designated to 
consider. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors of the Board. 
No Director or manager shall be involved in any decisions regarding their own remuneration. Bill Rhodes has been appointed to the 
Remuneration Committee and will replace Michael Gurner.
Corporate Governance Report 28
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness throughout the year. Such a system 
can only provide reasonable assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Board monitors ﬁnancial controls through the setting and approval of an annual budget and the regular review of monthly 
management accounts. Management accounts contain a number of indicators that are designed to reduce the possibility of misstatement 
in ﬁnancial statements.
Where the management of operational risk requires outside advice, this is sought from expert consultants, and the Group receives 
this in the areas of employment law and health and safety management.
The Group is compliant with industry standard quality assurance measures and undergoes regular external audits to ensure that 
accreditation is maintained.
Communication with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of communication with its shareholders. The Group maintains informative websites for Omega 
Diagnostics Limited, Cambridge Nutritional Sciences Limited and Omega GmbH containing information likely to be of interest to existing 
and new investors. In addition, the Group retains the services of ﬁnancial PR consultants, providing an additional contact point for investors. 
The Board encourages shareholder participation at its Annual General Meeting, where shareholders can be updated on the Group’s 
activities and plans.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the Business Review, which runs on pages 4 to 5 and pages 10 to 13 and pages 18 and 19. The ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash 
ﬂows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 18 and 19. In addition, Note 22 to the 
ﬁnancial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for its ﬁnancial risk management objectives; details of its 
ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. The recent renewal of overdraft facilities as 
well as the successful fundraising of £4 million means that the Group has signiﬁcant ﬁnancial resources together with long-term relationships 
with a number of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and fully capitalise on the 
new product opportunities despite the current uncertain economic outlook. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual ﬁnancial statements.

Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare Group and Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year end. Under company law, the 
Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they present fairly the ﬁnancial position of the Group 
and Company, ﬁnancial performance of the Group and cash ﬂows of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing the Group 
and Company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
 − select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently;
 − present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
 − provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance;
 − state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial 
statements; and
 − make judgements and estimates that are reasonable.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Group’s and Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the ﬁnancial position of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Group and Company ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding assets 
of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 30
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2013 which comprise the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Company Balance Sheet, Company Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Cash Flow Statement 
and the related Notes 1 to 23. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 29, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance 
that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report and Group Financial 
Statements to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
 − the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 
and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended;
 − the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 − the parent Company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 − the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 − adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
 − the parent Company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 − certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
 − we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
1 Authorisation of ﬁnancial statements
The ﬁnancial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2013 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors 
on 28 June 2013, and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by David Evans and Kieron Harbinson. Omega Diagnostics 
Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on AIM.
2 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these ﬁnancial 
statements. These ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling and have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU 
and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In relation to IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, the Group has identiﬁed the Executive Board as the chief operating decision maker with 
responsibility for decisions over the allocation of resources to operating segments and for the monitoring of their performance. The Group 
reports performance of the following three segments:
 − Allergy and Autoimmune
 − Food Intolerance
 − Infectious Disease and Other
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC and the entities it controls 
(its subsidiaries). Control comprises the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain beneﬁt from its 
activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, 
being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The ﬁnancial 
statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are based on consistent accounting 
policies. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised proﬁts arising from them, are eliminated.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the acquisition method. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Goodwill is 
not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may be impaired a charge is made to the income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually 
at business segment level or statutory Company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual 
or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition at fair value at the acquisition date, the historic 
cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets with a ﬁnite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives, with 
charges included in administration costs, as follows:
Technology assets – 5–20 years
Customer relationships – 5–10 years
Supply agreements – 5 years
Other intangibles – 5 years
Software – 5 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research and initial feasibility work is written off through the income statement as incurred. Thereafter, expenditure on 
product development which meets certain criteria is capitalised and amortised over its useful life. The stage at when it is probable that the 
product will generate future economic beneﬁts is when the following criteria have been met: technical feasibility; intention and ability to sell 
the product; availability of resources to complete the development of the product; and the ability to measure the expenditure attributable 
to the product. The useful life of the intangible asset is determined on a product-by-product basis, taking into consideration a number 
of factors. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives, on a straight line basis as follows:
Land and property – 33 years, straight line with no residual value
Leasehold improvements – 10 years, straight line with no residual value
Plant and machinery – 8 to 10 years, straight line with no residual value
Motor vehicles – 5 years, straight line with no residual value
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives are reviewed annually 
and, where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively.
Impairment of assets
The Group and Company assess at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, the Group and Company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset 
does not generate cash inﬂows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their net present value, using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to that asset. Impairment losses on continuing 
operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is deﬁned as standard cost or purchase price and includes all 
direct costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling 
price less any further costs expected to be incurred prior to completion and disposal. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at the lower of original invoice amount and recoverable 
amount. A provision for doubtful amounts is made when there is objective evidence that collection of the full amount is no longer probable. 
Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty or signiﬁcantly extended settlement periods are considered to be indicators of impairment. Normal average 
payment terms vary from payment in advance to 90 days. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as remote. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less.
Financial instruments
Under IAS 39, ﬁnancial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Financial assets are classiﬁed as either:
 − ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss; or
 − loans and receivables.
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce its exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest rates, both in sterling and US dollars. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments with positive fair values 
are recognised as assets measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined 
by reference to market values for similar instruments that have similar maturities. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income 
statement included in ﬁnance costs, due to the fact that hedge accounting has not been applied.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables that do not carry any interest and have ﬁxed or determinable payment amounts that are not quoted in an active market 
are classiﬁed as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables with a maturity of less than twelve months are included in current assets and 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as either:
 − ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss; or
 − other liabilities. 40

Financial instruments continued
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce its exposure to ﬂuctuations in interest rates, both in sterling and US dollars. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments with negative fair values 
are recognised as liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined 
by reference to market values for similar instruments that have similar maturities. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income 
statement included in ﬁnance costs, due to the fact that hedge accounting has not been applied.
Other ﬁnancial liabilities, whether used as part of the consideration for acquisitions which include deferred consideration or not, are designated 
by the Group as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt and loss. They are measured at the present value of the consideration expected 
to be payable by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at prevailing interest rates. At initial recognition, the quantum of liability to be 
recognised will depend upon management’s expectation, at that date, of the amount that would ultimately be payable. Where there is 
a change in the expectation of future cash ﬂows or interest rates, the change is reﬂected through the income statement.
Other liabilities
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Bank borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
For long-term bank borrowings stated at amortised cost, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the borrowing instrument are 
recognised as an interest expense over the life of the instrument.
A ﬁnancial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an 
existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and recognition of the 
new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised.
Financial assets and liabilities that are held for trading and other assets and liabilities designated as such on inception are included at fair 
value through proﬁt and loss. Financial assets and liabilities are classiﬁed as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term. 
Derivatives are also classiﬁed as held for trading unless they are designated as hedge instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet 
at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. 
Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost. The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Presentation currency
The ﬁnancial statements are presented in UK pounds sterling. Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the prevailing 
rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Foreign currencies
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net proﬁt or loss for the year. The trading results of the overseas subsidiaries 
are translated at the average exchange rate ruling during the year, with the exchange difference between the average rates and the rates 
ruling at the balance sheet date being taken to reserves. Any difference arising on the translation of the opening net investment, in the 
overseas subsidiaries, and of applicable foreign currency loans are dealt with as adjustments to reserves. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes. Sales of 
goods are recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. This will be when goods have 
been dispatched and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue relates to the sale of medical diagnostic kits.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect that the grants will be received and that all related conditions will be met, 
usually on submission of a valid claim for payment. Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income 
account and are released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under ﬁnance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter 
of their lease period and useful life. The corresponding lease or hire purchase obligation is capitalised in the balance sheet as a liability. 
The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals applicable to operating leases, where substantially all the beneﬁts and risks remain with the lessor, are charged against proﬁts 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
For equity-settled transactions, the Group measures the award by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and it is 
recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. 
Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and 
performance (vesting conditions), other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be 
non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining grant date fair 
value. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or 
non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisﬁed, provided 
that all other performance conditions are satisﬁed.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of vesting conditions and of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting as described above. 
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are not met. The movement in 
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁed or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost 
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over 
the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modiﬁcation, based on the difference between the fair value 
of the original award and the fair value of the modiﬁed award, both as measured on the date of the modiﬁcation. No reduction is 
recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in 
the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Pension contributions
Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a deﬁned contribution basis are charged to the income statement in the year 
in which they are payable.
The Group also operates two deﬁned beneﬁt plans in Germany, which are closed to new members. Obligations under deﬁned beneﬁt 
plans are measured at discounted present values by actuaries, while plan assets are recorded at fair value. The operating and ﬁnancing 
costs of pensions are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise and are recognised separately. The difference 
between actual and expected returns on assets during the year, including changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based 
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the ﬁnancial statements, with the following exceptions:
 − where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss;
 − in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
 − deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax and deferred tax is charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited 
or charged in other comprehensive income or directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax and deferred tax is recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of these ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The signiﬁcant areas of estimation and uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the accounting policies that have the most 
signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial information are discussed overleaf. Further judgements, assumptions 
and estimates are set out in the Group ﬁnancial statements. 42
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
2 Accounting policies continued
Use of estimates and judgements continued
Valuation of intangible assets
Management judgement is required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets, having reference to future economic beneﬁts 
expected to be derived from use of the asset. Economic beneﬁts are based on the fair values of estimated future cash ﬂows.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test considers future cash ﬂow projections of cash-generating units that give rise to the 
goodwill. Where the discounted cash ﬂows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recognised for the difference. 
Further analysis of the estimates and judgements is disclosed in Note 8.
Deferred tax assets
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable proﬁts together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. The carrying value of the 
deferred tax asset at 31 March 2013 is £553,647 (2012: £150,332). Further details are contained in Note 14.
New standards and interpretations not applied 
IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective 
date after the date of these ﬁnancial statements.

In his Budget speech on 20 March 2013, the Chancellor announced that the main UK corporation tax rate would be reduced from 
the current rate of 24% to 20% by 2015. The rate of corporation tax reduced from 28% to 26% on 1 April 2011 and a reduction to 24%, 
effective from 1 April 2012, was included in the Finance Bill that was enacted on 17 July 2012. A further reduction in the corporation 
tax rate to 23%, effective from 1 April 2013, was also included in the Finance Bill.
As the reduction in the rate to 23% was enacted at the balance sheet date, this is the rate at which deferred tax has been provided. 
The further rate reductions are to be incorporated within future legislative acts and so will not be substantively enacted until later 
periods. The estimated impact of the proposed further rate reduction to 20% would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by £7,272. 46

Equity-settled share-based payments
Consolidated and Company
The share-based payment plans are described below. 
EMI Option Scheme and Unapproved Option Scheme
The plans are equity-settled plans and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plans, share options are granted to 
Directors and employees of the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant. 
The options vest one year after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.

Second Unapproved Option Scheme (SUOS)
The plan is an equity-settled plan and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plan, share options may be granted 
to third parties for provision of services to the Company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares 
on the date of grant. The options vest three years after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
Under the EMI Option Scheme 135,000 options lapsed during the year and a further 1,450,000 were granted.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options during the year:

Model used Black-Scholes Black-Scholes
The expected life of the options is based on management’s assumption of the options’ life due to the lack of any historical data on the 
exercise period of these options. The assumption takes into account the experience of employees and Directors and is not necessarily 
indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reﬂects the assumption that historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the option is indicative of future trends, 
which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Impairment testing of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill 
is indicated in the table above. The net book value of goodwill above for Genesis-CNS amounts to £3,016,892 (2012: £3,016,892), Co-Tek 
£332,986 (2012: £332,986) and Omega GmbH £1,334,900 (2012: £1,323,063).
The recoverable amount of Genesis-CNS, Co-Tek and Omega GmbH has been determined based on a value in use calculation using 
cash ﬂow projections based on the actual results for the year ended 31 March 2013 and the ﬁnancial budget approved by the Board covering 
the period to 31 March 2014, with projected cash ﬂows thereafter through to March 2017 based on a growth rate of 3% per annum. The key 
assumptions used in the budget for Genesis-CNS are the sales projections which are predicated on the continued success of the Genarrayt
®
 
and Food Detective
®
 assays being commercialised on an international basis and the gross margins which can be achieved from the sales of 
these products. The key assumption used in the budget for Co-Tek is the growth in sales of the Company’s Micropath™ range of products 
where increased volumes are dependent upon having accessed a lower manufacturing cost through the acquisition of Co-Tek itself. The 
budget for Omega GmbH assumes continued organic growth in sales in the German market as well as achieving an increase in export sales 
through the existing Omega international distribution network. The Omega GmbH forecast also includes revenues in years two to ﬁve from 
the IDS-iSYS platform which will allow more rapid processing of higher volume tests.
In all three cases, the Company also makes assumptions in regard to having sufﬁcient production personnel to cope with increased volumes. 
The discount rate applied to cash ﬂows is 12.5% for the Group which takes account of other risks speciﬁc to each segment such as currency 
risk, geography and price risk. The discount rate is the weighted average cost of pre-tax cost of debt ﬁnancing and the pre-tax cost of 
equity ﬁnancing. Cash ﬂows beyond the budget period are extrapolated for Genesis-CNS, Co-Tek and Omega GmbH over the next four 
years using a growth rate of 3% that equates to the current growth rate in the IVD industry. Thereafter, a nil growth rate has been assumed 
for prudence. As a result, there has been no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill.
Sensitivity analysis
Base forecasts show headroom of £4.7 million above carrying value for Genesis-CNS, headroom of £410,000 above carrying value for 
Co-Tek and headroom of £800,000 for Omega GmbH. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to assess the impact of any reasonably 
possible change in key assumptions. If the growth rate were to drop from 3% to 1% this would have the effect of reducing the headroom 
in Genesis-CNS by £191,000 over ﬁve years, in Co-Tek by £29,000 over ﬁve years and in Omega GmbH by £45,000 over ﬁve years.
For Genesis-CNS, the discount rate would have to increase to 48% or the growth rate would have to be a decline of 81% for the headroom 
to reduce to £Nil.
For Co-Tek, the discount rate would have to increase to 55% or the growth rate would have to be a decline of 37% for the headroom 
to reduce to £Nil.
For Omega GmbH, the discount rate would have to increase to 22% or the growth rate would have to be a decline of 44% for the headroom 
to reduce to £Nil.

18 Retirement beneﬁt obligations
The Group operates pension schemes for the beneﬁt of its UK and overseas employees.
Details of the deﬁned contribution schemes for the Group’s employees are given below in Note (a). Details of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes 
for the Group’s German employees and details relating to these schemes are given below in Note (b). During the year Group accounted 
for these pension schemes under IAS 19 – Employee Beneﬁts.
a) Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group makes contributions to personal plans of employees on a deﬁned contribution basis. The Group does not have ownership 
of the schemes, with individual plans being arrangements between the employee and pension provider. For new hires in Germany, post 
1 January 2011, the support fund (LV 1871 Unterstutzungskasse e.V) is the deﬁned contribution scheme used. The total Group contributions 
for the year amounted to £62,775 (2012: £57,713).  54

18 Retirement beneﬁt obligations continued
b) Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The Deutscher Pensionsfonds AG and the LV 1871 Unterstutzungskasse e.V schemes give the rights to deﬁned future beneﬁts. 
Of these beneﬁts the past service component is based on years of service and salary as of 1 January 2011 and are provided by the 
Deutscher Pensionsfonds AG. The remaining beneﬁts based on years of service after 1 January 2011 as well as salary increases are 
provided by the LV 1871 Unterstutzungskasse e.V scheme. These are mainly dependent on the number of earning years and salary level 
at pension age. The commitments are covered through an insurance company and are compliant with the requirements of German 
insurance laws. Pension costs relating to each scheme operating in Germany are charged in accordance with IAS 19 – Employee Beneﬁts. 
Formal valuations of each scheme have been carried out by Towers Watson (Reutlingen) GmbH, who are independent, professionally 
qualiﬁed actuaries, on 2 May 2013 using the following assumptions:

IAS 19 (Revised) – Employee Beneﬁts will become effective for the Group in the March 2014 accounts. Under IAS 19 (Revised), there will 
be no impact on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability. The net charge to next year’s income statement will increase by approximately £6,300 
following the introduction of the concept of recognising net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability in place of the interest on the deﬁned 
beneﬁt obligation and the expected return on plan assets recognised under the current standard. This increase in the net charge to next 
year’s income statement would be offset by a decrease in the charge to other comprehensive income.

21 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net proﬁt for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Diluting events are excluded from the calculation when 
the average market price of ordinary shares is lower than the exercise price.

or deducting the tax charge in order to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of ﬁnancial performance in the year, 
so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better assess trends in ﬁnancial performance.

Within other loans designated at fair value through proﬁt and loss is the vendor loan note of £1.1 million, which was issued in September 2007 . 
It carries a coupon of base rate only and is repayable in three equal instalments of £360,000 in September 2012, 2013 and 2014 and a ﬁnal 
capital payment of £20k in September 2015. The interest is rolled up and repayable with the ﬁnal capital payment. The fair value is calculated 
as the future cash ﬂows expected to result based on current estimates of interest rates. There has been no change in the year to the fair value 
of the loan due to changes in credit risk. The movement in the year of £338,781 (2012: £28,154) is due to the ﬁrst instalment being paid 
in September 2012 (£360,000) offset by the effect of unwinding discount factors (£21,219), which is included within ﬁnance charges 
in the income statement.
Financial risk management
The principal ﬁnancial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, credit, liquidity and interest rate. 
These risks are managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates in more than one currency jurisdiction and is therefore exposed to currency risk on the retranslation of the income 
statement and the balance sheet of its overseas subsidiaries from euros and rupees into its functional currency of pounds sterling. 
The Company funds its subsidiaries by a mixture of equity and intercompany loan ﬁnancing and these balances are subject to exchange 
rate movements that can give rise to movements in equity. The Group also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than the 
functional currency, principally in euros and US dollars. The Group has US dollar and euro-denominated bank accounts and, where possible, 
the Group will offset currency exposure where purchases and sales of goods and services can be made in these currencies. The Group’s 
non-sterling revenues, proﬁts, assets, liabilities and cash ﬂows can be affected by movements in exchange rates. It is currently Group policy 
not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind but this will be monitored by the Board to determine whether it is appropriate 
to use additional currency management procedures to manage risk. At 31 March 2013 (and 31 March 2012) the Group has not entered 
into any hedge transactions.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in currency rates on the Group’s proﬁt before tax and equity through 
the impact of sterling weakening against the US dollar, the euro and the Canadian dollar.

Net investment in overseas subsidiary 5% — 98,112
An increase in currency rate of 5% would have a similar but opposite effect. The sensitivity around bank loans above represents the entire 
impact on the Company’s proﬁt before tax and equity.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The Group conducts its operations in many countries, so there is 
no concentration of risk in any one area. In most cases, the Group grants credit without security to its customers. Creditworthiness checks 
are undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers, and credit limits are set as appropriate. The Group conducts most of 
its operations through distributors and is therefore able to maintain a fairly close relationship with its immediate customers. As such, the 
Group monitors payment proﬁles of customers on a regular basis and is able to spot deteriorations in payment times. An allowance for 
impairment is made that represents the potential loss in respect of individual receivables where there is an identiﬁable loss event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ﬂows. The amounts presented in the balance sheet 
are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An analysis of trade receivables from various regions is analysed in the following table:

Capital management
An explanation of the Group’s capital management process and objectives is set out in the Capital management section on page 19 
of the Financial Review.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain sufﬁcient headroom to meet its foreseeable ﬁnancing and working capital requirements. The Group 
has in place drawn loan facilities and, in the case of bank loans, regularly monitors performance to ensure compliance with all covenants. 
The Group also maintains a surplus balance of cash and cash equivalents to ensure ﬂexible liquidity to meet ﬁnancial liabilities as they fall due.

Fair values 
The carrying amount for all categories of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities disclosed on the balance sheet and in the related notes to the accounts 
is equal to the fair value of such assets and liabilities as at both 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012. The monetary value attributable to 
these ﬁnancial assets and liabilities is the same value that has been disclosed in the related notes to the accounts.
The valuation methods used to fair value the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities have been disclosed in Note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements under 
the heading of Financial instruments.
The carrying amount recorded in the balance sheet of each ﬁnancial asset as at 31 March 2013 and 31 March 2012, including derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a signiﬁcant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly; and
Level 3:  techniques which use inputs which have a signiﬁcant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
The fair value of the ﬁnancial derivatives, detailed below, have been valued using the hierarchy above and have been categorised as level 2.

Notice of Annual General Meeting 62
Omega Diagnostics Group PLC Annual Report and Group Financial Statements 2013
Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
Entitlement to attend and vote
1.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001, 
the Company speciﬁes that only those members registered on the Company’s 
register of members at 6pm on 26 August 2013 shall be entitled to attend and 
vote at the Meeting.
Appointment of proxies
2.  If you are a member of the Company at the time set out in Note 1 above, you 
are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, 
speak and vote at the Meeting and you should have received a proxy form with 
this notice of meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set 
out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
3.  A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend 
the Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the 
Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the 
notes to the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the 
Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) 
and give your instructions directly to them.
4.  You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to 
exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than 
one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than 
one proxy, please contact the registrars of the Company, Share Registrars 
Limited, on 01252 821 390.
5.  A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be 
counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting 
indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her 
discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks 
ﬁt in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting.
Appointment of proxy using hard-copy proxy form
6.  The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote 
on each resolution or withhold their vote.
To appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:


and Lamb Yard, Farnham, Surrey GU9 7LL or by facsimile transmission 
to 01252 719 232;

proxies@shareregistrars.uk.com;
and received by Share Registrars Limited no later than 11am on 26 August 2013.
In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed 
under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an ofﬁcer of the company or 
an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed 
(or a duly certiﬁed copy of such power or authority) must be included with the 
proxy form.
Appointment of proxy by joint members
7.  In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports 
to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder 
will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names 
of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in 
respect of the joint holding (the ﬁrst-named being the most senior).
Changing proxy instructions
8.  To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment 
using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off time for receipt 
of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended 
instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant 
cut-off time will be disregarded.
  Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would 
like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form, please 
contact Share Registrars Limited on 01252 821 390.
  If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received 
last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.
Termination of proxy appointments
9.  In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company using 
one of the following methods:
  By sending a signed hard-copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke 
your proxy appointment to Share Registrars Limited at Suite E, First Floor, 
9 Lion and Lamb Yard, Farnham, Surrey GU9 7LL or by facsimile transmission 
to 01252 719 232. In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation 
notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an 
ofﬁcer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney 
or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly 
certiﬁed copy of such power of authority) must be included with the revocation notice.
  In either case, the revocation notice must be received by Share Registrars 
Limited no later than 11am on 26 August 2013.
  If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received 
after the time speciﬁed then, subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy 
appointment will remain valid.
  Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting 
and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the Meeting 
in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
Corporate representing
10.  Corporate members are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate 
representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure.
Issued shares and total voting rights
11.  As at the date of this Annual Report the Company’s issued voting share 
capital comprised 108,745,669 ordinary shares of 4p each. Each ordinary 
share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, 
therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company is as at the date 
of this Annual Report.
Communications with the Company
12.  Except as provided above, members who have general queries about the 
Meeting should telephone Kieron Harbinson on +44(0)1259 763 030 (no other 
methods of communication will be accepted). You may not use any electronic 
address provided either in this notice of annual general meeting, or any related 
documents (including the proxy form), to communicate with the Company for 
any purposes other than those expressly stated.
Voting through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST 
electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting and 
any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. 
CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer 
to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to 
be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be 
properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo Limited’s speciﬁcations and 
must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the 
CREST Manual.
The message, regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or 
to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, 
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent 
(7RA36) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments speciﬁed above. 
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined 
by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in 
the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to 
proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
providers should note that CRESTCo Limited does not make available special 
procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and 
limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. 
It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed 
a voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that 
a message is transmitted by means of CREST by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or 
voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy instruction in the circumstances 
set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.

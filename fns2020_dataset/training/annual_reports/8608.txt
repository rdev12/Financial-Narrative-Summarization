Dear Shareholder,
Your Board is pleased to report 
on what has been another good 
year for Sainsbury’s. We have 
outperformed the market, as we 
have done for a number of years, 
by providing great quality, value 
and service, and by remaining 
true to our values and heritage.
We have improved profits while continuing to invest 
significantly in strengthening the business for the 
future. Underlying profit before tax was up 6.2 per 
cent to £756 million. Underlying basic earnings per 
share were up 9.3 per cent to 30.7 pence. This year 
your Board recommends a final dividend of 11.9 
pence per share, making a full year dividend of 16.7 
pence, which is an increase of 3.7 per cent over the 
previous year, and which is covered 1.83 times by 
underlying earnings. Sainsbury’s remains focused 
on delivering returns to shareholders and the Board 
continues to plan to increase the dividend each  
year while building cover to two times over the 
medium term.
Sainsbury’s Bank
The Bank, started in 1997, has delivered five 
consecutive years of profit growth. Its pre-tax  
profit this year was £59 million, half of which  
accrues to Sainsbury’s shareholders. The Bank  
has built customer loyalty by offering good quality,  
value-for-money financial products together  
with attractive rewards and Nectar points. 
We have now reached an agreement with 
Lloyds Banking Group to acquire its 50 per cent 
shareholding and take full ownership of Sainsbury’s 
Bank. We are confident this is a move which will 
benefit customers and shareholders, allowing  
the full future potential of the Bank to be realised. 
We have strengthened the management of the Bank 
and its Board during the course of the last 12 months. 
Peter Griffiths joined as CEO of Sainsbury’s Bank last 
autumn and Roger Davis became Chairman in May 
2013. Each brings wide retail banking experience  
at a senior level to the Bank.

David T yler, Chairman 3 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
The value of our values
Our unique values and strong culture are at the 
heart of our success, and this remains as true today 
as it was when we were founded 144 years ago.  
Our ambitious 20x20 Sustainability Plan sets out 
our future commitments and is key to the long-term 
sustainability of our business. It is contributing to 
greater efficiency, stronger supplier partnerships, 
deeper customer loyalty and increased colleague 
engagement, all of which ultimately generate and 
enhance shareholder value.
Outlook
The wider economic situation looks likely to remain 
challenging, but we have consistently demonstrated 
we can succeed against this backdrop. Furthermore, 
we see exciting growth opportunities as we bring  
our great food, clothing and general merchandise  
to more customers across multiple channels,  
via our focused space, new technology and new 
business programmes. 
We remain committed to delivering value for 
shareholders and growing profits while making 
investments for the future. The foundations for 
growth are in place and your Board believes this 
positions us well to achieve our vision to be the most 
trusted retailer, where people love to work and shop. 
David Tyler
Chairman
A winning team
I would like to thank all of our 157,000 colleagues 
for their efforts in providing excellent service to our 
customers. Our people are the face of Sainsbury’s 
and are central to our success. We continue to invest 
in their training and development, and in ensuring 
Sainsbury’s is a great place to work. I am delighted 
that they share in a record bonus of over £90 million 
this year, meaning that over the last five years we 
will have awarded over £350 million to colleagues  
in this way.
In December 2012, Anna Ford stood down as a Non-
Executive Director of our plc Board. I would like to 
thank Anna for the contribution she has made since 
her appointment in 2006, both as a valued member 
of the Board and as Chairman of our Corporate 
Responsibility Committee. During her tenure, 
Corporate Responsibility has become an integral 
part of the Group’s business and we have benefited 
tremendously from Anna’s experience and skills.
We appointed Jean Tomlin to the plc Board  
in January 2013. She chairs the Group’s  
Corporate Responsibility Committee and sits on  
the Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
Jean’s experience and breadth of skills will be a  
great addition to the Board and we welcome her  
to Sainsbury’s.
In addition, we have appointed Lady Susan Rice 
as a Non-Executive Director to the plc Board with 
effect from June 2013. Her extensive retail banking 
experience, mainly at NatWest and Lloyds Banking 
Group, is particularly relevant to us given our 
agreement to acquire full ownership of Sainsbury’s 
Bank, and we also welcome her to Sainsbury’s.
Gwyn Burr, Customer Service and Colleague 
Director, left the Operating Board in March 2013. 
Gwyn played a key role in delivering our business 
turn round and I am delighted that she will 
continue in her role as a Non-Executive Director of 
Sainsbury’s Bank. In January 2013, we welcomed 
Angie Risley on to our Operating Board as Group HR 
Director. Angie was previously Group HR Director at 
Lloyds Banking Group and Whitbread, and brings a 
wealth of experience having worked at Board level  
in a number of large customer-facing companies.

Awards – the fifth time in seven years – as well  
as Convenience Chain of the Year for the third  
year running. 
With 23 million customer transactions a week, an 
increase of over 800,000 on last year, we believe 
our promise to help people Live Well For Less is 
more relevant than ever. Our customers trust us to 
make their lives simpler and easier and to help them 
save time and money. They are confident about the 
quality, provenance and integrity of the products 
they buy from us across all price brackets. 
We have continued to address price perception. 
Brand Match, now in its second year, is reassuring 
customers that they won’t pay more for brands 
at Sainsbury’s than at either Asda or Tesco. We 
are also able to offer meaningful and targeted 
promotions through Nectar – the UK’s largest loyalty 
scheme – and our coupon-at-till technology. Nearly 
12 million Sainsbury’s customers regularly use their 
Nectar loyalty card when they shop with us and 
the programme remains a source of considerable 
competitive advantage.
Great food
Our great food offer, in particular the strength and 
breadth of our own-brand products, is a key driver of 
growth and loyalty. Own-brand is outperforming the 
market as well as many branded equivalents, with 
most customers buying across our ranges – from 
basics to by Sainsbury’s and Taste the Difference. 
The relaunch of our core by Sainsbury’s range, 
which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of sales, is 
now complete, with many products new or improved. 
It has been very well received by our customers 
and is growing ahead of our major competitors’ 
comparable products.
Compelling general  
merchandise & clothing
Sales of general merchandise and clothing continue 
to grow – at more than twice the rate of food over 
the year. We offer customers high street quality and 
style at supermarket prices and this is proving to 
be very successful. We also know that our non-food 
offer builds overall customer loyalty and, with only 
around a third of the population – up from 11 per cent 
five years ago – living within a 15 minute drive of our 
full non-food range, there are plenty of opportunities 
for future growth.
A year like no other
This truly has been a year like no other. The Queen’s 
Diamond Jubilee festivities were not dampened 
by the great British weather, and the endeavours 
of our Olympians and Paralympians uplifted and 
inspired us as a nation. We were enormously proud 
to play our part in both events – as a partner for the 
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Beacons and Thames River 
Pageant, and by becoming the first-ever Paralympic-
only sponsor of the London 2012 Paralympic Games.
For Sainsbury’s too, it has been a year like no other 
as we helped more customers than ever before to 
Live Well For Less. With 33 consecutive quarters of 
like-for-like sales growth our market share is at its 
highest level for a decade and we are outperforming 
our major competitors. Our clear and proven long-
term strategy continues to drive good sales and 
profit growth. 
Our vision is to be the most trusted retailer, where 
people love to work and shop. Our success rests 
on the 157,000 colleagues working in our stores, 
depots and support centres. It is due to their hard 
work and dedication that we were once again named 
Supermarket of the Year at the Retail Industry 
Business review
Chief Executive’s letter
Dear Shareholder,
We have delivered good sales and 
profit growth, with significant market 
outperformance. We are succeeding 
because we work hard to understand 
what our customers want, and we 
offer them quality and value every day 
through our promise to help people 
Live Well For Less. We will continue  
to invest in creating the best quality 
own-brand products, delivering first-
rate service and bringing our food, 
clothing and general merchandise  
to more customers.
Justin King, Chief Executive 5 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Market share
and organisations to ensure that the next generation 
of Paralympic athletes get the support and coaching 
they need. Building on our support of British 
Athletics’ Paralympic programme, I am delighted 
that we are sponsoring the Sainsbury’s Summer 
Series – three world-class athletics events being 
held this summer in Birmingham and at the Queen 
Elizabeth Olympic Park in London. 
Being a great place to work is an essential part of  
our business plan. This is not only important to us 
but also to our customers – they consistently tell  
us that how we treat our colleagues is their number 
one priority for corporate responsibility. This 
year we have seen our highest levels of colleague 
engagement and commitment and we were 
recognised as the Employer of the Year by  
Retail Week.
In addition, Sainsbury’s was once again rated global 
sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
and continued to be listed in the FTSE4Good Index.
Looking forward
Looking forward to the year ahead, whilst the 
economic climate is likely to remain challenging, 
we are well positioned to succeed for you, our 
shareholders, through the continued delivery of  
our long-term strategy for growth and by helping  
our customers Live Well For Less.
Justin King
Chief Executive
Complementary channels & services
Our long-standing investment in complementary 
channels and services continues to deliver. The 
amount customers spend more than doubles 
when they shop in our supermarkets, convenience 
stores and online. Sainsbury’s Locals now account 
for nearly a third of the UK’s convenience market 
growth with sales of over £1.5 billion and year-on-
year growth of over 17 per cent. Annual sales in our 
groceries online business are at nearly £1 billion and 
continue to grow at around 20 per cent. 
Sainsbury’s Bank has enjoyed another successful 
year, with our share of joint venture post-tax profit 
up 38 per cent to £22 million and an eight per cent 
increase in active customer accounts over the 
year. We have reached an agreement to take full 
ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank by acquiring Lloyds 
Banking Group’s 50 per cent shareholding for £248 
million, which comprises cash consideration for 
the shares of £193 million and the purchase of £55 
million of loan stock. Developing complementary 
channels and services is a core part of Sainsbury’s 
long-term strategy for growth and our ownership of 
the Bank will enable its full potential to be realised. 
Developing new business
Our targeted programme of new business 
development continues, with Sainsbury’s pharmacies 
now open in over 270 stores and in three hospitals. 
Sainsbury’s Energy has achieved an 83 per cent 
increase in customers over the year and we are 
finding new ways to offer a range of digital products 
and services, from eBooks to Mobile Scan & Go. 
Growing space &  
creating property value
We continue to deliver against our space growth 
plans, with the return to what we consider to be a 
prudent and steady state of growth. This year we 
opened just over one million sq ft of space adding 14 
new supermarkets, 87 convenience stores and eight 
extensions to our estate. Our property portfolio is 
now valued at £11.5 billion and we generated £66 
million of property profit from sale and leaseback 
activity in the year.
Our values make us different
We know that our values make us different from 
other supermarkets, and our customers and 
colleagues expect Sainsbury’s to do the right thing. 
Our 20x20 Sustainability Plan, published in 2011, lays 
out 20 commitments, each linked to one of our five 
core values. The plan provides a clear focus to our 
corporate responsibility programme – from doubling 
the amount of British food we sell, to positive 
commitments on the environment. In November,  
we updated on the progress we have made so  
far and further information is provided in this  
annual report. 
Our values continue to be a source of long-term 
sustainable advantage and great pride. One example 
is our involvement in the London 2012 Paralympic 
Games. From the start we aimed to be much more 
than a sponsor and to play our part in ensuring 
the success of the Games, as well as creating a 
lasting legacy. Our legacy programme has already 
contributed £2 million of funding for schools, clubs

Our 
marketplace
Many commentators assumed 
that the challenging economic 
climate would lead to low prices 
becoming the primary motivator 
in supermarket shopping. Yet 
consumer behaviour shows a 
more complex picture – one where 
quality and values remain an 
important part of the ‘is it good 
value?’ equation.
As in previous years, the UK economic climate in 
2012/13 continued to be challenging. Consumers 
remained under pressure as inflation again 
outstripped wage growth, as it has done for the last 
four years, putting pressure on disposable income 
and squeezing household budgets (chart 1). 
There has been a slight improvement in consumer 
confidence during the year due to low interest rates 
and falling unemployment (chart 2); however, it 
remains resolutely negative. Despite this slightly 
increased confidence and a small increase in 
discretionary spending power, there has not been 
a commensurate increase in consumer spending 
(chart 3). Although the outlook has improved over 
the year, consumer confidence remains depressed, 
largely due to rising living costs, limited wage 
increases in real terms, job insecurity and changes  
to tax and benefits (chart 4). 
Over the past few years, we have seen significant 
changes in consumer behaviour, changes that 
we believe will continue over the coming years. 
Consumers have adapted to economic challenges 
by rediscovering the savvy housekeeping habits of 
earlier generations, leading to fundamental changes 
in the way they live and shop. There has been a shift 
to people buying slightly less in their weekly grocery 
shop and then topping it up locally in convenience 
stores. Across all demographics customers are more 
price conscious than ever, looking for discounts 
and offers to help them save money and make their 
household budget go further (chart 5). They are 
saving money by planning their meals ahead, writing 
and sticking to a shopping list, wasting less and using 
leftovers creatively for an extra meal or packed 
lunch (chart 6). 
The credit crunch has not led to a values crunch. 
Instead, the downturn has led to a strengthening of 
values irrespective of income, as people carefully 
consider their spending decisions. Consumers have 
greater expectations of the goods and services 
they buy and are more interested than ever in 
the integrity of products and the companies they 
buy from. They want complex questions solved on 
their behalf and are prepared to pay a fair price 
for quality products. Across all age ranges and all 
demographics shoppers are looking for quality, 
values and value from companies they trust (chart 7).
Our ‘Make Your Roast 
Go Further’ campaign 
encouraged customers 
to put less food in the bin 
and more money in their 
pockets by using their 
leftovers for an extra meal

Developing  
new business
Developing new business and investing 
beyond our core is an important part 
of our long-term strategy for the 
future. We are moving into areas that 
are a natural extension of our brand – 
such as pharmacy, energy and digital 
entertainment.
We have a clear, long-term 
strategy to deliver our vision  
of being the most trusted  
retailer where people love  
to work and shop
Complementary

People have more choice than ever 
before of where, how and when to do 
their shopping. We offer a winning mix 
of supermarkets, convenience stores 
and a full online grocery and general 
merchandise offer. 
Growing space  
& creating  
property value
We have a clearly defined strategy for 
growing space and increasing property 
value. This falls into three main areas 
– new supermarkets, adding space to 
existing stores through extensions and 
new convenience stores.
Great food
Fresh food is at the heart of what we 
do. The quality and value of our food, 
combined with our strong ethical 
standards and supplier relationships, 
differentiate us from other  
supermarkets and help our  
customers to Live Well For Less.
Compelling  
general merchandise 
& clothing
Our strategy of offering customers high 
street quality and style at supermarket 
prices is proving to be highly successful, 
with sales of general merchandise  
and clothing growing at over twice  
the rate of food.  12  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 12

Our customers trust us to provide high 
quality food that is safe to eat, and 
whose provenance is clear. We found no 
horsemeat in any of our products. This 
is testimony to our exacting standards 
and to the DNA and other testing we have 
been carrying out regularly for many 
years to ensure the integrity and safety 
of our food.
Sainsbury’s is committed to fishing 
responsibly and helping to change 
UK fish-eating habits. In January, 
we launched our second ‘Switch the 
Fish’ campaign. This was designed to 
encourage people to try lesser-known 
sustainable fish, with over five tonnes of 
lemon sole, mussels, Cornish sardines, 
coley fillets and loch trout fillets 
distributed over the three day campaign. 
Sales of these alternative species 
increased by 59 per cent following the 
campaign.
One pound in every five spent on fresh 
fruit and vegetables in UK supermarkets 
is spent at Sainsbury’s, because our 
customers trust the quality, integrity and 
provenance of our offer. We were the 
biggest volume retailer of British apples 
and pears for the fourth year running.
We offer a fresh counter service in over 
500 of our stores and sales from these 
counters are continuing to grow and 
outperform the market. Much of this 
success is driven by the enthusiasm,  
skill and expertise of over 20,000 
colleagues who have benefited from  
City & Guilds’ accredited training in our 
seven food colleges.
 
Ethical trading is a cornerstone of  
our food offer and with sales this year  
of £319 million we are once again the  
largest Fairtrade retailer in the world.  
All our bananas and own-brand tea, 
coffee and sugar are Fairtrade. Since 
2007 we have given over £20 million  
to projects in developing countries from 
sales of bananas alone.
We know people want to eat more local 
food, and support British farmers. We 
source food from the UK whenever it 
is available and the quality is of the 
standard our customers expect. We are 
committed to doubling the amount of 
British food we sell by 2020.
We are proud of our close and long-
standing relationships with our suppliers. 
We operate 10 Development Groups 
for farmers and growers across dairy, 
beef, pork, lamb, veal, eggs, chicken, 
cheese, wheat and produce and we 
have invested over £40 million in these 
groups since 2006. In May 2012, following 
an overwhelming majority vote from 
Sainsbury’s Dairy Development Group 
farmers, we adopted a unique ‘Cost of 
Production’ payment model for milk. 
This increased the price we paid to dairy 
farmers and continues to reward them for 
good animal welfare and environmental 
responsibility. We also paid a premium 
to our Pork Development Group farmers 
when they faced rising feed prices.
Customers increasingly buy into our 
own-brand food offer, which has grown 
by nearly five per cent in the year and 
now accounts for half of our food sales. 
The successful re-launch of our core by 
Sainsbury’s range is now complete with 
over 6,500 lines, many of which are new 
or improved. Sales grew ahead of our 
major competitors’ comparable ranges 
and by Sainsbury’s won the prestigious 
Grocer Gold Own Label Brand of the Year 
award. Our Taste the Difference range 
is also growing strongly at nearly 10 per 
cent and is gaining market share. Basics 
continues to be the second biggest selling 
supermarket value brand in the UK, 
purchased regularly by customers who 
buy across our own-brand ranges.

for children’s

Parents appreciate the great value and 
quality of our childrenswear ranges and 
our biggest ever schoolwear event last 
summer delivered a sales increase of  
25 per cent. We sold over one million polo 
shirts, 630,000 pairs of boys’ trousers 
and 272,000 girls’ skirts, consolidating 
our position of number four in the 
schoolwear market by volume. Another 
huge success has been our investment 
in children’s fancy dress, where we are 
second in the UK market by value. 
General merchandise sales outperformed 
the market, driven in part by strong sales 
on occasions such as Mother’s Day, Back 
to School and our bi-annual sales, as well 
as by the events unique to the year – the 
Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, Olympics and 
Paralympics. We sell more bakeware than 
our major competitors and as a result 
of our compelling offer and improved 
in-store experience, we are now the UK’s 
seventh largest retailer for homeware  
by value.
We have grown market share across all 
four categories of entertainment – film, 
music, games and books – in what is a 
challenging market. We secured exclusive 
versions of some of the biggest DVD 
releases of the year including Avengers 
Assemble, The Hunger Games, War Horse 
and Ice Age 4. In the first week of its 
release, we achieved over 25 per cent 
market share on Skyfall – the biggest-
selling DVD in the market since Mamma 
Mia in 2008.
Our non-food offer builds customer 
loyalty – customers who buy clothing and 
general merchandise, as well as food, 
shop with us more frequently and spend 
more than those who only buy food.  
In February, we achieved the significant 
milestone of £1 billion in annual general 
merchandise sales, a reflection of the 
investment we have made in space and 
the quality of our offer.
Two thirds of the UK population are still 
not within a 15 minute drive of our full 
non-food offer and only one in five of our 
supermarkets has a full non-food range. 
Future store extensions therefore present 
opportunities for growth in this area. 
Our successful Tu clothing ranges are 
increasingly popular with our customers 
and have enjoyed strong double-digit 
growth during the year. Tu is the seventh 
biggest clothing line in the UK by volume 
and has risen to twelfth place by value. 
The sales of women’s jeans increased 
by over 80 per cent after the successful 
roll-out of our new Denim Shop format, 
and our exclusive Gok for Tu collections, 
designed to be versatile, fashionable and 
flattering, continue to be hugely popular 
with our customers. 
We continue to increase direct sourcing 
and to forge better relationships and 
terms with our suppliers overseas 
through our offices in Shanghai, Hong 
Kong and most recently Bangladesh. 
We have rigorous technical and ethical 
processes to ensure we source with 
integrity and help our customers to  
Live Well For Less.

1st retailer
In the UK to trial 
innovative ‘Mobile 
Scan & Go’ technology
We offer a winning mix of supermarkets, 
convenience stores and a full online 
grocery and general merchandise offer. 
Where customers shop all three of these 
channels, their total spend is more than 
double that of the average supermarket-
only shopper.
The trend for local top-up shopping 
remains, as customers conserve fuel, 
minimise waste and manage their 
budgets. Our convenience business, which 
we have built and invested in over the past 
15 years, is benefiting from this trend, with 
five million customer transactions each 
week and a turnover in excess of £1.5 
billion. Convenience stores have delivered 
sales growth of over 17 per cent year-on-
year, driven by both new space and like-
for-like sales growth. We have continued 
to open one or two convenience stores 
each week, 87 during the year, bringing 
our total number of convenience stores 
to 523. In the next year the number of 
convenience stores will overtake that of 
supermarkets, and over the next three 
years this expansion will create 10,000  
job opportunities.
We were named Convenience Chain of 
the Year for the third year running at the 
Retail Industry Awards in recognition of 
our breadth of range, customer service 
and community involvement.
Our groceries online business, which has 
been operating since 1999, is also growing 
strongly at around 20 per cent year-on-
year. We have the ability to deliver to over 
96 per cent of UK households. Grocery 
orders now regularly exceed 190,000 per 
week – 25,000 more than last year –  
and customer feedback relating to  
service and availability are at an all-time 
high. We have also seen double-digit 
improvements in the efficiency of our 
picking and delivery operations.
Maximising new and existing 
opportunities in the online and digital 
space is a key part of our long-term 
growth plans. This year, we were the 
first retailer in the UK to trial innovative 
‘Mobile Scan & Go’ technology in three 
stores. It allows customers to track how 
much they are spending as they shop and 
view savings instantly on their mobile 
phone. When they have finished shopping 
they pay at the till without unloading their 
trolley, basket or bag.
Our general merchandise website 
continues to offer thousands of branded 
and own-brand lines across home and 
garden, appliances, technology, toys, 
games, sport and leisure. Over half our 
customers choose to collect their orders 
via our Click & Collect service which is 
available in nearly 1,000 of our stores.
Sainsbury’s Bank has enjoyed another 
successful year, delivering its fifth 
consecutive year of profit growth, with 
our share of the joint venture post-tax 
profit up 38 per cent to £22 million.  
Our strategy remains to offer customers 
good quality financial services products 
that offer value for money. The strong 
performance is underpinned by a 
competitive offering which combines 
preferential deals on financial products 
with Nectar points to be spent at 
Sainsbury’s or elsewhere.
The Bank’s active accounts are up eight 
per cent on the year to 1.5 million and 
these customers spend more with us. 
Our Nectar-based credit card, offering 
our most attractive reward to date, has 
exceeded all expectations and further 
deepened our relationship with Nectar 
and our customers. Growth in credit cards 
overall was 17 per cent year-on-year. 
The Bank enjoyed continued success with 
car insurance with new business up 67 
per cent year-on-year. Sainsbury’s Travel 
Money increased turnover by 35 per cent, 
with both in-store bureaux and online 
ordering performing well. 
The Bank was named Best Personal 
Loan Provider by Consumer Moneyfacts, 
Best Online Pet Insurance Provider by 
Your Money Direct, Best Credit Card for 
Rewards by Moneynet and Best Term 
Assurance Provider Direct by Moneyfacts 
Investment Life & Pensions. 
We have reached an agreement to take 
full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank by 
acquiring Lloyds Banking Group’s 50 per 
cent shareholding for £248 million, which 
comprises cash consideration for the 
shares of £193 million and the purchase 
of £55 million of loan stock. Developing 
complementary channels and services 
is a core part of our long-term strategy 
for growth and ownership of the Bank 
will enable its full potential to be realised. 
As a consequence, given that loyal Bank 
customers spend more in our stores than 
non-Bank customers, and that customer 
penetration is low, there is a significant 
opportunity to grow the Bank and at the 
same time in-store sales and customer 
loyalty. As a result we expect strong 
returns over time for the Group from  
this investment.

per cent in the last year, as people shop 
around for the best deals in the market. 
Our online sales channel accounts  
for 36 per cent of the total number  
of customers acquired. 
One of our 20x20 sustainability 
commitments is to be a leading provider 
of health services. Research shows  
that people are more likely to discuss 
minor ailments with a pharmacist  
than go to their GP and this is borne  
out by the experience of our 270 plus  
in-store pharmacies. Our highly trained, 
professional pharmacists conducted 
95,000 cholesterol checks, an increase 
of 25 per cent year-on-year, gave 56,000 
flu vaccinations and worked with the 
Department of Health for the third year 
to help people stop smoking by giving  
out more than 30,000 Quit Kits. We  
have also taken over the management  
of the outpatient pharmacies at Guy’s  
and St Thomas’ Hospitals in London  
and James Cook University Hospital  
in Middlesbrough. 
We have formed a joint venture with  
Aimia, owner of the Nectar programme. 
The new company, I
2
C (Insight 2 
Communication), will benefit customers 
through timely, relevant and accessible 
offers, based on their likes and dislikes, 
while brands benefit from insight-based 
marketing solutions and a greater return 
on investment.
We continue our drive into the online 
and digital entertainment market with 
the purchase of a majority stake in 
Anobii, now operating as eBooks by 
Sainsbury’s, and our partnership with 
Rovi Corporation, an on-demand  
video streaming service. These new  
and exciting business relationships  
underline our commitment to  
become a key player in the digital 
entertainment market.

Our store on Bellevue Road, Wandsworth, 
is a good example of this effect. Local 
traders were very supportive of us 
opening as they anticipated the benefits 
a Sainsbury’s store could bring to their 
own businesses. This has been borne 
out by research, which shows that since 
our store opened footfall in the area has 
increased by almost 40 per cent. 
We have a pipeline of space ready 
for development, including planning 
consents for a number of supermarket 
extensions, as well as a number of 
opportunities for new supermarkets and 
convenience stores. We ensure that all 
our investments, individually and overall, 
deliver good returns. 
We work with joint venture partners to 
add property value and trading space 
to our estate. In April, as part of our 
British Land joint venture, we opened 
our newly extended store at Purley Way, 
Croydon, giving us an additional 10,200 
sq ft of selling space. We also extended 
our store in Weedon Road, Northampton, 
by 23,600 sq ft, in November. Over the 
last few years, we have been successful 
in both securing mixed use planning 
permissions and ensuring we can get the 
maximum value for our land holdings via 
tactical sale and leaseback agreements. 
Work on a site in Fulham Wharf started 
in the summer and will deliver a 
replacement 76,000 sq ft supermarket 
and 267 residential apartments by 
mid 2015. Our partnership with Land 
Securities has seen work move forward 
at our Wandsworth Garratt Lane store 
where we are building an extension of 
34,700 sq ft, a hotel and additional retail 
space due to open this autumn.
We have a clearly defined strategy for 
growing space and increasing our store 
portfolio. This falls into three main areas:
1.  New supermarkets
2.   Adding space to existing stores 
through extensions
3.  New convenience stores
This year we have added 14 supermarkets, 
87 convenience stores and eight 
extensions to our property portfolio –  
a total of just over one million sq ft, in line 
with our target of around five per cent 
gross space growth. 
Some of this additional space has enabled 
us to bring our increasingly popular 
clothing and general merchandise ranges 
to more customers. It has also enabled 
us to expand our coverage of the UK to 
areas where our presence was previously 
limited – around 22 per cent of the UK 
population does not live within a 15 minute 
drive of a Sainsbury’s store and we have 
less than five per cent market share in  
35 per cent of UK postcodes. 
A new Sainsbury’s store brings a number 
of benefits to local communities. In 
October, we opened a new 60,000 sq 
ft supermarket in the Caldewgate area 
of Carlisle. The store has given a major 
regeneration boost to this area of the 
city, which had been badly affected by 
flooding and was becoming increasingly 
run-down. Our store created around 
300 new local jobs, increased parking 
provision and brought a petrol filling 
station to the area.
We opened our 500th convenience store 
in Southsea, Hampshire in November and 
in the coming year will see the number 
of convenience stores we operate 
exceed the number of supermarkets. 
Convenience stores deliver particularly 
good returns and make a positive 
contribution to the regeneration of local 
high streets in terms of footfall, increased 
trade and employment opportunities.

Our values make

Business review
Our strategy continued
Our values set us apart from 
other retailers. They underpin 
our strategy and the way we 
operate our business, and they 
govern the way we relate to 
customers, colleagues and 
stakeholders. We see this as  
a competitive strength as well  
as a responsibility.

20x20 Sustainability Plan
In October 2011, we published our  
20x20 Sustainability Plan comprising  
20 ambitious goals, each linked to one  
of our five values, which we aim to 
achieve by the year 2020. It is our 
roadmap towards a more sustainable 
future and part of our promise to help 
customers Live Well For Less. 
Best for food and health
We play a key role in helping our 
customers to achieve a healthier lifestyle, 
as well as encouraging co-operation 
between the food industry, Government, 
health and nutrition groups, suppliers and 
colleagues. We have been at the forefront 
of this type of positive action for many 
years: our innovative front-of-pack 
traffic light labelling – now on over 9,000 
products – has changed customer buying 
patterns in favour of amber and green-
rated products over red-rated ones. 
We continue to make progress in reducing 
salt, fat and sugar in our own-brand 
food. About 30 per cent of our fruit and 
vegetable sales are through promotions 
and we are active supporters of the 
Government’s Responsibility Deal  
‘Five-A-Day’ pledge. 
research and development grants to 
support the future of British farming 
through initiatives driven by our farmers, 
growers and suppliers. 
The weather was particularly bad for our 
growers this winter, and by selling ‘ugly’ 
fruit and vegetables of different shapes 
and sizes, that are just as nutritious and 
tasty as our regular produce, we were 
able to support British farmers and 
reduce unnecessary waste.
The sustainability of the fishing industry 
is high on our agenda and we are the 
largest retailer of Marine Stewardship 
Council certified sustainable fish in the 
UK, with around 130 products – from 
basics fish fingers to Taste the Difference 
Wild Alaskan Salmon and from fish 
counters through to ready meals. 
Respect for our environment
Using green energy and introducing 
proven and next-generation renewable 
technologies is fundamental to the 
long-term sustainability of our business. 
These technologies are helping to reduce 
our overall energy use, lower our energy 
bills and reduce our operational carbon 
emissions, even as we continue to grow 
floor space. 
Investment in this area not only 
improves the long-term sustainability 
of our business, but also delivers a 
strong financial return. It makes good 
business sense for Sainsbury’s, helps 
the environment and also supports job 
creation in the renewable energy sector.
We are the UK’s leading retail user of 
energy from anaerobic digestion (‘AD’). 
Tamar Ltd, the strategic partnership we 
set up with Tamar Energy to produce 
energy from organic waste matter, is 
developing a UK network of over 40 
AD plants that will generate 100MW of 
green electricity over the next five years. 
We are rolling out new ABV (alcohol 
by volume) labelling on our own-brand 
products to help customers identify 
quickly and easily the alcoholic strength 
of the products they buy. Since 2011 
we have seen a 17.5 per cent increase 
in the number of bottles of lighter 
alcohol wine sold. This year we have 
trained pharmacists in over 270 stores 
as Healthy Eating Advisors to help our 
customers eat more healthily, lose weight 
and get active.
Sourcing with integrity
Our entire supply chain, from farm 
to store, is built around long-term 
sustainable relationships to ensure the 
best quality products at fair prices. We 
have one of the most extensive quality 
control programmes in the industry, 
employing over 100 people to ensure 
the integrity of our products. We apply 
the same checks and exacting standards 
across all our own-brand products – from 
basics to Taste the Difference. 
We work with over 2,200 British farmers 
and growers and we are proud of the 
strong relationships we have built with 
them over time. We have invested over 
£40 million in our 10 British Farmer 
Development Groups since 2006 to 
promote and support good animal 
welfare, and improve environmental 
and ethical standards. In December, 
we awarded £1.2 million of agricultural

Business review
Our strategy continued
Our well-established zero food waste to 
landfill policy means that any surplus 
food from our stores that has not been 
given to charity or used for animal feed 
is sent for AD to generate green energy. 
We are also working closely with our 
suppliers to ensure they have access  
to these AD plants to help them reduce 
the environmental impact of their 
operations, a key strand of our 20x20 
Sustainability Plan. 
In February, we became the first retailer 
to achieve the Carbon Trust Water 
Standard, showing that we are taking 
action to measure, manage and reduce 
water use year-on-year. We also saved 
15,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide  
by switching to natural refrigerants  
in 150 stores. 
We host the largest multi-roof solar 
panel array in Europe, having installed 
over 82,000 solar panels at 189 stores 
producing renewable energy for 
electricity. 
We were awarded a number of 
environmental accolades this year, 
including the top award of ‘Sustainable 
Business of the Year’ at the Energy 
and Environmental Awards. This was 
in recognition of our industry-leading 
work on carbon and energy reduction, 
constant technological innovation,  
focus on recycling and water innovation. 
Making a positive difference 
to our community
As the first-ever Paralympic-only sponsor, 
we played a full part in the London 2012 
Games and experienced the power of 
sport to bring people and communities 
together. Over 18,000 Sainsbury’s 
customers and colleagues were given 
the opportunity to attend the Games 
with our support, and 148 colleagues 
were seconded to LOCOG or acted as 
Games Makers. One hundred and fifty 
customers and colleagues took part in 
the Paralympic Torch Relay, generating 
high levels of customer and colleague 
engagement as it toured the UK – and  
our supermarkets.

A great place to work
We have created 5,000 jobs this year, 
as part of our commitment to create 
50,000 new job opportunities by 2020. 
Since 2011, we have recruited over 370 
people on to our popular, fast-track 
Trainee Manager Scheme. Attracted 
by a long-term rewarding career and 
benefits including a contributory 
pension, discount card and eligibility 
for the Sainsbury’s profit sharing and 
bonus schemes, as well as first class 
on and off-the-job training, they are 
now making their mark on our business 
across the country. We also created 
400 apprenticeship places designed to 
train and develop team leaders of the 
future for our stores. Apprentices will be 
equipped with new skills and offered City 
& Guilds vocational training, including 
nationally recognised qualifications that 
are the equivalent of two A-levels. 
To date over 20,000 colleagues who work 
on fresh counters and bakeries and in our 
in-store cafes have received job-related, 
City & Guilds’ accredited training at our 
seven food colleges.
Over 80,000 colleagues are now saving 
for their retirement in a company 
Defined Contribution scheme. Last year, 
we were one of the first companies 
in the UK to introduce pension auto-
enrolment. In light of changes to 
pensions over the last few years, and 
in line with other businesses, we have 
started a consultation about changes 
to our Defined Benefit pension scheme. 
The proposed changes will ensure 
that pension arrangements for all our 
colleagues are fair and sustainable for 
the future.
Our colleagues shared in a bonus of over 
£90 million this year, meaning that over 
the last five years we will have awarded 
over £350 million to colleagues in this 
way. In addition, 11,000 colleagues shared 
a £23 million payout in savings and 
profit via two of our Sharesave schemes 
which matured in March 2013, and nearly 
19,000 colleagues participated in our 
most recent Save-As-You-Earn offer. 
Our focus on the value of our values 
is an integral part of our business 
strategy and has again been recognised 
by key external benchmarks. We were 
recognised as Employer of the Year at 
the Retail Week Awards, highlighting 
how we engaged our colleagues in every 
aspect of the London 2012 Paralympic 
Games. We maintained our position 
in the FTSE4Good Index and we were 
recognised as global sector leader, for 
the sixth consecutive year, in the 2012 
Dow Jones Sustainability Index review. 
Building on the success of Active Kids and 
the ‘Million Kids Challenge’, we launched 
our ‘Active Kids for All’ Paralympic legacy 
plan. Our £1 million commitment will fund 
teacher training to ensure that 500,000 
children with a disability in mainstream 
education are included in school sports 
lessons. We are also extending our 
sponsorship of the British Paralympic 
Association to ensure that the next 
generation of Paralympic athletes get the 
support and coaching they need through 
to the Sochi Winter Paralympic Games 
in 2014 and Rio in 2016. Looking forward 
to this summer, we are proud to sponsor 
the Sainsbury’s Summer Series – three 
world-class athletics events being held in 
Birmingham and at the Queen Elizabeth 
Olympic Park in London. 
Working together with our customers, we 
donated a record-breaking £41.5 million 
to good causes in the year including our 
sponsorship of Comic Relief, support 
for the Royal British Legion Poppy 
Appeal and our nationwide Local Charity 
Partnership programme. Our second 
Million Meals Appeal saw a record-
breaking two million meals donated to 
disadvantaged people across the country, 
with Sainsbury’s matching our customers’ 
donations, making it the UK’s biggest 
ever single-charity food drive.

Dear Shareholder,
In an eventful year, while the 
economic environment remained 
tough, Sainsbury’s grew sales 
(including V AT) by 4.6 per cent to 
£25,632 million (2011/12: £24,511 
million) and underlying profit 
before tax (‘UPBT’) by 6.2 per 
cent to £756 million (2011/12: 
£712 million). In so doing, we 
outperformed the market and 
increased market share to 16.8 
per cent, the highest for a decade. 
John Rogers, Chief Financial Officer
This performance was, in part, due to continued 
progress in our multi-channel strategy allowing 
customers to choose where, when and how they 
shop. Our online grocery business grew at around  
20 per cent and annual sales are nearly £1.0 billion.  
Our convenience business grew at over 17 per cent 
and annual sales are now over £1.5 billion. Own-
brand goes from strength to strength with not  
only top-line sales growth across all three ranges, 
basics, by Sainsbury’s and Taste the Difference, but 
also good profit growth. Brand Match continued 
to reinforce the competitiveness of Sainsbury’s 
price position along with Nectar and coupon-at-till 
technology, ensuring customers are rewarded with 
relevant offers. 
Sainsbury’s achieved over £100 million operational 
cost savings which offset most of the impact of 
inflationary pressures on costs during the year. 
Underlying operating profit increased by 5.1 per 
cent to £829 million (2011/12: £789 million), with 
operating margin improvement of two basis points 
(two basis points at constant fuel prices). UPBT 
improved by 6.2 per cent to £756 million (2011/12: 
£712 million). This growth was ahead of operating 
profit growth due to strong performance in 
underlying joint venture (‘JV’) profits, with our share 
of JV post-tax profit at Sainsbury’s Bank up 38 per 
cent from £16 million to £22 million.
We are pleased to announce that we have reached 
an agreement with Lloyds Banking Group to acquire 
their 50 per cent shareholding of Sainsbury’s Bank 
and take sole ownership. Sainsbury’s intends to fund 
the future consideration from internal resources.
As well as the stand-alone growth potential of the 
Bank, full ownership will also allow future products 
to be even more tailored to Sainsbury’s customers, 
leveraging Nectar data to drive sales uplift in both 
financial services and our supermarkets business. 
After taking out a Bank product, Sainsbury’s 
shoppers become more loyal and spend more  
in-store, providing significant opportunity to unlock 
further value. 
 
The Bank’s results will be fully consolidated  
within our financial services segment from when  
the transaction completes, currently expected in 
January 2014. 27 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Underlying basic earnings per share increased to 
30.7 pence (2011/12: 28.1 pence), a 9.3 per cent 
improvement year-on-year. This was higher than the 
increase in underlying profit, primarily due to the 
impact of the reduction in the statutory corporation 
tax rate. Basic earnings per share increased by  
1.9 per cent to 32.6 pence (2011/12: 32.0 pence).
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 11.9 
pence (2011/12: 11.6 pence), making a full year dividend 
of 16.7 pence, up 3.7 per cent year-on-year (2011/12: 
16.1 pence) and covered 1.83 times by underlying 
earnings. The Board intends to continue to increase 
the dividend each year and build dividend cover to 
around two times over the medium term. 
Whilst the economic climate is likely to remain 
challenging, next year will be an exciting one for 
Sainsbury’s as we take full ownership of Sainsbury’s 
Bank and increase the pace of our convenience 
opening programme. Alongside this, our priority is 
to continue to drive returns from our investments, 
improve operational cash flow and working capital 
management, and maintain tight cost control.
John Rogers
Chief Financial Officer
New space and the investments made over the past 
few years continue to deliver an expected return 
above the Group’s required hurdle rate, with core 
capital expenditure this year of £1,040 million 
(2011/12: £1,240 million). New space delivered a 2.5 
per cent contribution to sales growth, slightly ahead 
of expectations due to stores opening earlier than 
anticipated and sales performing ahead of forecast 
in both supermarkets and convenience.
The return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) increased 
by 12 basis points to 11.2 per cent enhanced by the 
movement in the net pension deficit, which reduces 
capital employed. ROCE excluding the pension fund 
deficit was 10.4 per cent, a 15 basis point decrease 
year-on-year, held back by the cumulative effect of 
the Group’s accelerated investment in space growth 
since June 2009 and slower sector growth and 
profitability.
Sainsbury’s took advantage of continued good 
property yields and generated funds through the 
selective sale and leaseback of supermarkets that have 
no further development potential, generating £202 
million of proceeds through property transactions 
(2011/12: £303 million). This delivered a profit from 
the disposal of properties of £66 million (2011/12: £83 
million). The estimated market value of the Group’s 
overall property portfolio increased by £0.3 billion,  
to £11.5 billion (17 March 2012: £11.2 billion). 
The balance sheet remained strong and the business 
has funding in place of over £3 billion, including a 
revolving credit facility of £0.7 billion that remained 
un-drawn at the year-end. Net debt ended the year 
at £2.2 billion, in line with expectations.

Sales (including VAT) and space
Sales (including fuel) increased by 4.6 per cent to £25,632 million 
(2011/12: £24,511 million).
 
This includes a 2.5 per cent contribution from new space 
(excluding extensions and replacements) and like-for-like (‘LFL ’)

Sales (excluding fuel) grew by 4.3 per cent, with LFL growth 
of 1.8 per cent, which was lower than the sales including 
fuel number due to the growth in fuel volume and fuel price 
inflation. The LFL increase was also below Sainsbury’s medium-
term planning objective of between three and four per cent, 
reflecting the challenging market conditions. Sainsbury’s 
growth was, however, 1.2 percentage points ahead of the 
market, with market share growing by 19 basis points to 16.8 per 
cent for the 52 weeks to 17 March 2013 (as measured by Kantar).
LFL sales growth (excluding fuel) improved from 1.7 per cent 
in the first half to 1.9 per cent in the second half. Sainsbury’s 
delivered growth of only 0.9 per cent in the third quarter, as 
competition intensified over the Christmas period. This eased 
off in the fourth quarter when Sainsbury’s recorded the highest 
LFL growth of the year, at 3.6 per cent. 
Average trading intensity (‘TI’) excluding fuel declined to 
£19.27 per sq ft per week (2011/12: £19.47 per sq ft), caused by: 
the higher proportion of space for general merchandise and 
clothing (which trades less intensively than food); an increasing 
presence in those parts of the country where TI is likely to be 
lower (albeit capital costs are also lower); and a drop in TI in the 
underlying estate due to the challenging economic environment. 
Convenience TIs continued to grow, as this offer meets changing 
customer shopping behaviours, with new stores performing well 
and sales from existing stores maturing.
New space, excluding extensions and replacements, contributed 
a net 2.5 per cent to the sales growth (excluding fuel) of 4.3 per 
cent. Sainsbury’s added a gross 1,007,000 sq ft of selling space 
in the year (including replacements and extensions), an increase 
of 4.9 per cent (2011/12: 1,401,000 sq ft and 7.3 per cent). 
Including the impact of closures, this translated into net space 
growth of 918,000 sq ft, an increase of 4.5 per cent since the 
start of the year (2011/12: 1,239,000 sq ft and 6.5 per cent).
Space growth included 14 new supermarkets, of which two 
were replacement stores (2011/12: 19 new supermarkets, of 
which four were replacements). These generated an additional 
634,000 sq ft of gross selling space (a net 551,000 sq ft), with 
one store closure. In line with previous guidance, we stepped 
up the number of supermarket refurbishments to 20 stores and 
consequently reduced the number of extensions to eight, adding 
185,000 sq ft of selling space (2011/12: 28 extensions and seven 
refurbishments added 498,000 sq ft). Sainsbury’s continued to 
open space in areas in which the brand is under-represented, 
with strong growth in East and North West England. These 
stores typically bring higher returns due to lower build costs, 
although ultimate TI is lower than in other parts of the country.
Convenience continues to be a key area of growth, with 87 
stores added during the year (2011/12: 73 stores). Four stores 
were closed (2011/12: ten stores closed) and 15 refurbished 
(2011/12: 28 stores), with net convenience space growth of 
182,000 sq ft, an increase of 17.7 per cent since the start of  
the year (2011/12: 118,000 sq ft and 13.0 per cent), meeting  
our target of opening one to two new stores per week.
Net of replacements, closures and disposals, closing space  
of 21,265,000 sq ft was 4.5 per cent higher than last year 
(2011/12: 20,347,000 sq ft).
The contribution from net new space (excluding extensions  
and replacements) of 2.5 per cent was slightly ahead of 
Sainsbury’s expectations due to stores opening earlier than 
anticipated and sales performing ahead of expectations in  
both new supermarket and convenience stores. 
The convenience business grew sales at over 17 per cent to 
over £1.5 billion, well ahead of the market, and groceries 
online delivered nearly £1.0 billion of sales, a year-on-year 
increase of around 20 per cent. Our multi-channel strategy 
enables customers to shop where, when and how they want. 
Sainsbury’s non-food offer continued to be challenged by the 
tough economic backdrop, and yet delivered growth ahead of 
the market and over twice that of the food business. This growth 
was supported by continued range development as well as 
investments in extensions and new space.

In 2013/14, Sainsbury’s expects LFL sales to be between 
1.0 per cent and 1.5 per cent, reflecting the tough economic 
environment and reduced contribution from extensions from 
0.7 per cent in 2012/13 to 0.2 per cent. Contribution from new 
space (excluding extensions and replacements) is expected to 
be similar to 2012/13.
In 2013/14, Sainsbury’s expects gross space growth of around 
one million sq ft with circa two new convenience store openings 
per week.
Underlying operating profit 
Underlying operating profit increased by 5.1 per cent to 
£829 million (2011/12: £789 million), reflecting a good sales 
performance and cost savings of over £100 million in the year, 
helping to offset most of the impact of cost inflation.
Underlying operating margin improved by two basis points year-
on-year to 3.56 per cent (2011/12: 3.54 per cent), which was also a 
two basis point improvement at constant fuel prices. Underlying 
EBITDAR margin increased by three basis points to 7.83 per 
cent, a four basis point improvement at constant fuel prices. 
In 2013/14, Sainsbury’s expects operating profit to grow in line 
with sales.

Sainsbury’s Bank joint venture (‘JV’)
Sainsbury’s underlying share of Sainsbury’s Bank post-tax profit 
increased by £6 million to £22 million (2011/12: £16 million). 
The Bank has continued to perform strongly, with profit growth 
driven through increasing commission income, particularly in 
car and home insurance, and lower bad debt levels.
 
Sainsbury’s announced its intention to purchase the remaining 
50 per cent of the Sainsbury’s Bank JV on 8 May 2013, with 
expected completion in January 2014. 
In 2013/14, Sainsbury’s Bank expects to make a similar profit 
to 2012/13. 50 per cent of the Bank’s post-tax profits will be 
included through equity accounting for around 46 weeks of 
2013/14. The Bank’s profits will be fully consolidated in the last 
six weeks of the financial year.
Property joint ventures (‘JV’)
Sainsbury’s underlying share of post-tax profit from its JV with 
British Land was £14 million (2011/12: £14 million). Its underlying 
share of post-tax profits from the JV with Land Securities was 
£2 million (2011/12: £2 million). 
At the year-end, a loss on revaluation of £10 million was 
recognised within the share of post-tax profit from the JVs in 
the income statement (2011/12: £nil loss). This represents a 
decrease on revaluation of properties in the JV to an average 
yield of 5.1 per cent (2011/12: 5.0 per cent) as a result of shorter 
lease terms within the portfolio.
In 2013/14, Sainsbury’s expects the property JVs to make  
a similar profit to 2012/13.

Underlying net finance costs
Underlying net finance costs increased by £2 million to £111 
million (2011/12: £109 million), mainly as a result of an increase 
in average net debt and a reduction in capitalised interest, 
partly offset by a decrease in the RPI rate which reduced the 
rate on Sainsbury’s inflation-linked debt

Sainsbury’s expects underlying net finance costs in 2013/14 to 
remain broadly flat, principally due to the effect of a decrease in 
the RPI rate on the component of the Group’s inflation-linked debt, 
partly offset by the higher forecast average net debt balance. 
Taxation
The income tax charge was £174 million (2011/12: £201 million), 
with an underlying tax rate of 23.7 per cent (2011/12: 26.1 per 
cent) and an effective tax rate of 22.1 per cent (2011/12: 25.2 
per cent). The underlying and effective tax rates were lower 
than last year, primarily as a result of the two per cent lower 
statutory corporation tax rate and the impact of this on the 
revaluation of the deferred tax balances.

In 2013/14, Sainsbury’s expects the underlying tax rate to be

to the impact of further reductions in the statutory corporation 
tax rate.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share increased by 9.3 per cent 
to 30.7 pence (2011/12: 28.1 pence), reflecting the improvement 
in underlying profit after tax and the lower underlying tax rate 
year-on-year, partially offset by the effect of the additional 
shares issued during the year.
The weighted average number of shares in issue was 1,881.5 
million (2011/12: 1,870.3 million), an increase of 11.2 million 
shares or 0.6 per cent. Basic earnings per share increased to 
32.6 pence (2011/12: 32.0 pence). Basic earnings per share were 
higher than the underlying basic earnings per share mainly due 
to the profit on disposal of properties.

Dividends
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 11.9 pence per 
share (2011/12: 11.6 pence), which will be paid on 12 July 2013 
to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of 
business on 17 May 2013, subject to approval. This will increase 
the full year dividend by 3.7 per cent to 16.7 pence per share 
(2011/12: 16.1 pence). The dividend is covered 1.83 times by 
underlying earnings (2011/12: 1.75 times).
The proposed final dividend was recommended by the Board  
on 8 May 2013 and, as such, has not been included as a liability 
as at 16 March 2013.
Sainsbury’s remains focused on delivering returns to 
shareholders. The Board intends to continue to increase the 
dividend each year and to build cover to two times over the 
medium term. 31 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Return on capital employed
The return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) over the 52 weeks 
to 16 March 2013 was 11.2 per cent (2011/12: 11.1 per cent), an 
increase of 12 basis points year-on-year, enhanced by the 
increase in the net pension deficit, which reduces capital 
employed. 
ROCE excluding the net pension deficit, over the 52 weeks to 
16 March 2013 was 10.4 per cent, a year-on-year decrease of 
15 basis points. ROCE growth was held back by slower sector 
growth, reduced industry profitability and the cumulative effect 
of Sainsbury’s accelerated investment in space growth since 
June 2009. This has an initially dilutive impact on profits as the 
stores mature, whilst increasing the value of capital employed.

Net debt and cash flows
Sainsbury’s net debt as at 16 March 2013 was £2,162 million 
(2011/12: £1,980 million), an increase of £182 million. This was 
driven primarily by a small increase in working capital, an increase 
in corporation tax payments and lower sale and leaseback activity. 
This was offset by lower investments in estate development.
 
Operating cash flow before changes in working capital increased 
4.5 per cent, but cash generated from operations decreased by 
1.8 per cent to £1,268 million (2011/12: £1,291 million, 13.4 per 
cent increase) due to an adverse movement in working capital. 
Working capital increased by £26 million year-on-year (2011/12: 
£53 million decrease) as inventory increased by £57 million, 
offset by £31 million of other working capital improvements.

Sainsbury’s expects net debt to be around £2.4 billion at the end 
of 2013/14, assuming the quantum of sale and leaseback activity to 
be similar to previous years and excluding the consideration to be 
paid for the Bank. Including this consideration net debt is expected 
to increase to £2.6 billion. Future net debt guidance will exclude the 
consolidation of balances attributable to Sainsbury’s Bank.
Financing
The Group’s key financing objectives are to diversify funding sources, 
to minimise refinancing risk and maintain appropriate standby 
liquidity. Sainsbury’s has drawn debt facilities of £2.7 billion and an 
un-drawn, committed credit facility of £0.7 billion at its disposal.
The principal elements of Sainsbury’s core funding comprise two 
long-term loans of £1,002 million, due 2018, and £841 million, due 
2031, secured over property assets. In addition, Sainsbury’s has 
unsecured loans totalling £510 million with maturities ranging from 
2014 to 2018, a £190 million convertible bond due July 2014 and 
£160 million of hire purchase facilities and other finance leases. 
Sainsbury’s maintains a £690 million syndicated revolving credit 
facility due October 2015 for standby purposes. There were £nil 
drawings under the facility as at 16 March 2013 (2011/12: £nil drawings).  32  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Business review
Financial review continued
Capital expenditure 
Core capital expenditure decreased by £200 million year-on-
year to £1,040 million (2011/12: £1,240 million), due to a reduced 
supermarket opening and extension programme, partly offset 
by an increase in convenience store openings and supermarket 
refurbishments. Sainsbury’s stepped up its convenience 
opening programme in the year with 87 new convenience 
stores (2011/12: 73 convenience stores) and completed 35 
refurbishments (2011/12: 35 refurbishments), including 20 
supermarkets (2011/12: seven supermarkets) and 15 convenience 
stores (2011/12: 28 convenience stores). 
Core capital expenditure as a percentage of sales (including 
fuel, including VAT) was 4.1 per cent (2011/12: 5.1 per cent). 
Sainsbury’s also took advantage of continued good property 
yields in the year to achieve £202 million in sale and leaseback 
proceeds (2011/12: £303 million), although this was a reduction 
of £101 million year-on-year. This contributed to a total profit on 
disposal of properties of £66 million (2011/12: £83 million). Net 
capital expenditure was £875 million (2011/12: £962 million).

around £1.1 billion, before any capital investment associated with 
Sainsbury’s Bank, with core capital expenditure as a percentage 
of sales (including fuel, including VAT) to be similar to 2012/13. 
In the medium term, the Group expects core capital expenditure 
as a percentage of sales (including fuel, including VAT) to fall to 
below 3.5 per cent.
Summary balance sheet
Shareholders’ funds as at 16 March 2013 were £5,734 million 
(2011/12: £5,629 million), an increase of £105 million. This is 
mainly attributable to the continued profitable growth of the 
underlying business and investment in space to support future 
growth, offset by the increase in the net retirement benefit 
obligation (net of deferred tax) and net debt.
The book value of property, plant and equipment, including 
land and buildings, has grown by £475 million, as a result of 
increased space growth, offset by the sale and leaseback of 
stores with no further development potential.
Net debt was £182 million higher than at 17 March 2012 due to 
investment in property, plant and equipment and lower cash 
balances at year-end as a result of lower sale and leaseback 
proceeds, a small increase in working capital and higher 
corporation tax payments.
Adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was in line with last year at  
4.1 times (2011/12: 4.1 times) and interest cover improved to  
7.8 times (2011/12: 7.5 times). Fixed charge cover was in line 
with last year at 3.1 times (2011/12: 3.1 times). Gearing increased 
year-on-year to 37.7 per cent (2011/12: 35.2 per cent) mainly as a 
result of the increase in net debt. Excluding the pension deficit, 
gearing reduces to 33.7 per cent (2011/12: 32.5 per cent).

As at 16 March 2013, Sainsbury’s estimated market value of 
properties, including our 50 per cent share of properties held 
within property JVs, was £11.5 billion (2011/12: £11.2 billion). The 
£0.3 billion increase year-on-year was driven by property value 
added of £0.5 billion, partly offset by sale and leasebacks of 
£0.2 billion. The yield remained constant at 4.9 per cent.  33 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Pensions 
As at 16 March 2013, the post-tax pension deficit was £233 
million higher at £688 million (17 March 2012: £455 million) 
mainly due to a fall in the discount rate from 5.0 per cent to  
4.6 per cent and a rise in RPI inflation expectations from 3.3 per 
cent to 3.5 per cent, partially offset by a 12.5 per cent increase 
in the value of plan assets.

The IAS 19 pension current service cost included within UPBT

17 March 2012: £59 million). 
In 2013/14, including the effect of the application of IAS 19 
Revised, Sainsbury’s expects the pension service cost to 
increase by circa £5 million to £64 million; the pension financing 
charge reported outside of UPBT is expected to increase by 
£22 million to £27 million. Furthermore, all pension scheme 
expenses will now be shown as a charge outside of UPBT; 
Sainsbury’s expects this cost to be circa £6 million in 2013/14. 
These changes are also expected to reduce the balance sheet 
pension deficit before tax by circa £135 million in 2013/14.

The defined benefit pension scheme was subject to a triennial 
actuarial valuation carried out by Towers Watson, the scheme’s 
independent actuaries, at March 2012 on the projected unit 
basis. The results of this valuation are expected to be finalised 
in June 2013. 
 
On 10 April 2013, the Group entered into a consultation period 
regarding the proposed cessation of the future benefits accrual 
within its defined benefit pension scheme. Under this proposal, 
impacted colleagues will be offered membership to the Group’s 
existing defined contribution plans.
 
If the proposal proceeds, it is expected to result in a decrease 
in the defined benefit pension scheme service cost and an 
increase in contributions to the defined contribution plans, 
as well as a reduction in the defined benefit pension liability. 
Subject to the proposal being accepted, the financial impact 
will depend on both the implementation date and the extent to 
which impacted colleagues continue membership of the defined 
contribution plans and therefore until consultation completes, 
cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty.

Governance
Operating Board continued
Operating Board as at 16 March 2013. 38  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Dear Shareholder,
This has been another good year 
for Sainsbury’s. We have made 
progress on many different fronts. 
I firmly believe that our strong and 
established governance described 
in the following pages has played 
an important part in our progress. 
Sainsbury’s has again this year complied with all provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
We take succession at Board and senior management level very 
seriously and we believe that we have a good record of identifying the 
resourcing needs of the business, developing our own people, attracting 
external talent and planning and implementing change over a number 
of years. 
I have referred to our Board and management team changes in my 
introductory statement. Our new appointees during the year, Jean 
Tomlin at plc level, and Angie Risley on the Operating Board, are already 
bringing new skills and experience to our established teams. In addition, 
following the announcement that we plan to acquire the 50 per cent 
of Sainsbury’s Bank that we currently do not own, we are pleased that 
Lady Susan Rice will join the Board on 1 June 2013 as a Non-Executive 
Director. Susan has wide experience as a Non-Executive Director 
and her career in retail banking is particularly relevant in light of our 
announcement about our plans to take full ownership of Sainsbury’s 
Bank. I am sure she will make a very strong contribution to the Board.
Jean, Angie and Susan will also add to our broad diversity which has 
always been one of Sainsbury’s strengths. As set out below, we have 
a high proportion of women in Board and senior positions who have 
been appointed on merit throughout the organisation. From 1 June, 
we will have three women on our Board (30 per cent), exceeding the 
aspirational target of the Davies report that 25 per cent of board 
positions at FTSE 100 companies should be filled by women by 2015. 
I am delighted that Jean Tomlin has taken on the role of Chairman of 
our Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) Committee. The Board takes CR very 
seriously as it is an integral part of Sainsbury’s business. I am sure that 
Jean’s unique experience and breadth of skills will be a great addition 
to the Board and provide inspirational leadership of the Committee. 
Sainsbury’s was one of the first companies to establish a CR Committee 
at plc level, reflecting the key role that our five values play in achieving 
our vision to be the most trusted retailer where people love to work and 
shop. Jean’s first letter to shareholders is on page 43.
We have made further change by appointing one of our established 
Non-Executive Directors, Mary Harris, as Chairman of our Remuneration 
Committee. Mary’s first letter to you in her new role is set out on 
page 54. There has never been more external focus on executive 
remuneration in the UK’s largest companies. Under Mary’s leadership 
the Remuneration Committee has ensured that our consistent efforts 
to ensure a direct link between pay and performance in the areas most 
valued by our shareholders have contributed to building a focused 
leadership team.
The Board received a broad range of presentations from the senior 
management team during the year (see below), one of which was on 
colleague engagement. We know that setting the right culture and 
values throughout the business really helps to drive customer service 
and sales. As a Board, we take our own culture very seriously and 
always review it as part of our annual evaluation. We conducted an 
external review of our performance in 2011 when Manchester Square 
Partners confirmed that the Board was seen as effective, with a number 
of specific strengths as regards ethics, organisation, information and 
decision making. We have looked to build on these strengths to ensure 
that we have a consistent culture throughout the business. This year’s 
evaluation, carried out internally, concluded that we have shared values 
and a common purpose and are able to debate matters openly and 
honestly, with a high degree of trust and integrity. 
We believe that our strong culture and values will continue to hold  
us in good stead for the future.

David Tyler, Chairman
Governance 39 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
The role of the Board
The Board is chaired by David Tyler and, at the year-end, there were 
three Executive Directors and five Non-Executive Directors. John 
McAdam is the Senior Independent Director. The Directors’ biographical 
details are set out on page 35. Susan Rice will join the Board as a Non-
Executive Director with effect from 1 June 2013.
The Board’s key focus in helping to create long-term sustainable value 
for shareholders is on strategic leadership, performance management, 
investor relations, risk management, governance and succession 
planning, each of which is described below. The Board has a scheduled 
forward programme of meetings to ensure that we can allocate 
sufficient time to each of these key areas. This enables us to plan 
Board and Committee meetings appropriately and use the time most 
effectively. There is sufficient flexibility in the programme for specific 
items to be added to any particular agenda and this ensures that the 
Board can focus on the key matters relating to the business at the 
appropriate time. 
The Board’s scheduled forward programme includes the following items, 
some of which are considered at each meeting and others are reviewed 
periodically throughout the year: 
• 
Annual budget
• 
Corporate plan
• 
CEO Report and 
trading update
• 
Financial items
• 
Preliminary and 
Interim results
• 
Annual Report 
• 
Dividend policy and 
recommendations
• 
Committee reports
• 
Investor relations
• 
Strategic items
• 
Safety reports 
(Health & Safety  
and Food)
• 
Customer insights
• 
Pensions
• 
Project updates
• 
Treasury 
• 
Governance 
• 
Risk management
• 
Board evaluation
There are also a number of informal meetings of the Board, which 
enable all the Directors to spend more time together and to discuss 
specific areas of the business with individual Operating Board members. 
Our annual Board evaluation exercise enables us to review whether 
Board meetings are structured with a clear focus on the key issues 
facing the Company, with a full and open debate before major decisions 
are taken. We ensure that all Directors are aware of the key discussions 
and decisions of each of the four principal Committees – the Chairman 
of each Committee provides a detailed summary to all Directors at the 
Board meeting following the relevant Committee meeting. Minutes 
of Board and Committee meetings are circulated to Directors shortly 
after those meetings take place. The Board has a schedule of formally 
reserved powers, which it reviews each year, and receives a number of 
in-depth presentations during the year.
Strategic leadership
The Board continued to focus on strategic matters during the year. 
We hold a two-day Strategy Conference in the autumn, which the 
Operating Board Directors attend. This enables the Board to conduct an 
in-depth review of relevant economic factors and their likely impact on 
customers and the market, to evaluate key opportunities and threats, 
consider the corporate plan and agree the strategic goals for the 
short-term and longer term perspectives, and the five areas of focus 
described on pages 10 to 21. The Board receives a detailed half-year 
update on progress against the agreed priorities and then, to complete 
the cycle in July, agrees the objectives and principal areas of focus for 
the next conference. Specific projects are considered at other meetings 
during the year as necessary. Our 2013 Board evaluation exercise 
concluded that the Board continued to make good progress in driving 
the strategic debate during the year.
Compliance
The following sections explain how the Company applies the main 
principles of Section 1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’). The Board is committed to strong governance and, during 
the year, the Company has complied with all the provisions of  
the Code. 
The Board was fully involved in the decision to acquire full ownership 
of Sainsbury’s Bank, announced in May 2013. In-depth reviews 
were presented at a number of meetings setting out the strategic 
opportunity, the risks and the funding options, together with the 
related regulatory requirements. In June 2012 the Board held one of its 
scheduled meetings at Sainsbury’s Bank’s offices in Edinburgh which 
provided the opportunity to meet the Bank’s leadership team and senior 
management, and to review the Bank’s operations and product range.
Performance management and operational matters
Performance against delivery of the agreed key targets is reviewed 
at every meeting with particular reference to the detailed Group 
management accounts. The Chief Executive, Group Commercial Director 
and Chief Financial Officer comment on the market and current trading 
at each meeting and present comparative data and customer insight. 
One of the Board’s key roles is to ensure that Sainsbury’s unique values 
and strong culture are safeguarded so that they remain at the heart 
of the Company’s success, as they have been throughout the last 144 
years. The Board reviewed our colleague engagement in September, 
as our colleagues are key to our success. The Board was pleased that 
Sainsbury’s was a sponsor of the Paralympics and was delighted to host 
a reception for over 130 of our key suppliers and other stakeholders to 
mark the successful partnership. 
Risk management
The Board reviews the Company’s principal risks on an annual basis, 
in addition to receiving regular updates on risk management and 
internal controls from the Chairman of the Audit Committee after each 
Committee meeting. The Board also receives an annual update on all 
matters relating to safety, supported by quarterly updates, together 
with updates on relevant controls and governance. Any specific 
issues on these and other matters which might affect the Company’s 
reputation are reported to the Board as they occur. See page 48 for 
further details.
Investor relations
Turning to investor relations (‘IR’), the Board receives an annual 
independent survey at the Strategy Conference from Makinson  
Cowell which reports on the views of major shareholders and analysts, 
together with updates at each Board meeting on the IR programme and 
feedback from major shareholders, particularly following each major 
announcement of the Company’s results. See page 42 for further details.
Succession planning/Nomination Committee
The Board takes succession planning for both Board members and 
senior management very seriously. All of the Non-Executive Directors 
are members of the Nomination Committee which is chaired by David 
Tyler. Justin King is not a member of the Committee although he is 
invited to attend meetings. 
As stated below, our Board evaluations consider the balance, skills 
and diversity of the Board. They also consider succession planning, 
reviewing whether it is working effectively. The evaluation reviews any 
senior appointment processes during the year and identifies priorities 
for the year ahead. 
The changes to the Board which have been announced during the year 
are part of the succession planning process. In May 2012, we announced 
that Bob Stack had decided to stand down from the Board with 
effect from our Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in July. Mary Harris, 
who joined the Remuneration Committee in July 2011, then became 
Chairman of the Committee. The Nomination Committee instructed 
consultancy Egon Zehnder in connection with the recruitment of a 
new Non-Executive Director. The Committee considered the balance of 
skills, experience and diversity on the Board in determining the types 
of candidate who might best fit the specification of this role. The Board 
were delighted to be able to appoint Jean Tomlin as a Non-Executive 
Director on 1 January 2013. 
Governance
Corporate governance statement continued 40  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
We believe we have a good balance and diversity amongst our Non-
Executive Directors with several having deep experience of consumer 
facing businesses and other highly relevant skills partly derived from 
serving in a range of major executive and non-executive positions 
throughout their careers. Following the appointment of Jean Tomlin,  
our Non-Executive Directors’ tenure on our Board as at the year-end  
is as follows:
Board tenure
Non-Executive
Number Percentage
0–1 years 1 17
2–3 years 2 33
4–5 years 1 17
6–8 years 2 33
The above table includes the Chairman.
Following the announcement that we plan to acquire the 50 per cent 
of Sainsbury’s Bank that we currently do not own, Susan Rice will join 
the Board on 1 June 2013 as a Non-Executive Director. Egon Zehnder 
facilitated the recruitment process that led to Susan’s appointment.
At the time of the annual Strategy Conference the Committee reviews 
succession plans for the Operating Board, as well as Divisional Director 
development, talent management and the graduate programme.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the website and 
set out the Committee’s responsibilities. The Committee meets on such 
occasions as are necessary and in 2012/13 held five meetings in total, 
particularly relating to the process which led to Jean Tomlin’s appointment. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the website  
at www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance.
Diversity
Fairness, diversity and inclusion are a core part of our values and 
heritage at Sainsbury’s. For more information on our progress, see  
‘A great place to work’ on page 25. We continue to work to ensure  
that colleagues from all backgrounds can progress in their careers. 
As part of ‘A great place to work’ the Company has well-developed 
policies for fair and equal treatment of all colleagues. We encourage 
applications from all backgrounds to ensure a diverse and inclusive 
workforce. It is our policy that people with disabilities are given full and 
just consideration for vacancies and over the year we have conducted 
a number of training sessions to raise awareness and understanding of 
our customers and colleagues with disabilities and how we can better 
support them. If a colleague were to become disabled while working 
for Sainsbury’s we are committed to making reasonable adjustments 
to support them. Under the banner of ‘You Can’, the Company also 
actively works with a number of organisations which seek to promote 
employment for disadvantaged persons and inclusion within the 
workplace. One of our 20x20 Sustainability Plan commitments is that by 
2020 we will provide 30,000 people from disadvantaged groups with 
work opportunities. These include Job Centre Plus, A Fairer Chance, 
Shaw Trust, Remploy and Mencap. Sainsbury’s is a Gold partner of the 
Business Disability Forum. The Company also has a flexible working 
and carers policy making it possible for colleagues to achieve a balance 
between work and home. Further details of Sainsbury’s diversity policy 
can be found at www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/diversity. Our focus for the year 
ahead is on gender and race equality in employment, and a legacy of 
inclusion following our sponsorship of the 2012 Paralympics. 
One of our strengths is the diversity that results from having a high 
proportion of women in senior management positions and throughout 
the organisation who have been appointed on merit. Following the 
appointments of Jean Tomlin and Susan Rice to the Board, and of  
Angie Risley to the Operating Board, 30 per cent of our Board and  
27 per cent of our Operating Board are women. Thirty two per cent of 
our most senior executive positions are filled by women, providing a 
strong pipeline of female leaders for the future. Overall 54 per cent of 
our 157,000 colleagues are female.
Male Female

Operating Board 73% 27% 
Senior executive positions 68% 32% 
Company 46% 54% 
Division of responsibilities 
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive which is set out in writing and has been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring 
its effectiveness and setting its agenda to enable the Board to fulfil 
all aspects of its role. As set out above, we ensure that the Board has 
sufficient time to allocate to its key areas of focus throughout the annual 
cycle of Board meetings. The Chairman ensures effective communication 
with shareholders and that the Board is aware of the views of major 
shareholders. He facilitates the contribution of the Non-Executive 
Directors through a culture of openness and debate, and ensures 
constructive relations between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management of 
the Company, and executing the strategy, once agreed by the Board.  
He creates a framework of strategy, values, organisation and objectives 
to ensure the successful delivery of results, and allocates decision 
making and responsibilities accordingly. He takes a leading role, with the 
Chairman, in the relationship with all external agencies and in  
promoting Sainsbury’s.
Independence 
The Non-Executive Directors bring wide and varied commercial 
experience to Board and Committee deliberations. On appointment 
they confirm that they will have sufficient time available to be able to 
discharge their responsibilities effectively. They are appointed for an 
initial three-year term, subject to election by shareholders at the first 
AGM after their appointment, after which their appointment may be 
extended for further terms, subject to mutual agreement. All members 
of the Board will retire by rotation and seek re-election by shareholders 
at this year’s AGM in accordance with the Code. 
The Chairman satisfied the independence criteria of the Code on his 
appointment to the Board in October 2009 and all the Non-Executive 
Directors are considered to be independent according to the provisions 
of the Code. The Board has specifically considered the executive or 
non-executive roles that some of the Non-Executive Directors have with 
companies who may be in competition with, or suppliers to, Sainsbury’s. 
The Board is satisfied that the independence of the Directors who 
have executive or non-executive roles with other companies is not 
compromised and that they all have sufficient time available to devote 
to the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that directors must avoid a situation 
where they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, 
or possibly may conflict, with a company’s interests. Directors of public 
companies may authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where 
appropriate, if a company’s articles of association permit. Shareholders 
approved the appropriate amendments to the Company’s Articles at the 
2008 AGM. The Board has established procedures for the disclosure 
by Directors of any such conflicts, and also for the consideration and 
authorisation of these conflicts by the Board. In accordance with the 
Act, the Board considered and authorised each Director’s reported 
potential conflicts of interest during the year. Whenever a Director takes 
on additional external responsibilities, the Board considers any potential 
conflicts that may arise and whether the Director continues to have 
sufficient time to fulfil his or her role as a Director of the Company.  
The Board will continue to monitor and review potential conflicts of 
interest on a regular basis.
Governance
Corporate governance statement continued 41 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
In last year’s report, the Board disclosed that it had considered a 
potential conflict for Justin King, whose son, Jordan King, is one 
of the country’s top young racing drivers. His success is attracting 
interest from potential sponsors. Current sponsors include high net-
worth individuals and companies with established interests in motor 
sport. Some of the sponsors are also suppliers to Sainsbury’s. Jordan 
King arranges his sponsorships through his company, 42 Racing Ltd. 
The Board has again satisfied itself that Justin King has no direct 
involvement in the trading relationship between Sainsbury’s and any 
supplier who may have an interest in 42 Racing Ltd. It remains satisfied 
that the governance of all supplier relationships is robust and that there 
is therefore no conflict of interest regarding these arrangements.
Information 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that all Directors are properly 
briefed on issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full 
and timely access to relevant information. The quality and supply of 
information provided to the Board is reviewed as part of the Board 
evaluation exercise. The conclusion from this year’s evaluation was that 
Board meetings and processes were very effective.
Directors’ induction and development
We have a programme for meeting Directors’ training and development 
requirements. Newly appointed Directors who do not have previous 
public company experience at Board level are provided with detailed 
training on their role and responsibilities. All new Directors participate 
in a comprehensive and tailored induction programme including store 
and depot visits and meetings with other members of the Board, 
members of the Operating Board, senior management and external 
advisors. The induction programme includes a full review of corporate 
responsibility. Subsequent training is available on an ongoing basis to 
meet any particular needs. 
Since her appointment to the Board in January 2013 Jean Tomlin’s 
induction programme has included a session with PwC on her role and 
responsibilities as a non-executive director, and meetings with all of the 
plc and Operating Board Directors. She has also had meetings with the 
Remuneration Committee advisors, the Director of Corporate Affairs 
and senior members of the Finance Division. Jean has also presented  
to the Company’s senior management on her experience at LOCOG.  
Her induction will continue into 2013/14. Following her appointment 
on 1 June 2013, Susan Rice will have a detailed induction programme 
during 2013/14.
During the year the Company Secretary, Tim Fallowfield, has provided 
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, Directors’ duties 
and obligations, and new legislation and its impact on the Company.  
The Audit Committee regularly considers new accounting developments 
through presentations from management and the external auditors. 
This year this included updates on the future of narrative reporting, 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code and revision of the 
IFRS conceptual framework. The consultants to the Remuneration 
Committee advise the Committee on relevant governance and trends in 
remuneration. They received updates on the new BIS requirements and 
the remuneration guidelines issued by investor representative bodies. 
The Board programme includes regular presentations from 
management and informal meetings which increase the Non-Executive 
Directors’ understanding of the business and the sector. During the 
year the Board held a Board meeting at our Sainsbury’s Bank offices in 
Edinburgh and received presentations from members of the Sainsbury’s 
Bank team on all of the keys aspects of the Bank’s business. In addition, 
they met a number of the broader management team during their 
visit and held a question and answer session with all Bank colleagues. 
Directors have also visited stores and other sites as part of their 
continuing engagement with the business. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. He has responsibility for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and for governance matters. The appointment and removal of 
the Company Secretary is one of the matters reserved for the Board. 
There is an agreed procedure by which members of the Board may 
take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the 
furtherance of their duties.
Board evaluation
The annual evaluation exercise was last conducted on an external basis 
in 2011 when Manchester Square Partners (who had no other relationship 
with Sainsbury’s) led the review. Their report to the Board concluded 
that the Board was working effectively across many dimensions. The 
Board identified actions to develop some aspects of Board succession 
and management transition and to strengthen further the focus on 
strategic initiatives and progress was reported in last year’s report. 
The Board agreed that this year’s review should be carried out by the 
Company Secretary, as it had been in 2012. The Board is satisfied that 
these internal reviews follow an established process which enables a 
thorough review with full and open participation from all Directors. 
The key objectives were to determine whether year-on-year progress 
had continued on the key points identified by Manchester Square 
Partners, to review progress against last year’s action points, to identify 
any emerging themes, and to consider whether the Board and its 
Committees were working effectively. 
A questionnaire was circulated to all Directors seeking their evaluation 
of a number of matters, including strategy, Board and management 
succession, Board culture, balance and diversity, meetings and 
processes, investor relations, risk management and Board Committees. 
This was followed up in separate discussions with each of the Directors 
to take their detailed feedback on any emerging themes. The Company 
Secretary then presented the principal conclusions to the Board at a 
meeting convened for that purpose, and the Board discussed the key 
points and agreed certain actions. 
The Board reviewed the action points from the 2012 evaluation and 
concluded, in particular that:
• 
the strategic debate had made good progress and there were 
common views on the strategic priorities;
• 
it would continue to develop strong links with the broader 
management team. The Board’s visit to Sainsbury’s Bank had been 
very successful and the regular informal sessions with the members 
of the Operating Board were an effective means of understanding 
their priorities. The Board noted that it will be visiting the new Store 
Support Centre offices in Coventry in June 2013 which will provide 
another excellent opportunity for engaging with the non-food and 
property teams located there; and
• 
Directors were working well together with an open and honest culture 
and a high degree of trust and integrity. 
As part of the Board evaluation exercise, the Senior Independent 
Director reviewed the Chairman’s performance with the other Directors 
and subsequently met him to provide feedback. The Chairman provided 
feedback to each Director on their individual contribution to the Board 
and, with each of them, considered development priorities for them. 
In line with the Code, the Board anticipates that the 2014 Board 
evaluation will be facilitated by an external provider.

As referred to above, there were a number of informal meetings during 
the year when Directors met individual members of the Operating Board 
to receive updates on their specific areas of responsibility. In addition, 
the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors met without the Executive 
Directors being present, and the Non-Executive Directors also met 
without the Executive Directors or the Chairman being present. 
Investor relations 
The Company is committed to maintaining good communications 
with investors. Normal shareholder contact is the responsibility of 
Justin King, John Rogers and Adam Wilson Katsibas, Head of Investor 
Relations. The Chairman is generally available to shareholders 
and meets with institutional and other large investors; the Senior 
Independent Director is also available as required. 
The Company regularly meets with its large investors and institutional 
shareholders who, along with sell-side research analysts, are invited to 
presentations by the Company immediately after the announcement 
of the Company’s interim and full year results. They are also invited 
to participate in conference calls following the announcement of the 
Company’s trading statements. The content of these presentations and 
conference calls are webcast and are posted on the Company’s website 
(www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre) so as to be available to all 
investors. 
The Board at each Board meeting receives feedback on the views of 
major investors and the IR programme. In addition, Makinson Cowell 
provide investor relations consultancy services to the Company and 
give an external analysis to the Board at the Strategy Conference on 
the views of institutional investors and sell-side analysts. Non-Executive 
Directors also receive regular market reports and broker updates from 
the Company’s IR department.
Shareholders have the opportunity to meet and question the Board at 
the AGM, which this year will be held on 10 July 2013. There will be a 
display of various aspects of the Company’s activities and Justin King 
will make a business presentation. A detailed explanation of each item of 
special business to be considered at the AGM is included with the Notice 
of Meeting which will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. All resolutions proposed at the AGM will be taken on 
a poll vote. This follows best practice guidelines and enables the Company 
to count all votes, not just those of shareholders who attend the meeting. 
Information on matters of particular interest to investors is set out on 
pages 125 to 127 and on the Company’s website (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/
investor-centre).
Board Committees 
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to the Operating 
Board and to the Audit, Corporate Responsibility, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees. The terms of reference for each 
Committee are available on the website (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/
investor-centre/corporate-governance).
Operating Board
Day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the Operating 
Board, which is chaired by Justin King. The Operating Board held ten 
scheduled meetings during the year and each Director’s responsibilities 
are set out on page 37. It has formal terms of reference setting out its 
key responsibilities. 
The Operating Board has delegated certain powers to the Trading 
Board, the Investment Board, the Group Safety Committee and the 
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Steering Group, each 
of which has approved terms of reference setting out its areas of 
responsibility.

The year’s key highlights are noted on pages 8 and 9 within the  
Non-Financial KPIs and other examples are integrated across the 
Business review. 
This track record has once again been recognised by numerous awards 
and sustainability indices. A selection of these is listed on these pages 
with others noted on our corporate website. In particular, we maintained 
our Global Sector leader status in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, 
for the sixth year running, having first joined in 2003. We retained our 
listing in the FTSE4Good Index, which we have been part of since its 
inception in 2001. 
As the Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee, I will  
report to the Board twice a year on our plans and on the progress  
we have made against each of our values.
We will once again be providing a further public update on progress  
in November for our customers, colleagues, partners and shareholders,  
as well as continuing our practice of providing a Corporate 
Responsibility and Sustainability update with every Trading Update.

Jean Tomlin, Chairman, 
Corporate Responsibility Committee
Dear Shareholder,
Corporate responsibility 
and sustainability remain an 
integral part of Sainsbury’s 
overall business strategy and an 
important part of our vision to  
be the most trusted retailer where 
people love to work and shop.
I joined the Sainsbury’s Board in January 2013, and was delighted to 
become Chairman of the Corporate Responsibility Committee from 
my predecessor Anna Ford, having been impressed with Sainsbury’s 
approach to sustainability in recent years. 
Our five corporate values of ‘Best for food and health’, ‘Sourcing with 
integrity’, ‘Respect for our environment’, ‘Making a positive difference 
to our community’ and ‘A great place to work’ remain as important  
as ever to our ongoing success. They frame the Company’s work  
day-to-day and are part of our heritage. With 23 million customer 
transactions each week and employing around 157,000 colleagues and 
working with over 2,000 direct suppliers in over 70 countries, we  
need to manage our significant economic, social and environmental 
value chain.
Sainsbury’s 20x20 Sustainability Plan is both ambitious and essential to 
the future health of our business. In November, we updated on progress 
during the first year since its October 2011 launch. Two innovative ‘crowd 
sourcing’ events saw over 300 stakeholders provide detailed feedback 
and advice to inform the agenda’s future direction and engage them in 
its delivery. The team has also been working with our own-brand and 
branded suppliers – both individually and collectively – to ensure they 
are playing their part and fully embracing the Plan. 
Sainsbury’s is also engaging customers in the ideas and actions that 
20x20 stands for. The Company’s overarching Live Well For Less 
mission chimes perfectly with this, and is underpinned by more specific 
campaigns such as Switch the Fish, Love Ugly Veg, Make Your Roast 
Go Further, Million Meals Appeal, Active Kids and of course Sainsbury’s 
involvement in the Paralympics and inclusivity.
As a result, our customers now rate Sainsbury’s ahead of our peers for 
taking our responsibilities seriously. In an environment where trust is 
an ever more precious asset for any business, the team are focused on 
ensuring Sainsbury’s values continue to make us different.
Our ‘New Fashioned Values’ consumer insight report showed that more 
than ever people are looking to vote with their wallets and choose 
companies they trust to do the right thing and act on their behalf. 
Sainsbury’s values and the 20x20 Sustainability Plan offer both an 
assurance and a roadmap in this regard.  44  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Corporate Responsibility Committee
During the year the Committee was chaired by Anna Ford, and Justin 
King and Mary Harris are its members. Jean Tomlin became Chairman 
of the Committee in January 2013 when Anna Ford stood down from 
the Board. David Tyler attends each meeting. It met twice during the 
year. These formal Committee meetings were supported by Corporate 
Responsibility and Sustainability (‘CR&S’) strategic meetings that were 
hosted by Anna Ford and Justin King. Each meeting is based around 
one of the five CR&S values and key external stakeholders are invited to 
attend. During the year five such meetings were held, relating to each of 
the five values, framed within our 20x20 Sustainability Plan which was 
launched in October 2011.
The Committee is supported by an internal CR&S governance structure 
whereby members of the Operating Board have responsibility for each 
of our five values and sit on our CR&S Steering Group, which meets 
quarterly and is chaired by Justin King. The members of the Steering 
Group are shown opposite. 
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the website  
at www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance. 
This year’s 20x20 Sustainability Plan update will be published in 
November 2013.

Our 20x20 Sustainability Plan
In many ways, the commitments encapsulated in our 20x20 
Sustainability Plan are not new to Sainsbury’s. We have sought 
throughout our 144-year history to lead in matters of business 
responsibility and sustainability. Examples of our contribution over the 
past decade include transforming the market for fairly traded products 
and sustainable seafood, improving animal welfare, supporting British 
farming and championing community investment.
With our 20x20 Sustainability Plan, we formalise our action against 
our values, as well as recognising the new and changing issues which 
today’s world faces.
In developing the plan, in 2011 we undertook a detailed auditing and 
materiality process. This year, we continued to listen to our customers, 
suppliers and opinion formers to make sure we have the most relevant 
and effective agenda, leverage the knowledge and experience of experts 
and remain at the forefront of sustainability between now and 2020.
With the clarity of purpose that the 20x20 Sustainability Plan brings,  
we are focused on its delivery, whilst also ensuring we continue to 
engage and look beyond 2020. 45 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder,
The Committee remains 
satisfied that the business 
has maintained robust risk 
management and internal 
controls, supported by strong 
overall governance processes. 
We have a good balance of skills and experience amongst Committee 
members, and we believe that our discussions with management 
are open, thorough and appropriately challenging. We are well 
supported by the internal audit function, and our external auditors 
also give us confidence in the Company’s approach to controls and 
risk. Recent annual evaluations support our belief that governance of 
risk at Sainsbury’s remains strong and that the Committee is working 
effectively.
As a Committee, we are keen to ensure that the identification and 
management of risks is embedded across all areas of the business,  
with effective oversight by the Operating Board. We regularly review the 
risk profiles for each business division and the actions they are taking 
or processes they have in place to manage or mitigate their risks. In 
addition, we frequently receive updates on specific areas of risk from 
the relevant members of the management team. We are satisfied that 
management has instilled a strong culture throughout the business.
Over recent years, the Committee has received updates on the matters 
discussed at the Sainsbury’s Bank Audit Committee and on other key  
Bank matters including its liquidity, cash flows, capital adequacy  
and risk management processes. One of our priorities in 2013/14  
will be to ensure our governance continues to be strong from an  
Audit Committee perspective as we move towards completion of  
our full ownership of the Bank.

Sainsbury’s Bank report
During the year, the Committee has considered a number of matters 
under the general headings above. It monitored the integrity of the 
financial statements and any formal announcements relating to 
the Company’s financial performance and reviewed any significant 
financial judgements contained in them. Within the accounting update 
it considered provisions made by the Company, dilapidations of 
properties and land, impairments, promotional monies and the related 
accounting, and pensions. In addition, the Committee regularly reviewed 
the Company’s funding and liquidity position and has considered its 
impact on the Company’s financial and operational capabilities. The 
Committee’s detailed review of the year-end position assisted the Board 
in making the going concern statement set out on page 70.
 
The Committee considered the key matters relating to the recently 
announced acquisition of the 50 per cent stake in Sainsbury’s Bank that 
we do not currently own. These included the accounting and direct tax 
implications, how the purchase would affect the Group balance sheet 
and how the Committee would continue to receive assurance around 
risk management and internal controls.
At each meeting the Committee receives a report on the internal 
controls framework and the Internal Audit department’s activities. This 
year it received information on major IT projects, business continuity 
planning and details of any invocation of the business continuity 
management team. The Committee reviews the quarterly results of the 
store safe and legal audits to ensure that appropriate standards are 
being maintained. 
The Committee also reviews:
• 
the effectiveness of the Company’s financial controls and the systems 
of internal control by approving the Internal Audit plans twice yearly, 
reviewing the findings quarterly and by reviewing the scope of 
work and reports of the external auditors. The detailed actions for 
resolution of any identified weaknesses are closely monitored by the 
Committee through to completion; and
• 
the management of risk by reviewing the risk assessment process and 
corporate and divisional risk maps and registers twice yearly. These 
form the basis of the Internal Audit planning process.
Full descriptions of the risk management and internal controls 
processes are set out below. 
The Company’s ’whistleblowing’ procedures ensure that arrangements 
are in place to enable colleagues and suppliers to raise concerns about 
possible improprieties on a confidential basis. All issues raised have 
been investigated and appropriate actions taken. Any significant issues 
are highlighted to the Audit Committee.
The Company has a fraud policy and a Serious Fraud Committee, which 
convenes in the event of serious incidents to oversee case management 
and ensure appropriate actions are taken. The Audit Committee 
receives a fraud update at each meeting. 
The Committee also receives an update at each meeting about matters 
discussed at the Sainsbury’s Bank Audit Committee and on any other 
key matters. Given the economic climate it has continued to focus on the 
Bank’s liquidity and cash flows, capital adequacy and risk management 
processes.
Throughout the year, the Committee also reviewed a number of specific 
presentations and updates. For instance, it received an update on the 
Company’s IT change framework, data security controls and significant 
new opportunities being explored beyond the core business. 
Financial statements and significant issues
An accounting paper is prepared by management and presented to the 
Audit Committee four times a year, which provides detail on the main 
financial reporting judgements. Specific accounting papers will also be 
prepared where considered necessary. The significant issues considered 
in the year were as follows:
• 
Review of new contracts to ensure all accounting issues are identified 
and revenue is recognised correctly in line with IAS 18: Revenue.  
One example was our new joint venture, Insight 2 Communication,  
as disclosed within the Business review.
• 
Consideration of provisions held and whether they remain adequate 
and complete. As a result of the review, the majority of the disposal 
provision has been released. See note 22. 
• 
Impairment of both financial and non-financial assets. As disclosed 
in note 2, a review for impairment triggers is performed at each 
reporting date by considering if any current or future events suggest 
their recoverable value may be less than their carrying value. 
This covers stores, depots and land. An impairment review is also 
performed for goodwill. As a result, a provision of £2 million has been 
made against investments in subsidiaries where the carrying value 
exceeded the recoverable amount, as disclosed in note 13. 
• 
Pensions and, in particular, the revision to IAS 19: Employee Benefits, 
to ensure adequate IAS 8 disclosure could be provided within the 
Annual Report and the implications for 2013/14 are understood.  48  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Governance
Corporate governance statement continued
• 
The presentation of certain items outside of underlying profit as 
defined within note 3. Our definition of such items remains clear and 
further disclosure is included where appropriate. 
• 
A review for post balance sheet events has identified two recent 
announcements by the Group that require disclosure within the 
Annual Report. Firstly, the purchase of the remaining 50 per cent of 
Sainsbury’s Bank and secondly, the proposed cessation of the future 
accrual of benefits within our defined benefit pension scheme. Both 
post balance sheet event disclosures have been included within note 37. 
The Audit Committee remains satisfied that reasonable judgements 
have been made by management and adequate disclosures provided 
where appropriate. 
Internal Audit
The Committee has regularly reviewed the Internal Audit department’s 
resources, budget, work programme, results and management’s 
implementation of its recommendations. In 2012, the Committee 
commissioned a review of the function by Deloitte. The overall assessment 
was that it was a high performing function which is well respected by 
its key stakeholders, compliant with the requirements of the Institute of 
Internal Auditors standards and achieving performance levels which were 
considered to be leading practice in many key areas. The review found 
there has been significant improvement since the last external review, 
which had been conducted five years previously.
The Director of Internal Audit reports to the Committee Chairman and 
has direct access to all members of the Committee and the Chairman. 
She is given the opportunity after each meeting to meet with the 
Committee separately without management being present. She has 
regular meetings with all Committee members. The purpose, authority 
and responsibility of Internal Audit are defined in the Internal Audit 
Charter. The Committee reviews the Charter annually. 
External Audit
The Committee reviewed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s (‘PwC’)  
overall work plan, and approved their remuneration and terms of 
engagement. It considered in detail the results of the audit, PwC 
performance and independence and the effectiveness of the overall 
audit process. PwC have been the Company’s auditors since 1995.  
They are required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group 
audit every five years. Richard Hughes, the current audit partner, was 
appointed in July 2010. The Committee recommended PwC’s re-
appointment as auditors to the Board and this resolution will be put to 
shareholders at the AGM.
Independence
In order to ensure their independence, the Committee has implemented 
the Company’s policy which restricts the engagement of PwC in relation 
to non-audit services. The majority of the non-audit work undertaken  
by PwC during 2012/13 was audit related assurance services such as the 
interim review and the provision of accounting advice, fees for which 
totalled £0.2 million. In addition, PwC earned fees for other non-audit 
work of £58,000. The audit fee for the year in respect of the Group, 
Company and its subsidiaries totalled £0.8 million. The Committee 
remains satisfied with PwC’s independence and their overall challenge 
to management. 
The policy was reviewed during the year and is consistent with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards No. 5 – Non Audit Services. 
The policy is designed to ensure that the provision of such services 
does not have an impact on the external auditors’ independence and 
objectivity. It identifies certain types of engagement that the external 
auditors shall not undertake, including internal audit and actuarial 
services relating to the preparation of accounting estimates for the 
financial statements. It also requires that individual engagements 
above a certain fee level may only be undertaken with appropriate 
authority from the Committee Chairman or the Committee. The policy 
also recognises that there are some types of work, such as accounting 
and tax advice, where a detailed understanding of the Company’s 
business is advantageous. The policy is designed to ensure that PwC is 
only appointed to provide a non-audit service where it is considered to 
be the most suitable supplier of the service. The Committee receives a 
report at each meeting on the non-audit services being provided and 
the cumulative total of non-audit fees. In the event that cumulative 
non-audit fees exceed the audit fee then all subsequent non-audit 
expenditure must be approved by the Committee Chairman. 
Grocery Supply Code of Practice 
The Grocery Supply Code of Practice 2010 (‘GSCOP’) requires each 
grocery retailer to which it applies to appoint a Code Compliance 
Officer whose duties include hearing disputes between suppliers and 
the relevant retailer. Sainsbury’s has appointed the Director of Internal 
Audit as its Code Compliance Officer. 
A further GSCOP requirement is that each grocery retailer to which it 
applies must deliver an annual compliance report to the Office of Fair 
Trading which has been approved by the chair of the Audit Committee. 
A summary of the compliance report must be included in our Annual 
Report and Financial Statements.
Summary Annual Compliance Report
Sainsbury’s continues to invest significant time and resource in 
providing comprehensive training to all relevant colleagues as required 
under GSCOP. This training is reinforced by online knowledge testing 
and further supported by training and reference materials on our 
intranet. Sainsbury’s has also dedicated internal legal resource to 
provide all relevant colleagues with day-to-day advice and guidance.
A small number of alleged breaches of GSCOP have been received in the 
reporting period, all of which either have been or are in the process of 
being resolved to the supplier’s satisfaction within the Trading Division 
using our standard internal escalation procedure. The resolution of 
one of these alleged breaches was facilitated by the Code Compliance 
Officer.
Risk management and internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and the 
system of internal controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. Certain 
of these responsibilities have been delegated to the Audit Committee 
as outlined on page 47. The system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Company’s business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The risk management process and the system of internal controls 
have been in place for the whole year, up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements, and accord with the Turnbull 
guidance and the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of 
internal controls and has ensured that any required remedial action on 
any identified weaknesses has been, or is being taken.
Risk management
Accepting that risk is an inherent part of doing business, the risk 
management system is designed to identify key risks and to provide 
assurance that these risks are fully understood and managed. The 
effectiveness of the process is reviewed twice a year by the Audit 
Committee. The Board carries out an annual review of the significant 
risks facing the business. 
The Operating Board maintains an overall corporate risk register which 
is reviewed twice yearly by the Audit Committee and formally discussed 
with the Board. The risk register contains the significant risks faced by the 
business and identifies the potential impact and likelihood at both a gross 
level (before consideration of mitigating controls) and net level (after 
consideration of mitigating controls). This gives the Board the opportunity 
to review the level of risk that the business is prepared to accept. The 
register also contains the assurance provided over current key mitigating 
controls. Where further actions have been identified to mitigate risks to 
a level deemed acceptable, these are agreed with specific timelines for 
delivery and progress on implementation of these actions is monitored. 
The risk management process is embedded at the Operating Board level 
and through the review of the risk registers of each of the operating 
divisions of the business:

managing the risks to their business objectives and for identification

responsibility are appropriately identified, evaluated and managed;
• 
this divisional risk process is achieved through twice yearly workshops 
held by the divisional management and facilitated by Internal Audit. 
Each divisional management team produces and maintains a divisional 
key risk register. The likelihood and impact of each key risk is evaluated, 
management’s risk appetite is discussed and actions deemed 
necessary to mitigate the risk are identified. In addition, the risks and 
the robustness of the mitigating controls are regularly reviewed by 
divisional management as part of their normal business activities;
•

managing their business objectives and that the internal controls are 
such that they provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that 
the risks in their areas of responsibility are appropriately identified,

Internal Audit provides independent assurance to management and 
the Audit Committee as to the existence and effectiveness of the risk 
management process; and
• 
the Board reviews the risk process and corporate risks in May and

Governance
Corporate governance statement continued
Internal controls
The system of internal control encompasses all controls, including those 
relating to financial reporting processes (including the preparation of 
the consolidated Group accounts), operational and compliance controls 
and those relating to risk management processes. It also includes the 
controls over Sainsbury’s interests in Sainsbury’s Bank and property 
joint ventures.
The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the internal controls 
systems on an ongoing basis, enabling a cumulative assessment to be 
made. The processes used during the year to support this assessment 
are as follows:
• 
discussion and approval by the Board of the Company’s strategy, 
plans and objectives, and the risks to achieving them;
• 
review and approval by the Board of budgets and forecasts, including 
those for both revenue and capital expenditure;
• 
regular reviews by management of the risks to achieving objectives 
and mitigating controls and actions;
• 
regular reviews by management and the Audit Committee of the 
scope and results of the work of Internal Audit across the Company 
and of the implementation of their recommendations;
• 
regular reviews by the Audit Committee of the scope and results of 
the work of the external auditors and of any significant issues arising;
• 
regular reviews by the Audit Committee of accounting policies and 
levels of delegated authority; and
• 
regular reviews by the Board and the Audit Committee of material 
fraudulent activity and any significant whistleblowing by colleagues or 
suppliers, and actions being taken to remedy any control weaknesses. 51 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
The most significant principal risks identified by the Board and the 
corresponding mitigating controls are set out below in no order of priority.
Business continuity and major incidents response 
Risk
A major incident or catastrophic event could impact on the 
Group’s ability to trade. 
Mitigation
Sainsbury’s has detailed plans in place, supported by senior 
representatives who are trained in dealing with major incidents 
and have the authority levels to make decisions in the event of a 
potentially disruptive incident.
The Business Continuity Steering Group meets quarterly to ensure 
that the business continuity (‘BC’) policy and strategy is fit for 
purpose. In addition, it oversees the mitigation of all risks associated 
with BC and IT disaster recovery. In the event of any unplanned 
or unforeseen events the Business Continuity Management Team 
is convened at short notice to manage any associated risk to the 
business.
All key strategic locations have secondary backup sites which would be 
made available within pre-defined timescales and are regularly tested.
Business strategy 
Risk
If the Board adopts the wrong business strategy or does not 
communicate or implement its strategies effectively, the 
business may be negatively impacted. Risks to delivering the 
strategy need to be properly understood and managed to 
deliver long-term growth for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Mitigation
A clear strategy remains in place with five key areas of focus:
• 
Great food;
• 
Compelling general merchandise & clothing;
• 
Complementary channels & services;
• 
Developing new business; and
• 
Growing space & creating property value.
Progress against these areas of focus and any risks to delivery, such 
as the availability of suitable new store sites, are regularly reviewed by 
the Board and the overall strategy is reviewed at the two-day Strategy 
Conference. The Operating Board also holds regular sessions to discuss 
strategy. This activity is supported by a dedicated strategy team. 
To ensure the strategy is communicated and understood, the Group 
engages with a wide range of stakeholders including shareholders, 
colleagues, customers and suppliers on a continual basis.
Governance
Corporate governance statement continued
Our Principal Risks & Uncertainties
The risk management process is closely aligned to our strategy,  
which focuses on growing the business through the addition of  
new range, space, business development, channels to market and 
property management. Risk is an inherent part of doing business.  
The management of these risks is based on a balance of risk and 
reward determined through careful assessment of both the potential 
likelihood and impact as well as risk appetite. Consideration is given to 
both reputational as well as financial impact, recognising the significant 
commercial value attributable to the Sainsbury’s brand. Each principal 
risk and uncertainty is considered in the context of how it relates to the 
achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. The current business 
strategy and objectives are categorised into five areas of focus as follows:

Operational excellence
Our values make us different 52  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Colleague engagement, retention and capability
Risk
The Group employs around 157,000 colleagues who are critical 
to the success of our business. Attracting and maintaining good 
relations with talented colleagues and investing in their training 
and development is essential to the efficiency and sustainability 
of the Group’s operations. 
Mitigation
The Group’s employment policies and remuneration and benefits 
packages are regularly reviewed and are designed to be competitive 
with other companies, as well as providing colleagues with fulfilling 
career opportunities. Colleague surveys, performance reviews, 
communications with trade unions and regular communication 
of business activities are some of the methods the Group uses to 
understand and respond to colleagues’ needs. Processes are also 
in place to identify talent and actively manage succession planning 
throughout the business.
Data security
Risk
It is essential that the security of customer, colleague or 
company confidential data is maintained. A major breach of 
information security could have a major impact on the business. 
Mitigation
Various information security policies and standards are in place 
which focus on encryption, network security, access controls, system 
security, data protection and information handling. A review of key 
contractors across the organisation who hold sensitive customer 
or colleague data is ongoing, and progress is monitored by the 
Information Security Committee. A risk based security testing 
approach across Sainsbury’s IT infrastructure and applications is in 
place to identify and remediate ongoing vulnerabilities.
 
Developing new business 
Risk
Exploring a range of new opportunities beyond our core 
business forms part of our five areas of focus. Robust 
identification and management of risks associated with the new 
business development agenda is essential to support successful 
delivery of objectives.
Mitigation
The existing risk management framework and processes embedded in 
the business extend to exploring new opportunities beyond the core. 
All projects have a steering group and subject matter experts are 
engaged as appropriate. A formal review and approval governance 
structure is also in place. 
Environment and sustainability 
Risk
Environment and sustainability are core to Sainsbury’s values. 
The key risk facing the Group in this area relates to reducing the 
environmental impact of the business with a focus on reducing 
packaging and new ways of reducing waste and energy usage 
across stores, depots and offices.
Mitigation
A number of initiatives are in place, which are being led by the 
Environmental Action Team and the Corporate Responsibility & 
Sustainability Steering Group, to reduce our environmental impact 
and to meet our customers’ expectations in this area. Further details 
are included in the Corporate Responsibility review on pages 43 to 45.
Financial strategy and treasury risk 
Risk
The main financial risks are the availability of short and long-term 
funding to meet business needs, counterparty liabilities and 
fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates which continue 
to be impacted by the turbulence in the financial markets.
Mitigation
The Group Treasury function is responsible for managing the Group’s 
liquid resources, funding requirements and interest rate and currency 
exposures and the associated risks as set out in note 28 on page 
104. The Group Treasury function has clear policies and operating 
procedures which are regularly reviewed and audited.
Health and safety – people and product 
Risk
Prevention of injury or loss of life for both colleagues and 
customers is of utmost importance. In addition, it is paramount to 
maintaining the confidence our customers have in our business.
Mitigation
Clear policies and procedures are in place detailing the controls 
required to manage health and safety and product safety risks 
across the business and comply with all applicable regulations. These 
cover the end-to-end operation, from the auditing and vetting of 
construction contractors, to the health and safety processes in place 
in our depots, stores and offices to the controls in place to ensure 
people and product safety and integrity. 
In addition, established product testing programmes are also in place 
to support rigorous monitoring of product traceability and provide 
assurance over product safety and integrity. Supplier terms and 
conditions and product specifications set clear standards for product/
raw material safety and quality which suppliers are expected to 
comply with.
Process compliance is supported by external accreditation and 
internal training programmes, which are aligned to both health and 
safety laws and Sainsbury’s internal policies. In addition, resource 
is dedicated to manage the risk effectively, in the form of the Group 
Safety Committee and specialist teams including Convenience Risk 
Managers and Logistics and Commercial Safety Specialists.
IT systems and infrastructure 
Risk
The Group is reliant on its IT systems and operational infrastructure 
in order to trade efficiently. Inadequate systems or failure of key 
systems could have a significant impact on our business.
Mitigation
The Group has extensive controls in place to maintain the integrity and 
efficiency of its systems including detailed recovery plans in the event of a 
significant failure. New innovations and upgrades to systems are ongoing 
to improve both the customer experience and colleague efficiency. Prior 
to introducing system changes, rigorous testing is completed. 
Governance
Corporate governance statement continued 53 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Pension risk 
Risk
The Group operates a number of pension arrangements which 
includes a defined benefit scheme. This scheme is subject to 
risks in relation to its liabilities as a result of changes in life 
expectancy, inflation and future salary increases, and to risks 
regarding the value of investments and the returns derived 
from such investments. 
Mitigation
An investment strategy is in place which has been developed by the 
pension trustee, in consultation with the Company, to mitigate the 
volatility of liabilities, to diversify investment risk and to manage cash. 
In April 2013, a proposal was announced to close the Sainsbury’s 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme to future accrual, which will help us to 
manage the escalating costs of pensions and protect the pension that 
colleagues have already built up in the scheme. A consultation period 
is currently underway following which a final decision will be made.
Regulatory environment 
Risk
The Group’s operations are subject to a broad spectrum of 
regulatory requirements. Key areas subject to regulation 
include planning, competition and environmental issues, 
employment, pensions and tax laws and regulations over the 
Group’s products and services.
Failure to comply with laws and regulations could lead to civil 
and/or criminal legal prosecution and fines or imprisonment 
imposed on Sainsbury’s or our colleagues. In addition, a breach 
could lead to reputational damage.
Mitigation
There is an established governance process in place to monitor 
regulatory developments and to ensure that all existing and 
forthcoming regulations are complied with. Regular reviews are 
completed across the estate to ensure compliance and that training 
needs are addressed as required.
Processes for monitoring and embedding training for key new 
legislation are in place and Sainsbury’s also has a dedicated internal 
legal department to provide the relevant colleagues impacted by the 
regulations with advice and guidance.
Trading environment 
Risk
Effective management of the trading account is key to 
the achievement of performance targets. The continued 
challenging economic environment and competitive retail 
pressure could affect the performance of the Group in terms of 
sales, costs and operations, through:
• 
 the ongoing challenges to household disposable income;
• 
competitor pricing positions; 
• 
the reduction of the industry profit pool in the last year; and
• 
commodity costs driving up the cost of goods.
There is also a risk of supplier or other counterparty failure, 
with possible operational or financial consequences for  
the Group.
Mitigation
We continue to focus on delivering quality products with ‘universal 
appeal’, at a range of price points ensuring value for all our customers. 
This is achieved through the continuous review of our key customer 
metrics, monitoring of current market trends and price points across 
competitors, active management of price positions, development of 
sales propositions and increased promotion and marketing activity. 
While external cost pressures including oil-related costs, commodity 
pricing and business rates affect our business, the Group continues to 
work hard to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures on customers 
and on our overall profitability through the delivery of cost savings. 
Sainsbury’s undertakes credit checks on suppliers and maintains regular, 
open dialogue with key suppliers concerning their ability to trade.
Transitional risk – Sainsbury’s Bank 
Risk
Acquiring full ownership of Sainsbury’s Bank will introduce 
change-driven operational risk in particular through the 
transitional period. This transitional risk could have an adverse 
impact on people, processes, regulatory compliance and 
technical infrastructure. Failure to transition successfully may 
have an adverse impact on the Sainsbury’s brand. A robust 
risk management process is essential to support successful 
transition. 
Mitigation
Executive sponsorship and a change governance structure is in place 
to manage and oversee the transition, including engagement of 
management with financial services experience. The risk management 
process includes early identification of key transitional risks along with 
mitigation plans. Tracking of risk mitigation effectiveness will be ongoing 
throughout the transitional period.

Remuneration report
Mary Harris, Chairman,  
Remuneration Committee
We are keen to ensure that our shareholders fully understand our 
approach to pay. We await the final announcement from the Department 
for Business, Innovation & Skills (‘BIS’) on the new reporting 
requirements. While the new legislation will not come into effect until 
October 2013, we have already adopted some of the future changes, 
while retaining all content required under the existing regulations. 
Finally, I would like to thank Bob Stack, following his retirement last  
year, for his leadership of the Committee since 2005, as well as 
welcoming John McAdam and Jean Tomlin to the Committee.  
We remain committed to rewarding the leadership team for the  
delivery of long-term shareholder value creation, while staying  
true to our Company values.
Mary Harris
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
2012/13 has been a year of good 
performance, despite tough 
trading conditions. We have had 
record customer transactions, 
increased total sales by 4.3 per 
cent (excluding fuel), improved 
underlying profit before tax by  
6.2 per cent and grown our market 
share to 16.8 per cent, its highest 
for a decade. This performance 
has been reflected in the payments 
under our incentive plans, where 
we have met, and in some cases 
exceeded, our stretching targets. 
Our approach to pay is holistic, we consider the o verall package, as well 
as each individual element to ensure it is appropriately balanced. We 
also take into account the pay and benefits of colleagues throughout 
the business, are extremely mindful of the economic and political 
environment regarding executive remuneration and exercise appropriate 
judgement to ensure that rewards are reflective of underlying 
performance. We are not proposing any changes to the remuneration 
policy for 2013/14 and the 2013 salary increases for Executive Directors 
and managers were in line with colleague increases and below inflation.
The over-arching principles of our remuneration policy are to balance 
reward with performance and encourage sustainable shareholder value 
creation. We ensure there is a sufficient weighting on variable pay to 
drive the delivery of business objectives, without undue risk-taking. 
The variable pay arrangements throughout the Company have been 
structured to reward short-term financial and operating performance 
(Annual Bonus), sustainable business development (Deferred Share 
Award) and creation of value to shareholders over the longer-term 
(Future Builder; previously Value Builder).
• 
Annual Bonus – our profit and sales growth over the year have 
resulted in a record bonus pool of over £90 million, which was shared 
by over 134,000 colleagues across the business. For the Executive 
Directors the average payment is 85 per cent of the maximum, 
compared to 47 per cent last year. 
• 
Deferred Share Award – following the delivery of strong financial  
and strategic performance during the year, awards were made at  
83 per cent of the maximum.
• 
Value Builder – in May 2013, the fifth cycle of Value Builder, in which 
over 1,000 managers participate, will mature at a performance 
multiplier of 1.75 times (44 per cent of the maximum), reflecting our 
performance over the previous three years.  55 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Summary of performance and pay for 2012/13
Despite a challenging year for the retail sector and wider economy, we 
continued to deliver a good performance in 2012/13, outperforming 
the market and growing our market share. Our colleagues and 
Executive team worked hard to provide a great service for customers 
and this, combined with a quality range of food and non-food, has 
led to continued sales growth and profitability. All of this was against 
the backdrop of what was truly a ‘year like no other’ with Sainsbury’s

(appointed 11 July 2012) and Jean Tomlin (appointed 1 January 2013). 
Bob Stack was Chairman until 11 July 2012 and Anna Ford was a member 
of the Committee to 31 December 2012. All members of the Committee 
are independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Role and responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee complies with relevant regulations and considers best 
practice when determining pay and policy. The specific responsibilities 
of the Committee include: 
• 
Determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration policy for 
the Chairman, Executive Directors and the Operating Board Directors; 
• 
Setting individual remuneration arrangements for the Chairman and 
Executive Directors;
• 
Recommending and monitoring the level and structure of 
remuneration for those members of senior management within the 
scope of the Committee, namely the Operating Board Directors and 
any other executive whose salary exceeds that of any Operating 
Board Director;
• 
Reviewing and noting the remuneration trends across the Company;
• 
Considering the achievement of the performance conditions under 
annual and long-term incentive/bonus arrangements; and
• 
Approving the service agreements of each Executive Director, 
including termination arrangements.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s 
website (www.j-sainsbury.co.uk/investor-centre/corporate-governance). 
Tim Fallowfield, Company Secretary, acts as secretary to the 
Committee. David Tyler, Justin King and Gwyn Burr, Customer Service 
and Colleague Director (to 16 March 2013), Angie Risley, Group HR 
Director (from 7 January 2013) and Diana Breeze, Director of Corporate 
HR are invited to attend Committee meetings. The Committee considers 
their views when reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and Operating Board Directors. Individuals who attend Remuneration 
Committee meetings do not participate in discussions concerning their 
own remuneration. 
The Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers 
if it considers this beneficial. Over the course of the year, the Committee 
was supported by its appointed advisers, Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’), 
whose consultants attended all of the Committee meetings. Deloitte 
provided the Company with unrelated advice and consultancy regarding 
information technology, taxation and non-audit accounting matters. 
Towers Watson provided comparative data which was considered by  
the Committee in setting remuneration levels and it also provided  
other services relating to pensions. Deloitte and Towers Watson are 
members of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operate 
under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK.

Remuneration policy
Our colleagues are central to the Company’s ongoing success and the 
Company’s overall reward strategy needs to support this. Our objective 
is to have a fair, equitable and competitive total reward package that 
supports our vision of being a place where colleagues love to work 
and shop, encourages colleagues to perform in ways that deliver great 
service for customers and drives sales and provides opportunities for 
colleagues to share in Sainsbury’s success. This overall reward strategy 
is the foundation for the remuneration policy for senior executives.
The over-arching objectives of the remuneration policy are to ensure 
rewards are performance-based and encourage long-term shareholder 
value creation. Reflecting the scope and responsibilities of senior 
executives, the remuneration policy seeks to:
• 
Link rewards to the delivery of the business strategy, specifically the 
five areas of focus (as described in the Business review);
• 
Support the Company values as outlined in our 20x20 Sustainability 
Plan;
• 
Drive the right behaviours for long-term growth;
• 
Secure high calibre leaders who can deliver operational excellence; 
and
• 
Encourage executives to become shareholders in the Company. 
The Committee takes a rounded approach to pay and considers a 
variety of factors when determining the remuneration policy, setting 
executives’ remuneration packages and implementing them. It believes 
it is important to exercise suitable judgement at all stages during the 
process to ensure that executive pay levels appropriately reflect the 
long-term shareholder experience.
The Committee regularly reviews the overall structure of remuneration 
for senior executives to ensure that it continues to evolve alongside the 
objectives of the business and supports the interests of shareholders.
When reviewing or amending remuneration arrangements, the 
Committee considers pay practices across the Company, the impact 
on colleague behaviour, the cost to the Company, share dilution, 
stakeholder views (including shareholders, governance bodies 
and colleagues), best practice corporate governance and market 
competitiveness, particularly within the retail sector. It also considers 
the overall performance of the Company within the context of the retail 
market and the wider economic environment. 
The table overleaf summarises each element of the remuneration 
package, with further details set out after the table.  58  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Consideration of colleague pay and how the 
Remuneration Policy relates to the wider Company 
When considering remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, 
the Committee takes into account, as a matter of course, the pay and 
conditions of colleagues throughout the Company.
In particular, the Committee is kept informed of any major changes to 
the pay and benefits of colleagues generally and the Committee takes 
into account wider pay issues when determining Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. 
Many aspects of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
are consistent with the reward strategy for all colleagues across the 
Company. However, below executive level, pay and benefits are lower in 
aggregate, driven by market comparatives and the nature of the roles. 
When considering salary increases for management the individual’s 
performance and market rate for the role are considered, within the 
scope of the overall salary pot. For hourly paid colleagues a number 
of internal and external factors determine the rate of pay. Executive 
Director salary increases of around 2.1 per cent are in line with those  
of the wider workforce averaging 2.2 per cent.
In terms of variable incentives, annual bonus plans are operated across 
the Company and are aligned under a common set of principles with 
performance metrics tailored to different populations. All colleagues’ 
bonuses include an element on sales and customer-focussed measures. 
For 2012/13, the total bonus pool was over £90 million. 
Long-term incentives are reserved for those senior executives expected 
to have the greatest influence on Company performance over time. 
All colleagues have the opportunity to become shareholders in the 
Company through our all-employee share plans.
Participation in a pension plan is also offered to all colleagues on a 
contributory basis, with the Company contribution varying by grade. 
The Committee is being kept up-to-date on the proposed closure of 
the Defined Benefit Pension Plan for existing members, on which the 
Company is currently consulting with its members. Pensions auto-
enrolment launched in October 2012 and 57,000 colleagues were 
enrolled, with an opt-out rate of around six per cent. Overall, 96,000 
colleagues now participate in a Company pension plan. 
A range of other benefits are also offered, including colleague discount.
Total remuneration under different  
performance scenarios
The Committee believes it is important for Executive Directors that 
both a significant portion of the package is performance-related and a 
significant proportion is delivered in shares to align their interests with 
shareholders. The balance between the fixed pay (basic salary, pension 
and benefits) and variable pay (Annual Bonus, Deferred Share Award 
and Long-Term Incentive Plan) changes with performance. The variable 
proportion of total remuneration increases significantly for increased 
levels of performance. At least 60 per cent of the package is delivered 
through variable pay at on-target performance and this proportion 
increases to at least three-quarters of the package at maximum levels  
of performance.
The charts show for the Chief Executive and the Executive Directors 
their 2013/14 total remuneration potential under three performance 
scenarios (excluding the effect of share price movements).

Elements of remuneration
Basic salary 
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the 
Committee, taking account of a number of internal and external factors 
including the role, responsibilities, job size and scope, as well as external 
pay data. Furthermore, the Committee considers such information as 
economic factors, remuneration trends and focuses in particular on the 
general level of salary increases awarded throughout the Company. The 
Committee uses the same approach when reviewing the salaries of the 
Operating Board Directors. 
The external pay data provided to the Committee is sourced from 
relevant roles within the UK retail sector, in companies with annual 
sales revenues over £5 billion and also in companies with a market 
capitalisation ranging from £3 to £11 billion. This approach ensures that 
the most appropriate available benchmark for the Director’s specific 
position is obtained; however, in line with best practice, the Committee 
applies judgement when considering market data. 
The Committee reviewed the Executive Directors’ salaries for the start 
of the 2013/14 financial year. In the context of another good year, the 
Committee agreed salary increases for 2013/14 that were in line with 
those made to colleagues generally averaging 2.2 per cent (consisting  
of a review for management and non-management central colleagues  
of 2.0 per cent in March 2013 and for hourly paid retail colleagues of  
2.5 per cent in September 2012).

John Rogers £510,000 £520,000 2.0
Pensions 
The Company’s Defined Benefit Pension Plan was closed to new 
members on 31 January 2002 and none of the Executive Directors 
participate in it. 
In lieu of pension plan participation, Justin King receives a pension 
supplement of 30 per cent of salary and Mike Coupe receives a pension 
supplement of 25 per cent of salary.
John Rogers participates in the JS Self Invested Pension Plan, a defined 
contribution arrangement which is open to all senior management. 
In return for contributing five per cent of his salary, the Company 
contributes 12.5 per cent of his salary up to an internal earnings cap 
(£137,400 for 2012/13). He receives a pension supplement of 25 per cent 
of the pensionable salary he was paid in excess of the earnings cap.
Benefits 
Benefits for Directors include the provision of company car benefits, 
private medical cover, long-term disability insurance, life assurance and 
colleague discount. 
Annual Bonus
2013/14 policy
All bonus plans across the Company are aligned under a set of common 
principles. The Board and management plans continue to be based on 
profit and sales growth, customer-focussed measures and an element for 
individual performance. Bonus awards are weighted to the achievement 
of profit (at least 50 per cent) and profit continues to act as the overall 
‘gateway’ measure for the plan, reflecting the emphasis on growing 
profit. For 2013/14, the targets will be set to reward stretching year-on-
year growth. The Annual Bonus is paid in cash after the year-end.
The customer-focussed measures are based on availability (which 
is measured across all stores on a regular basis by an independent 
third party, conducting random and unannounced store visits) and a 
customer service measure. 
Individual performance objectives are set annually for each Executive 
Director and are reviewed by the Committee. These objectives cover 
a variety of financial and operational targets that contribute to the 
achievement of longer-term strategic goals; some of these objectives 
relate, either directly or indirectly, to the Company’s values. 
The maximum Annual Bonus opportunity remains unchanged from last 
year at 125 per cent of basic salary for the Chief Executive and 90 per 
cent of basic salary for the other Executive Directors.
2012/13 payment
The performance measures for 2012/13 are the same as outlined above 
for 2013/14. The Committee assessed performance against the targets 
following the end of the financial year and, in summary, the outturn is 
as follows:
Profit Sales Customer– 
focused
Individual 
performance
Above target
• • •
Target
•
Threshold
Below threshold
During the year the Company achieved strong year-on-year growth in 
sales and profit and performed well against the stretching targets which 
were set across all elements of the plan at the start of the year.
Based on the above performance outcomes, the table below sets out the 
Executive Directors’ bonus payments for 2012/13. For information, the 
average bonus over the last three years has been: 2011/12 – 48 per cent 
of salary, 2010/11 – 48 per cent of salary and 2009/10 – 92 per cent of 
salary.
Annual Bonus for 2012/13
Value Per cent of salary Per cent of maximum
Justin King £996,000 106% 85%
Mike Coupe £449,000 78% 87%
John Rogers £390,000 76% 84%
The 2012/13 Annual Bonus for store colleagues was based on corporate 
sales, availability and customer service targets measured in their 
individual stores. This has resulted in a record bonus pool of over  
£90 million which will be shared by over 134,000 colleagues. 
Deferred Share Award 
2013/14 policy
Since 2009, the Deferred Share Award (‘DSA’) has been used to drive 
performance against a diverse range of business-critical financial and 
non-financial scorecard measures. This plan has become a vital part 
of the remuneration package and rewards Directors for achieving the 
short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, 
long-term growth of the Company. Share-based awards are made 
further ensuring alignment of Directors’ interests with shareholders.
The DSA covers the top 45 managers in the Company, including 
Executive Directors. The Committee has reviewed the DSA’s 
performance framework for 2013/14 and performance will continue to 
be measured against a basket of key strategic measures aligned under 
four broad categories:
1. Financial performance;
2. Returns to shareholders;
3. Relative performance against peers; and
4. Strategic goals. 
When developing the DSA, the Committee gave careful consideration 
to the selection of its performance measures and targets, as well as 
to the robustness of the plan design. The Committee also agreed that 
appropriate corporate responsibility targets would be included within 
the strategic goals category.  61 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Governance
Remuneration report continued
At least 50 per cent of the award will be based on the delivery of 
financial performance (e.g. profit and earnings per share) and returns 
to shareholders (e.g. Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and dividend 
yield). The balance will be based on measures which will assess the 
Company’s performance relative to its competitors (e.g. market share) 
as well as key strategic and corporate goals, linked to the five areas of 
focus. In addition, no shares will be awarded unless the profit gateway 
target (as applied to the Annual Bonus) is achieved. As a further means 
of ensuring robust performance measurement, a feature of the plan 
is that during the year, the Committee receives an interim appraisal to 
gauge the progress of performance and the plan’s effectiveness based 
on half-year results.
Performance is assessed over one financial year, but any shares 
awarded are deferred for a further two years. The shares are subject 
to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed for cause prior to 
their release date. Dividends accrue on the shares that vest in the form 
of additional shares. 
The maximum DSA award opportunities remain unchanged at 125 per 
cent of basic salary for the Chief Executive and 90 per cent of basic 
salary for the other Executive Directors.
2012/13 award
Following the year-end, the Committee conducted a rigorous 
assessment of performance. Consistent with the underlying principles 
of the DSA, the Committee assessed achievements in the round and 
also considered the manner in which these performance goals had been 
delivered, in particular how the overall performance of the Company 
had contributed to its future, sustainable growth and success. 
The Company performed well in 2012/13 and this flowed through to 
the basket of measures that determine awards under the DSA. The 
Committee agreed that for 2012/13 awards would be made at 83 per 
cent of the maximum level. For information, the previous levels of 
awards have been: 2012 – 78 per cent of the maximum, 2011 – 83  
per cent and 2010 – 88 per cent. The table below sets out the  
2012/13 awards for the Executive Directors.
Deferred Share Award for 2012/13
Value Per cent of salary Per cent of maximum
Justin King £975,000 104% 83%
Mike Coupe £430,000 75% 83%
John Rogers £381,000 75% 83%
Although some of the specific measures and targets are commercially 
sensitive, the sections below present a selection of performance 
highlights within each of the four categories. 
Financial performance 
We performed strongly over the last year and underlying profit before 
tax improved by 6.2 per cent to £756 million. Underlying operating 
margin improved by two basis points to 3.56 per cent and underlying 
basic earnings per share increased by 9.3 per cent to 30.7 pence.
Returns to shareholders
The Company saw its eighth consecutive year of like-for-like sales 
growth, with like-for-like sales (including VAT, excluding fuel) of 1.8 per 
cent. The strong sales performance helped to maintain a strong balance 
sheet, with return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) of 11.2 per cent, a 
year-on-year increase of 12 basis points. This has enabled the Company 
to maintain a good level of returns to shareholders. The proposed full 
year dividend is 16.7 pence, up 3.7 per cent year-on-year (2011/12: 16.1 
pence). The dividend is covered 1.83 times by underlying earnings and 
our dividend yield and price/earnings ratio remain amongst the highest 
in the UK food sector. TSR was assessed on both a relative and absolute 
basis over one, three and five-year periods.
Relative performance 
Our sales grew ahead of the market, with market share increasing to 
16.8 per cent despite the continuing difficult consumer environment. 
The Company was the only one of the top four supermarkets to see a 
year-on-year market share increase. For the 50 weeks from 18 March 
2012 to 02 March 2013 we outperformed the Institute of Grocery 
Distribution (‘IGD’) pool by 2.0 per cent (source: IGD Market Track).  
We won the top award, Supermarket of the Year, in the Retail Industry 
Awards 2012 for the fifth time in seven years and for a third year 
running won the Convenience Chain of the Year award.
Strategic goals 
The Company’s strategy continues to centre on our five areas of focus. 
These are underpinned by Sainsbury’s strong heritage and brand which 
consistently set it apart from major competitors. Further details on the 
corporate objectives can be found in the Business review and details of 
the corporate responsibility commitments are summarised on  
pages 22 to 25. 
• 
We made good progress this year on Great Food. Customers 
increasingly buy into our own-brand food offer, which has grown by 
nearly five per cent in the year and now accounts for half of our food 
sales. The successful re-launch of our core by Sainsbury’s range 
is now complete with over 6,500 lines, many of which are new or 
improved. Sales grew ahead of our major competitors’ comparable 
ranges and by Sainsbury’s won the prestigious Grocer Gold Own 
Label Brand of the Year award. Our Taste the Difference range is also 
growing strongly at nearly 10 per cent and is gaining market share. We 
are about to start a re-launch of our basics brand, the second largest 
value brand in the market, due to be complete by early 2014. Overall, 
Sainsbury’s own-brand ranges rank second in market share of the top 
four supermarkets.
• 
Our non-food offer builds customer loyalty – customers who buy 
clothing and general merchandise, as well as food, shop with us more 
frequently and spend more than those who only buy food. In February, 
we achieved the significant milestone of £1 billion in annual general 
merchandise sales, a reflection of the investment we have made in 
space and the quality of our offer.
• 
We continued the development of our multi-channel offer. Our 
convenience business, which we have built and invested in over the 
past 15 years, has five million customer transactions each week 
and sales of over £1.5 billion. Convenience stores have delivered 
sales growth of over 17 per cent year-on-year, driven by both new 
space and like-for-like sales growth. We have continued to open one 
or two convenience stores each week, bringing our total number 
of convenience stores to 523. Our groceries online business is 
also growing strongly at around 20 per cent year-on-year, and we 
have the ability to deliver to over 96 per cent of UK households. 
Sainsbury’s Bank has enjoyed another successful year, delivering 
its fifth consecutive year of profit growth, with our share of the joint 
venture post-tax profit up 38 per cent to £22 million. We are pleased 
to have reached an agreement with Lloyds Banking Group to acquire 
their 50 per cent shareholding of Sainsbury’s Bank and take sole 
ownership which will allow future products to be even more tailored 
to Sainsbury’s customers.
• 
During the year, we continued to develop new businesses. We have 
formed a joint venture with Aimia, owner of the Nectar programme. 
The new company, I
2
C (Insight 2 Communication), will benefit 
customers through timely, relevant and accessible offers, based 
on their likes and dislikes, while brands benefit from insight-based 
marketing solutions and a greater return on investment. Also, with 
the purchase of a majority stake in Anobii, now operating as eBooks 
by Sainsbury’s, and our partnership with Rovi Corporation, an on-
demand video streaming service, we continue our drive into the online 
and digital entertainment market. These new and exciting business 
relationships underline our commitment to becoming a key player in 
the digital entertainment market. 62  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Remuneration report continued
• 
This year we have added 14 supermarkets, 87 convenience stores 
and eight extensions to our property portfolio – a total of just over 
one million sq ft, in line with our target of around five per cent gross 
space growth. Some of this additional space has enabled us to bring 
our increasingly popular clothing and general merchandise ranges to 
more customers. It has also enabled us to expand our coverage of the 
UK to areas where our presence was previously limited – only around 
22 per cent of the UK population do not live within a 15 minute drive of 
a Sainsbury’s store. 
• 
In the last five years, we have added £4 billion to the value of our 
property portfolio, the market value of which is now £11.5 billion. 
Activity during the year delivered profits of £66 million and over  
five years property profits have totalled £341 million.
• 
We have a responsibility to protect our environment for future 
generations, help sustain the communities in which we operate and 
help our customers to Live Well For Less. We are continuing to work 
towards our 20x20 Sustainability Plan comprising 20 ambitious 
goals we aim to achieve by the year 2020. During the year we ran 
our second Million Meals Appeal, launched our Active Kids for All 
Paralympics legacy plan and donated a record-breaking £41.5 million 
to good causes in the year such as Comic Relief, the Royal British 
Legion Poppy Appeal and our nationwide Local Charity Partnership 
programme. We were also awarded a number of environmental 
accolades this year, including the top award of Sustainable Business 
of the Year at the Energy and Environmental Awards. This was in 
recognition of our industry-leading work on carbon and energy 
reduction, focus on recycling and water innovation.
Long-term incentives
2013/14 policy
The long-term incentive vehicle in use at Sainsbury’s is known as 
Future Builder. This arrangement was introduced in 2012 following 
the amendment to the performance conditions. Performance is now 
assessed against ROCE, cumulative cash flow from operations and 
relative sales measured against the IGD Index, with an earnings per 
share gateway. Awards are made under the shareholder approved  
2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
Around 200 senior managers participate in this arrangement. Under 
Future Builder, a core award of shares is granted, calculated as a 
percentage of salary and scaled according to grade. The Chief Executive 
receives a core award of 55 per cent of salary and the other Executive 
Directors a core award of 50 per cent of salary. Vesting of core awards is 
dependent upon performance against specific measures (common for all 
participants) tested at the end of a three-year performance period. The 
core award can grow by up to four times at stretch levels of performance. 
The overall maximum award permitted by the rules of the plan is 250 per 
cent of salary including the performance multiplier. 
Half of any vested shares are released at the end of the performance 
period, while the remaining half are released after a further year. 
Dividends accrue on the shares that vest, in the form of additional shares. 
The performance measures are reviewed each year by the Committee, 
before a new grant is made, to ensure that they remain relevant and 
stretching. The performance conditions applying to the 2013 grant are 
the same as those used in 2012.
 
The Committee believes it is important that the performance conditions 
in the long-term incentive arrangement support the corporate 
ambitions of the Company during the next phase of development. 
We operate in a dynamic market with evolving challenges and the 
Committee monitors this over time. ROCE, cash flow and relative sales 
complement the Company’s future strategy, as outlined in the Business 
review which will be achieved by delivering long-term sustainable 
performance in three key areas:
• 
Improving the returns from our existing supermarkets business (both 
food and non-food);
• 
Driving growth through value-adding new stores and extensions; and 
• 
Creating new business growth through investing further in our 
existing convenience and online channels, building our presence 
in financial services and pursuing new opportunities, for example 
Energy and Pharmacy.
The Committee retains the discretion to make adjustments to the 
calculation of the performance measures (for instance for material 
acquisitions and disposals and one-off events not foreseen at the time 
the targets were set) to ensure they remain true and fair reflections of 
performance.
Element Performance metrics
ROCE
• 
ROCE reflects the return generated for shareholders, and as such is a critical measure of the quality of our business 
activity and the efficiency of capital use. 
• 
For the purposes of Future Builder, ROCE is based on the underlying operating profit for the business, including the 
underlying share of post-tax profit from joint ventures. The capital employed figure excludes the impact of movements in 
the IAS 19 pension deficit.
Cumulative 
underlying 
cash flow from 
operations
• 
Cumulative underlying cash flow from operations measures the total flow of cash in and out of the business as well as 
providing an assessment of underlying profitability. 
• 
For Future Builder, the cumulative underlying cash flow is based on the reported cash flow generated from operations over 
the performance period after adding back net rent and cash pension costs.
Relative sales
• 
This is an important metric used across the retail sector. Outperforming our direct peers on sales will be a key source of 
value for our shareholders and like-for-like sales are the biggest driver for profitability and returns. 
• 
Our relative sales performance is measured using the IGD Index. The IGD Index measures growth in like-for-like sales 
(excluding fuel) across the market based on the performance of all of the Company’s key competitors. This is an 
independently audited index of sales efficiency, which is viewed as a robust reference point for performance across the 
food retail sector. 63 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

2013 Future Builder (2nd cycle)
The performance measures and targets for the 2013 Future Builder 
grant are summarised in the table below. Straight-line vesting will 
operate between the threshold and maximum targets. The Committee 
2013 vesting
Until 2012, long-term incentive awards were known as Value Builder 
awards. The structure of the plan is the same as Future Builder but 
different performance conditions applied. The fifth cycle of Value 
Builder made in 2010 is due to vest in May 2013, based on performance 
over 2010/11 to 2012/13. The Committee determined performance 
over the period should deliver a vesting multiplier of 1.75 times, based 
on adjusted ROCE of 13.5 per cent and cash flow per share (‘CFPS’) 
of 8.2 per cent. This represents 44 per cent of the maximum award 
opportunity, which the Committee believes is a true and fair reflection 
of performance. When assessing ROCE and CFPS performance for 
the purposes of the plan, adjustments were made to take into account 
additional investments, returns and one-off events not envisaged at the 
time the targets were set. One half of the award becomes exercisable in 
May 2013, with the remaining portion exercisable in May 2014.
For information, the previous levels of vesting have been: 2012 vesting 
– 1.7 times, 2011 vesting – 1.9 times, 2010 vesting – 3.2 times and 2009 
vesting – 3.7 times.
Performance conditions attached to outstanding long-term 
incentive awards
The table below sets out the performance conditions attached to all 
outstanding awards; the definitions for ROCE and CFPS previously used 
can be found in the remuneration report for the relevant year of grant. 
The structure of Value Builder and Future Builder awards are the same 
and both are granted under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

All-employee share plans 
In line with our 2020 target of increasing the number of colleagues with 
shares in the Company by 25 per cent, the Company provides two all-
employee share plans for colleagues, namely the Savings-Related Share 
Option Plan (‘SAYE’) and the All-Employee Share Ownership Plan, of 
which the Sainsbury’s Share Purchase Plan is a part. Executive Directors 
may participate in these plans in the same way as all other colleagues. 
Justin King and John Rogers currently participate in both plans. Mike 
Coupe participates in the SAYE. As these are all-employee plans there 
are no performance conditions. The Committee approves the adoption 
or amendment of these plans and awards to Executive Directors. 
The 2007 (five-year) SAYE reached maturity on 1 March 2013. Around 
3,200 colleagues could use their savings and a tax-free bonus to buy 
Sainsbury’s shares at a £3.31 option price. The 2009 (three-year)  
SAYE matured at the same time covering around 7,800 colleagues  
who could use their savings and a tax-free bonus to buy Sainsbury’s 
shares at a £2.73 option price. Using the market price on the date of 
the first exercise, the value of all the shares subject to the maturity 
was nearly £23.5 million. The Company currently has over 30,000 
colleagues participating in the SAYE with around 59,000 individual 
savings contracts.

Claw-back
In 2012 the Remuneration Committee introduced claw-back (malus) 
in order to strengthen the Company’s formal governance in line with 
our existing philosophy, and in recognition of shareholders’ current 
concerns around executive remuneration. This clause is intended to 
apply to all long-term incentive awards made following the introduction 
in 2012.
The circumstances in which the clause may be invoked have been 
defined as follows: 
Financial accounts
• 
Material mis-statement of our 
financial results
Actions/conduct of participant
• 
Serious reputational damage
• 
Serious misconduct
• 
Fraud
Should the Committee consider such events to have occurred, it will 
have discretion to: 
• 
Reduce the number of shares under an unvested award; 
• 
Cancel an unvested award in full; or 
• 
Impose further conditions on an unvested award. 
considers that the stretch of the targets set for 2013 awards is 
comparable to awards granted in previous years, and that the delivery 
of stretch targets would result in significant shareholder value creation. 64  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Dilution 
The Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the 
Company’s share plans and the means of satisfying such awards 
remains within best practice guidelines so that dilution from employee 
share awards does not exceed ten per cent of the Company’s issued 
share capital for all-employee share plans and five per cent in respect 
of executive share plans in any ten-year rolling period. The Company 
monitors dilution levels on a regular basis and the Committee reviews 
these at least once a year. Up to 16 March 2013, an estimated 7.9 per 
cent of the Company’s issued share capital has been allocated for 
the purposes of its all-employee share plans over a ten-year period, 
including an estimated 3.7 per cent over ten years in respect of its 
executive share plans. 
Performance graph 
The graph below shows the TSR performance of an investment of £100 
in J Sainsbury plc shares over the last five years compared with an 
equivalent investment in the FTSE 100 Index. This has been selected to 
provide an established and broad-based index. An additional graph is 
included which shows J Sainsbury plc’s daily TSR since March 2012;  
over the last year our TSR has exceeded the FTSE 100. 
Service contracts 
Justin King has a service contract which can be terminated by either 
party by giving 12 months’ written notice. If his service contract is 
terminated without cause, the Company can request that he works his 
notice period or takes a period of garden leave, or can pay an amount in 
lieu of notice equal to one times basic salary for the notice period plus 
75 per cent of basic salary in lieu of all other elements of remuneration, 
except share plans. If he is dismissed within six months of a change 
of control, the above sum will become payable. The contract contains 
restrictive covenants, which continue for 12 months after termination. 
If the service contract of Mike Coupe is terminated without cause, the 
maximum payment he would receive would be equal to one times basic 
salary for the 12-month notice period plus 50 per cent of basic salary 
in lieu of all other elements of remuneration, except share plans. He 
is required to mitigate his losses and would receive phased payments, 
which would be reduced or terminated if he secured alternative 
employment during the notice period. His contract also contains 
restrictive covenants, which continue for 12 months after termination.  
It does not contain any specific provisions relating to change of control. 
In 2010, the Committee agreed that within future Executive Directors’ 
service agreements the notice period would be 12 months and that 
the termination provisions would state that any severance payments 
would be limited to one year’s salary and benefits, be made on a phased 
basis and be subject to mitigation. As is the current practice, if “good 
leaver” status is given, long-term incentive awards that vest following a 
Director’s employment termination will continue to be pro-rated for time 
and performance. Bonus awards will also be paid subject to time and 
performance for the financial year in which office is held if the individual 
is considered to be a “good leaver”. The service contract under which 
John Rogers was appointed as Chief Financial Officer follows these 
provisions in full; in addition, there are no specific terms relating to 
change of control.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts became effective on the 
following dates: 
Justin King  29 March 2004 
Mike Coupe  1 August 2007
John Rogers 19 July 2010  
  
External appointments 
The Company’s normal practice is that Executive Directors may take up 
one public company non-executive role outside the Company, subject 
to a consideration of the role and the time commitment. Directors are 
entitled to retain the fees earned from such appointments. Details of the 
Executive Directors’ external fees are set out on page 66. 
Shareholding guidelines 
The Committee introduced shareholding guidelines in 2006/07, updated 
in 2010/11, to create greater alignment of the Directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders, which is a key objective within the remuneration 
policy. The guidelines require Directors to build up a specified level  
of shareholding within five years of appointment. The guidelines are  
as follows: Chief Executive 2.5 times salary; Executive Directors 1.5 
times salary and Operating Board Directors 1.0 times salary. 65 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Remuneration report continued
Chairman 
The Chairman does not have a service contract; his letter of 
appointment became effective on 1 October 2009 and he became 
Chairman on 1 November 2009. He was appointed for an initial term of 
three years, renewable on a 12-month rolling basis and thereafter by 
mutual consent. His appointment may be terminated at any time upon 
the serving of six months’ written notice by either party. 
David Tyler receives a basic fee of £470,000 per annum. His fees were 
reviewed during 2012/13 but no adjustment was made. He devotes such 
time as is necessary to perform his duties. He does not participate 
in any performance-related incentive plans and the only benefits he 
receives are private medical cover, an annual medical assessment and a 
colleague discount card. 
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts. They are 
appointed for an initial three-year period, which may be extended for 
a further term by mutual consent. The initial appointments and any 
subsequent re-appointments are subject to annual election or re-
election by shareholders. Their appointments may be terminated by  
the serving of three months’ notice by either party. 
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic annual cash fee; additional fees are 
paid to the Senior Independent Director and to the Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committees. Non-Executive 
Directors do not participate in any performance-related incentive plans 
and receive no benefits other than a colleague discount card. 
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees were reviewed during the year but no 
changes were made. The fee levels are as follows: 
Basic fee    £60,000 
Senior Independent Director fee £15,000 
Chairman of Remuneration Committee fee  £15,000 
Chairman of Audit Committee fee £15,000

1 The maximum share award assumes full vesting.
2  The performance conditions attaching to the awards made between 2008 and 2011 are return on capital employed and growth in cash flow per share. The performance conditions relating to the 
award made in 2012 are a combination of return on capital employed, cumulative underlying cash flow from operations and relative sales performance. Further information is provided on pages 118 
to 119. The performance of the award made in June 2009 was tested in May 2012 and a multiplier of 1.7 was achieved. The number of shares between the maximum multiplier (4.0) and the multiplier 
achieved have lapsed. Half of the achieved award vested in May 2012 whilst the remainder of the achieved award will vest in May 2013. The number of dividend shares which have been received on 
vested shares was determined by a five-day average share price from 10 to 16 May 2012. 
3  The second half of the award which vested in May 2011 was released in May 2012. The number of dividend shares which have been received on vested shares was determined by a five-day average 
share price from 10 to 16 May 2012.

remainder of the achieved award was released in May 2012. The number of dividend shares on the second vesting was determined by a five-day average share price from 10-16 May 2012.
– The 2009 deferral was made on a net post-tax basis and it was released on 23 March 2012. The matching shares lapsed as the performance conditions were not met.
– The exercise price is nil.

Notes:
–  The Executive Directors are potential beneficiaries of the Company’s employee benefit trust, which is used to satisfy awards under the Company’s employee share plans, and they are therefore 
treated as interested in the 5.3 million shares (2012: 5.9 million) held by the Trustees.

Principal activities and Business review
The Company’s and its subsidiaries’ principal activities are grocery and 
related retailing. 
Pages 1 to 70 inclusive (together with the sections of the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements incorporated by reference) comprise the 
Directors’ report, that has been drawn up and presented in accordance 
with and in reliance upon applicable English company law and the 
liabilities of the directors in connection with that report shall be subject 
to the limitations and restrictions provided by such law.
The Business review sets out a comprehensive review of the 
development and performance of the business for the 52 weeks ended 
16 March 2013 and future developments. The Business review is set 
out on pages 1 to 33 of this report. All the information detailed in these 
pages forms part of the Directors’ report.
The corporate governance statement as required by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules 7.2.1 is set out on pages 38 to 53 and forms part of 
the Directors’ report.
Dividends
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 11.9 pence 
per share (2012: 11.6 pence), making a total dividend for the year of 16.7 
pence per share (2012: 16.1 pence), an increase of 3.7 per cent over the 
previous year. Subject to shareholders approving this recommendation 
at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), the dividend will be paid on  
12 July 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
17 May 2013.
Changes to the Board 
On 11 July 2012, Bob Stack stood down from his position as a Non-
Executive Director. Mary Harris, who has been a Non-Executive 
Director of Sainsbury’s since 2007, succeeded Bob as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. John McAdam joined the Remuneration 
Committee as the third independent Non-Executive Director on the 
Committee. 
Anna Ford stood down from her position as a Non-Executive Director on 
31 December 2012.
On 1 January 2013, Jean Tomlin, the former HR Director for The London 
Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, joined 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director. Jean became Chairman of 
the Corporate Responsibility Committee and a member of both the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
On 8 May 2013, we announced the appointment of Susan Rice as a 
Non-Executive Director from 1 June 2013. Susan is currently Managing 
Director, Lloyds Banking Group Scotland and has extensive retail 
banking experience, both in the UK and internationally. Susan will join 
the Audit and Nomination Committees.
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Jean Tomlin, who was 
appointed to the Board since the last AGM, will seek election at the AGM.
Susan Rice will join the Board on 1 June 2013 and will also stand for 
election at the AGM. Her biographical details are set out in the Notice  
of Meeting accompanying this report. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code provides for all directors of FTSE 
companies to stand for election or re-election by shareholders every 
year. Accordingly, all other members of the Board will retire and seek  
re-election at this year’s AGM. Full biographical details of all of the 
current Directors are set out on page 35. 
 
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held on Wednesday, 10 July 2013 at The Queen 
Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London 
SW1P 3EE at 11.00am. The Chairman’s letter and the Notice of Meeting 
accompany this report, together with notes explaining the business to 
be transacted at the meeting.
At the meeting, resolutions will be proposed to declare a final dividend, 
to receive the Annual Report and Financial Statements and approve the 
Remuneration Report, to re-elect all of the Directors, and to re-appoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors. In addition, shareholders 
will be asked to renew both the general authority of the Directors to 
issue shares and to authorise the Directors to issue shares without 
applying the statutory pre-emption rights. In this regard, the Company 
will continue to adhere to the provisions in the Pre-emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles.
Shareholders will be asked to authorise the Company to make market 
purchases of its own shares. Shareholders will also be asked to 
authorise the Directors to hold general meetings at 14 clear days’ notice 
(where this flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is 
thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole). A resolution 
to renew the authority to make ‘political donations’ as defined by Part 14 
of 2006 Companies Act, will also be proposed.
Share capital and control
The following information is given pursuant to Section 992 of the 2006 
Companies Act.
Except as described below in relation to the Company’s employee share 
schemes, there are no restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in the Company; 
no person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights 
with regard to control of the Company; and the Company is not aware 
of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions in the transfer of securities or voting rights. Further details 
of the rights, restrictions and obligations attaching to the share capital 
of the Company, including voting rights, are contained in the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The Articles of Association may only be changed 
with the agreement of shareholders. 
Shares acquired through the Company’s employee share plans rank  
pari passu with shares in issue and have no special rights. Where,  
under the Company’s All Employee Share Ownership Plan, participants are 
beneficial owners of the shares but the Trustee is the registered owner, 
the voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the 
direction of the participants. The J Sainsbury Employee Benefit Trusts 
waive their right to vote and to dividends on the shares they hold which 
are unallocated. Some of the Company’s employee share plans include 
restrictions on transfer of shares while the shares are held within the plan.
At the AGM held in July 2012, the Company was authorised by 
shareholders to purchase its own shares, within certain limits and 
as permitted by the Articles of Association. The Company made 
no purchases of its own shares during the year and no shares were 
acquired by forfeiture or surrender or made subject to a lien or charge.
All of the Company’s employee share plans contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. On a change of control, options and awards 
granted to employees under the Company’s share plans may vest 
and become exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of any applicable 
performance conditions at that time. 
Certain of the Company’s credit facilities and banking arrangements 
contain change of control clauses under which lenders may cancel their 
commitments and declare all outstanding amounts immediately due and 
payable. There are no other significant agreements that would take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control following a takeover bid.

of the Company are shown in the Remuneration Report on page 68.  
The Company’s Register of Directors’ Interests contains full details  
of Directors’ interests, shareholdings and options over ordinary shares 
of the Company.
During the year, no Director had any material interest in any contract  
of significance to the Group’s business.
Directors’ indemnities
The Directors are entitled to be indemnified by the Company to the 
extent permitted by law and the Company’s Articles of Association in 
respect of all losses arising out of or in connection with the execution 
of their powers, duties and responsibilities. The Company has executed 
deeds of indemnity for the benefit of each Director in respect of 
liabilities which may attach to them in their capacity as Directors of 
the Company. The Company purchased and maintained Directors’ 
and Officers’ liability insurance throughout 2012/13, which has been 
renewed for 2013/14. Neither the indemnities nor the insurance provide 
cover in the event that the Director is proved to have acted fraudulently.
Market value of properties 
The Directors believe that the aggregate open market value of Group 
properties exceeds the net book value as set out in note 11 on pages 91 
to 92 to the financial statements. 
Employment policies
Our diversity policies and priorities are set out on page 40.
The Company’s quarterly trading statements, interim and annual  
results are presented to all senior management and are communicated 
to all colleagues. Colleagues have always been encouraged to hold 
shares in the Company. One of our 20x20 commitments is to increase 
the number of colleagues with shares in our business by 25 per cent  
by 2020.
Donations
Sainsbury’s is committed to making a positive difference to the 
communities in which we operate. We support many charitable 
organisations and community projects through either donating cash, 
making in-kind donations or through colleague volunteering.
During the year, Sainsbury’s colleagues, customers and suppliers 
raised £41.5 million (2012: £25.4 million) for charities through events 
supported by the Company, including Comic Relief and Active Kids.  
Cash and in-kind donations totalled £5.1 million (2012: £4.2 million). 
The Company made no political donations in 2013 (2012: £nil).
Essential contracts
Sainsbury’s has contractual and other arrangements with numerous 
third parties in support of its business activities. None of the 
arrangements is individually considered to be essential to the business 
of Sainsbury’s. 
Policy on payment of creditors
The policy of the Company and its principal operating companies is 
to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier 
and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory 
invoices. The Company is a holding company and therefore has no trade 
creditors. Statements on the operating companies’ payment of suppliers 
are contained in their financial statements. 
Post balance sheet events
Events after the balance sheet are disclosed in note 37 on page 123  
of the financial statements.
Financial risk management
The financial risk management and policies of the Group are disclosed  
in note 28 on pages 104 to 110 to the financial statements.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Business review on pages 1 to 33. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows and liquidity are highlighted in the Financial review 
on pages 26 to 33. The Group manages its financing by diversifying 
funding sources, maintaining core borrowings with long-term maturities 
and sufficient standby liquidity. Full details of the Group’s financing 
arrangements can be found in note 20 on pages 97 and 98 to the 
financial statements. In addition, notes 28 and 29 on pages 104 to 113 
to the financial statements include the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The debt refinancing in March 2006 removed the Group’s reliance on 
unsecured credit markets for medium and long-term finance and the 
Group’s first significant re-financing exposure is not until July 2014. 
Management are satisfied that stress tests on the future liquidity of the 
Group do not indicate a going concern risk.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully despite the current challenging 
economic outlook. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company has sufficient resources to continue in operation for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements which are shown  
on pages 73 to 123.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the Directors has confirmed that, so far as he/she is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware. 
Each Director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that 
information. 
Independent auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have expressed their willingness to be 
reappointed as auditors of the Company. Upon the recommendation  
of the Audit Committee, resolutions to reappoint them as auditors  
and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will  
be proposed at the AGM.

Governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• 
state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Remuneration report 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 35 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• 
the Group and Company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Group and Company; and
• 
the Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Company, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 72  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Financial statements
Independent Auditors’ report to the members  
of J Sainsbury plc  
We have audited the financial statements of J Sainsbury plc for the 
52 weeks ended 16 March 2013 which comprise the Group income 
statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group 
and Company Balance sheets, the Group and Company Cash flow 
statements, the Group and Company statements of changes in equity 
and related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and, 
as regards the Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 71, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report and Financial Statements to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
• 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 16 March 2013 and of the 
Group’s profit and Group’s and Company’s cash flows for the 52 weeks 
then ended;
• 
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• 
the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;

Notes to the financial statements
1 General information
J Sainsbury plc is a public limited company (the ‘Company’) 
incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly traded 
on the London Stock Exchange. The Company is domiciled in the United 
Kingdom and its registered address is 33 Holborn, London EC1N 2HT, 
United Kingdom.
The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 16 March 2013 (prior 
financial year 52 weeks to 17 March 2012). The consolidated financial 
statements for the 52 weeks to 16 March 2013 comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) and the 
Group’s share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures.
The Group’s principal activities are grocery and related retailing.
 
2 Accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the European Union and International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRICs’) interpretations and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRSs. The Company’s financial statements have been 
prepared on the same basis and, as permitted by Section 408(3) 
of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement or statement of 
comprehensive income is presented for the Company.
(b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the 
nearest million (‘£m’) unless otherwise stated. They have been  
prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, 
except for derivative financial instruments, investment properties and 
available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs 
requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed 
in note 2c.
Amendments to published standards
Effective for the Group in these financial statements:
• 
Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of IFRS’, Severe 
hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates for first-time adopters
• 
Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’, 
Disclosures on transfers of financial assets
The Group has considered the above amendments to published 
standards that are effective and concluded that they are either not 
relevant to the Group or that they do not have a significant impact on 
the Group’s financial statements, apart from additional disclosures. 
Effective for the Group for the financial year beginning 17 March 2013:
• 
Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’, 
Presentation of items of other comprehensive income
• 
Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, Deferred tax accounting for 
investment properties
• 
IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee benefits’ *
• 
Amendment to IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption’, Government loans
• 
Amendment to IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ on assets 
and liabilities offsetting *
• 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ *
• 
Annual Improvements 2011 *
* These standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the EU.
In June 2011, the IASB issued IAS 19, Employee Benefits (revised 2011; 
IAS 19R). The most significant change that will impact the Group is that 
the amendment requires the expected returns on pension plan assets, 
currently calculated based on management’s best estimate of expected 
returns, to be calculated at the liability discount rate. The removal of the 
reserve for scheme expenses from within the defined benefit obligation 
and service cost will also have an impact on both the Group’s net assets 
and income statement. 
 
The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013 and the Group will therefore adopt the revised standard 
for the year ended 15 March 2014. IAS 19R requires retrospective 
application in line with IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors’. The Group estimates that adoption 
of IAS 19R would have increased underlying profit by £2 million and 
resulted in an additional charge of £18 million outside of underlying 
profit in the year ended 16 March 2013. The revised standard would have 
increased net assets before deferred tax by approximately £135 million 
at 16 March 2013.
The Group has considered the remaining above amendments to 
published standards and new standards that are not yet effective and 
concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or that they 
would not have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements, 
apart from additional disclosures. 
The following standards and revisions will be effective for  
future periods:
• 
IAS 27 (revised) 2011 ‘Separate financial statements’ *
• 
IAS 28 (revised) 2011 ‘Associates and joint ventures’ *
• 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ – classification of financial assets and 
financial liabilities ^
• 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ *
• 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ *
• 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ *
• 
Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ on 
offsetting financial assets and liabilities *
• 
Amendment to IFRS 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance *
* These standards are effective for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2014.
^ This standard is effective for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2015.
The Group has considered the impact of the above standards and 
revisions and has concluded that they will not have a significant impact 
on the Group’s financial statements, apart from additional disclosures.
The accounting policies set out below and in note 3 have been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements by the 
Group and the Company.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The results 
of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date 
of acquisition or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of 
disposal. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group  80  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
2 Accounting policies continued
companies are eliminated upon consolidation. Accounting policies of 
subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss 
in the financial statements of the Company. 
Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business 
combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of 
a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities 
incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition 
date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, 
the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition 
date through profit or loss.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities in which the Group has an 
interest. The Group’s share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures 
are included in the income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. Where the Group transacts with a joint venture, profits and 
losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint 
venture. 
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Group balance sheet at 
cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of 
the entity, less any provision for impairment. 
Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Company balance sheet 
at cost less any provision for impairment. 
Sainsbury’s Bank’s fees and commissions, that are not integral to 
the effective interest rate calculation, are recognised in the income 
statement as services are provided. Where in the case of insurance 
commissions the income comprises an initial commission and profit 
share both are recognised on completion of the service to the extent 
reliably measurable. Where there is a risk of potential claw-back, an 
appropriate element of the commission receivable is deferred and 
amortised over the life of the underlying loan or period of claw-back.
Investment properties held by the Group are those contained within 
its joint ventures with Land Securities Group PLC and The British Land 
Company PLC. These are properties held for capital appreciation and/
or to earn rental income. They are initially measured at cost, including 
related transaction costs. After initial recognition at cost, they are 
carried at their fair values based on market value determined by 
professional valuers at each reporting date. The difference between 
the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its 
carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included within the income 
statement but is excluded from underlying profit in order to provide a 
clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the 
Group’s ongoing business for shareholders. 
Revenue
Revenue consists of sales through retail outlets and excludes Value 
Added Tax. Sales through retail outlets are shown net of returns, the 
cost of Nectar reward points issued and redeemed, colleague discounts, 
vouchers and sales made on an agency basis. Commission income is 
recognised in revenue based on the terms of the contract.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and 
services have been passed to the buyer and it can be measured reliably.
The cost of Nectar points is treated as a deduction from sales and 
part of the fair value of the consideration received is deferred and 
subsequently recognised over the period that the awards are redeemed. 
The fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the 
fair value to the customer.
Finance income and costs
Finance income and costs are recognised in the income statement for 
financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. This calculation takes into account interest 
receivable or payable and fees and commissions received or paid that 
are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs. 
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of all costs to the point of sale including 
warehouse and transportation costs and all the costs of operating retail 
outlets.
Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are recognised within cost 
of sales as they are earned. The accrued value at the reporting date is 
included in prepayments and accrued income.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings
Land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any recognised provision for impairment. Properties in the course 
of construction are held at cost less any recognised provision for 
impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and 
the costs incurred attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.
Fixtures and equipment
Fixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to 
bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their 
residual values, on a straight-line method, on the following bases:
• 
Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease 
term if shorter
• 
Fixtures, equipment and vehicles – 3 to 15 years
• 
Freehold land is not depreciated
Buildings under construction are not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds 
with the asset’s carrying amount and are recognised within operating 
profit. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Intangible assets
Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
any provision for impairment. Externally acquired computer software 
and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful economic lives of five to seven years. Costs 
relating to development of computer software for internal use are 
capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ 
are met. Other development expenditures that do not meet these 
criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. When the software is 
available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful economic lives of five to seven years within 
administrative expenses.  81 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration 
of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net 
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset on the Group’s balance sheet in the 
year in which it arises, and is considered to have an indefinite useful 
life. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and again whenever 
indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any 
provision for impairment.
Other
Pharmacy licences are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any recognised provision for impairment and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the licence period of up to 15 years within  
cost of sales.
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any provision for impairment. They are amortised  
on a straight-line basis over their contractual useful economic lives 
within cost of sales.
Impairment of non-financial assets 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of 
its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and 
its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) to which the asset belongs. 
For property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding 
goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store. For goodwill,  
the CGU is deemed to be each retail chain of stores acquired.
Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in 
the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss, other than an 
impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in 
the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, or its original carrying 
value less accumulated depreciation if lower. 
Capitalisation of interest
Interest costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, 
gross of tax relief.
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets are classified as assets held for sale and stated 
at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell 
if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets  
held for sale are not depreciated.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease 
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. For property 
leases, the land and building elements are treated separately to 
determine the appropriate lease classification.
Finance leases
Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as property, 
plant and equipment and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The amount capitalised is the 
lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum 
lease payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. 
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance 
charges. Finance costs on finance leases are charged directly to the 
income statement.
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance 
sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement  
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Sale and leaseback
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an 
asset and immediately reacquires the use of that asset by entering 
into a lease with the buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and 
leaseback depends upon the substance of the transaction and whether 
or not the sale was made at the asset’s fair value. 
For sale and finance leasebacks, any apparent profit or loss from 
the sale is deferred and amortised over the lease term. For sale and 
operating leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and 
accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised immediately  
in the income statement.
Following initial recognition, the lease treatment is consistent with those 
principles described above.
Lease incentives
Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free 
periods. Lease incentives are capitalised and spread over the period of 
the lease term.
Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases
The Group has a number of leases with predetermined fixed rental 
increases. These rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Operating lease income
Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements 
and is recognised as earned.
Inventories
Inventories comprise of goods held for resale and properties held for, 
or in the course of, development and are valued on a weighted average 
cost basis and carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution. Cost includes all direct expenditure and other appropriate 
attributable costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present 
location and condition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank, 
investments in money market funds and deposits and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of 
the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement. 82  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Current taxation
Current tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax is charged 
or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items 
charged to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the 
current tax is also dealt with in equity or other comprehensive income 
respectively. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences 
arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base of 
assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the 
extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. 
It is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where 
the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation, and 
where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions 
are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to 
be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage 
of time is recognised as interest expense. 
Onerous leases
Provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected rental income, 
are recognised when the property leased becomes vacant and is no 
longer used in the operations of the business. Provisions for dilapidation 
costs are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis.
Employee benefits
Pensions
The Group operates various defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension schemes for its employees. A defined benefit scheme is a pension 
plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will 
receive on retirement. A defined contribution scheme is a pension plan 
under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the pension scheme 
surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the 
difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The defined 
benefit obligation is actuarially calculated on an annual basis using the 
projected unit credit method. Plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The income statement charge is split between an operating service 
cost and a financing charge, which is the net of interest cost on pension 
scheme liabilities and expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise, in 
other comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet 
date are included as an accrual as at that date. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
Long service awards
The costs of long service awards are accrued over the period the service 
is provided by the employee when it is probable that settlement will be 
required and they are capable of being measured reliably. Liabilities 
recognised in respect of long-term employee benefits are measured at 
the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the 
Group in respect of services provided by employees up to reporting date.
Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of 
the Group in the form of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange 
for shares, rights over shares or the value of those shares in cash terms.
For equity-settled share-based payments the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-
market vesting conditions. All share options are valued using an option-
pricing model (Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo). This fair value is charged 
to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based 
payment scheme. 
For cash-settled share-based payments the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the 
charge recognised through the income statement over the vesting 
period of the share-based payment scheme, with the corresponding 
increase in accruals. 
The value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the 
remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of 
options vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and 
accruals.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to 
the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as 
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, 
measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown  
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 83 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

Foreign currencies
Foreign operations
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are 
translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates. The results  
of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates  
of exchange for the year. The functional currency of the Company  
is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet  
date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the 
income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: 
at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’), loans and receivables, 
and available-for-sale (‘AFS’). AFS investments are initially measured 
at fair value including transaction costs. Financial assets held at fair 
value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value and 
transaction costs are expensed.
Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets held for trading 
and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. 
Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they are accounted 
for as an effective hedging instrument. Financial assets at FVTPL are 
recorded at fair value, with any fair value gains or losses recognised  
in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
The Group has no intention of trading these loans and receivables. 
Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, 
these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using  
the effective interest method. Income from these financial assets  
is calculated on an effective yield basis and is recognised in the  
income statement.
AFS financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in 
this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are 
included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of 
the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Subsequent 
to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets 
are recorded at fair value with the movements in fair value recognised 
in other comprehensive income until the financial asset is derecognised 
or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income 
statement. Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in 
the income statement when the entity’s right to receive payment is 
established. Interest on AFS debt instruments is recognised using the 
effective interest method.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash 
flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Group has 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision  
for impairment.
Financial liabilities
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at 
fair value, which is generally the proceeds received, net of direct issue 
costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accrual basis 
in the income statement using the effective interest method and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is 
determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-
convertible bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised 
cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds. 
The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the conversion option. 
This is recognised and included in shareholders’ equity, net of income 
tax effects and is not subsequently re-measured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and the equity 
components of the convertible bonds based on their carrying amounts 
at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is 
charged directly against equity.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Impairment of financial assets
An assessment of whether there is objective evidence of impairment 
is carried out for all financial assets or groups of financial assets 
at the balance sheet date. This assessment may be of individual 
assets (‘individual impairment’) or of a portfolio of assets (‘collective 
impairment’). A financial asset or a group of financial assets is 
considered to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or 
events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial 
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. 
For individual impairment the principal loss event is one or more missed 
payments, although other loss events can also be taken into account, 
including arrangements in place to pay less than the contractual 
payments, fraud and bankruptcy or other financial difficulty indicators. 
An assessment of collective impairment will be made of financial 
assets with similar risk characteristics. For these assets, portfolio loss 
experience is used to provide objective evidence of impairment.
Where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists on 
loans and receivables, impairment provisions are made to reduce the 
carrying value of financial assets to the present value of estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the charge to the income 
statement reflects the movement in the level of provisions made, 
together with amounts written off net of recoveries in the year.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a 
significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the asset below 
its cost is considered in determining whether the asset is impaired. 
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the 
cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income 
statement. The cumulative loss is measured as the difference between 
the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss 
on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement. 84  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
2 Accounting policies continued
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity 
instruments are not reversed. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value 
of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and 
the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after 
the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the 
impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Interest will continue to accrue on all financial assets, based on the 
written down balance. Interest is calculated using the rate of interest 
used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring 
the impairment loss. To the extent that a provision may be increased 
or decreased in subsequent periods, the recognition of interest will be 
based on the latest balance net of provision.
Fair value estimation
The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values  
of financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in note 29. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value 
on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent 
reporting dates.
Hedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the 
derivative financial instruments hedge the exchange rate risk of future 
highly probable inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow 
hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the 
asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the 
derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive 
income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
Hedge relationships are classified as fair value hedges where the 
derivative financial instruments hedge the change in the fair value of 
a financial asset or liability due to movements in interest rates. The 
changes in fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in the 
income statement.
The hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to 
the hedged risk, with the corresponding adjustment made in the income 
statement.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents at the inception 
of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction 
and the nature of the risks being hedged. The Group also documents the 
assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship, to show 
that the hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement  
as finance income or costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained in 
equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement 
for the period.
 
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in 
the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the 
recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or 
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(c) Judgements and estimates
The Group makes judgements and assumptions concerning the future 
that impact the application of policies and reported amounts. The 
resulting accounting estimates calculated using these judgements and 
assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results 
but are based on historical experience and expectations of future 
events. 
The judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements 
are discussed below. 
Depreciation and amortisation
Judgement is used in assessing useful lives and residual values of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The assets are 
depreciated or amortised over their estimated useful lives to their 
residual values. 
Goodwill impairment
The Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered  
any impairment loss, based on the recoverable amount of its cash-
generating units (‘CGUs’). The recoverable amounts of the CGUs 
have been determined based on value in use calculations and these 
calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows 
and suitable discount rates as disclosed in note 12. Actual outcomes 
could vary from these estimates. 
Impairment of assets
Financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews 
based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest 
that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value. 
Recoverable amount is based on the higher of the value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated from expected future 
cash flows using suitable discount rates and includes management 
assumptions and estimates of future performance as disclosed in note 11. 
Post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme for its employees. The 
present value of the scheme’s liabilities recognised at the balance sheet 
date is dependent on interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. The 
net financing charge recognised in the income statement is dependent 
on the interest rate of high quality corporate bonds and an expectation 
of the weighted average returns on the assets within the scheme. Other 
key assumptions within this calculation are based on market conditions 
or estimates of future events, including mortality rates, as set out in 
note 30. Any changes to assumptions used will impact the carrying 
value of the retirement benefit obligation. Sensitivity of the retirement 
benefit obligation to changes in certain assumptions is provided in  
note 30. 
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations and long 
service awards. These provisions are estimates and the actual costs 
and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any 
difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be 
accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Details of 
provisions are set out in note 22.
Income taxes
The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an estimation 
of the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the 
ultimate tax determination of certain items. Where the actual liability 
arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences 
will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax provisions in the 
period when such determination is made. Detail of the tax charge and 
deferred tax are set out in notes 8 and 21 respectively. 85 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

3 Non-GAAP performance measures
Certain items recognised in reported profit before tax can vary significantly from year to year and therefore create volatility in reported earnings 
which does not reflect the Group’s underlying performance. The Directors believe that the ‘underlying profit before tax’ (‘UPBT’) and ‘underlying 
diluted and basic earnings per share’ measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of Sainsbury’s 
ongoing business for shareholders. Underlying profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the ‘adjusted’ profit 
measures of other companies. The adjusted items are:
• 
Profit/loss on disposal of properties; 
• 
Investment property fair value movements – these reflect the difference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date 
and its carrying amount at the previous reporting date;
• 
Financing fair value movements – these are fair value gains and losses on non-derivative financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, 
on derivatives relating to financing activities and on hedged items in fair value hedges;
• 
Impairment of goodwill;
• 
The financing element of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’; and
• 
One-off items – these are items which are material and infrequent in nature and do not relate to the Group’s underlying performance.
The adjustments made to reported profit before tax to arrive at underlying profit before tax are:

2 Financing fair value movements for the financial year comprised a £7 million loss for the Group (2012: £11 million loss) and a £3 million loss for the joint ventures (2012: £5 million loss).
One-off items
Included within one-off items is £20 million of transaction and transition costs incurred relating to the ongoing purchase of the remaining 50 per 
cent of Sainsbury’s Bank. Other one-off costs of £5 million have been incurred for internal restructuring. A disposal provision for indemnities of  
£16 million has also been released during the year as it is no longer required. This provision was initially recorded within one-off items outside 
underlying profit before tax.
The £3 million one-off item in the prior year relates to the release of a provision in respect of the Office of Fair Trading dairy inquiry which was 
settled in full in October 2011.
4 Segment reporting
The Group’s businesses are organised into three operating segments: 
• 
Retailing (Supermarkets and Convenience);
• 
Financial services (Sainsbury’s Bank joint venture); and
• 
Property investments (The British Land Company PLC joint venture and Land Securities Group PLC joint venture).
Management have determined the operating segments based on the information provided to the Operating Board (the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker for the Group) to make operational decisions on the management of the Group. All material operations and assets are in the UK. The business 
of the Group is not subject to highly seasonal fluctuations although there is an increase in trading in the period leading up to Christmas. 
The Group has continued to include additional voluntary disclosure analysing the Group’s Financial services and Property investment joint ventures 
into separate reportable segments.
Revenue from operating segments is measured on a basis consistent with the income statement. All revenue is generated by the sale of goods and 
services.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one 
period. 
The Operating Board assesses the performance of all segments on the basis of underlying profit before tax. The reconciliation provided overleaf 
reconciles underlying operating profit from each of the segments disclosed to profit before tax. 86  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

On 21 March 2012, the Chancellor announced that the main rate of UK corporation tax would reduce to 23.0 per cent from 1 April 2013. This was 
substantively enacted on 3 July 2012 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included in the 2013 figures above.  89 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

8 Income tax expense continued
In addition to this, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the 5 December 2012 and the 20 March 2013 
UK Budget Statements. The main rate of corporation tax is expected to reduce to 21.0 per cent from 1 April 2014, and to 20.0 per cent from 1 April 
2015. Neither of these expected rate reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, their effect is not included 
in the financial statements.
The effect of a one per cent reduction in the corporation tax rate on the deferred tax balances at the balance sheet date would reduce the deferred 
tax liability by £11 million.
As part of the funding plan agreed with the Pension Scheme’s Trustees, in June 2010 Sainsbury’s established the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish 
Partnership (‘the Partnership’) with the Scheme and properties with a value of £757 million were transferred to the Partnership. Included in the 
Finance Act 2012 were provisions to restrict tax relief on the total amount of payments an employer makes to the pension scheme directly or 
through the Partnership. These changes have been reflected in the figures above.

9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts (note 25), which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the convertible bonds (net of 
tax). The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. These 
represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares 
during the year and the number of shares that would be issued if all convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any profit or loss on disposal of properties, investment property fair value 
movements, impairment of goodwill, financing fair value movements, IAS 19 pension financing element and one-off items that are material and 
infrequent in nature. This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Group’s underlying trading performance.
All operations are continuing for the periods presented.

During the year, the Group acquired 100% of a property holding company from the BL Sainsbury Superstores Limited joint venture for £21 million. 
The business holds only property, plant and equipment and the purchase price represented the fair value of the assets acquired. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, property, plant and equipment is only tested for impairment in the event that a triggering event is 
identified. The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, following a triggering event, each store is a cash-generating unit 
(‘CGU’). 
The recoverable amounts for the CGUs are based on value in use which is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the units using 
the latest budget and forecast data, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. The key assumptions in the value in use calculation are the 
discount rate, growth rates and expected changes in margin. Changes in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations 
of future changes in the market. The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates for the food retail 
sector. The discount rate is based on the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of ten per cent (2012: ten per cent).
Non-store assets are also tested for impairment in the event that a triggering event is identified. When an impairment review is required, the 
carrying value of the asset is compared with its value in use using a methodology consistent with that described above. 92  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

11 Property, plant and equipment continued
Interest capitalised
Interest capitalised included in additions amounted to £32 million (2012: £35 million) for the Group and £nil (2012: £nil) for the Company. 
Accumulated interest capitalised included in the cost of property, plant and equipment net of disposals amounted to £330 million (2012: £302 
million) for the Group and £nil (2012: £nil) for the Company. The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for 
capitalisation is 5.3 per cent (2012: 5.7 per cent).
Security
Property, plant and equipment of 128 (2012: 131) supermarket properties, with a net book value of £2,213 million (2012: £2,288 million) has been 
pledged as security for the long-term financing (note 20).
In addition, property, plant and equipment of a further six supermarket properties, with a net book value of £67 million (2012: £68 million) has been 
pledged as security to underpin the residual value guarantee given by the Group with regards to 16 supermarket properties sold in March 2000 and 
ten supermarket properties sold in July 2000.
On 17 June 2010 property, plant and equipment comprising eight supermarket properties, with a net book value of £167 million, were transferred 
to the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership (‘the Partnership’). On 25 March 2011 a further 13 properties with a net book value of £345 million 
were transferred to the partnership (see note 30).

12 Intangible assets continued
Other intangibles are primarily comprised of pharmacy licences.
The goodwill balance above relates primarily to the Group’s acquisitions of Bells Stores Ltd, Jacksons Stores Ltd (£55 million), JB Beaumont Ltd, 
SL Shaw Ltd, Culcheth Provision Stores Ltd, Town Centre Retail (Bicester) Ltd, SW Dewsbury Ltd, Anobii Ltd and Portfolio Investments Ltd and is 
allocated to the respective cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) within the Retailing segment. The CGUs for this purpose are deemed to be the respective 
acquired retail chains of stores. The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the 
recoverable amount of each CGU with the carrying value of its goodwill. 
To calculate the CGU’s value in use, Board approved cash flows for the following financial year are assumed to inflate at the long-term average 
growth rate for the UK food retail sector and are discounted at a pre-tax rate of ten per cent (2012: ten per cent) over a 25 year period. Changes in 
income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market. Based on the operating performance of the 
respective CGUs, no impairment loss was identified in the current financial year (2012: £nil). The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a 
reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

All principal operating subsidiaries operate in the countries of their registration or incorporation, and have been consolidated up to and as at  
16 March 2013. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in s410 of the Companies Act 2006 to disclose a list comprising solely the 
principal subsidiaries. A full list of subsidiaries will be sent to Companies House with the next annual return.
During the prior year, a corporate simplification exercise resulted in the liquidation of a number of subsidiary companies of the Group, with a 
carrying value of £56 million.
During the year, a provision of £2 million was made against investments in subsidiaries where the carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount 
(2012: £1 million).
The Group has an interest in two partnerships, Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Partnership and Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Limited Partnership, 
which are fully consolidated into these Group accounts. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the 
Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts of these qualifying partnerships to these accounts. 
Separate accounts for these partnerships are not required to be, and have not been, filed at Companies House. 94  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

The Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from its retail operations is minimal given that the customer base is large and unrelated and that the 
overwhelming majority of customer transactions are settled through cash or secure electronic means. New parties wishing to obtain credit terms 
with the Group are credit checked prior to invoices being raised and credit limits are determined on an individual basis. 
Major counterparties are identified as follows:

on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices. 
Deferred income relates to the accounting for leases with fixed rental increases and lease incentives on a straight-line basis over the term of  
the lease.

Secured loans
Secured loans are secured on 128 (2012: 131) supermarket properties (note 11) and comprise loans from two finance companies:
• 
a fixed rate amortising loan with an outstanding principal value of £1,002 million (2012: £1,036 million) at a weighted average rate of 4.98 per cent 
stepping up to 5.36 per cent from April 2013 with an effective interest rate of 5.39 per cent and carrying amount of £1,039 million (2012: £1,069 
million) with a final repayment date of April 2018; and
• 
an inflation linked amortising loan with an outstanding principal value of £841 million (2012: £843 million) at a fixed real rate of 2.36 per cent 
where principal and interest are uplifted annually by RPI subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at nil per cent with a carrying amount of £868 
million (2012: £874 million) with a final repayment date of April 2031. 
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert £211 million (2012: £211 million) of the £1,002 million (2012: £1,036 million) loan due 2018 
from fixed to floating rates of interest. These transactions have been accounted for as fair value hedges (note 29). In previous years, £572 million 
of swaps accounted for as fair value hedges were de-designated from their fair value hedging relationship. The fair value adjustment of the debt 
previously hedged by these swaps will be amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement 
in the current financial year of £1 million (2012: £1 million). 
The Group entered into inflation linked swaps to convert £300 million (2012: £250 million) of the £841 million (2012: £843 million) loan due 2031 
from RPI linked interest to fixed rate interest for the period to April 2017. These transactions have been accounted for as cash flow hedges (note 29).
Bank overdrafts
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and bear interest at a spread above bank base rate.
Bank loan due 2014
A £25 million loan due July 2014 at floating rates of interest.
Bank loans due 2015
A £54 million amortising loan due May 2015 at floating rates of interest; a £20 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest; a £40 
million loan due May 2015 at floating rates of interest subject to a cap; a € 50 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into 
a £45 million floating rate loan; a US$69 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £44 million floating rate loan and a 
€40 million loan due March 2015 at floating rates of interest swapped into a £34 million floating rate loan.
In June 2012, a £50 million maturing loan at floating interest rate was renewed to June 2015. The £50 million floating rate loan has been swapped 
into a fixed rate loan and the loan and swap have been designated as a cash flow hedge. 98  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

20 Borrowings continued
Bank loan due 2016
A €50 million loan due September 2016 at floating rates of interest. The € 50 million loan has been swapped into a £44 million floating rate loan. 
Bank loans due 2017
A £45 million loan due February 2017 at floating rates of interest and a US$100 million loan due March 2017 at floating rates of interest. The  
US$100 million loan has been swapped into a £63 million fixed rate loan. The US$100 million loan and associated cross currency swap have been 
accounted for as a cash flow hedge with fair value movements in future interest payments deferred through the cash flow hedge reserve.
Bank loan due 2018
In June 2012, the Group entered into a new £23 million six year amortising bank loan due 2018 at floating rate of interest.
Convertible bond due 2014
In July 2009, the Group issued £190 million of unsecured convertible bonds due July 2014. The bonds pay a coupon of 4.25 per cent payable semi-
annually. Each bond is convertible into ordinary shares of J Sainsbury plc at any time up to 9 July 2014 at a current conversion price of 413.0 pence. 
In previous years the £190 million fixed rate convertible bonds had been swapped into floating rates of interest for the period to July 2012. These 
transactions had been accounted for as fair value hedges (note 29).
The net proceeds of the convertible bond have been split into a liability component of £166 million and an equity component of £24 million.  
The equity component represents the fair value of the embedded option to convert the bond into ordinary shares of the Company.

Three non-bank fixed rate loans due March 2015 totalling €28 million swapped into a £23 million floating rate loan. These transactions have been 
accounted for as fair value hedges (note 29).
Borrowing facilities
The Group maintains a £690 million syndicated revolving credit facility maturing in October 2015 for standby liquidity purposes. At 16 March 2013, 
no advance had been made under the borrowing facility (2012: £nil) and all conditions precedent had been met as at that date.
The facility incurs commitment fees at market rates and the interest rate on draw downs would be at floating rates.

Deferred income tax assets have been recognised in respect of all income tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred income 
tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally 
enforceable right of offset and the deferred income tax assets and the deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority. 100  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

28 Financial risk management
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity, counterparty credit, foreign currency, interest rate, commodity and capital risks.
Funding and financial risk management are managed by a central treasury department in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by 
the Board of Directors. The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance by 
identifying financial exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls. The Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has delegated 
responsibility for approving specific financial transactions. The Treasury Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, regularly reviews risk 
positions and monitors Treasury performance. The Group Audit Committee oversees compliance with risk management policies and reviews the 
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group Audit Committee is assisted by Group Internal 
Audit who periodically review the Group’s risk management controls and procedures. 
The Group uses forward contracts and options to hedge foreign exchange and commodity exposures, and interest rate swap contracts to hedge 
interest rate exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s treasury policy which prohibits the use of derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Treasury operations in respect of Sainsbury’s Bank are managed separately through Lloyds Banking Group, the Group’s joint venture partner.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due at a reasonable price.
The Group’s operational cash flow is largely stable and predictable, reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector. Cash flow 
forecasts are produced regularly to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements.
The Group’s liquidity policy targets a minimum funding headroom of £300 million in excess of forecast net debt over a rolling 12-month time 
horizon. The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a core of long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow commitments and 
holding adequate standby liquidity.  105 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

The Group’s core funding comprise two long-term loans of £1,002 million due 2018 and £841 million due 2031 both secured on property assets. In 
addition the Group has unsecured bank loans totalling £487 million with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2018, unsecured non-bank loans totalling 
£23 million maturing 2015, and a capital market convertible bond totalling £190 million maturing July 2014. The Group has also financed £96 million 
through multiple hire purchase facilities in respect of movable in-store assets for various periods to 2019. 
Short term and seasonal funding is sourced from the wholesale inter-bank money market where interest is charged at various spreads above LIBOR. 
The Group maintains a £690 million syndicated revolving credit facility due October 2015 for liquidity standby purposes. Interest on drawings under 
this facility is charged at a margin over LIBOR. There were £nil drawings under the facility as at 16 March 2013 (2012: £nil drawings). 
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity 
date as at the balance sheet date. The amounts disclosed in the tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows or an estimate of cash flows in

Counterparty credit risk
The Group is exposed to counterparty default or non-performance risk on its holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, 
deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities and trade and other receivables. 
The Group’s credit policy limits new investments to counter parties with minimum credit ratings of A1 from Standard & Poor’s or P1 from Moody’s 
Investors Service or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAAm from Standard & Poor’s or Aaa/MR1+ from Moody’s Investors Service.
The Group deposits surplus funds directly with approved banks on the wholesale inter-bank money market or with approved money market funds as 
a pooled investment.

Market risk
a) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on supplier contracts denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling and on recognised foreign 
currency assets and liabilities.
The Group’s currency risk policy limits the impact of movements in exchange rates on Group income by requiring anticipated foreign currency cash 
flows, primarily supplier contracts in US dollars and euros, to be hedged. The future cash flow which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are 
hedged on a layered basis from 20 per cent and building up to 80 per cent using forward contracts and options.
The Group also has exposure to currency risk on balances held on foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term 
timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments. 
The Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility. The impact of a ten per 
cent movement in the exchange rate of US dollar and euro versus sterling at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant,  
is summarised in the table below:

EUR/GBP –/– (13)/15 1/(1) (8)/10
b) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its borrowing and deposit portfolios. The Group’s interest rate policy seeks to control the Group’s 
interest cost and interest expense volatility by maintaining an appropriate and diversified mix of fixed rate, floating rate and inflation-linked 
liabilities. 
Financial instruments where interest is re-priced at intervals of one year or less are classified as floating rate. Interest on financial instruments 
classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument. 
(i) Fair value sensitivity for fixed rate instruments
The Group holds £1,303 million of fixed rate debt (2012: £1,345 million), of which £234 million (2012: £424 million) has been swapped into floating 
rate debt using interest rate swaps. The remaining £1,069 million (2012: £867 million) portion of fixed rate debt is recorded at amortised cost and a 
change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement. 
For the year to 16 March 2013, the fair value movement in the interest rate swaps resulted in a charge to the income statement of £3 million  
(2012: £8 million credit). The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt resulted in a credit to the income statement of £3 million  
(2012: £10 million charge).
 
(ii) Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments
The Group holds £549 million of floating rate borrowings (2012: £526 million) of which £113 million (2012: £63 million) has been swapped into fixed 
rate debt. The Group also holds £295 million of floating rate swaps (2012: £485 million) and holds £436 million of interest bearing assets (2012: £542 
million). The Group considers that a 100 basis point increase is a reasonable measure of volatility. The sensitivity of these balances to a change of 
100 basis points (or such lesser amount as would result in a zero rate of interest) in the floating rate at the balance sheet date is shown below:

The Group holds £854 million of inflation-linked debt (2012: £843 million) of which £300 million (2012: £250 million) has been swapped into fixed 
rate debt using inflation rate swaps due April 2017. The Group considers that a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the RPI rate is a reasonable 
measure of volatility. The sensitivity of these balances to a change of 100 basis points in the RPI rate at the balance sheet date is shown below:

(iv) Fair value sensitivity for available-for-sale assets 
Included within available-for-sale financial assets is £154 million (2012: £146 million) relating to the Group’s beneficial interest in a property 
investment pool. The net present value of the Group’s interest in the various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been 
derived by assuming a property growth rate of three per cent per annum (2012: three per cent) and a discount rate of ten per cent (2012: ten per 
cent), (see note 15). The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 0.5 per cent in the assumed rate of property rental growth and one per cent in the 
discount rate holding other assumptions constant is shown below:

Commodity risk
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk within its commercial buying operations and also with its own use consumption of electricity, gas  
and fuel.
The Group’s Energy Price Risk Committee limits the impact of movements in commodity prices on Group income by requiring forecast purchases of 
power and fuel to be hedged.
The Group uses financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference. The Group considers a ten per cent 
movement in commodity rates a reasonable measure of volatility. A ten per cent (2012: ten per cent) change in the fair value of the commodity price 
at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by £4 million (2012: £4 million).
The Group hedges own consumption electricity and gas exposures with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with its suppliers.
The Group has also entered into several long term fixed price power purchase agreements with independent producers. Included within derivative 
financial assets is £4 million (2012: £3 million) relating to these agreements. The Group values its power purchase agreements as the net present 
value of the estimated future usage at the contracted fixed price less the market implied forward energy price discounted back at the prevailing 
swap rate. The Group also makes an assumption regarding expected energy output based on the historical performance and the producer’s 
estimate of expected electricity output. The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 20 per cent in the assumed rate of energy output and 10 per 
cent in the implied forward energy prices holding other assumptions constant is shown below:

Capital risk management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as total equity plus net debt.
The Board’s objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Group’s strategic objectives, provide optimal returns for 
shareholders and safeguard the Group’s ability to remain a going concern. There has been no change to capital risk management policies during the 
year. 
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, balance sheet gearing and fixed charge cover. 
The Group can manage its capital structure by diversifying its debt portfolio, adjusting the size and timing of dividends paid to shareholders, 
recycling capital through sale and leaseback transactions, issuing new shares or repurchasing shares in the open market and flexing capital 
expenditure. 110  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
28 Financial risk management continued
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Group’s share option 
programmes. The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
The Board has a policy to maintain the underlying earnings cover for the ordinary dividend at a minimum of 1.5 times and to increase dividend cover 
to two times over the medium term.
Part of the Group’s capital risk management is to ensure compliance with the general covenants and financial covenants included in the Group’s 
borrowing facilities. There have been no breaches of these covenants in the financial year ended 16 March 2013.

Interest rate swaps – fair value hedge
The Group holds a portfolio of £234 million of interest rate swaps (2012: £424 million) to hedge a portion of the £1,002 million fixed rate secured 
loan due in 2018 and other loans due 2015. Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed interest and pays floating rate interest at a fixed 
spread above three-month LIBOR. The notional principal amount of one of the interest rate swaps amortises from £211 million to £111 million from 
April 2016 to April 2018. 
Interest rate swaps – cash flow hedge
The Group holds a portfolio of £300 million of inflation-linked swaps (2012: £250 million) due 2017 to hedge a portion of the £854 million inflation-
linked secured loan due 2031. Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives floating RPI interest (subject to a cap at five per cent and floor at 
nil per cent) and pays fixed rate interest. The Group also holds a portfolio of £113 million of floating to fixed interest rate swaps (2012: £63 million) to 
hedge a £50 million bank loan due 2015 and a US$100 million bank loan due 2017.
 
At 16 March 2013, an unrealised gain of £1 million (2012: £nil) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the interest rate swaps in cash 
flow hedges. This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next four years. 
Interest rate swaps – fair value through profit and loss
At 16 March 2013, the Group held a portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss which convert £331 million of the Group’s 
floating rate obligations into fixed rates (2012: £331 million). Under the terms of these swaps the Group pays fixed rates of interest and receives 
three-month LIBOR for periods to 19 April 2018. During the year, a £150 million swap under which the counterparty had a recurring option to cancel 
the swap through to January 2031, was restructured at market value into an amortising non-cancellable swap due 19 April 2018. 
The Group holds a portfolio of non-designated interest rate swaps which convert £391 million of fixed rate borrowings into floating rates (2012: £391 
million). Under the terms of the swaps the Group receives fixed rates of interest and pays floating rates of interest at various spreads above three-
month LIBOR until 19 April 2018. 
Foreign exchange forward contracts – cash flow hedges
At 16 March 2013, the Group held a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts with a fair value gain of £19 million (2012: £3 million) to hedge

rates ranging from 1.15 to 1.27 (2012: 1.14 to 1.21) with maturities from March 2013 to December 2015 (2012: March 2012 to April 2013) and forward

At 16 March 2013, an unrealised gain of £17 million (2012: loss of £3 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of the forward 
contracts. This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 33 months. During the year a credit to the income statement of  
£3 million was transferred from the cash flow hedge equity reserve and included in cost of sales (2012: debit of £3 million).
Commodity contracts – cash flow hedges
At 16 March 2013, the Group held a portfolio of commodity forward contracts with a fair value gain of £1 million (2012: gain of £3 million) to hedge  
its future own use fuel consumption over the next 12 months.
At 16 March 2013, an unrealised gain of £1 million (2012: gain of £3 million) is included in other comprehensive income in respect of these contracts. 
This gain will be transferred to the income statement over the next 12 months.
Commodity forward contract – fair value through profit or loss
Commodity forward contracts at fair value through profit and loss relates to the Group’s long-term fixed price power purchase agreements with 
independent producers (see note 28).
Fair value 
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial instruments that are carried in the financial 
statements other than at fair value. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices that are available from the market on which 
the instruments are traded where available. The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected 
future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, overdrafts and payables are assumed to 
approximate to their book values, and are excluded from the analysis below:

Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are recognised at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to 
which the fair value is observable:
• 
Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• 
Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
• 
Level 3 fair value measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

30 Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefit obligations relate to a defined benefit scheme, the Sainsbury’s Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) and an unfunded pension liability 
relating to senior employees. The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002. The assets of this scheme are held separately from the 
Group’s assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation carried out by Towers Watson, the scheme’s independent actuaries, at March 2012 on the 
projected unit basis. The results of this valuation are expected to be finalised in June 2013. The retirement benefit obligations at 16 March 2013 have 
been based, where appropriate, on the most recent actuarial valuation and updated by KPMG as actuarial advisors to the Group to take account of 
the requirements of IAS 19. 
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised 
in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
Sainsbury’s Property Scottish Limited Partnership
Further to the funding plan agreed with the Scheme’s Trustees, on 17 June 2010 Sainsbury’s established the Sainsbury’s Property Scottish 
Partnership (the ‘Partnership’) with the Scheme. Under this arrangement, properties to a fair value of £256 million were transferred to the 
Partnership. On 25 March 2011, further properties to a fair value of £501 million were transferred to the Partnership. Both transfers were effected 
via a 30 year sale and leaseback arrangement.
The Scheme’s interest in the Partnership currently entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately £35 million for 20 years. These 
contributions will be in addition to the Group’s normal cash contributions paid to the Scheme annually. The properties transferred to the Partnership 
will revert to Sainsbury’s ownership in 2030 in return for a cash payment equal to the amount of any remaining funding deficit on the Scheme at 
that time, up to a maximum of £600 million. 
The Partnership is controlled by Sainsbury’s and its results are consolidated by the Group. The Group’s balance sheet, IAS 19 deficit and income 
statement are unchanged by the establishment of the Partnership. The investment held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as  
a plan asset for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.  
The value of the properties transferred to the Partnership remains included within the Group’s property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet. 
In addition, the Group retains full operational flexibility to extend, develop and substitute the properties within the Partnership.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:

The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes. The expected 
return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking view of the financial markets (as suggested 
by the yield available) and the views of investment organisations.

The base mortality assumptions are based on the SAPS tables, with adjustments to reflect the Scheme’s population, with future improvements 
based on the CMI 2011 projection with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent per annum. 
e) Sensitivities
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £672 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the 
discount rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £749 million. 
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £455 million. A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the 
inflation rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by £425 million.
An increase of one year to the life expectancy would increase the retirement benefit obligations by £153 million.
The sensitivities are based on management’s best estimate of a reasonably anticipated change.

31 Share-based payments continued
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as set out below:
a) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (‘SAYE’)
The Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months’ continuous service. 
This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980. Under the SAYE scheme, participants remaining in the Group’s employment at 
the end of the three-year or five-year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price. 
Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.
At 16 March 2013, UK employees held 21,773 five-year savings contracts (2012: 22,976) in respect of options over 22.3 million shares  
(2012: 22.8 million) and 37,154 three-year savings contracts (2012: 33,993) in respect of options over 24.8 million shares (2012: 22.9 million).

Options granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair 
value calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
2013 2012
Share price at grant date (pence) 333 298
Exercise price (pence) 267 238
Expected volatility – 3 year period (%) 19.2 22.4
  – 5 year period (%) 29.5 32.2
Option life – 3 year period (years) 3.2 3.2
 – 5 year period (years) 5.2 5.2
Expected dividends (expressed as dividend yield %) 5.1 3.6
Risk-free interest rate – 3 year period (%) 1.1 1.3
 – 5 year period (%) 2.0 2.5
Fair value per option – 3 year period (pence) 50 60
 – 5 year period (pence) 73 85
The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, 
over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three or five years, as appropriate, on the assumption that 25 per cent of options will 
be cancelled over the service period as employees leave the SAYE scheme. 118  J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013

b) Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006, shares are conditionally awarded to the top managers in the Company. The core awards are calculated as 
a percentage of the participants’ salaries and scaled according to grades. 
The awards granted between 2006 and 2011 will vest if the threshold levels of two co-dependent performance conditions – Return on Capital 
Employed (‘ROCE’) and growth in cash flow per share, are achieved over the three-year performance period. The award granted in 2012 is assessed 
against ROCE, cumulative underlying cash flow from operations and relative sales measured against the IGD Index, with an Earnings Per Share 
gateway. The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance. Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls 
between two points.
Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards 
vest and 50 per cent of the award will be released. Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be 
released one year after the vesting date. Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date. Dividends will 
accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares. 
To achieve the maximum multiplier of four, the following criteria are required to be met:

Options to acquire the award of shares were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the 
fair value calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
 2013 2012 
Share price at grant date (pence) 310 355
Expected volatility (%) 23.1 18.4
Option life (years) 4.2 4.2
Risk-free interest rate (%) 1.4 3.3
Fair value per option (pence) 310 355 119 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Financial statements Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
31 Share-based payments continued
The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Group’s share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, 
over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for management’s view of future volatility of the share price.
In March 2012, the three-year performance targets were met achieving a multiplier of 1.7 (2011: 1.9). During the year, a total number of 5.9 million 
shares were granted to employees as a result of achieving the performance target and 4.2 million options were exercised. The weighted average 
share price during the year for options exercised was 310 pence (2012: 326 pence).
c) Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, applied to the top levels of management including Executive Directors and comprised around 40 participants in 
total. The first deferral took place in June 2007, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 24 March 2007. The second deferral 
took place in June 2008, in respect of the bonus awards for the financial year ended 22 March 2008. The third and final deferral took place in June 
2009, in respect to bonus awards for the financial year ended 21 March 2009.
The Plan measured the Company’s TSR performance over a three-year period against a bespoke UK and European retail comparator group 
comprising: Ahold, Carrefour, Casino, Delhaize, DSG International, Home Retail Group, Kingfisher, Marks & Spencer, Metro, Morrisons, Next and 
Tesco. Alliance Boots was removed from the comparator group following its de-listing.
Up to two matched shares could be awarded for each share deferred depending on the extent to which the TSR measure is achieved. No shares were 
awarded for below median performance, and the full match only applied where the Company achieved first place within the comparator group. At 
median position the match was 0.5 shares for each deferred bonus share and the share match was pro-rated at every position between median and 
first place.
To the extent that the performance condition was met at the end of the three-year performance period, the matched shares would be added to the 
deferred bonus shares. The deferred bonus shares and half of the matched shares could be accessed immediately following the performance test, 
while the remainder were held over for a further year. Dividends or their equivalents accrued on shares that vested.

d) Deferred Share Award
The Deferred Share Award targets a diverse range of business critical financial and non-financial scorecard measures. These are intended to reward 
the top 45 managers in the Company, including Executive Directors, for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the 
sustainable, long-term growth of the Company.
Share-based awards will be made to participants subject to performance against a basket of key strategic measures. At least 50 per cent of the 
award will be based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders. The balance will be based on measures which will assess 
the Company’s performance relative to its competitors as well as key strategic goals.
Performance against the target is measured over one financial year, but any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that 
management’s interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders. The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is 
dismissed for cause prior to their release date. Dividends accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.

e) Bonus Share Award
The Bonus arrangements for our senior managers and supermarket store managers include corporate and personal performance targets. A profit 
gateway is in place which means that a certain level of underlying profit before tax must be achieved before any bonus related to the corporate 
element of the bonus is released. 
60 per cent of the bonus is paid in cash and 40 per cent converted into shares, which are automatically released after three financial years. The 
share element of the bonus arrangement is called the Bonus Share Award. Bonus Shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is 
dismissed for cause prior to their release date. Dividends accrue on these shares and are released at the end of the three-year retention period.  
Our top 45 managers do not receive Bonus Share Awards as they receive Deferred Share Awards.

34 Capital commitments
The Group has entered into contracts totalling £296 million (2012: £345 million) for future capital expenditure in relation to property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets not provided for in the financial statements. 
The Company does not have any capital commitments (2012: £nil).
35 Financial commitments
Sainsbury’s Bank, a 50 per cent joint venture of the Group, has off balance sheet financial instruments committing it to extend credit to customers 
of £48 million (2012: £40 million). 
36 Contingent liabilities
The Group has a contingent liability for indemnities arising from the disposal of subsidiaries. No provision has been recognised on the basis that any 
potential liability arising is not considered probable. It is not possible to quantify the impact of this liability with any certainty.
37 Post balance sheet events
On 7 May 2013, the Group signed a share purchase agreement with Lloyds Banking Group to purchase the remaining 50 per cent of Sainsbury’s 
Bank and take sole ownership. The Group intends to fund the future consideration from internal resources. The transaction, subject to regulatory 
approval, is expected to complete in January 2014.
On 10 April 2013, the Group entered into a consultation period regarding the proposed cessation of the future accrual of benefits within its defined 
benefit pension scheme. Under this proposal, impacted colleagues will be offered membership of the Group’s existing defined contribution plans.
If the proposal proceeds, it is expected to result in a decrease in the defined benefit pension scheme service cost and an increase in contributions 
to the defined contribution plans, as well as a reduction in the defined benefit pension liability. Subject to the proposal being accepted, the financial 
impact will depend on both the implementation date and the extent to which impacted colleagues continue membership of the defined contribution 
plans and therefore until the consultation completes, cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty.

Tax information – Capital Gains Tax (‘CGT’)
For CGT purposes, the market value of ordinary shares on 31 March 1982 
adjusted for all capital adjustments was 91.99 pence and B shares 10.941 
pence.
Share capital consolidation
The original base cost of shares apportioned between ordinary shares 
of 28
4
/7 pence and B shares is made by reference to the market value of 
each class of shares on the first day for which a market value is quoted 
after the new holding comes into existence. The market value for CGT 
purposes of any share or security quoted on the Stock Exchange Daily

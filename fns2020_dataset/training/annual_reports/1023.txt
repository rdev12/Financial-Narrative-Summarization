CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Overview
Chairman’s statement 4
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
During the year, we continued in our strategy of transforming Anite
into a global software-based company.
Adjusted revenue and operating proﬁt from continuing operations
for the year (the Board’s preferred comparative measures) were
down 2.8% and 10.5% respectively when compared with the
previous year. This was wholly attributable to the handset testing
division of our Wireless business which was affected by difﬁcult
market conditions during the year. As a result, Wireless revenues
and proﬁts were reduced despite a strong performance from the
network testing (Nemo) unit, and action was taken to restructure
the handset business. Travel performed strongly, with better than
expected order intake, revenues and proﬁtability, while Public
Sector reported a good overall improvement in performance.
Further details of the Company’s performance are provided in the
Chief Executive’s review and in the ﬁnancial review.
Acquisitions and disposals
In july 2007 we disposed of our remaining German IT Services
business, Anite Deutschland, for a total consideration of £8.0m
paid in cash. We also sold Anite Travel Systems (Carus), a small
non-core Finnish subsidiary which was part of our Travel business,
for £1.0m, paid in cash.
We will continue to review the proﬁle of the Group to sharpen
its focus and deliver shareholder value, as well as considering
acquisition opportunities. We continue to work actively, with our
advisers, to explore a variety of strategic alternatives to remove, or
at least signiﬁcantly reduce, the scale of the discount in the market
valuation of our shares that reﬂects the ownership of several
businesses.
Results
Adjusted revenue from continuing operations was £15 4.0m (2007:
£158.4m). Adjusted operating proﬁt was £24.7m (2007: £27.6m)
and the operating margin was 16.0% (2007: 17.4%).Adjusted
operating proﬁt is stated before disposed businesses, share-based
payments, Telecoms restructuring costs and amortisation of
acquired intangible assets.
The reconciliation of adjusted operating proﬁt to proﬁt before tax

Review
Chief Executive’s review 6
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
OUR DETERMINATION TO TRANSFORM ANITE INTO
A SOFTWARE-BASED COMPANY IS UNCHANGED –
TECHNOLOGY IS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE,
AT THE HEART OF EFFICIENT BUSINESS AND OUR
AMBITION IS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, TO MAKE
ANITE THE LEADING SUPPLIER OF INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC
IT SOLUTIONS IN OUR CHOSEN MARKETS.
We made further progress during the year in our strategy of
transforming Anite into a software-based company which is the leading
supplier of industry-speciﬁc IT solutions in its chosen markets.
This progress was made despite a disappointing performance in
Wireless Handset Testing business.
On the positive side, however, our network testing business, Nemo,
performed strongly, and in November 2007, our handset testing
business entered into a strategic partnership with Agilent Technologies
to deliver market-leading test solutions for the new LTE (4G)
standard. This will result in the launch of a new LTE hardware
platform later this year.
The Travel division performed extremely well and, in the Public
Sector division, Pericles is now proﬁtable and acknowledged to be
a functional revenue and beneﬁts system.
On the minus side, the weakness in handset testing, which we
highlighted at the half year, has continued. Handset testing is
a cyclical business and after several years of strong growth, the
market is currently in a natural lull created by the transition from
3G to 4G technology. That has coincided with a general dip in the
market, particularly in the United States, although the severity
of the downturn was greater than we had initially anticipated.
As a result we undertook a restructuring of the business, including
senior management changes, created ﬁve market-facing business
units, increased use of offshore development facilities and imposed
rigorous cost controls.
I am, however, conﬁdent that the reduction in revenue and
operating proﬁt resulting from the weakness in the handset
testing market is temporary, and that our strategy is sound.
Our determination to transform Anite into a software-based
company is unchanged – technology is, and will continue to be, at the
heart of efﬁcient business and our ambition is, and will continue to
be, to make Anite the leading supplier of industry-speciﬁc IT
solutions in our chosen markets.
Strategic objectives
The longer-term strategic objectives which I set out in our 2007
annual report are also unchanged.
Our commitment to putting Wireless at the heart of our business
continues to be our main strategy. While development and growth
in that business has, for the time being, changed pace a little, the
market is still growing and has great potential. In readiness for 4G,
the Wireless division is currently focusing the majority of its
investment on the R&D phase to enable it to meet the requirements
of what is expected to be the dominant 4G standard, LTE (Long
Term Evolution). In conjunction with this we have signed
agreements with the early developers of LTE and, to date, have
four collaborative arrangements in place, including those with
NXP Semiconductors (NXP) and LG Electronics (LG), which will
strengthen the development of our new LTE products. Meanwhile,
our network testing business continues to beneﬁt from operators’
technical upgrades and a broader geographic spread.
Clearly, we will continue to drive organic growth in all our operations,
to focus on increasing our revenue and earnings, improving margins,
and maintaining strong operational cash ﬂow. As part of our dedication
to achieving that, we are becoming more of a global business.
While operating in other economies brings some challenges – such
as ﬂuctuations in exchange rates – which affect our business and
which are outside our control, they are outweighed by the tremendous
opportunities that being an international business creates.
The success of our more recent acquisitions, Nemo and Invenova,
encourages us to continue to look for businesses in our core markets
– particularly in network testing – which will enable us to increase
our geographic presence, as well as adding to the range of products
and technology we offer. Fixed-line operators are adopting
WiMAX technology to give users of
laptops easier access to high-speed
broadband. WiMAX complements the
services provided by mobile operators
and existing wireless networks and
eliminates the need to ﬁnd a hotspot.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Strategic progress
During the past year, we sharpened our focus on the transformation
of our business into a software-based company when we disposed
of two non-core businesses, began to reap beneﬁts from the two
businesses we had bought in the second half of the previous
ﬁnancial year, and signed a collaboration agreement with Agilent
Technologies, which enabled us to cease development of our own
hardware platform (Nevis).
Disposals In july 2007, we sold the last of our European IT services
businesses, Anite Deutschland, for £8m, and in February 2008 a
small Finnish business, Anite Travel Systems (Carus), for £1m.
Acquisitions Invenova, a smaller business acquired in january 2007,
brought WiMAX testing into the group. Now fully integrated into
the Wireless division, it has given us a foothold in the wireless
broadband test systems market and enabled us to add many of the
major WiMAX developers to our customer base.
Nemo, which we acquired in November 2006, and which added
network testing to our Wireless business, is also helping to increase
our geographic presence – its biggest potential growth areas are
Asia, particularly India, the Middle East (where we opened an ofﬁce
in Dubai in August 2007), Latin America, the CIS countries and
Africa. Nemo tools enable network operators to check the quality
of their networks regularly, to verify coverage, and to deal with
problems such as dropped calls and poor voice quality. They also
enable the effectiveness of new services, such as video streaming,
to be tested and measured.
Our markets
Anite operates in three clearly-deﬁned markets: Wireless, Travel
and Public Sector.
Wireless Anite provides specialist systems and software which
enable manufacturers of mobile phones and network equipment to
bring their new products to market quickly, WiMAX providers to test
their coverage, and service providers to optimise their networks.
Handset testing works in three stages: our software enables
manufacturers ﬁrst, to test the viability of new products; second,
to test products’ conformance – to prove that they meet the
rigorous standards set by the network operators and industry
regulators; and third, to test their interoperability – their ability to
communicate with other devices and networks. Our partnership
with Agilent Technologies gives us the ability to supply customers
with a scalable platform to test all three stages, rather than having
to use a variety of different hardware platforms to do the same job.
The Wireless business is driven by innovation (new technology,
the proliferation of new types of handset, and new devices).
The next generation 4G (LTE), will offer huge beneﬁts to consumers
by providing high-speed access to data and a true mobile
broadband experience. It will offer equally big beneﬁts to operators
by enabling them to make more efﬁcient use of the spectrum –
and bring new and existing services to consumers more rapidly.
Several of the leading operators have already committed to LTE, and
have asked to see engineering samples by the end of 2008. In the
early days of a new technology, such as LTE, developers of user
equipment need to work with a test solution partner to verify their
designs. This collaboration involves alignment of standards,
advanced test tools, and the provision of early test capability. In
effect, through these relationships, Anite is pioneering the eco-
system needed to make LTE happen. We have already signed up four
agreements with leading operators/equipment manufacturers as
collaboration partners – including NXP and LG to help us to develop
our LTE test solutions in conjunction with Agilent Technologies.
We expect our WiMAX business to grow, as ﬁxed-line operators
adopt the technology to enable them to offer subscribers easier
access to high-speed broadband on laptops – rather than having
to rely on hotspots – thereby complementing the services provided
by mobile operators and existing wireless networks. The world’s
leading chip maker, Intel, is now integrating WiMAX capability
into many of its products. Review
Chief Executive’s review 8
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our network testing business provides measurement tools that
enable network operators to verify the initial radio plan and network
coverage during roll-out, to troubleshoot problem areas, including
dropped calls, poor voice quality and indoor coverage during
operation, and to test the effect of new services, such as video
streaming, on existing networks. Investment in R&D is, therefore,
essential to ensure that it is ﬁrst-to-market with the latest
technologies. As a leading vendor of test-drive solutions, we have
global agreements in place with several large mobile operators
and network vendors. A focus on after-sales support, through
49 local distributors on three continents, makes our test-drive
solutions product a compelling choice in the market.
Travel Anite is a leading provider of travel technology solutions for
tour operators, low cost airlines, and ferry and holiday park operators
in the UK and Europe. Customers can choose to license our
products, manage the system themselves, or – as many do – take
advantage of our transaction fee based service where we provide
hosting and 24x7 system availability from our secure data centre.
In last year’s annual report, we said we had increased our
investment in our @comRes reservation system. A browser-based
solution, @comRes combines content management, reservations
and customer relationship management for internet bookings, call
centre reservations and fast-search facilities. In addition, we have
successfully developed the capabilities of @comRes to offer further
applications, such as supplier connectivity and procurement
facilities, which form part of our @com eBusiness suite.
During this ﬁnancial year, our belief in the value of the system has
been justiﬁed. At the beginning of April 2008, @comRes went live at
TUI AG, the largest tour operator in Germany, on time and on
budget – completing the ﬁrst phase of this project. Anite’s software
enables TUI AG to manage bookings through more than 9,400 retail
outlets to 180 destinations throughout the world. Once all the TUI
AG brands are live, @comRes will manage several million passengers
per year.
Superbreak Mini Holidays is one of the latest customers to adopt
@comRes. With more than 1million bookings a year, Superbreak is
the market leader in the provision of UK and European short breaks.
The implementation of @comRes will enable this specialist tour
operator to run its operations on new technology, providing a more
ﬂexible solution to offer improved marketing services to its
customers and sell holidays faster and more effectively
The consolidation in the UK travel market conﬁrms the wisdom of
us looking to expand internationally and we have already opened an
ofﬁce in Cologne, Germany, to aid us in that endeavour. We focus on
providing excellent service to our customers, maintaining
relationships with them and delivering solutions which meet their
needs. We are now marketing @comRes and the @com eBusiness
suite, which are constantly developing, together with the services
we offer, to this market.
Superbreak Mini Holidays, the market leader in UK
and European short breaks, has recently adopted our
@comRes reservation system to enable them to sell
holidays more effectively.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Public Sector
Anite is a market leader in software and solutions for local
government, including document management, social care, housing
management and the collection of local taxes and beneﬁts. We work
with 70% of local authorities, and also supply software and services
to the police and a number of national government departments
through our Secure Information Solutions division (SIS).
Local authorities are constantly under pressure to provide better,
and better value-for-money, services. Our transformation products,
such as document management and mobile working, help the public
sector to cut costs by improving efﬁciency and effectiveness. Our
solutions also help them to make information more accessible and
transparent, and to share information with other services where
necessary. SIS supplies security solutions to all UK police forces. In
October 2007, it was awarded a three-year £3.6m contract to
support the national Automatic Number Plate Recognitions (ANPR)
system, which positions Anite as a major supplier of national police
information systems.
In the past ﬁnancial year, we continued our response to the
separation of local government services for adults and children
with the launch of our new adults solution supporting the central
government drive towards personalisation and social care.
Within Public Sector, the year’s greatest success was the successful
implementation of Pericles, our browser-based revenues and
beneﬁts solution, at 35 local authorities. Front-line staff and
management are reporting that Pericles is streamlining the process
of delivering more co-ordinated services.
In what is generally considered to be a tough market, the Public
Sector division is performing well.
Looking ahead
In our drive to continue creating long-term shareholder value, we
will maintain our focus on investing in growth markets, on meeting
customers’ needs and on maximising opportunities from advances
in technology.
In our Wireless division, we will continue to take advantage of
growth in emerging regions and from advances in technology, will
maintain our investment in development and focus on increasing
our sales to network operators. We believe that the current negative
trends in demand for 2G and 3G systems will continue throughout
the current year. We will commence shipments of our 4G(LTE)
systems towards the end of 2008, although we do not expect
to see the full beneﬁts come through to the bottom line until
the 2009/2010 ﬁnancial year. We will also continue to look for
acquisitions, particularly in the network testing market, which
is fragmented and is likely to consolidate.
A strong order book indicates that the Travel division will continue
to make good progress, although the price of fuel and the risk of
recession is of increasing concern to tour operators. @comRes is
making the progress we predicted, and we are conﬁdent that it will
build on its initial success. We expect the division to increase its
business outside the UK in the coming year, particularly in Germany
and northern Europe.
The Public Sector division is now in good shape. It is expected
to continue to improve its overall performance led by our Local
Government business.
Taking the seasonality of our Wireless business into account, the
current year has had a satisfactory start with trading ahead of the
same period last year.

Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Despite a strong ﬁrst time full-year contribution from Nemo, our network testing business, overall revenues and proﬁts in Wireless
declined. They were affected by the reduced revenues in handset testing – which accelerated in the second half – and a planned increase
in development spending in the division (an additional £2.6m was expensed in the income statement) impacted on the operating margin.
The effect of net capitalisation of R&D under IAS 38 had a neutral impact on the P&L, compared with the previous period, in which net
capitalised R&D improved proﬁts by £1.5m .
The currency effect of exchange rate ﬂuctuations in the US dollar had the effect of reducing overall Wireless revenues by £0.6m and proﬁts
by £0.7m on a constant currency basis. In addition, sales of third-party hardware fell by £4.8m.
During the year £3.3m of exceptional restructuring costs were incurred in the handset testing business. These resulted from the cost of
discontinuing our own platform development project (Nevis), of £2.4m, following our strategic agreement with Agilent Technologies – and
also from management and structure changes in the business to mitigate the weakness in its trading, of £0.9m.
Handset testing After three years of strong growth this business experienced a fall in demand during the year. This was the result of a
number of inﬂuences: the technology cycle (2G revenues in long-term decline, 3G revenues peaking and 4G revenues yet to compensate)
which principally affected the conformance testing segment of our market; budget constraints at key customers in the USA (focusing on
higher utilisation of existing test systems rather than purchasing new); and weakness in Europe, japan and Korea.
To mitigate the impact of these trends on proﬁtability, while at the same time taking the Agilent Technologies partnership into
consideration, we made a number of changes to the business to increase focus and reduce costs.
Network testing (Nemo) This business performed strongly: it returned good revenue growth and proﬁtability in what was its ﬁrst full year
of Anite ownership. We have focused on expanding the business geographically, through the opening of new ofﬁces, such as that in Dubai
which will serve the Middle East, and by appointing new distributors, strengthening our business development team and launching new and
updated products. This was reﬂected in strong sales in Europe and emerging markets. Nemo’s results in euros showed revenue increased
21. 9% to €26.2m (2007: 12months €21.5m)and operating proﬁt (including integration costs) up 20.0% at €7 .8m (2007: 12months €6.5m).
The network testing market continues to be extremely competitive and order book visibility is generally very short, but the business has
excellent products – on which investment continues – and improved routes to market. Overall, Nemo’s market position has improved
during the year and we believe that we can grow our network test presence further, both organically and through acquisition.

Travel had a strong year, with excellent growth in revenue and operating proﬁt. This was driven by good demand for our @comRes product
(our internet-based booking suite) and associated services. We also continue to work with Norwich Union’s Lifetime division, for which we
supply hosting and infrastructure support services.
Multi-million pound orders were received from TUI AG, the German subsidiary of the TUI Travel Group (through conﬁrmation of future
phases of the contract), and from Superbreak (a division of Holidaybreak Plc). International revenues as a percentage of Travel’s total
revenues continue to rise, to 18.6% (2007: 12.4%).
@comRes is being very well received in the market and our key projects, the most signiﬁcant of which is the TUI contract in Germany, are
making good progress. The level of engagement and satisfaction among @comRes customers provides encouragement for the growth of the
order book.
During the year, we announced the opening of an ofﬁce in Cologne to enable us to realise our plans to win more customers for @comRes in
the market in Germany.
Increasing pressure on margins of tour operators is forcing them to look at ﬁnding ways of reducing costs through the use of effective
systems, such as @comRes to improve their proﬁtability.

Total Public Sector Public Sector beneﬁted from the continuing reduction in Pericles losses, by £2.4m to £0.3m, and tight cost control,
resulting in a good increase in operating proﬁt and continuing sequential progress. Although total revenue fell by £3.8m, software and
recurring maintenance revenue increased by £4.0m to £36.7m, while our development and systems integration revenue fell by £6.6m
to £17.7m. Our revenue from our legacy VME business declined by £1.8m and had a £1.1mnegative impact on proﬁt compared with the
previous year.
Net capitalised R&D in the period reduced proﬁt by £1.1m(net amortisation), compared with last year, when net capitalised R&D improved
proﬁts by £1.5m. Capitalised R&D is amortised over three years.

Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Local Government Our investment in new products focused on the areas in which we are strongest and believe that opportunities are
greatest. We also made savings by reducing our cost base in the year.
We continue to make good progress with Pericles and believe that it will prove to be a successful product that will generate proﬁts in the
future as a core part of our Local Government business. As a result, there was no increase in the contract provision related to it.
Secure Information Solutions (SIS) SIS proﬁts were down year-on-year. This was anticipated, since the business beneﬁted from
a disproportionately high level of software licence sales and high professional services utilisation in the previous year.
In October 2007, SIS was awarded a three-year £3.6m contract to support the national Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
system which secures our position as a major supplier of national police information systems. Anite’s ANPR solution stores readings from
roadside trafﬁc cameras in a secure database enabling police to deny criminals the use of the UK’s road network. The UK leads the world in
sophisticated forensic and police information systems and we have won an initial international contract in the Netherlands. We are also
currently exploring opportunities to secure further international business.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Revenue
Revenue for continuing businesses, excluding disposed businesses, decreased by 2.8% to £154.0m and is analysed by type in the table below:
One of the Group’s ﬁnancial objectives is to improve the quality of its earnings by increasing the proportion of revenue that comes from
recurring business, such as managed services and software maintenance, both of which are longer-term in nature, together with the revenue
stemming from sales of software licences, embedded in its software, which derive from the Group’s internally developed IPR and know-how.

Overhead costs
Divisional performances are stated before unallocated corporate costs. Unallocated corporate costs include head ofﬁce staff costs,
Directors’ remuneration, professional and ofﬁce costs, and non-operational costs. During the period unallocated corporate costs totalled
£1.6m (2007: £2.0m) and were reduced by lower overhead costs and reduced bonuses. Unallocated share-based payments totalled £1.2m
(2007: £0.9m).
Non-operational properties resulted in a small surplus in the period of £0.1m (2007: net cost £0.4m). We continue to manage an orderly
and low-risk run-down of this portfolio which comprises legacy properties previously occupied by Group businesses. We take the
opportunity to exit from non-operational properties, where economically advantageous, although this does cause ﬂuctuations in our
costs and cash ﬂows from time to time.

Total development spending (excluding the effect of capitalisation/amortisation) reduced in the year to £17.3m(2007: £18.0m). £18.4m
(2007: £15.0m) was expensed in the year, including net amortisation of £1.1m(2007: net capitalisation £3.0m). Development spending
largely focused on Wireless and Public Sector.
Group ﬁnance costs
The Group had a net debt position on 30 April 2008 of £15.4m (2007: £22.6m). Gearing was 25% (2007: 35 %). Net ﬁnance costs (note 4)
of £0.8m (2007: £0.8m) included a one-off exchange gain of £1.3m on the translation of the escrow account (euro denominated) held for
the Nemo earnout, which was released in April 2008.
Taxation
The tax rate for the continuing operations for the year was 25.7% (2007: 30.1%). The charge for the year amounted to £3.8m (2007: £7.0m).
The cash payment for the year amounted to £3.9m (2007: £2.5m). The tax rate decreased in the year, as a result of the decrease in proﬁts
from countries where tax rates are higher than the UK, principally in Anite Wireless’s US operation. As Wireless continues to widen its
geographic spread of proﬁts in higher tax regimes, the Group tax rate is expected to show some volatility as the proﬁt mix between high-tax
and low-tax locations changes from year to year.
Shareholder returns and dividends
> Adjusted basic earnings per share was 4.9p (2007: 5.5p).
> The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 0.60p per share (2007: 0.55p) making a total for the year of 0.875p (2007: 0.80p) – covered
six times by adjusted earnings.
> Retained earnings to equity holders was £13.2m(2007: £20.3m) for the year.
At 30 April 2008, the number of shares in issue had decreased by 14.7 million in the period under review to 338.04 million, (from 352.7million
at 30 April 2007). In total, 16.26 million shares were bought back and cancelled at an average price of 45.9p per share and for a total cost of
£7.5m; 1.55 million new shares were issued to settle SAYE and grant/award maturities. The weighted average number of shares in issue used
to calculate basic earnings per share was, therefore, 344.53 million (2007: 350.16 million). This does not include the dilutive effect of share
option and grant/award schemes.

The disposals of Anite Deutschland Management GmbH (part of the International division) for a gross consideration of £8.0m, and Anite
Travel Systems Ab Ltd (“Carus”) (part of the Travel division), for a gross consideration of £1.0m, were completed within the ﬁnancial year.
Revenue and proﬁt attributable to disposed and discontinued businesses in the period were £3.2m (2007: £15.4m)and £0.3m (2007: £3.7m).
Cash management
Despite the lower proﬁt performance, the Group achieved strong cash conversion from operating proﬁts during the year. The key
movements in the year were as follows:
> Net proceeds from disposals – £8.5m (2007: £0.1m)
> Tax paid – £3.9m (2007: £2.5m)
> Capital expenditure – £3.8m (2007: £3.7m)
> Shares bought back for cancellation – £7 .5m (2007: £0.6m)
> Shares bought for employee trust – £4.3m (2007: £0.3m)
> Dividends paid – £3.7m (2007: £1.7m)
> Earnouts paid for Invenova and Nemo acquisitions – £2.3m (2007: nil)
> Term loan repayment – £5m (2007: nil)
The dividend payments included three payments (two interims and a ﬁnal) in the year to bring payments into line with the ﬁnancial year end.
Balance sheet and cash
The Group has further reduced its net debt this year following the acquisitions of Nemo and Invenova in the previous year at a cost of
£63.7m, and remains well within its bank covenant levels.

Change of Company name
The Company changed its name from Anite Group plc to Anite plc with effect from 4 October 2007.
Principal activities
The Group is a leading worldwide provider of IT solutions, software, systems integration and managed services within its core markets of
Wireless, Travel and Public Sector.
Analyses of turnover, proﬁt on ordinary activities and net assets are given in note 2 on pages 50 to 53.
Business review and future developments
The Company is required by the Companies Act to include a business review in this report. The information that fulﬁls the requirements

contained in the Chairman’s statement on page 4, the Chief Executive’s review on page 6, the ﬁnancial review on page 10 and the corporate
governance report on page 23 of this report.
Where the Annual Report contains forward-looking statements, these are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information
available to them at the time of their approval of this report. Consequently, such statements should be treated with caution due to the
inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying such forward-looking statements or information.
Results
The audited accounts of the Group for the year ended 30 April 2008 are set out on pages 38 to 82. The Group proﬁt for the year,

together with the interim dividend of 0.275p per share paid on 28 March 2008, will make a total dividend for the year of 0.875p per share.
Research and development
The total expenditure in the year was £17.3m (2007: £18.0m) of which £18.4m was expensed in the income statement (2007: £15.0m)

Report of the Directors 20
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The Company’s Articles of Association require that one-third of the Directors must retire at each AGM and that each Director must offer
themselves for re-election at least once every three years. At the 2008 AGM, Mr Brendish and Mr Hurst-Brown will retire by rotation under
Article 66 and, being eligible, Mr Brendish and Mr Hurst-Brown offer themselves for re-election.
The Board considers that the performance of the Directors proposed for re-election continues to be effective and that they demonstrate
a strong commitment to their role.
Directors’ interests
The beneﬁcial interests of the Directors holding ofﬁce at 30 April 2008 and their immediate families in the capital of the Company are as
set out in the remuneration report which starts on page 29.
No Director has, or had during the period under review, any interest in any contract of signiﬁcance with the Company or any of its subsidiaries
other than their own employment contracts.
Directors and ofﬁcers of the Company and its subsidiaries have the beneﬁt of a Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance policy which

Environmental policy
The Company supports the protection of a sustainable environment. The Group’s activities do not produce harmful waste or emissions and
the Ethical Investment Research Service grades Anite as “low impact”. Whilst our operations are, by their nature, of minimal impact on the
environment, we do recognise our responsibilities in this respect.
Anite is therefore committed to:
> complying with the relevant environmental legislation, regulations and industry standards of the countries in which it conducts business;
> reducing the output of emissions that may adversely impact on the environment;
> minimising the consumption of energy and water used in its facilities;
> reducing waste and, wherever practicable, re-using and recycling consumables (e.g. paper, toner cartridges and computer equipment)
and disposing of non-recyclable items in an environmentally acceptable manner; and
> where practicable, purchasing environmentally-sound goods and services.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Company is building awareness and promoting initiatives to encourage employees to become fully
engaged. The Directors regularly review the environmental policy.

Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Employees
The energy, commitment and passion of our employees are vital to our business. The Company strives to create a working environment
which encourages people to be individuals and develop their full potential within a framework of shared values and goals. To achieve this,
Anite is committed to a policy which provides all employees and potential employees with equality of opportunity for selection and
development regardless of age, gender, nationality, race, creed, disability or sexuality.
In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with the Company continues and that
appropriate training is arranged for them.
Employees are provided with information through Myanite, the Group’s global intranet, roadshows and other internal communications.
The views and ideas of employees are sought through discussion, line management and focus groups.
The Company operates a range of employee share schemes for Executive Directors and a small number of Senior Executives, and they are
more fully described in the remuneration report contained on pages 29 to 34.
Since August 2005, the Company has offered employees an enhanced Share Incentive Plan, which currently matches on a one-for-one basis
the number of shares purchased monthly by employees.
The Company also has Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes, both in the UK and overseas. No options were granted under these schemes during
the year, and it is not anticipated that any further grants will be made.
Payment of suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree with all suppliers, where practicable, appropriate terms of trade and to operate within those terms.
Trade creditors at 30 April 2008 represented on average 45 days’ credit (2007: 43 days) for the Group and 40 days’ credit for the Company
(2007: 40 days).
Going concern
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, consider that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
ﬁnancial statements.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In the case of each of the persons who were Directors of the Company at the date when this report was approved:
> so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are not aware; and
> each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS CONTINUED
Management and governance
Report of the Directors 22
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The Company is committed to the principles of good corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
adopted by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (the “Combined Code”). This report sets out the Company’s compliance with the
Combined Code.
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
The Company has applied the principles set out in section 1 of the Code, including both the main and supporting principles, by complying
with the Code as reported above. Further explanations of how principles and supporting principles have been applied are set out below and
in the remuneration report and the report of the Audit Committee.
The Board
The Board of Directors is the body responsible for corporate governance, for establishing policies and objectives and for the stewardship
of the Group’s resources. It is the Group’s policy that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with their roles and
responsibilities clearly divided and recorded. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting
its agenda. He also ensures that communication with shareholders is effective and facilitates the contribution of the Non-Executive
Directors. The Chief Executive is responsible for implementing the strategy agreed by the Board as a whole and for managing the Group.
Currently, the Board is made up of the Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors. Peter Bertram
is the Senior Independent Director. The biographies of the Directors as at the date of this report are given on page 18.
The Chairman was considered to be independent in his appointment to the Board. It is the opinion of the Board that the two
Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and have no business or other relationship which could interfere materially
with the exercise of their judgement in relation to the business of the Company or the Group.
The Directors believe it is essential that the Company has an effective Board. The Board operates formally through regular Board meetings
and there is also frequent communication between the Directors outside these meetings. During the period under review the Board met
20 times. Details of attendance at these meetings are given in the table on page 25. During the year the Board also received detailed
strategy presentations from the divisional Managing Directors.
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the management and control of the Group’s activities, its strategic objectives,
governance, internal controls, and the stewardship of its resources. The regular and timely provision of information to the Board is ensured
through the monthly preparation and circulation to all Board members of the Chief Executive’s report, which reports on operational
matters; the Group Finance Director’s report, which provides the monthly management accounts and other relevant ﬁnancial information;
and the Company Secretary’s report, which covers corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and matters concerning the
Company’s shares, share schemes and shareholders. Other matters are tabled on a regular basis at Board meetings or are reported to the
Board as appropriate.
The Board has a regular schedule of meetings together with further meetings when required. In addition, Directors meet as members of
relevant committees. The Board has delegated the normal operational management of the Company to the Executive Directors, who
have direct responsibility for all operations and activities. They are supported in this by an Executive Team which comprises, in addition to
the Executive Directors, the Managing Directors of each division, plus the Group Human Resources Director and the Company Secretary.
The Board has agreed a formal schedule of matters reserved speciﬁcally for its decision which include:
> strategy and objectives;
> business plans and budgets;
> changes in capital and corporate structure;
> accounting policies and ﬁnancial reporting;
> internal controls and business risk factors;
> major contracts;
> capital projects;
> acquisitions and disposals;
> communications with shareholders; and
> Board membership.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present at least annually.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and
applicable rules and regulations are observed. There is an agreed procedure for Directors to obtain independent professional advice, paid for
by the Company.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, one-third of the Board is required to retire by rotation each year and each Director
must offer himself for re-election once every three years. In addition, any Director appointed during the year will stand for election at the
next General Meeting, ensuring that each Board member faces re-election at regular intervals. Details of the Directors due to retire at the
2008 Annual General Meeting are shown on page 21.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Committees of the Board
The Board’s Committees meet regularly to enable them to discharge their responsibilities. Each Committee has terms of reference which
are reviewed regularly by the Board. Copies are available on request from the Company Secretary or on the Group’s website www.anite.com.
Following formal decision making the Board may, on occasion, delegate authority to a committee consisting of any two Directors to
approve the detailed execution of an agreed course of action within strict parameters.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Chairman and the two Non-Executive Directors. It is chaired by Peter Bertram. The Committee’s role
is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for ﬁnancial reporting and internal control.
The report of the Audit Committee on page 35 includes details of the Audit Committee and its work.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman, the two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the two Executive Directors.
The Board acknowledge that the Committee is not technically in line with the Combined Code recommendation that the Committee should
comprise a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors as the test of independence does not apply to the Board Chairman in
accordance with the Combined Code. However, the Board Chairman was independent on his appointment and the Board still consider him
to be independent. It is chaired by David Hurst-Brown. The Committee may invite others, including external advisers, to attend its meetings
as appropriate. The Company Secretary is the secretary to the Committee. The Nomination Committee met twice during the year. Details of
attendance at each meeting are shown in the table on page 25.
The principal role of the Nomination Committee is to advise and make recommendations to the Board with regard to the size, structure
and composition of the Board, the appointment of new Directors and the re-appointment of existing Directors. The Committee follows
formal, rigorous and transparent procedures when appointing new Directors, which include the preparation of a job description, the use
of external advisers to facilitate the search and the evaluation of candidates according to objective criteria. All short-listed candidates
are interviewed by at least two members of the Committee.
Remuneration Committee
The remuneration report on pages 29 to 34 includes details of the Remuneration Committee and its work.

Terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for a term of three years. The terms and conditions of the appointment of the
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection by any person at the registered ofﬁce of the Company during normal business hours
and at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Board performance evaluation and training
The Board, as part of its commitment to ensure its effectiveness and evaluate its performance, completed a full evaluation of its
performance and that of its Directors during the year. This evaluation consisted of a questionnaire being completed by all Board members.
In addition, questionnaires were completed by members of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee in connection with a
formal evaluation of each Committee’s assessment of its performance and effectiveness.
The Non-Executive Directors have met alone to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
The evaluation of Board performance will continue to be conducted annually and the Company will engage external help from time to time
to ensure that the process is robust.
Induction and development of Directors
All new Directors receive a comprehensive induction to the Company.
Individual Directors are expected to take responsibility for identifying their training needs and to take steps to ensure that they are
adequately informed about the Company and their responsibilities as a Director. In addition, the Company has a continuing professional
approach to assist the Directors in discharging their responsibilities effectively. This is achieved through brieﬁngs on business issues,
as well as legal, accounting and changes in corporate governance. Directors also have the ability to attend external seminars on topics
that are of interest.
Non-Executive Directors meet regularly with Executive Directors and members of the Executive Team and also receive regular business
updates via scheduled presentations.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
The Group uses a range of performance measures to measure and manage the businesses within the Group. In addition, the divisions have
established their own performance indicators that are speciﬁc to their individual businesses.
The Group KPIs monitor order intake (net and gross), revenues, margins (gross and net), overhead costs, projects, cash ﬂow, capital and
development expenditure and headcount. In addition to these Group KPIs, other measures indicating speciﬁc divisional measures such
as product development, loss making projects, manpower utilisation and working capital are used.
The Group changes and reﬁnes the KPIs regularly dependent on the major issues that are identiﬁed in the businesses.
Internal control and risk
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a sound system of internal control to provide them with
reasonable assurance that all information used within the business and for external publication is adequate, including ﬁnancial, operational
and compliance control and risk management, and for ensuring that assets are safeguarded and therefore that shareholders’ investment is
protected. There are limitations in any system of internal control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group continues to enhance its project management procedures to ensure that good practice is applied consistently across the Group.
Management and governance
Corporate governance report 25
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 In line with past practice, the Board has reviewed the internal control system in place during the year and until the date of the approval of
this report to ensure that it remains effective. Where signiﬁcant weaknesses are identiﬁed as a result of the reviews, new procedures are put
in place to strengthen controls.
The Board has in place risk assessment processes across the Group’s divisions, and procedures have been established to implement best
practice. There is an ongoing process for identifying, managing and reviewing any changes in the risks faced by the business. This process
has been in place throughout the year under review, and continues. It operates under the direction of the Board and is reviewed by the
Audit Committee.
The key procedures that the Board has established and which are designed to provide effective internal control for the Group are:
> The Board sets out the Group authority procedures, which are adopted by all the subsidiary companies.
> The issue of a Group accounting and procedures manual which sets out the Group’s accounting practices, revenue recognition rules,
accounting under IFRS and bid approval processes.
> The Board continues to review the progress of all major ﬁxed price contracts monthly.
> The Director of Projects and Programmes oversees project management standards and procedures across the Group and the education
of all divisional project managers in best practice for the management of bids and the execution and status reporting of projects.
> The application of a rigorous annual budgeting process following a detailed divisional and Group strategy review. All budgets are subject
to approval at Board level.
> The Executive Team is responsible for reviewing the operational results, communicating and applying Group-wide polices and
procedures, and strategy on operational matters which is communicated both to the Board and to the operating units.
> The formal monthly operational review by the Executive Directors together with the divisional management teams to assess the
ﬁnancial and operating performance and discuss the ongoing development of each business unit and the comparison of detailed
monthly management reports against budgets, forecasts and prior years. In addition, the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director
prepare a monthly report for the Board on key developments, performance and issues in the business.
> The maintenance of local operating boards and divisional management teams, enabling the Board to delegate appropriate levels
of authority to a small number of subsidiary company directors and managers, all of whom are directly accountable to the Board.
> The identiﬁcation and mitigation of major business risks is the responsibility of operating company management. Each operating
company maintains internal controls and procedures appropriate to its structure and business environment, whilst complying with
Group policies, standards and guidelines. The Managing Director and Finance Director of each business unit are required to complete a
self assessment checklist half yearly. This provides assurance that the business unit has complied with internal controls, ﬁnancial controls
and reporting requirements of the Group and has brought to the attention of Group management any instances of fraud or other
matters relating to their business.
> Insurance cover is maintained for all the major risk areas of the Group based on the scale of the risk and the availability of cover in the
external market.
> The use of external professional advisers to carry out due diligence reviews of potential acquisitions.
> The operation of a small internal review function to carry out internal control reviews of all the operating divisions at least annually,
reporting to the Audit Committee.
> The periodic detailed objective review of each business and its future direction by management and the Audit Committee.
The Board, with the advice and recommendations of the Audit Committee, will continue to review the effectiveness of all internal systems
of control through independent reports where appropriate, and by internal formal monthly review meetings in all main operating
companies and divisions to test the validity of the internal reporting process.
Internal review function
The Board has established a Group internal review function which reports to the Audit Committee. The function is not an independent audit
function but nevertheless it is an important part of the Group’s overall system of internal control.
Risk management
Anite has undergone signiﬁcant change over the past few years. The Group operates in a number of fast-changing markets within wireless,
public sector, local government and central government, and travel industry enterprise software. These markets provide signiﬁcant
challenges as well as rewards and management have progressively improved the Group’s approach to risk management.
The combination of robust and well-deﬁned central direction, strong divisional management and effective processes and controls will
enable the Group to identify and deal with key risks at the earliest opportunity.
The Group operates rigorous processes and controls to ensure that for each division there is a detailed annual operating plan and budget
with a monthly operational review by senior management to ensure the businesses are making progress against those plans, taking the
appropriate corrective actions throughout the course of the year should issues arise. The progress of each division is reported regularly
to the main Board meetings.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Management and governance
Corporate governance report 26
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The principal risk factors that may affect Anite Group’s business are outlined below. These are not all within the Group’s control; other
factors beside those listed may also affect the Group.
Business asset risk
The Group increasingly operates in global markets and failure to manage its portfolio of businesses effectively could have a serious impact.
The Group conducts regular reviews of its business portfolio; it may, however, still be exposed to risks such as increased taxation,
regulations and threats to its market leadership.
Political climate risk
The Group recognises that in some countries in which it operates, speciﬁc country risks exist that could have an effect on its business and
such risks may include volatility of national currencies, unexpected changes in local laws, regulations or standards and changes in local
customs and business practices.
Project delivery risk
The successes of many of the Group businesses are dependent on the successful completion of development projects within budget,
cost and speciﬁcations. The delivery of these projects is subject to certain technical, commercial, legal, contractor and economic risks.
Strategic and operational risks
Within Wireless
> The highly technical and fast-changing nature of the marketplace.
> Ensuring the business realises continued growth in network testing.
> The ability to identify and maintain effective relationships with key suppliers and strategic partners.
> The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology.
Within Travel
> The changing nature of the customer market resulting from increasing use of the internet.
> The need to keep products at the forefront of changes in technology.
> Delivery of projects and contracts to our clients within agreed budgets and timescales.
> Ensuring the business is ﬂexible enough to accommodate the changing structure of the travel industry.
> Ensuring that the division has common robust systems and back-up processes in place to mitigate problems of external infrastructure
failures that might have an impact on the division’s performance.
Within Public Sector
> The nature and speed of the market changes occurring as the result of the Government’s agenda for increased efﬁciency and
effectiveness in local government.
> All contracts and product developments are managed with respect to the Board’s approach to risk.
> Delivery of projects and contracts to our customers within agreed budgets and timescales.
> The division continues to invest in products which are driven by regulation and market changes.
> The market moves toward customer services, shared management services and efﬁciency in order to enhance competitiveness.
Human resource and organisation risks
Anite’s performance and its ability to mitigate signiﬁcant risks within its control depend on its employees and management teams.
Future success will depend to a large extent on the Group’s ability to attract, retain and motivate its people.
If the Group loses the services of key people or is unable to attract and retain employees with the right capabilities and experience,
it would be likely to have an effect on the Group’s business and operations.
Financial risks
The Group has several ﬁnancial risks, including costs, the nature of commercial contracts, interest rates, exchange rates, insurances
and other ﬁnancial risks. Some of these are covered in the Group treasury management section below.
The Group also recognises that the continued change in the Group’s portfolio and geographic spread requires new risk mitigation techniques
which enable the Group to:
> manage bank debt in compliance with banking covenants.
> identify and mitigate the effect of currency, interest rate and cost changes.
> mitigate the increase in the Group’s tax rate as sales and proﬁts expand in higher tax areas.
Group treasury management
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise borrowings, derivatives, cash and liquid resources, and various items such as trade debtors
and trade creditors that arise directly from, and ﬁnance, operations.
Management and governance
Corporate governance report 27
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The
Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis.
The Group’s head ofﬁce ﬁnance function is responsible for ensuring that the policies approved by the Board are adopted throughout the Group.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is subject to a cross-border transactional currency exposure in respect of trading outside each operating company’s functional
currency. Where possible, currency receivables and payables are matched, creating a natural hedge. Any surplus cross-border transactional
exposure is not hedged. The policy is that any surplus foreign currency is converted into sterling at the earliest opportunity.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern Europe and Asia Paciﬁc and whose revenues and
expenses are denominated in their local currencies. The Group currently partly hedges its investment in overseas subsidiaries through
ﬁnancial instruments and natural hedges.
Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of retained reserves and bank borrowings. The Group seeks to
minimise overall net interest expense, and where there are surplus funds to obtain a fair market rate of return. The Group operates a cash
pooling arrangement for all its UK operating companies and endeavours to balance liquidity requirements with achieving a market rate of
return on cash through the use of short-term money market deposits or other term deposits. Appropriate ﬁnancial instruments are used to
mitigate the impact of changes in interest payable in respect of signiﬁcant borrowings. Further details are set out in note 23(e) on page 74.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to maintain a balance of available facilities to fund the Group’s liquidity requirements, further details of which are set out
in note 23(k) on page 76.
The Group has strong operating cash inﬂows and has focused efforts on managing its working capital.
Credit risk
The Group’s policy on credit risk is set out in note 23(j) on page 76.
Relations with shareholders
Communications
The Board considers effective communication with its investors, whether institutional, private or employee shareholders, to be extremely
important.
The Company reports formally twice a year, with the half-year results announcement and the preliminary announcement of the full-year
results. Shareholders are issued with an Interim Report and Accounts in December and with the full-year Report and Accounts in July.
Additionally, as required under Article 6 of the Transparency Directive, the Company will issue an interim management statement during
each half year. These reports are posted on www.anite.com.
The Company makes other announcements from time to time, which can also be found on www.anite.com.
Members of the Board meet institutional investors on a regular basis, providing an opportunity to discuss, in the context of publicly
available information, the progress of the business. Institutional investors and analysts are also invited to attend brieﬁngs by the Company
following the announcements of the annual and interim results.
During the year the Non-Executive Directors met a number of major shareholders individually.
The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are available to shareholders on all matters relating to governance.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will be held on 11 September 2008 at the Company’s registered ofﬁce in Slough. The notice of meeting is sent to
shareholders at least 20 working days before the AGM. The Directors encourage the participation of private shareholders at the AGM, and
are available for questions both formally during the meeting and informally afterwards. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees are normally available to answer questions at the AGM.

Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 as inserted by the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”) and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company
at which the ﬁnancial statements will be presented for approval.
The Regulations require the independent auditors to report to the Company’s shareholders on certain speciﬁed matters and this report
has therefore been split into separate sections for the unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board and comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of
management and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: David Hurst-Brown (Chairman of the Committee); Peter Bertram and
Clay Brendish. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee invites the Executive Directors and other senior managers to attend its meetings as appropriate. The Committee met eight
times during the year. Details of attendance at the meetings are shown in the table in the corporate governance report on page 25.
The principal function of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. It is
also responsible for setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Chief Executive’s direct
reports, and for monitoring and approving all share-based incentive arrangements. The Committee also determines the terms and
conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which are posted on the Company’s website.
Advice and assistance
The Committee uses Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as its professional advisers on executive remuneration and employee share
schemes. Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provide no other services to the Company.
The Company Secretary (who is also the Secretary to the Committee) and the Group Human Resources Director provide the Committee
with information and assistance. The Chief Executive regularly attends Committee meetings to provide his own insights on business
objectives and the individual performance of his direct reports. However, no Director or senior manager is present when their own
remuneration is being speciﬁcally discussed.
Remuneration policy
Main principles
The Company’s objective is to attract, retain and incentivise high-calibre executives who can drive the business forward and increase
shareholder value. To meet this objective, the Company follows three key principles:
> total rewards are designed to be competitive, with the remuneration package of each Executive Director and their direct reports
benchmarked regularly against the market;
> incentive-based rewards are seen as an important part of each Executive Director’s total remuneration and are designed to drive and
reward exceptional performance; and
> long-term incentive arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the
shareholders and to support the Company’s business strategy.
Reward structure
The Executive Directors’ total remuneration packages consist of:
> base salary;
> annual performance bonus;
> long-term incentive arrangements; and
> other beneﬁts and allowances.
The Executive Directors make their own pension arrangements and the Group makes no payment in this respect.
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually and is set with reference to salary levels for similar roles in other comparable companies in the software
and computer services sector and the market generally. The factors for comparability include market sector, size and business complexity.
Management and governance
Remuneration report 29
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
REMUNERATION REPORT Annual performance bonus
As disclosed to shareholders in the 2007 Annual Report, the Company implemented a new Annual Bonus Plan (“the Plan”) for Executive
Directors with effect from 1 May 2007. Under the terms of the Plan, the majority of the bonus (up to 75% of basic salary) is paid for
performance against a sliding scale of challenging Group Proﬁt Before Tax (PBT) growth targets that are agreed by the Committee at the
beginning of the ﬁnancial year. To ensure that true underlying PBT growth is measured, PBT is calculated before net capitalisation of R&D,
fair value write downs, amortisation of acquired business, gains or losses on business disposals, deduction of share-based payments, and
any increase/decrease in provisions related to “legacy” non-operational property matters. This “baseline” PBT may also be adjusted to
reﬂect any movements in average weighted share capital that may have occurred during the ﬁnancial year.
Under the terms of the Plan an additional bonus (up to 25% of basic salary) may be paid on a discretionary basis with reference to
pre-agreed challenging personal objectives.
For the year ended 30 April 2008, the threshold level of baseline PBT growth was not achieved and no bonus was paid under the Plan.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Company operates the following two long-term share-based incentive plans:
> the Performance Share Plan (PSP); and
> the Share Matching Plan (SMP).
Under the PSP an individual may receive an award of shares worth up to 100% of their salary per annum (although in exceptional
circumstances an award of up to 200% of their salary may be made). The awards are made as conditional awards of free shares.
The Executive Directors and a small number of the most senior executives are also able to participate in the SMP. As originally structured,
participants were allowed to lodge in the SMP shares worth up to 30% per annum of base salary, which were then matched on a two-for-
one (gross) basis.
At the 2007 AGM, shareholders approved a change to the investment level under the SMP which was effected as the Committee was keen
to ensure that the most senior executives in the Company were fully aligned with the business at this critical stage in its development.
Pursuant to this change, whilst the effective average annual level of co-investment in the SMP remained unchanged at 30% per annum,
executives were provided with a “one-off” opportunity over the three ﬁnancial years from 1 May 2007 to 30 April 2010 to invest a higher
amount annually (up to 90% of base salary) in the SMP. However, any investment is subject to the effective current overall aggregate limit
of 90% of salary over this three-year period. The original two-for-one gross matching ratio was retained. With effect from 1 May 2010 it is
currently intended that the SMP will revert to the normal 30% per annum investment limit.
Awards granted under the PSP and SMP are subject to three-year performance conditions. The awards made in 2005 and 2006 under both
PSP and SMP were subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition which measures the Company’s TSR performance
against a comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector over a single three-
year performance period commencing on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year in which the award is made. In respect of the PSP and SMP
awards made in 2005 and 2006, a total of 25% of the award will vest if the Company is ranked at the median end of the performance
period, with 100% of the award vesting if the Company is at or above the upper quartile (with straight-line vesting in between).
The performance of the 2005 awards made under the PSP and SMP have been measured against the comparator group for the period ended
30 April 2008 and the result was below median. Therefore none of these awards will vest and the award will lapse on the third anniversary
of grant.
The PSP and SMP awards made in 2007 are subject to the following performance conditions:
> half of awards are subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. This will continue to be measured relative to the FTSE Software and
Computer Services Sector, with the same median to upper quartile vesting schedule as has applied to past awards; and
> half of awards are assessed by reference to Anite’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance. For compound annual EPS growth of at least
RPI plus 4% per annum, 25% of awards subject to this part of the condition will vest, and for full vesting, compound EPS growth must
be at least RPI plus 12% per annum. Straight-line vesting applies between these points.
The EPS ﬁgure used for PSP and SMP measurement in 2007 was 5.2p being basic EPS before amortisation of acquired intangible assets,
gains and losses on the disposal of operations, the effect of net capitalisation/net amortisation on research and development costs, results
from discontinued/disposed operations and share-based payments.
However, before any awards vest, the Committee must have satisﬁed itself that the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance over the
performance period warrants the level of vesting determined by reference to the TSR performance condition. The extent to which the
performance condition is satisﬁed will be calculated by external consultants to ensure the appropriate level of third-party veriﬁcation.
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Management and governance
Remuneration report 30
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The change in performance conditions for the 2007 awards compared to earlier awards was made by the Committee as it believes that,
whilst TSR is an important indicator of shareholder value creation, it is also advisable to focus the Company’s senior executives on driving
Group proﬁtability.
The Committee intends to apply broadly similar performance conditions to any PSP or SMP awards that may be made in the forthcoming year.
The Committee will continue to regularly review the operation of the Company’s share incentive arrangements to ensure that they take due
account of market practice and the particular circumstances of the Company.
TSR performance graph
To provide a further alignment of interest with shareholders, the Executive Directors and others participating in the SMP are required to
retain in shares an amount equal in value to 50% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards until they have built up a shareholding
equal to 100% of base salary.
The Executive Directors also participate in the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan.
The use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under the share plans is subject to a 15% dilution limit in any ten-year
period. The current potential dilution is below this level. The Committee, aware of shareholders’ views in connection with this matter,
continues to take active steps to control the dilutive effect of the Company’s share incentives and is currently working under an informal
dilution limit of 13%. The actual dilution limit is currently 9.6%. However, following the lapse of the 2005 PSP and SMP awards, the dilution
limit will reduce to 8.6%.
Other beneﬁts and allowances
Executive Directors are entitled to a car allowance, fuel, medical insurance, death-in-service and permanent health insurance, together with
reasonable business expenses.
Other share plans
Following the acquisition of Anite Finland Limited on 30 November 2006, the Company introduced a Management Incentive Plan (MIP) for
key employees. The MIP is not available to Executive Directors and all awards are settled using market purchase shares or a cash equivalent.
Further details of the MIP are contained in note 7 on page 59.
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy is that all Executive Directors’ service contracts will be rolling contracts of one year’s duration. The service contracts
of Steve Rowley and Christopher Humphrey were each amended on 9 October 2007. The effect of the amendments in respect of each case
was to limit the obligations of the Company under clause 12.7 (termination of Executive Director’s employment by the Company) to awards
under the Company’s incentive schemes made to the Executive Director after 1 May 2007.
Other than in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct, the provisions of service contracts will be honoured in full. Information regarding
the Executive Directors’ service contracts is summarised in the table below.

Executive Directors are not permitted to hold external non-executive directorships or ofﬁces without the approval of the Board.
No Executive Director received any fees in respect of any external non-executive directorship that they have held during the year.

1 Contractual beneﬁts include the annual performance bonus the Executive Director would have received had he continued to be employed from the date of termination until the
expiry of the notice period.
2 Payments cease, in effect, if the Executive Director commences employment with a new employer during the payment period.
Furthermore, for a period of six months following a change of control in the Company, Steve Rowley may terminate his employment on
28 days’ notice at which point he will be entitled to the same payments as set out in the table above (which, as can be seen, shall not
exceed 12 months’ remuneration).
The Company is aware of the provisions in the Combined Code which state that compensation payments should reﬂect a departing
Director’s obligation to mitigate his loss. However, the Company has adopted the above described approach to determining the
compensation that is payable in the event that an Executive Director’s service contract is terminated as it believes that it is in shareholders’
interests that the obligations of each party in such circumstances are transparent and agreed in advance to provide certainty.
If the Company terminates an Executive Director’s employment without cause, the Remuneration Committee will be asked to exercise any
discretion it has under the terms of any share incentive plans in favour of the departing Executive Director. If the Remuneration Committee
determines not to follow this recommendation, the departing Executive Director shall be entitled to damages.
Non-Executive Directors
Clay Brendish has a three-year term of ofﬁce with six months’ notice of termination required by either party. Peter Bertram and David
Hurst-Brown each have a three-year term of ofﬁce with no notice period or provision for compensation for loss of ofﬁce.
The Board reviews the Independent Non-Executive Directors’ fees annually, in the course of which it compares fees paid to Non-Executive
Directors of comparable companies. Fees recognise the additional responsibilities undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors in chairing the
Board and its Committees. In addition to their fees, the Non-Executive Directors are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The Chairman’s fees are set by the Remuneration Committee. He is not present at any discussion of his own remuneration.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Management and governance
Remuneration report 34
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Membership
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board which comprises the Non-Executive Directors who are independent of management
and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
During the year, membership of the Committee was as follows: Peter Bertram (Chairman); Clay Brendish; and David Hurst-Brown.
Both Peter Bertram and David Hurst-Brown are considered by the Board to be “independent” as deﬁned by Provision A.3.1 of the
Combined Code. Clay Brendish was considered to have met the independence criteria on his appointment as Chairman of the Company
on 4 October 2005.
The Board considers that Mr Bertram has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The Group provides an induction programme for new Audit Committee members.
The Committee invites others, including the external auditors, the Group Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the Chief
Executive, to attend its meetings as appropriate. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee.
Meetings
During the period under review the Committee met three times. Details of attendance at each meeting are shown in the table in the
corporate governance report on page 25.
The Committee meets with the external auditors without any Executive Directors present at least annually and more often if this
is considered appropriate.
Role, responsibilities and terms of reference
The Committee’s role is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for ﬁnancial reporting and internal review.
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
> reviewing the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements and results announcements of the Company, and any other formal
announcements relating to the Company’s ﬁnancial performance;
> reviewing the Company’s accounting policies;
> monitoring and reviewing the Company’s systems of internal control and risk management;
> monitoring and reviewing the Company’s “whistleblowing” procedures;
> monitoring and reviewing the requirement for an internal audit function;
> considering the appointment of the Company’s external auditors, overseeing the process for their selection and making
recommendations to the Board in relation to their appointment; and
> overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, including approval of their remuneration, agreeing the scope of the audit
engagement, assessing their independence, monitoring the provision of non-audit services, and considering their reports on the
Company’s ﬁnancial statements and systems of internal control and risk management.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, which can be found on the Company’s website.
Internal audit
The Committee agreed in July 2006 to create an internal review function, headed by a member of the Group ﬁnance team, who, under the
control of the Audit Committee, carries out a plan of detailed reviews throughout the operating companies. Where additional resource is
required, this is sourced either from an external professional ﬁrm or by selecting divisional staff who carry out peer reviews in divisions other
than their own. This internal review function does not represent an independent internal audit function as deﬁned by professional internal
audit standards, but has been a signiﬁcant enhancement in the Group’s internal control framework.
Independence of external auditors
The Committee keeps under review the relationship with the external auditors including:
> the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, taking into account the relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements
and the relationship with the auditors as a whole, including the provision of non-audit and consulting services; and
> the consideration of audit fees and any fees for non-audit and consulting services.

Report of the Audit Committee 35
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements. The Directors are required to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRS) and have also elected
to prepare ﬁnancial statements for the Company in accordance with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
interpretations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare such ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985
and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each ﬁnancial year the Company’s ﬁnancial position,
ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in
accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
> properly select and apply accounting policies;
> present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
> provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRS is insufﬁcient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Group, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements
of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We conﬁrm to the best of our knowledge:
> the ﬁnancial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole; and
> the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of
the business and the position of the Company and the undertaking included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Management and governance
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 36
Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008 We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Anite plc, for the year ended 30 April 2008 which comprise the Group income
statement, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity, the cash ﬂow statement and the related notes 1 to 30. These Group
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Anite plc company only, for the year ended 30 April 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the Group ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out
in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group ﬁnancial statements
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement of compliance with the Combined Code reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2006 Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group ﬁnancial
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review, the report
of the Directors, the corporate governance report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, and the report of the Audit
Committee. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the Group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group ﬁnancial statements and
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements
made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state
of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 2008 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
> the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation;
> the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985; and
> the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT
for the year ended 30 April 2008 1 StAte meNt o f AccouNtiNg pol icie S
a) General information
Anite plc is a company incorporated in the united Kingdom under the c ompanies Act 1985.the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the
c ompany for the year ended 30 April 2008 comprise the company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “group”). the principal
activities of the com pany and its subsidiaries are described in note 13.th e ﬁnancial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors
on 17July 2008. t he ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the gro up operates.
b) Basis of preparation
t hese consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with international f inancial Reporting Standards (ifRS) adopted
by the european unio n and international fina ncial Reporting interpretations c ommittee (ifRi c) interpretations and those parts of the
c ompanies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under ifRS. th erefore the gr oup ﬁnancial statements comply with Article 4 of
eu iAS regulations.
t he ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial
instruments.
i) Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
t he preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with ifR S requires the use of certain critical accounting assumptions. it also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the gr oup’s accounting policies. th e areas requiring a higher degree of
judgement, or areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, are discussed in the relevant
accounting policies under the following headings:
1 go odwill (note 1(e));
2 intangible assets (note 1(f)(iiand iii));
3 Revenue recognition (note 1(k ));
4 tax ation (note 1(l));
5 employee beneﬁts – share-based compensation (note1(m));and
6 provisions (note 1(p)).
ii) IFRIC Interpretations and amendments/new IFRS
t he ifRi c interpretations and amendments to published standards that are effective in 2008 and those that are not yet effective are
discussed in section 1(t)below.
t he accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
t he transition date for the application of ifRS for the group was 1may 2004.
c) Basis of consolidation
t he gr oup ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial statements of the co mpany and entities controlled by the company, all of which
are made up to 30 April each year. th e results of companies acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from or to the
date on which control passed. c ontrol is achieved where the compa ny has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the ﬁnancial and
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. in assessing control, potential voting rights that presently
are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method. the results of
subsidiaries disposed in the year are included in the consolidated income statement up to the effective date of disposal.
on acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deﬁcit in the
cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income
statement in the period of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those
used by the gr oup. All inter-company transactions and balances between gr oup enterprises are eliminated on consolidation.
d) Foreign currency
tr ansactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange at the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date, are
retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
t he exchange differences arising on retranslation are taken to the income statement, except for exchange differences arising on
non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.

d) Foreign currency continued
th e results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates
ruling at the balance sheet date. exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations
and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the gr oup’s investment in such operations, are recognised directly
in the hedging and translation reserve account (“other reserves”).
Any differences that have arisen since 1may 2004, the date of transition to ifR S, are included in the retained earnings account.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
th e gro up has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to ifRS as
sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
e) Goodwill
g oodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the gro up’s interest in the fair value of the identiﬁable
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
g oodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
on disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included
in determining the proﬁt or loss on disposal or closure.
g oodwill arising prior to the transition to ifRS has been recognised and measured in accordance with uK g AAp, but no longer amortised.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
th e determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the cash-generating
units (cg u) to which goodwill has been allocated. t he value in use calculation includes estimates about the future ﬁnancial performance
of the cash-generating units, including management’s estimates of long-term operating margins and long-term growth rates. the carrying
amount of goodwill and the key assumptions used in the calculation of value in use of cgus to which goodwill is attributed are disclosed
in note 10.
f) Intangible assets
i) Software licences
Software licences are initially measured at cost. cos t includes the purchase price of the assets and the directly attributable costs of bringing
the asset into its intended use. After initial recognition, the intangible asset is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation less any
accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged evenly over the assets’ estimated useful life.
ii) Separately identiﬁable intangible assets arising on business combinations
Separately identiﬁable intangible assets such as customer relations, technology and in process R&D are recognised only when the assets
meet the following conditions:
a) meet the separately identiﬁable criteria below;
b) are controlled by the acquiring company;
c) provide a probable source of future economic beneﬁts; and
d) the fair value can be measured reliably.
th e criteria to be separately identiﬁable are met when the intangible asset:
i) is capable of being separated from the acquired business; and
ii) arises from contractual or legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired company
or other rights and obligations.
th e amortisation period ranges from ﬁve to ten years and is based on equal annual instalments over the assets’ estimated useful life.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
th e assessment of the future economic beneﬁts generated by these separately identiﬁable intangible assets and the determination of its
amortisation proﬁle involve a signiﬁcant degree of judgement based on management estimation of future potential revenue and proﬁt and
the useful life of the assets. Reviews are performed regularly to ensure the recoverability of these intangible assets.

f) Intangible assets continued
iii) Research and development expenditure
expenditure on research activities as deﬁned in ifR S is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
expenditure on internally-generated intangible assets arising from the gr oup’s development activities is recognised only when both
the identiﬁcation and recognition criteria as deﬁned in iAS38 for an intangible asset and the following six criteria are met:
1 the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use has been achieved;
2 the g roup has the intention to complete the asset and use or sell it;
3 the g roup has the ability to use or sell the asset;
4 it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic beneﬁts;
5 adequate technical, ﬁnancial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
6 the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
if these conditions are not met, such development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
t he qualifying expenditure capitalised represents costs directly attributable to the development of the asset. th is expenditure is capitalised
from the point at which the above criteria are met up to the point at which the product is in use. internally-generated intangible assets
including capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives which management estimate to be
no more than three years.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
t he assessment that the internally-generated assets will generate future economic beneﬁts rely on the management’s estimation of
future cash ﬂow streams of these assets. th e technical feasibility of the assets involves a degree of management’s judgement as to when
this is achieved.
management assessment regarding the useful lives of capitalised development costs is based upon the typical product life cycle for similar
assets in the market adjusted by the risks associated with each capitalised development project.
g) Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
l and and buildings, ofﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures and ﬁttings, computer equipment and vehicles are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible ﬁxed assets and freehold properties, at rates calculated to write off the cost over the estimated
useful lives, on a straight-line basis, as follows:
f reehold properties 2% per annum of cost excluding land
Short leasehold properties l ength of lease
of ﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures and ﬁttings 10% to 50% per annum of cost
Vehicles 25% per annum of cost
c omputer equipment 33% per annum of cost
c osts relating to short leasehold properties, ofﬁce equipment and ﬁxtures and ﬁttings and vehicles are included in the “plant, ﬁxtures,
equipment and motor vehicles” category (see note 12).
t he gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the grou p reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are independent from
other assets, the g roup estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Any tangible or intangible
asset with an indeﬁnite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.

h) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill continued
if the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss
is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment
loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
i) Other investments
other investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
j) Inventories and work in progress
inventories and short-term work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. cost s include materials and, where
relevant, direct labour and appropriate overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories and work in progress to their present
location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
k) Revenue recognition
Revenue from sale of software relates mainly to perpetual licences, which provide the customer with the right to use the gr oup’s products.
Where any associated services are not essential to the functionality of the software then the software revenue is recognised when the
following conditions are met:
> persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;
> the compa ny’s fee is ﬁxed or determinable; and
> collection is probable.
Revenue is recognised on delivery with a retention to be recognised on acceptance or otherwise as performance is deﬁned in the relevant
customer contract.
Revenue generated from ﬁxed price contracts, including relevant licence fees where service essential to the functionality of the software
is being performed, is recognised on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the contract. provision is made for any expected losses
on uncompleted contracts. Amounts recoverable on ﬁxed price contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at the net sales value
of the work done less amounts received as progress payments on account. excess progress payments are included in creditors as payments
on account. cu mulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, less provisions for contingencies and anticipated future
losses on contracts, are included as ﬁxed price contract balances in work in progress.
contrac ts which meet the deﬁnition of construction contract, are disclosed separately as “amount due from construction customers”
in “trade and other receivables” or “amount due to construction customers” in “trade and other payables”, as required under iAS 11
“co nstruction c ontracts”. See note 21for more details.
Revenue generated from time and material contracts is recognised in line with when the work is performed.
maintenance revenue is generally recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement, taking into account any free
maintenance periods.
managed services revenue is recognised over the life of the contract. c osts incurred on a contract from third parties, which are directly
related to the contract, are capitalised and recognised over the life of the contract. contract proﬁtability is regularly reviewed and, if
necessary, provision for any forecast loss arising is made. Sales, operational and administrative costs are written off as incurred.
All ﬁnance income is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
th e revenue and proﬁt of ﬁxed price contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract can be
estimated reliably. management exercises judgement in determining whether a contract’s outcome can be estimated reliably. management
also makes estimates of the total cost of professional services, or, in some instances, total contract costs which are used in determining the
value of amounts recoverable on contracts and any related provisions required for onerous contracts. estimates are continually revised
based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008 1 StAte meNt o f AccouNtiNg pol icie S coNti NueD
k) Revenue recognition continued
t he carrying amount of amounts recoverable on contracts is disclosed in note 21.
management has exercised a degree of judgement in formulating a set of criteria used for determining when revenue that involves several
deliverable elements should be recognised on a bundled or unbundled basis.
l) Taxation
t he tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
t he tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. th e liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests
in joint ventures, except where the gro up is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
t he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Accounting assumptions and judgements
in recognising income tax assets and liabilities, management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on
transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. Where the ﬁnal outcome of such matters is different, or expected
to be different, from previous assessments made by management, a change to the carrying value of income tax assets and liabilities will be
recorded in the period in which such a determination is made. th e carrying values of current tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities are
disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet.
m) Employee beneﬁts
i) Retirement beneﬁt costs
payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. payments made to state-managed
retirement beneﬁt schemes are dealt with as payments to deﬁned contribution schemes where the gr oup’s obligations under the schemes
are equivalent to those arising in a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt scheme. the group has no deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
ii) Share-based compensation
t he gr oup has applied the requirements of ifRS 2 “Share-based payments”. in accordance with the transitional provisions, ifRS 2 has been
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1January 2005.
t he gr oup operates several equity-settled share-based payments plans for its employees. the fair value of shares determined at the grant
date of the equity-settled share-based payment is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
t he gr oup operates an inland Revenue approved employee share option scheme (“SAYe scheme”), which allows employees the ability to
purchase the g roup’s ordinary shares at a discount of the current market value. the gro up records an expense, based on its best estimate
of the fair value of the discount related to shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
t he gr oup has granted executive options, which include approved option plans and long-term incentive plans. the grant price is normally
equal to the average quoted market price of the group shares on the date of grant. the vesting period is generally three to ten years. if the
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. furthermo re, options are forfeited if the
employee leaves the gro up before the options vest, unless the employee meets certain “good leaver” conditions.

m) Employee beneﬁts continued
ii) Share-based compensation continued
Accounting assumptions and judgements
th e fair value of the SAYe scheme and executive option scheme is measured by using the Black-Scholes and a stochastic model, namely the
monte-c arlo pricing model, respectively. th e total amount of this fair value to be expensed rateably over the vesting period is determined
by reference to the fair value of the options at the grant date, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (such as proﬁt
targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable
or the number of shares that the employee will ultimately receive. th is estimate is revised at each balance sheet date and the difference is
charged or credited to the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
market vesting conditions such as tSR targets are factored into the fair value of the option and, therefore, no subsequent adjustments will
be made if performance conditions are not met.
th e proceeds received on exercise of the options, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to equity.
for more details on the assumptions made in the valuation, see note 7.
n) Financial instruments
fina ncial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the gro up’s balance sheet when the gro up becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
i) Trade and other debtors
trade and other debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts.
ii) Investments
investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade-date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including
transaction costs.
investments are classiﬁed as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net proﬁt or loss for the
period.
for available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the net
proﬁt or loss for the period.
iii) Financial liabilities and equity
fina ncial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
iv) Bank borrowings
interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. finance charges, including
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the

o) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
t he gr oup’s activities expose it primarily to the ﬁnancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. t he gro up
does not enter into speculative derivative contracts and all such instruments, if used by the group, are for hedging purposes to alter the risk
proﬁle of an existing underlying exposure to the group in line with the gr oup’s risk management policies.
t he use of ﬁnancial derivatives is governed by the group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles
on the use of ﬁnancial derivatives.
Cash ﬂow hedge
ch anges in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ﬂows are recognised
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. if the cash ﬂow hedge of a ﬁrm
commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised,
the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the
asset or liability. for hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the
income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net proﬁt or loss.
Fair value hedge
f or an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in the fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the
risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in proﬁt or loss. gain s or losses from re-measuring the derivative, or for non-derivatives the
foreign currency component of its carrying amount, are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
ch anges in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.
Discontinued hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast
transaction occurs. if a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred
to net proﬁt or loss for the period.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash ﬂow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve; the gain or loss relating
to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
g ains or losses deferred in the foreign currency translation reserve are recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss on disposal of the
foreign operation.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains
or losses reported in the income statement.
p) Provisions
provisions for warranties, onerous contracts, vacant properties with outstanding leases to settle, restructuring costs and legal claims are
recognised when the gro up has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events. this is where, in management’s view,
it is more likely than not that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise unexpired future lease payments, employee termination payments and removal costs. provisions for
restructuring costs are recognised when the group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to
affected parties.
Deferred consideration provision is management’s best estimate of the contingent consideration payable to vendors, which may be subject
to change as this is dependent on the fulﬁlment of certain performance targets of the businesses acquired.
provision is established on a property-by-property basis to meet the estimated liabilities, including dilapidations. the provision covers all
ongoing unavoidable costs net of rental income. provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
q) Operating proﬁt from continuing operations
ope rating proﬁt from continuing operations is stated after charging restructuring costs but before ﬁnance income or charges and before
gains or losses relating to disposed businesses.

r) Leasing
le ases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the gro up at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. th e corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as
a ﬁnance lease obligation. l ease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. f inance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are
directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the group’s general policy on borrowing costs
(see above).
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
s) Assets and disposal groups held for sale
Assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than
through continuing use. thi s condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available
for immediate sale in its present condition.
management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from
the date of classiﬁcation.
Assets and disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of the assets’ previous carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell.
t) Adoption of IFRIC Interpretations, new and amendments to IFRS

At the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements, the following standards, interpretations and amendments thereto were issued that are

2.2 Telecoms restructuring costs
in the absence of acceptable alternatives being available in the marketplace, Anite had pursued a strategy of developing its own in-house
hardware platform, Nevis, in respect of the lte standard. on 12November 2007 , Anite Wireless announced a strategic partnership with
Agilent tec hnologies to deliver test solutions for the design of next generation mobile communications products conforming to the new
3gpp lon g term evolution (l te) standard. th e new strategic partnership with Agilent tec hnologies will enhance development of best of
breed solutions, making a clear business case for Anite to cease its in-house development.
in addition, a restructuring of the Wireless handset testing business has taken place, resulting in management changes and a reduction
in the overall workforce.
t he impact of asset writedowns and cash settlement of exiting the current Nevis own-platform development and costs incurred as a result
of restructuring the business were £3.3m as set out below:
Note £000
impairment of inventories 298
impairment of property, plant and equipment 12 443
impairment of capitalised Nevis development costs 11 475
Redundancy costs – development 309
oth er exit costs including inventory commitments 949
c ost of existing Nevis development 2.7 2,474
oth er restructuring/redundancy costs 2.7 854
2.7 3,328
t he analysis of the above restructuring costs is between research and development costs (£2,47 4,000) and administrative expenses
(£854,000), as disclosed in note 2.7.
2.3 Business segments – primary basis
t he gr oup is organised into three business segments: Wireless, public Sector and travel.
t hese three business segments are the group’s primary reporting format for segment information. During the period, Anite Deutschland
management gm bH and its subsidiaries (“Anite Deutschland”), the last remaining part of the international consult ancy operation was sold.
its results are included as a discontinued operation and details are disclosed in note 3.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those than can be allocated on a reasonable
basis. un allocated items comprise several income-earning assets, interest-bearing loans, corporate assets and liabilities and expenses.

† expected life for other share-based payments is 100% of the options that are exercised after three years if a gain of 10% is available. if this gain is not available, options are held
until such a gain can be achieved. Any remaining options are exercised at maturity providing that they are “in the money”. for l tip(pr oﬁt element only) – 5% p.a. leavers in the

annual vesting is possible.
expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the c ompany’s share price over the following periods (expected life)
up to grant date: other share-based schemes – three years and SAYe three, four and ﬁve years for three, four and ﬁve year contracts respectively.
t he period of exceptional volatility for the period from 30 September 1999 to 24 July 2002 was removed from the volatility calculations.
t he expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise
restrictions and behavioural considerations.

1April 2008, being the standard rate for u K corporation tax, as the gr oup’s head ofﬁce is in uK .
Some components of the g roup’s overseas proﬁts are likely to be taxed at an effective rate that is higher than the uK rate. other components,
due to the availability of losses brought forward in certain countries, are likely to be taxed at a lower rate.

g oodwill is subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
t he recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (c gu ) are determined from value in use calculations or management’s review of the
recoverable amount. the cgu is typically the combination of a group of assets acquired which cannot be separately identiﬁed, within each
primary segment of the gro up. the key assumptions for these calculations are as follows:
> discount rate – the pre-tax rate used to discount the operating proﬁt projections was in the range of 10%-10.6%,which reﬂects
management’s views of the market risk of the cgu; and
> operating proﬁt projections for the years 2009-2011are derived from recently approved budgets, three year strategic plans,
management’s view of the recoverable amount based on observable market prices for the cgu and have assumed the terminal growth
rate after 2011to be zero.

t he amounts presented in the table above are net of provision for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses.
t he gr oup’s policy is to ensure that all credit trade customers are subject to credit veriﬁcation procedures and where appropriate, parent
guarantee and letter of credit especially for overseas customers are used so that the gr oup is exposed to a minimum level of bad debts.
t he credit risk for trade receivables by business segments for 2008 and 2007 is as follows:
in trav el, the top four customers represent 9% (2007: 5%) of the gr oup’s trade receivables.
in te lecoms, the top four customers represent 7% (2007: (3%) of the gr oup’s trade receivables.
in public Sector, the customers are government bodies in uK, North America and Australia, which have low credit risks.
ove rall, the g roup has no customer that accounted for more than 5% or more of the accounts receivable at 30 April 2008 and 2007
and, therefore, there is no signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated counterparties.
t he average credit period for trade receivables is 54 days. in the unite d Kingdom trade receivables are typically on 30 days’ credit terms
whilst, in certain cases, a schedule of payments or extended payments have been agreed. interest may be charged on any outstanding
balance that is 30 days overdue. At 30 April 2008 and 2007, the trade receivables were non-interest bearing.

Cash ﬂow hedges – interest rate swaps and caps
t he gr oup uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
At 30 April 2008, the interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts totalling £20m (2007: £20m) have ﬁxed interest rate payments at
an average rate of 5.535% and have ﬂoating interest receipts at l iBoR rate for periods up until 31oc tober 2011.At 30 April 2008, the
details of the interest rate caps contracts were as follows:
f or a notional principal amount of £5m (2007: £5m) interest rates are capped at 6.25% for periods up until 31January 2009.
t he fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps as shown above are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet
date. All these interest rate swaps and caps are designated and effective as cash ﬂow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred
in equity. th e net amount of the swaps and caps that has been expensed against hedged interest payments made in the period is £3,000
(2007: less than £300).

Net investment hedges – cross currency swaps
th e gro up has overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Northern europe and Asia paciﬁc and whose revenues and
expenses are denominated in their local currencies. t he group has hedged part of its net investment in overseas subsidiaries through natural
hedges and utilisation of cross currency swaps.
At the balance sheet date, the currency split of the mark-to-market values of cross currency swaps, including the exchange of principals
was €136.6m (£109.5m) (2007: €138.4m (£94.6m)) and £92.2m (2007: £92.8m). the ﬁxed interest rates on these cross currency swaps,
range from 4.64% to 5.19%(2007: 3.83% to 5.22%) and the ﬂoating interest rates are based on liBoR (sterling) and euRiBoR (euro).
th ese cross-currency swaps were used to hedge the euro-denominated net investment of Wireless Nemo.
th e fair value change on the cross currency swaps which is approximately 99% effective against the hedged item is recognised in the foreign
currency/hedging reserve. An amount of £43,000 (2007: nil) of ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement during the year.

d) Financial risk management
t he g roup’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities mainly comprise bank borrowings, some cash and liquid resources, derivative ﬁnancial instruments,
deferred consideration for acquisitions and various items, such as trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
t he main risks arising from the grou p’s ﬁnancial instruments are market risk (primarily exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign
currency risks), liquidity risk and credit risk. the Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
e) Market risk – interest rate
t he gr oup ﬁnances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves, bank borrowings and new equity and this policy is
reviewed from time to time. the gro up borrows in the desired currencies at ﬂoating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk
by selectively using interest rate swaps and caps. Any surplus cash is converted into sterling and is invested in short-term money market
and bank deposits at the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return.
t he ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the gr oup to interest rate risk are as follows.
i) Cash and equivalents (note 17). th e weighted average ﬂoating interest rate for these ﬁnancial assets which were based on liBoR
or equivalent market rates, ﬁxed for periods up to three months was 5.5% (2007: 4.9%) and the euro interest rate was 4.1% (2007: 3.3%).
ii) Bank borrowings (note 19). th e weighted average ﬂoating interest rate for bank borrowings was 6.57% (2007: 6.2%). thi s is linked
to l iBoR plus a margin for bank loans. th e margin varies between 0.60% and 1.05% dependent on the ratio of net debt to eBitDA,
reviewed annually.
t he interest rate on the overdraft is based on 1% per annum over the Bank’s base rate for its sterling accounts and 1%per annum over the
bank’s relevant short-term offered rate for any other currency accounts.
iii) Interest rate swap and caps. these derivatives are used to manage the gro up’s exposure to interest risk on its bank borrowings above.
See note 22 for details of the interest rate.
iv) Cross currency swaps. t hese derivatives were used to hedge the net investment of an overseas subsidiary. See note 22 for details of the
interest rate.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
t he sensitivity analyses below have been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, both
including derivative instruments, as listed above at balance sheet date and adjustments have been made particularly where some of the
signiﬁcant derivatives only existed for part of the year.
With all other variables held constant, the table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1%change in interest rates applied to the major
currencies of net variable rate assets/liabilities. 1% is the sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonably
possibly change in interest rates.

f) Market risk – Foreign currency
th e gro up has overseas subsidiaries and branches which operate mainly in North America, Northern europe and Asia paciﬁc and whose
revenues and expenses are denominated in their local currencies. th e gro up currently partly hedges its investment in overseas subsidiaries
through ﬁnancial instruments and natural hedges.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
th e sensitivity analyses below is based on a 10% appreciation/depreciation of the euro and uS dollar against sterling, applied to the net
monetary assets or liabilities of the gro up that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.

10% appreciation KH 136 KQP 91 I,OHP 1,850
10% depreciation (J M) (111) (KJN) (75) (I, LHM) (1,514)
in management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is based on the monetary assets and liabilities at reporting date and, therefore, does not
fully reﬂect the exposure during the year. uS denominated sales/purchases were higher in the last month, which resulted in higher uS dollar
net assets at the year end.
With all other variables held constant, the effect of a 10% depreciation and appreciation of the euro against sterling applied to the euro-leg
liability of the cross currency swaps of £109.7m (2007: £94.6m) will be a gain (after tax) of £7.2m (2007: £6.2m) and a loss (after tax) of
£8.8m (2007: £7.6m) in the other/forex reserve, respectively. th ese swaps are after-tax net investment hedges (note 22) and therefore we
expect this gain and loss to be nearly 100% offset by an equal and opposite amount of foreign exchange arising on the translation of the
euro-denominated net investment of Wireless-Nemo.
g) Other price risks
th e gro up is not exposed to other price risks apart from interest rate and foreign exchange risk, disclosed above.
h) Forward foreign exchange contracts
Anite’s strategy is to hedge a proportion of the forecast future cash ﬂows for a period of three to ﬁve months, creating a cash ﬂow
movement to offset the translational movement. th e proportion of forecast cash ﬂows that will be hedged is reviewed periodically in the
light of experience.
At 30 April 2008 (2007: £nil), the grou p had the following outstanding forward contracts to sell uS dollars and receive sterling:

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 22 IK 121
tr ade receivables 15 LH, QLJ 45,579
O H, KJQ 64,365
t he credit risk on cash and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated ﬁnancial
institutions.
t he gr oup’s policy to mitigate potential credit risks and the concentration of credit risks of trade receivables are detailed in note 15– trade
and other receivables.
k) Liquidity risk
t he gr oup’s objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank
syndicated facilities.
t he gr oup’s uK overdraft facility was renewed during the year and agreed at £10m (net). the amount drawn down under these facilities
at 30 April 2008 and 2007 was £nil.
t he gr oup entered into a new ﬁve-year syndicated facility on 31octo ber 2006 which was underwritten in full by llo yds tSB Bank plc. this
facility consists of a term loan of £50m repayable at £5m per annum until 30 November 2010, with the balance due on 30 November 2011,
and a revolving credit facility of £40m. th e amount of undrawn facilities, at 30 April 2008 was £40m (2007: £40m) and total undrawn
facilities including the overdraft facility was £50m (2007: £50m). the revolving credit facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.
t his facility is available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes for the gro up including working capital requirements.

Deferred tax assets in respect of future goodwill amortisation and losses carried forward in certain companies have not been recognised
because at present it is not envisaged that there will be sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts in those companies from which future reversal of these
reliefs can be deducted. the unutilised reliefs may be carried forward indeﬁnitely.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings
of certain overseas subsidiaries. No provision is required since the gr oup is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these
differences and either it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or no tax is payable on the reversal.

is no commitment to dispose of the replacement assets. the reduction in the year was due to the decrease in the uK corporation rate.

Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
FIVE7YEARSUMMARY We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Anite plc, for the year ended 30 April 2008 which comprise the Company
balance sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity, the Company cash ﬂow statement and the related notes 1to 17 . These parent
company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements of Anite plc. for the year ended 30 April 2008 and on the information in the
Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent
company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether
in our opinion the information given in the report of the Directors is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the ﬁnancial review,
the report of the Directors, the corporate governance report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, and the report
of the Audit Committee. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside
the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company ﬁnancial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the
parent company ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union,
of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2008;
> the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
> the information given in the report of the Directors is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT
for the year ended 30 April 2008 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a) Basis of preparation
Anite plc has presented separate ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as permitted
by the Companies Act 1985.
The Company has taken the exemption from section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985from preparing the income statement and related
notes when the Group’s consolidated income statement has been presented.
b) Accounting policies
The accounting policies as set out below and in note 1to the Group ﬁnancial statements have been applied in the preparation of these
Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
i) Investments
Investments held are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
c) Restatement – prior year adjustment
The Company has implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with its subsidiary
undertakings under IFRS 2, whereby the Company has granted the rights of its shares to the employees of its subsidiary undertakings under
an equity-settled arrangement and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed to the Company for these rights. Under this arrangement, the
Company should treat the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiary’s accounts as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credit
equity with an amount equal to the share-based payments recognised by these subsidiaries in their accounts. As a result, the Company has
recognised cost of investment (note 4) equal to the share-based payments for 2007 (£978,000) and 2008 (£1,081,0 00) and credited equity
with the same amount (see the statement of changes in equity). The cost for 2007 was treated as a prior year adjustment as a result of
reﬂecting the effects in the change in the policy.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008 17 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
d) Financial risk management
The Company’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities mainly comprise cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables
and payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Company’s ﬁnancial instruments are market risk (primarily exposure to changes in the interest rate and
foreign currency risks), liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are
summarised below.
e) Market risk – interest rate
The Group ﬁnances its operations and acquisitions through a mixture of reserves, bank borrowings and new equity and this policy is
reviewed from time to time. The Group borrows in the desired currencies at ﬂoating rates of interest and manages the interest rate risk
by selectively using interest rate swaps and caps. Any surplus cash is converted into sterling and is invested in short-term money market
and bank deposits at the prevailing rates of interest in order to achieve the market rate of return.
The ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that are interest-bearing and expose the Company to interest rate risk are as follows:
i) Cash and cash equivalents (note 8). The weighted average ﬂoating interest rate for these ﬁnancial assets which were based on the
sterling LIBOR or equivalent market rates, ﬁxed for periods up to three months was 5.5% (2007: 4.9%); the euro interest rate was 4.1%
(2007: 3.3%).
ii) Interest bearing intercompany debtors and creditors. The weighted average of these interest rates (net) are 6% (2007: 5%). These rates
are linked to LIBOR plus margin. The margin is 0.85% as stipulated in the loan agreement.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined, based on the exposure to interest rates for both ﬁnancial assets and liabilities,
both including derivative instruments, as listed above at balance sheet date.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, applied to the major
currencies of net variable rate assets/liabilities. 1% is the sensitivity rate represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possibly
change in interest rates.

f) Market risk – foreign currency
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The table below shows the Company’s currency exposures in the proﬁt and loss account arising from the monetary assets and monetary
liabilities of the Company that are not denominated in sterling, its functional currency. The sensitivity analyses below is based on a 10%
appreciation/depreciation of euro against sterling, applied to the net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in this currency at reporting
date. The sensitivity analysis includes amounts owed by the Group undertakings.

£000 £000
Proﬁt before tax – gain/(loss)
10% depreciation K,HH K 2,146
10% appreciation (K,N OH) (2,622)
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is based on the monetary assets and liabilities at reporting date, and it therefore does not
fully reﬂect the exposure during the year. A euro-denominated cash amount of €12.2m(£9.6m) was transferred from a subsidiary at 30 April
2008 which results in a higher euro cash balance.
g) Other price risks
The Group is not exposed to other price risks apart from interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
h) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a ﬁnancial loss to the Group.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk are as follows:
2008 2007
Note £000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents 8 KH, J IQ 17,837
Trade receivables 6 I LH 29
Amounts owed by Group undertakings LH,MIH 59,222
O H, PNQ 77,088
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because the counterparties to these assets are highly rated ﬁnancial institutions.
The trade receivables are amounts recoverable from the suppliers. Since the year end, £100,000 was recovered.
The amounts presented in the table above are net of allowances for doubtful recoverability and foreseeable losses.
The table below shows the movements in the provision for impairment of amounts owed by Group undertakings:

The credit quality of those debts owed by Group undertakings that are past due but not impaired has been assessed at the reporting date
and has not signiﬁcantly changed. There is no reason why these amounts will not be recovered in due course.
j) Liquidity risk
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance and continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank
syndicated facilities. Working capital requirements are mainly funded through dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings.
The Group’s UK overdraft facility was renewed during the year and agreed at £10m (net). The amount drawn down under these facilities
at 30 April 2008 and 2007 was £nil.
The Company is a guarantor of Anite plc’s overdraft and syndicated revolving credit facilities of £95m (2007: £100m) of which £50m
(2007: £50m) was undrawn at 30 April 2008. The Company is also a party to an unlimited omnibus set-off arrangement to secure
the liability of the Company and certain group companies with Lloyds TSB Bank Plc.

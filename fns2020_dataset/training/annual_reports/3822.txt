Chairman’s statement 
A positive year for our Company
Greg Lock, Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report a positive year for 
our Company with good progress on 
many fronts for Computacenter. 
Revenue grew 5.4 per cent to a record high 
of £3.072 billion, our adjusted* profit before 
tax was a solid £81.7 million and our strong 
consistent cash generation enabled us 
to make a special return of approximately 
£75 million to our shareholders, in addition 
to regular dividends.
We did not, however, meet our plan in 
France and were disappointed with our 
performance there. While business 
conditions in that country were challenging, 
most of the problems were of our own 
making. We took too long to implement 
the Group ERP system and this resulted 
in logistics issues that have depressed 
our profit and temporarily increased our 
working capital requirements which have,  
in turn, negatively impacted our cash 
position in the short term. 
We managed to stabilise our problem 
contracts in Germany and reengineered 
our processes and organisation there. As a 
result, our German business has performed 
well in 2013, and it is now better positioned 
for the future. In the UK, the business was 
strong in both product sales and Services 
revenues and profit, and we were pleased 
with our progress across all fronts. 
All of this added up to healthy revenue 
growth and solid profit for the Group as 
a whole. 
The implementation of our Group 
Operating Model in the UK and Germany is 
substantially complete and we expect solid 
progress from our businesses in each of 
these countries during 2014. The changes 
in management and organisation we are 
making in France will not deliver much profit 
improvement in the coming year, but we are 
determined to focus on the long term.
We have no borrowings, strong cash flow 
and healthy customer relationships in all 
aspects of our business and we face the 
future with confidence in our strategy  
and in our operational capability. Where  
we have stumbled we have reacted 
vigorously to improve our performance  
and our long-term prospects.
I take this opportunity to thank our 
customers for their confidence in us and 
the business they have given us, and our 
employees for their skills, development 
and performance.
I trust you will find the above summary and 
the details which follow to be fair, balanced 
and understandable.

03 Chief Executive’s strategy review 
Building a strong platform
Mike Norris, Chief Executive
For the Executive Management at 
Computacenter, 2013 has been about 
three main priorities. All of them relate to 
our aim of building a strong platform for 
our business.
It is a strong platform that will allow us 
to deliver consistently for our customers 
and ensure that we remain in a position to 
respond to the current and future needs 
of their businesses.
Firstly, we have taken action to ensure that 
we have in place appropriate governance 
processes and procedures, so that the 
Services we provide to our customers 
adhere to our Group standards of quality 
and reliability no matter where from, or by 
whom within the Group, those Services 
are delivered. With this in mind, you will see 
reference within the following pages to the 
implementation of our Group Operating 
Model. We believe that this is fundamental 
to the development of our business and 
the achievement of our strategic objectives 
as we look to pursue medium term 
Services growth. The background to, and 
operation of, this model is explained in  
more detail on pages 10 and 11 of this 
strategy review by our Chief Operating 
Officer, Chris Webb.
I am pleased to inform you that the impact 
of the model on our German business, 
since its implementation in January 2013, 
has been very positive. We look forward 
to its full implementation within our French 
business over the coming few months. 
We have additionally carried out an 
extensive strategy review process, and our 
current shareholders that received our 2012 
Annual Report and Accounts will notice that 
the Group’s strategic objectives have been 
modified as a result. As is explained on 
page 19, we will continue to invest in our 
technical capability and scale to allow us 
to achieve these updated objectives.
Finally, although 2013 has been a year  
of good underlying business performance 
by the Group, it has also required some 
tough decisions to be made by the 
Group that have impacted our short-term 
profitability. However, we are confident 
that these decisions will allow us to 
provide additional value for our 
shareholders over the medium term.
We hope to receive your support at the 
Company’s 2014 Annual General Meeting.

Our strategy  
Delivering against the plan
To lead with and grow our  
Services business
What we achieved in 2013
In 2013, we saw a 6.3 per cent Services 
revenue growth across the Group on an  
as reported basis, and 3.7 per cent 
Services revenue growth in constant 
currency. Our two lead indicators in this 
area are our Contractual Services base 
growth and our project pipeline. In respect 
of the former, the UK business continues 
to grow well in excess of overall market 
growth, in part due to our ability to win 
second generation or third generation 
outsourcing contracts. Whilst the rate of 
Contractual Services growth in 2013 has 
not matched the levels seen in 2011 and 
2012, we have nonetheless been pleased 
with our performance. In Germany, in 2012 
and the first half of 2013, we curtailed our 
business marketing activities and restricted 
our bidding efforts to those opportunities 
which we perceived to have an attractive 
risk profile. However, following the success 
we have seen with new contracts on-
boarded in 2013 by our German business 
in accordance with our Group Operating 
Model, we have now started to increase 
our efforts to win new business again.  
The Services offering of our French 
business is not as mature as that in the  
UK or Germany, but in 2013 we have 
managed to secure the largest Services 
contract ever entered into by the Group,  
for a customer with its head office located 
in France. The bidding process for this 
contract was carried out in accordance  
with our Group governance procedures, 
and we will use our Group subsidiaries  
and our global partners to deliver the 
relevant Services to the customer. 
We have continued to invest in the 
footprint and capability offered by our 
Services business, opening new Services 
Desks in Hungary and Malaysia, and 
increasing our capacity in Berlin, Milton 
Keynes and Barcelona. 
Our remote management capability of our 
customers’ assets has been enhanced with 
increased capacity and advanced tooling. 
What we intend to do in 2014
We believe that we are seeing the early 
signs of recovery within the macro-
economies of our two principal operating 
countries, the UK and Germany. Whilst it 
remains to be seen whether this can be 
sustained, with our Group Operating Model 
now firmly embedded within both 
businesses, we are in a position to 
capitalise on any IT Services investment 
growth within our target markets. In France, 
the most important task is on-boarding  
the large contract won in 2013, not least 
because it provides us with a referencing 
opportunity, which will be key to the 
generation of new customers as we 
transition our French business to be more 
Services-focused in the medium term. 
Whilst this will be no easy task given the 
current market positioning of our French 
subsidiary, it is a task that Group Executive 
Management is wholly committed to 
completing. As part of this transition, we 
are planning to offer another major Service 
Desk location this year to enhance our 
IT Services French language capability.

06 Computacenter plc 
Enabling IT Users 
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013 2 3 4
To improve our Services 
productivity and enhance  
our competitiveness
What we achieved in 2013
As a result of our three-year UK 
industrialisation programme, we were able 
to bring and develop our productivity model 
and measures across our scale-shared 
Services engines. This resulted not only in 
a constant and hugely successful Service 
delivery into our customers, but also a 
series of competitive price points which 
underpinned our Services renewals and 
wins during the year.
We believe that 2013 has seen a significant 
improvement in our processes for bidding 
and on-boarding our Services business 
within our German subsidiary, following the 
implementation of our Group Operating 
Model early in the year. We have been 
pleased with the results we have seen 
so far in respect of those contracts 
on-boarded in Germany in accordance 
with the model during the year.
What we intend to do in 2014
The same measures and models that 
have been used successfully within our UK 
business will be applied within our German 
and French operating subsidiaries. This will 
be facilitated by the continuing refinement 
of the use of our Group Operating Model 
in Germany and the introduction of the 
model to our French business early in 
2014. The presence and input of our 
senior management team, along with 
the implementation of our revised bidding 
process, should drive and increase our win 
ratios in each country, whilst ensuring that 
we are fully capable of delivering the Service 
that we agree to provide to our customers.
To retain and maximise the 
relationship with our customers 
over the long term
What we achieved in 2013
Computacenter remains focused on large 
and medium-sized enterprise and corporate 
customers headquartered in Western Europe, 
supporting their needs in their local markets, 
and globally , where appropriate. The key to  
our development as a business is being  
able to attract these customers through our 
best-in-class Services capabilities, and then 
delivering a portfolio of Services and Solutions 
to them. We recognise that whilst it is vital to 
generate new Services business, it is just as 
important to us to ensure that we maintain  
our existing relationships to reduce our 
average cost expended to generate Services 
engagements, which is lower when through 
repeat business. Nowhere has our 
commitment to deliver on the promises  
that we make to our customers been more 
evident than in 2013 within our German 
Managed Services business. On our three 
onerous contracts we have prioritised our 
relationship with the customer and the delivery 
of customer satisfaction, both of which are key 
to the sustainability of our business model, 
over the short-term profitability of the business. 
Our achievement of this objective, or otherwise, 
can be measured in a number of different 
ways. However , the simple metric that the 
Group uses is the number of customers where 
the Group generates more than £1 million 
of contribution from across our portfolio. 
The retention by our UK business of its 
number one ranking within KPMG’ s UK 
Outsourcing Service Provider Performance 
and Satisfaction Survey was an important 
achievement within the context of this strategic 
objective. The uncompromising approach of 
our UK business to the achievement of 
customer satisfaction was also evidenced by 
its joint top ranking within a study , carried out 
by the Whitelane Research Group, measuring 
the performance of 24 outsourcing providers 
in the UK and 700 UK IT outsourcing 
contracts worth £15 billion in total.
What we intend to do in 2014
Whilst it is always our ambition to retain our 
clients over the long term, we recognise that 
the spending patterns of our customers can 
go up and down on projects that they deploy 
within their organisations. Our target in 2014 
is to increase the number of customers that 
are found within our target markets where 
contribution is greater than £1 million, by 
adding both new clients, as well as increasing 
the range of Services and Solutions that we 
sell to our existing customers.
To innovate our Services 
offerings to build future 
growth opportunities
What we achieved in 2013
In 2013, we carried out a comprehensive 
review of our strategy. This included a 
review of our current Services offerings 
and how our capabilities will need to 
develop in order to meet the future needs 
of our customers. This also included 
analysis of how these will be impacted 
by new technologies and in particular 
developments in social media, mobility, 
analytics and cloud. We believe that these 
areas, amongst others, present incremental 
growth opportunities for Computacenter. 
Our customers, the IT departments of 
enterprise and corporate organisations 
across Western Europe, are under 
increasing pressure from their IT user 
communities to enhance and consumerise 
their experience, and we will continue to 
develop our offerings to ensure that we 
remain relevant to, and can respond 
appropriately to, the needs of these 
departments that arise as a result. 
What we intend to do in 2014
Broadly speaking, our priorities during 
2014 will be three-fold. Firstly, to enhance 
our Service desk experience, enabling our 
customers to self-serve and automate their 
request and support environment. We will 
also attempt to enable and enhance the 
mobile experience of IT users within 
our customers. Finally, we will extend 
our offerings into additional Western 
European countries.

Chris Webb, 
Group Chief Operating Officer
Customers ask us for a Service
Every customer has an assigned account 
manager and will often have a Service 
manager. These customer management 
teams are run in-country in order to 
achieve the greatest level of customer 
proximity possible. Our aim is to partner 
with the customer’s Information Services 
Department in enabling the overall business 
objectives of the company they work for.
The in-country teams represent 
the customer’s needs and wants 
into the Group Services functions
Group Services are those Services 
which we have industrialised to provide  
cost effective and repeatable outcomes.  
They range from (i) Supply Chain Services,  
such as Product Supply and Configuration, 
through to (ii) Professional Services, such 
as Project Management and additionally 
Engineering, Installation and Maintenance, 
and (iii) Managed Services, such as Service 
Desk, Remote Infrastructure Management 
and Outsourcing.
The Group Service teams advise 
on our ability to meet the customer 
requirement and price point before 
formally signing off our commitment  
to fulfil their need
For all large contracts, Group Legal  
provide a contracting and legal Service. 
This overall sign-off process allows us to 
apply a highly-effective formal governance 
procedure to deal with the challenge of 
meeting our customers’ varied needs. 
The industrialised Service ‘engines’ 
provide the Service to the customer
These engines are operated as shared 
teams generally, but customers will on 
occasion request to have a dedicated team.
The customer is able to access all 
of Computacenter’s resources, offers, 
best practices and experience through 
their account teams and Service 
management teams
The account team manage overall 
relationship and commercial arrangements 
with the customer, and the Service 
management team manage the overall  
Service delivery.
Receipt of Service
The customer receives industry-leading, 
cost-effective, reference-able IS support.
Overall
All of Computacenter’s teams combine 
to work together to deliver the industry’s 
number one customer satisfaction Service.
Following a successful 
industrialisation programme run 
in the UK from 2009 to 2012, 
the Group Operating Model was 
officially created in September 
2012 in readiness to be rolled out 
into Computacenter in Germany 
during 2013. It is being introduced  
to Computacenter in France in 2014.
By combining, centralising and 
standardising as much Service 
provision into our shared Group 
Services engines as possible, 
we are able to drive attractive 
economies of scale and apply 
formal governance. We also 
create the opportunity to improve 
and drive best practices, as well 
as lessons learnt.
A practical example of the Group 
Operating Model is our business  
take-on process. We have a 
five-stage gateway controlled process 
which ensures that at each stage we, 
and the customer , are in control and 
ahead of the dependencies a 
successful take-on requires. Using 
this process, we have been able to 
complete 25 successful take-ons in 
the UK and arrest the take-on issues 
we suffered in Germany in 2012.
As most of our customer service is 
provisioned out of our centralised 
Group Service teams, the in-country 
teams are able to focus on staying 
informed and often ahead of our 
customers’ changing business 
IS priorities. They are also able 
to spend time and focus on 
attracting new customers.

Our risk management approach
The Board of Directors is responsible for 
reviewing and monitoring the Company’s 
risk management process and internal 
control systems. The Board has considered 
the nature and extent of the risks it is  
willing to take in pursuit of the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
Our risk appetite 
We have a healthy risk appetite where 
we understand the risks based on our 
experience in, and knowledge of, our 
business. Conversely, we have a low 
appetite for risk where we have less 
knowledge, experience and understanding 
of the accompanying exposures. 
We balance risk appetite with opportunities for 
further business development, and long-term 
customer satisfaction. Our risk appetite is 
managed through the Matters Reserved  
for the Board and related operational 
governance documents. This is an intrinsic 
part of our risk management approach. 
Our overall aim is to embed and evolve risk 
management to support the achievement 
of our strategic objectives.
The annual risk identification and 
assessment process is integrated with the 
strategic planning process. The process 
starts with the Board setting the strategic 
objectives for the Group. The Board and the 
Group Executive Committee then consider 
the barriers to achieving the strategic 
objectives and, in turn, assess the level of 
risk in the context of our defined risk 
appetite. This top-down key risk assessment 
process is linked through the Group Risk 
Committee to a Group-wide, bottom-up 
business risk assessment process. There is 
clear linkage between the two approaches, 
with the bottom-up risks mapping to a risk 
appearing on the top-down Group Risk 
Log. The risk management framework is 
shown on the page opposite.
The principal risks are subject to robust 
challenge on the effectiveness of the 
mitigations and safeguards. This challenge 
is delivered at the highest level through the 
Group Risk Committee which is comprised 
of senior management and Country Heads. 
On a cyclical basis, a selection of principal 
risks is considered at each meeting of the 
Group Risk Committee to ensure complete 
coverage annually. For each principal 
risk under consideration, the risk owner 
presents on the risk, the potential customer 
and internal impacts, the mitigations, what 
has changed and is changing, triggers, and 
key metrics. The Group Risk Committee 
challenges what has been presented and 
collectively agrees an assessment of the 
status of the risk and the mitigations.
The minutes from the Group Risk 
Committee, along with the current status 
of each principal risk, are reported to the 
Audit Committee and to the Board. From 
2014 going forward, at each Board meeting 
following a quarterly Group Risk Committee 
meeting, there is a Board agenda item to 
discuss, for each principal risk covered, 
the effectiveness of the mitigations and 
safeguards, the level of challenge applied, 
and whether the management assessment 
of the current status remains appropriate.
Our strategic objectives and  
principal risks
1. To lead with and grow our  
Services business
We will grow the level of our Services 
offerings, which we provide to large and 
medium-sized international enterprises 
which are headquartered in Western 
Europe, and will serve these enterprises in 
their home markets and globally.
2. To improve our Services productivity 
and enhance our competitiveness
We will continue to reduce our costs  
and increase the efficiency of our Services 
operations through the industrialisation  
of our processes and the development  
of our tools to increase productivity.
3. To retain and maximise the 
relationship with our customers 
over the long term
While we will lead with our Services 
offerings, we will develop: (i) the 
relationships we have with our Vendor 
Partners and, (ii) the ability of our people  
to ensure that our customers are aware  
of, and have access to, the full range of 
capabilities that we can provide them with. 
We will also aim to develop our reference-
ability and repeat business through  
the achievement of high levels of  
customer satisfaction.
4. To innovate our Services offerings 
to build future growth opportunities
We will continue to adapt our Services 
offerings to meet the requirements 
of our customers as they are driven by 
changes in the deployment and use 
of technology.
The risk identification and assessment 
process gave rise to 13 principal risks this 
year, which make up our formal Group Risk 
Log. This is set out on pages 14 and 15 of 
this report. Our principal risks continue to 
be concentrated around the availability 
and resilience of systems, our people, 
our cost base, technology change, and in 
the design, take-on, and running of large 
Services contracts.
The likelihood and impact of our principal 
risks are shown on the heat map below, with 
the highest likelihood and highest impact 
risks sitting in the upper right section, and 
the lowest likelihood and lowest impact 
risks sitting in the lower left section.

Performance review
Group
 
Turnover and Adjusted Profitability
2013 was a year of good progress for the 
Group, notwithstanding our disappointing 
business performance in France. The 
results outlined in this section include only 
one very small acquisition by our Belgian 
business at the end of 2012, and thus 
comparatives excluding acquisitions are 
not shown.
Total revenue increased by 5.4 per cent 
on a reported basis, to £3.072 billion, and 
by 2.5 per cent in constant currency. This 
was our fourth successive year of turnover 
growth and represented the first time 
that the Group has broken through the 
£3 billion revenue barrier. 
The Group continued to consolidate on 
its significant Services growth seen in 
2012. Group Services revenue increased 
by 6.3 per cent to £965.9 million on an 
as reported basis, and by 3.7 per cent 
in constant currency. This reflects our 
strategic focus on growing our Services 
business, which now represents 31.4 per 
cent of the Group’s total revenue. 
Our Supply Chain businesses in the 
UK and Germany also performed well, 
especially during the second half of the 
year. We believe this is a testament to 
the strength of our customer relationships 
within these markets, which themselves 
appear to be showing the signs of a 
sustained economic recovery. These 
performances fuelled Supply Chain 
revenue growth across the Group of 
5.0 per cent on an as reported basis, 
and by 2.0 per cent in constant currency.
Group profitability was mixed within 
our main operating units, with adjusted* 
profit growth in the UK and Germany 
being substantially offset by our issues 
in France which became apparent 
during the course of the year. As a result, 
the Group’s adjusted* profit before tax 
increased by 3.0 per cent to £81.7 million. 
As a result of the overall increase in 
profitability and the Return of Value to 
shareholders, the Group’s adjusted* 
diluted earnings per share has increased 
by 6.1 per cent to 43.3 pence in 2013. 
Statutory Performance and 
Exceptional Items
The Group incurred £28.8 million of 
exceptional items in the period. On a 
statutory basis, taking account of 
exceptional items and amortisation of 
acquired intangibles, the Group made 
a profit before tax of £50.5 million.
As announced by the Group on 16 July 2013, 
a number of Managed Services contracts 
entered into by our German business in 
2011 have failed to achieve the margins 
anticipated. Following a thorough review 
of these contracts in the first half of the 
year, it was established that three of these 
were forecast to be loss-making over the 
course of their lifetime, and we continue 
to forecast that this will be the case. The 
operational and financial performance of 
these contracts has been stabilised over 
the second half of the year, and they have 
continued to perform as forecast and in 
line with the provision within our 2013 
Interim Accounts. As we move further into 
2014, Management remain committed to 
both maintaining our relationship with these 
very important customers for the Group, 
whilst attempting to minimise the actual 
level of losses incurred regardless of the 
relevant provision made. 
A number of cost-saving activities have 
been driven across the Group during the 
course of 2013. As a result of implementing 
our Group Operating Model in Germany, 
and simplifying the management structure 
across the Group, we have incurred 
restructuring charges of approximately 
£4.3 million during the course of 2013, 
in addition to the £1.5 million taken in 
2012. Whilst the underlying trend of overall 
adjusted operating expenses (‘SG&A’) 
in France increased by 1.2 per cent in 
constant currency as a result of the cost  
of implementing our Group ERP system, 
we have no doubt that there will be a  
need to take action in 2014 to increase the 
competitiveness of our French business.  
As a result of the activity undertaken, we 
have already seen an SG&A reduction of  
3.0 per cent in Germany in 2013.
As reflected previously in our 2013 
Interim Results, the disappointing financial 
performance of our French business in 
2013 has resulted in the requirement for 
a non-cash impairment to non-current 
assets in its cash-generating unit, relating 
to goodwill and acquired intangibles, of 
£12.2 million.
As part of our normal audit processes 
at the end of the financial year, we have 
carried out a detailed evaluation of our 
other long-term Services contracts across 
the Group. This has resulted in a one-off 
gain of £4.0 million which, due to its nature 
and size, has been classified by the Group 
as exceptional.

Summary of Operational 
Performance
Our UK business has performed well during 
the year, further building on the significant 
levels of Services growth that it achieved 
in 2012. The continuing ability of the UK 
Services business to deliver operational 
excellence to large customers has resulted 
in it being awarded the number one ranking 
within UK customer satisfaction surveys, 
carried out in 2013, by each of KPMG and 
the Whitelane Research Group. In addition, 
this has helped the UK Professional 
Services business to have a significant 
forward order book, which is now at a 
record high level.
Computacenter in Germany saw a year of 
stable performance, which was pleasing 
given the significant operational change 
which took place in 2013 due to the 
implementation of our Group Operating 
Model. This change was implemented 
due to the need to leverage the Group’s 
systems and processes consistently across 
its operating geographies and has helped 
to resolve operational problems on the 
three onerous contracts, as well as ensure 
robust contract governance on new bids. 
It has been encouraging to see this action 
now begin to take effect, with a gradual 
increase in Services margins throughout the 
year from our existing Services business, 
excluding our three onerous contracts.
We have been extremely disappointed 
by the Group’s performance in France. 
Whilst this has no doubt been impacted 
by the ongoing and prolonged poor 
market conditions, it was also impacted 
by a number of operational issues arising 
in part from the implementation of 
our Group ERP system. Whilst these 
operational issues are now substantially 
behind us, we are taking robust action in 
order to improve the performance of the 
business in the medium term. This includes 
the extension of our Group Operating 
Model into France, alongside a strategic 
shift towards a more Services-based 
business model, similar to those currently 
seen in the UK and Germany. There 
remains significant work ahead over the 
next 18 months to ensure that these 
changes are implemented successfully. 
In the UK, recent business wins 
and improving margins in our 
Services business, combined with 
positive momentum in the Supply 
Chain business, gives us scope  
for further improvement.

Dividend
The Board has decided to propose a final 
dividend of 12.3 pence, bringing the total 
ordinary dividend paid for 2013 to 17.5 pence, 
representing a 12.9 per cent increase on 
the 2012 dividend paid of 15.5 pence. 
This regular dividend is consistent with our 
stated policy of maintaining dividend cover 
within our target range of 2 to 2.5 times 
our annual adjusted* diluted EPS. Subject 
to the approval of shareholders at our 
Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2014, 
the proposed dividend will be paid on 
Friday 20 June 2014. The dividend record 
date is set on Friday 23 May 2014, and 
the shares will be marked ex-dividend on 
Wednesday 21 May 2014. 
Strategy and Investment
During the course of the year, we have 
undertaken a rigorous strategy review 
process, which has resulted in some 
refinement to the Group’s strategic 
objectives, which are now as follows:
1.  To lead with and grow our 
Services business;
2.  To improve our Services productivity 
and enhance our competitiveness;
3.  To retain and maximise the relationship 
with our customers over the long term; 
and
 4.  To innovate our Services offerings to 
build future growth opportunities. 
To enhance and implement the result of 
the strategy review process, the Group 
has appointed a Head of Strategy recruited 
from within our German business and, 
additionally, a Service Innovation Director 
who joined with a significant track record 
for Services innovation development.
We have continued to invest appropriately 
to ensure that we have the technical 
and operational capability to meet our 
customers’ needs. T o support the ongoing 
demand for our Service desk offerings, we 
have invested in new supporting tool-sets 
to ensure high-level resilience and enable 
the ongoing development of our Service 
desk capability. In 2014, we will complete 
the upgrade of our entire global Service 
desk estate to this platform. 
In accordance with our strategic objectives, 
we will continue to keep abreast of industry 
developments, particularly around the use 
of knowledge management to help drive 
self-service, first contact resolution and 
workplace efficiencies. This is facilitated 
by a substantial investment in the upgrade 
of our BMC Remedy platform involving 
the migration of all customers, where we 
manage incident and request activities. 
In addition to capability, we have also 
developed our capacity to satisfy customer 
demand for low-cost European language 
service desk operations. In February 2014, 
the first of our customers, having recently 
renewed with us for a third term, transferred 
its service to our new facility in Budapest, 
Hungary. We have additionally increased 
the capacity of our Barcelona facilities and 
now have additional capacity to increase 
our offshore remote management facility 
in Cape Town. 
Outlook
The Board expects Computacenter to 
make further progress in 2014. At such 
an early stage of the year it is difficult to 
be very specific about the outcome, but 
we believe all of our major geographies 
will move in the right direction. 
In the UK, recent business wins and 
improving margins in our Services business, 
combined with positive momentum in the 
Supply Chain business gives us scope for 
further improvement. 
In Germany, we do not expect a significant 
improvement in Services revenues until 
the second half of the year at the earliest 
but, nevertheless, there is some progress 
to be gained through Services margin 
improvement. The onerous contracts in 
Germany should continue to perform in 
line with the provisions.
After a highly disappointing 2013 for our 
French business, we expect the French 
loss to reduce, but for the French business 
to remain loss-making as we take steps 
to position business for its longer-term 
success.
In 2014, we will continue to build on 
Computacenter’s strong platform by 
increasing its number of customers, 
broadening our customer relationships, 
increasing our service productivity and 
innovating our offerings. This should 
enable us to continue our track record 
of cash generation and earnings per 
share growth.
Cash and Return of Value
Cash flow generation remained strong 
during the period and, at the end of 
2013, net cash prior to customer specific 
financing (‘CSF’) was £90.3 million 
(2012: £72.3 million). Including CSF , net 
funds were £71.4 million (2012: £53.6 million). 
It should again be noted that this position 
continues to benefit by approximately 
£41 million (2012: £34 million) from the 
extended credit facility provided by one 
of our major suppliers. These extended 
terms have been in place for over four 
years, and while they can be withdrawn 
at any time, they have now been in place 
for such a significant period that, moving 
forwards, it is our intention to only report 
on these within our Annual Report and 
Accounts document, and no longer within 
each external announcement released 
by the Company.
The 2012 cash positions noted above 
exclude the £75 million of value returned 
to shareholders during 2013, in order 
to show a like-for-like comparison against 
the cash position as at the end of 2013. 
Our year-end cash position clearly 
demonstrates once again Computacenter’ s 
ability to turn operating profit into free 
cash, notwithstanding the impact of our 
2013 challenges in France, which have 
temporarily tied up cash in working capital. 
An additional Return of Value to shareholders 
totalling £75 million, or 48.7 pence for every 
existing ordinary share held at the close of 
trading on 11 June 2013, was successfully 
completed at the beginning of July 2013.  
As part of the Return of Value, an associated 
share capital reorganisation took place on  
12 June 2013, whereby every ten Ordinary 
Shares of 6 pence each in the Company 
were effectively consolidated into nine 
Ordinary Shares of 6⅔ pence each. The 
Return of Value has reduced our interest 
income by approximately £0.8 million 
annually, with adjusted* diluted EPS 
augmented, as a result of the share 
consolidation, by approximately 9 per cent 
over the course of a full year. As the share 
capital reorganisation associated with the 
Return of Value took place in June 2013,  
the Company’ s adjusted* diluted EPS was 
augmented by approximately 4.5 per cent 
during the second half of 2013. 
The Board will continue to evaluate the 
requirement to maintain an efficient balance 
sheet, and will endeavour to use our ability 
to generate free cash in order to continue 
to deliver incremental value for our 
shareholders.

Performance review continued
Computacenter in the UK
 
Our UK business has performed well in 
2013, and we are encouraged by what 
has now been a sustained period of 
growth in both revenue and profitability. 
Overall, total revenue for the year increased 
by 7.6 per cent to £1,286.1 million 
(2012: £1,195.6 million). This was fuelled 
by a Supply Chain revenue growth increase 
of 8.4 per cent, which was primarily due 
to an increase in the size of our customer 
base, following significant Contractual 
Services growth in the prior year, and 
continued demand for our Windows 7 
roll-outs.
Services revenue grew during the reporting 
period by 6.2 per cent, consolidating 
and building on the 15.3 per cent growth 
in 2012. This incorporated a growth of 
5.4 per cent within our Contractual 
Services business and 8.4 per cent within 
our Professional Services operations.
As expected, the significant level 
of profitability achieved in 2012 as a 
result of business take-on transition and 
transformation work, which has not been 
repeated in 2013, has made profitability 
growth more challenging than revenue 
growth to achieve during the reporting 
period. Notwithstanding this, adjusted* 
operating profit in the UK grew by 
7.5 per cent. 
Overall Supply Chain margin in the UK 
grew broadly in line with its growth in 
revenue, but the trend of customers 
purchasing a higher volume, but lower 
margin mix of product, has been seen 
throughout the course of 2013. We  
were pleased with our Supply Chain 
performance, especially during the second 
half of the year, which we see as a reflection 
of the strength of our customer and vendor 
relationships in the UK, and gradually 
improving market conditions. However, as 
we have previously explained, our Supply 
Chain business is impacted significantly by 
the short and medium-term buying patterns 
of our customers, and is therefore difficult 
to forecast in the medium term and is 
reliant on macro-economic factors. 
As a result, our primary focus will remain 
on the growth of our Services business 
which, for a second successive year, has 
underpinned our profitability growth in 
the UK. We have continued to develop 
our Contractual Services governance and 
bidding processes alongside the execution 
of Service delivery to our customers, whilst 
operating efficiently through the high 
utilisation of our Services staff. 
The consistent achievement of Services 
operational excellence has resulted in our 
retention of the number one ranking for 
customer satisfaction and reference-ability 
within a survey carried out by KPMG, for the 
second year running. We have additionally 
been awarded the top-ranking position 
within a study by the Whitelane Research 
Group, measuring the performance of 
24 outsourcing providers in the UK, and 
700 UK IT outsourcing contracts worth 
£15 billion in total. 
We anticipate that the demand for 
our Professional Services offerings 
will continue, given that our forward 
order book finished the year at a 
record level.
20 Computacenter plc 
Enabling IT Users 
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013 continue to invest in and refine these on 
an ongoing basis. The increasing focus on 
our target market throughout the bidding 
process, which is well supported and 
monitored by our established Group 
Operating Model governance procedures, 
has indeed resulted in us withdrawing 
from one significant bid during the year 
where we deemed the level of risk to 
be unacceptable. However, we believe  
that this approach reflects our prioritisation 
of long-term delivery of value to our 
customers, and ultimately shareholders, 
over short-term financial targets of  
the business. 
In its second year at its new premises, 
2013 was a year of consolidation for our 
IT redeployment and recycling subsidiary 
RDC, as the business absorbed the main 
impact of its ERP system implementation. 
In 2013, adjusted* operating profit for the 
year grew by 0.7 per cent, during a period 
in which all sales, service delivery and 
operational staff migrated fully to its new 
Microsoft AX software. 
The RDC business enters 2014 with a 
stable IT system, and without the significant 
burden of running two systems in parallel, 
as was the case in 2013, and having 
trained its staff fully on the new system now 
in place. In 2014, we anticipate that RDC 
will begin to reap the benefits, through the 
improvement of operational productivity, 
and the roll-out of more automation within 
its sales and reporting processes.
Overall SG&A in the UK have increased by 
9.3 per cent during the year. This reflects 
our increased bid costs, increased bonus 
and commission payments to our staff 
and further investment in our governance 
processes. Despite our recent success in 
the UK, we are mindful of the need to invest 
in a controlled and careful manner and, as 
such, we will be monitoring our level of 
SG&A closely during the course of 2014.
Our UK Services business is benefiting from 
its increasingly strong Services delivery 
reputation. 2013 saw a breakthrough deal 
for the Company with the UK Central 
Government. We have signed a Desktop 
Infrastructure Services Agreement with a 
UK Central Government department, which 
includes the management and support of 
their workplace, datacenter and networking 
environments, allowing the department to 
improve its end-user experience and 
safeguard service continuity. 
Additionally, a multi-million pound Managed 
Services contract with Computacenter will 
help RWEIT improve the user experience 
and reduce operational costs for parent 
company, RWE Group. The five-year 
contract includes end-user support for 
13,000 UK employees, major incident 
management for workplace IT and a 
Windows 7 transformation project.
We anticipate that the demand for our 
Professional Services offerings will remain 
strong, given that our forward order book 
finished the year at a record level. We 
additionally believe that this will be sustained 
in the short and medium term as customers 
need to upgrade their operating systems, 
due to user support coming to an end for 
soon-to-be obsolete versions. As such, 
they will continue to modernise their 
end-user workplace environments, 
for example through Windows 7 and 
Microsoft Office 2010 upgrades. Our 
approach to Professional Services business 
development will not be solely reliant upon 
these upgrades and, in terms of a longer-
term outlook, we believe that demand 
will continue and be based around 
Windows Server, mobility, datacenter 
and networking upgrades. 
We remain aware of the critical role that 
our governance processes and procedures 
have played in the maintenance of our 
Services margins in 2013. Given their 
importance to our business, we will

Performance review continued
Computacenter in Germany
 
The reporting period saw our German 
business continue to stabilise. Both 
revenue and adjusted* profitability grew 
during the year, against a backdrop of 
significant change within the business, 
including the implementation of our Group 
Operating Model and the restructuring of 
its sales force.
T otal revenue grew in 2013 by 6.5 per cent 
on an as reported basis to €1,497.8 million, 
and 1.7 per cent in constant currency. 
This growth came from our Supply Chain 
business, which enjoyed a particularly 
strong second half of the year. Supply 
Chain revenues grew by 7.2 per cent 
during 2013 on a reported basis, and 
by 2.4 per cent in constant currency. 
Whilst this Supply Chain performance is 
pleasing and appears to reflect a growing 
recovery within the German IT market 
which has now been sustained for the 
best part of a year, it is clearly not as 
predictable as our Services business. 
It is for this reason that, in line with our 
updated strategic objectives, our primary 
focus during 2014 will be in relation to 
the growth of our Services business.
During 2013, Services revenue was broadly 
flat at €485.4 million. This was impacted 
by the significant reduction in size of one 
customer contract, which affected the 
fourth quarter of the year. However, it also 
illustrates the anticipated slow-down in 
our Services business, as a result of our 
decision to only bid for selective Managed 
Services opportunities during the year. This 
enabled us to dedicate more resource to 
successfully resolving the issues which 
had arisen from the substantial growth of 
our Services business in the fourth quarter of 
2011, and importantly addressing the 
underlying causes of those issues. 
These issues related primarily to the 
adequacy of contractual governance 
procedures, and therefore during the year 
we have taken decisive action to improve 
these through the implementation of our 
Group Operating Model. This has already 
started to take effect, and has enabled us 
to stabilise and improve the operational 
and financial performance of a number of 
our difficult Managed Services contracts. 
As a result, excluding our three onerous 
contracts, we have seen a gradual 
improvement in our Services margins 
through the year. 
Our Professional Services business 
generated significant momentum during 
the year, with its total revenue growing 
by 11.3 per cent in constant currency. This 
performance was largely driven by our 
Workplace Solutions business delivering 
significant volumes of Windows 7 and 8 
roll-outs, and our network security offering. 
In addition to our strong Supply Chain 
performance, and other improvements 
in the business, adjusted* operating profit 
for the German segment has increased by 
48.8 per cent to €36.1 million. Notwithstanding 
that this performance was against the 
backdrop of a weak comparator in 2012, 
we are encouraged that the governance 
changes we have implemented appear 
to be having their intended impact.
This has been further evidenced by the 
new material transition and transformation 
projects that have been executed in 
accordance with new Group processes, 
albeit that these have been relatively few 
in number during 2013. These have been 
completed in accordance with agreed 
contractual Services levels and projected 
financial outcomes. We are now in a better 
position to ensure that new Services wins 
in 2014 will be contracted appropriately 
and implemented successfully as a result 
of the new operating model, and therefore 
have built a strong platform on which 
we can look to pursue medium term 
Services growth.
Turning specifically to our three loss-making, 
or onerous, contracts, we are pleased to 
report that the operational and financial 
performance of these has been stable 
during the second half of the year. We 
have resolved our operational issues and 
are now delivering to contractually agreed 
levels of performance. As explained within

Enabling IT Users 
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013 Computacenter in France
 
Clearly, 2013 was a disappointing year for 
our French business. Total revenue for the 
reporting period reduced by 7.1 per cent 
in constant currency. Overall, the result 
reduced from an adjusted* operating profit 
of €5.3 million in 2012 to an adjusted* 
operating loss of €8.6 million in 2013. 
The majority of this decline was attributable 
to a significant reduction in our Supply 
Chain revenues, which decreased by 
8.3 per cent in constant currency. This 
reduction was in itself due to two primary 
factors. Firstly, our Supply Chain business 
was impacted by the prolonged and 
continuing difficult market conditions in 
France, which has caused customers 
to reduce their IT investment spend. 
We do not expect market conditions 
in France to improve materially in 2014, 
which has brought into sharp focus a 
requirement for our business model in 
France to be aligned more closely with our 
UK and German businesses. In the UK and 
Germany, we are less reliant on commodity 
Supply Chain business, and are thus more 
likely to be able to withstand the impact of 
negative external market conditions. 
Secondly, the implementation of our Group 
ERP system in France was expected to be 
a more significant challenge than was the 
case in either the UK or Germany, as the 
extent of system and process change 
was greater. However, the difficulties 
experienced were more pronounced than 
expected and, as a result, a number of 
operational issues arose within the business 
affecting its ability to manage the delivery 
of product and parts through its logistics 
operation and therefore to ship on time.
While it is clear that these issues impacted 
the performance of our Supply Chain 
business materially during the second half 
of the year, they have now been resolved 
and the relevant order backlogs have been 
cleared. This is evident in the strong recovery 
of Supply Chain sales during Q4 2013 with 
orders being delivered in accordance with 
agreed service levels. Whilst we are aware 
that we have lost Supply Chain orders as a 
result of these issues, we do not believe that 
we have lost any of our material Supply 
Chain customers. 
the Group overview, the contracts have 
performed in line with the forecast set 
out in our 2013 Interim Results during 
the second half of the year. 
In addition to the governance changes 
outlined above, we have also carried out 
a full review, restructuring and realignment 
of our sales force. We are confident that, as 
a result of this, we are now better prepared 
to take advantage of significant Services 
growth opportunities within the German IT 
market. This review process has included 
significant knowledge transfer between our 
UK and German businesses, particularly 
within Managed Services, which we 
anticipate will accelerate the learning 
progression of our sales force in Germany 
to sell and interact with our customers 
in accordance with Group strategy and 
business principles. Primarily as a result 
of the action detailed above, which has 
additionally resulted in a general de-layering 
of German management across the 
business, SG&A has reduced by 3.0 per 
cent in 2013. Due to the nature of these 
actions, redundancy and restructuring 
costs totalling €3.7 million have been 
included within the Group financials as 
exceptional costs.
Although 2013 Services revenue has 
broadly been flat, our Services business 
has achieved a number of notable wins. 
Going forward, Computacenter will be 
providing Dataport with operational 
assistance for its IT workstations, 
Datacenter and Networking. Dataport is 
the service provider for information and 
communications technology of the public 
administration for the German Federal 
States of Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein 
and Bremen, as well as for the tax 
administrations in Mecklenburg-Western 
Pomerania and Lower Saxony. Additionally, 
a Computacenter overflow help desk in 
Berlin will ensure that Dataport’s user-help 
desk is provided with additional capacity 
where required during peak times. The 
duration of the contract is for three years. 
Whilst we would clearly want to have 
avoided the Managed Service contract 
issues that we have faced over the last two 
years, they have forced us to re-evaluate 
ourselves internally, and we are confident 
that our business prospects in the medium 
term have emerged stronger as a result.

In line with our Group Operating Model 
strategy and following its successful 
implementation in Germany, we started 
the process of implementing our 
Group Operating Model into our French 
business in early 2014. The Group ERP 
implementation was essential in order to 
enable this to happen and will allow us 
to drive efficiencies within the business, 
for example within the utilisation of our 
resources and the implementation of 
the Group’s best practices. 
Given the issues experienced in France in 
2013 and as a result of the implementation 
of the Group Operating Model, there have 
been some senior management changes in 
France. Moving forward, we will strengthen 
the management team in key areas to help 
facilitate the implementation of the Group 
Operating Model. Whilst the underlying 
trend of SG&A increased by 1.2 per cent 
in constant currency during the course of 
2013 as a result of the cost of implementing 
our ERP system, we have no doubt that 
there will be a need to take actions in 2014 
to increase the competitiveness of our 
French business.
As outlined in the Group overview and 
as previously highlighted within our 2013 
Interim Results, as a result of the continuing 
disappointing performance in France during 
the year, and our continued medium-term 
expectations for the business, we have 
incurred a non-cash impairment in 
the French cash-generating unit of 
£12.2 million, relating to goodwill 
and acquired intangibles.
Computacenter in France continued
Overall gross margin contribution within  
our Supply Chain business has declined as 
a direct result of the reduction in revenue 
outlined above, an increased proportion  
of low margin software business and 
temporary increased warehouse operating 
costs due to our Group ERP system 
implementation. 
Services revenue in 2013 reduced by 
0.8 per cent to €90.5 million, mainly due 
to a 16.9 per cent decline in Professional 
Services revenue compared to 2012. 
This was as a result of weak demand for 
our offerings throughout the year, which 
itself was primarily due to weak market 
conditions. In addition, the impact of the 
Group ERP system implementation on 
our maintenance and logistics functions 
temporarily impacted our service levels. 
Whilst this has now improved significantly, 
it has led to a reduction in our Services 
contract base. 
Overall Services gross margin generation 
has reduced materially due to the decline 
in revenue and lower Professional Services 
utilisation, resulting in spare capacity in 
the workforce with associated margin 
dilution. Given our disappointing Services 
performance in 2013, our strategic shift 
to become more Services-focused in the 
medium term will be no easy task, and 
considerable work remains to be done in 
2014 and beyond to achieve this goal. 
However, we are encouraged by the fact 
that our French and International teams have 
worked very well together during the year  
to secure the Group’ s largest-ever Managed 
Services contract, for which the relevant  
bid had been made in accordance with 
Group processes. 
Moving forward, we will strengthen 
the management team in key areas 
to help facilitate the implementation  
of the Group Operating Model.

Computacenter in Belgium
 
Overall, our Belgian business has 
performed well in 2013. In 2011 and 2012 
we enjoyed large, one-off, Supply Chain 
revenues with a particular customer which, 
as we expected and as noted in our 2012 
Annual report, would impact comparators 
in 2013. Unless specifically stated, the 
results below include the contribution from 
the acquisition of Informatic Services (‘IS’) 
in December 2012.
Total revenue grew by 6.0 per cent on 
an as reported basis, and by 1.2 per cent 
in constant currency. Adjusted* operating 
profit reduced by 6.8 per cent to €2.2 million, 
which given the expected decline in 
Product revenue noted above, was still 
encouraging, albeit materially assisted by 
the acquisition of IS. Belgian SG&A has 
increased by 34.4 per cent however, on a 
like-for-like basis excluding the acquisition, 
in constant currency SG&A increased by 
0.5 per cent.
Clearly, Supply Chain revenue growth 
was materially impacted by one-off deals 
noted above. As a result, during the year 
Supply Chain revenue in constant currency 
reduced by 19.2 per cent. However, in 
the fourth quarter Supply Chain revenue 
was only down by 3.2 per cent in constant 
currency, reflecting the one-off deals in 
the first half of 2012 outlined above, and 
a strengthening Supply Chain demand 
environment towards the end of 2013. 
Our total Services revenue grew by  
65.2 per cent to €22.4 million. Excluding 
the effect of the acquisition, Services 
revenue has still grown organically by 
over 18.4 per cent during the period, 
which has been assisted by our ability 
to extend a number of our Managed 
Services contracts during the year. 
We have been pleased with the 
performance of IS in 2013, which has 
exceeded our initial expectations and, 
although much remains to be done, we 
have made significant progress towards 
integrating IS into our business. We have 
also managed to retain a significant 
majority of all major Managed Services 
contracts through the integration process. 
We were able to renew our 
Managed Services contract  
with Mercedes-Benz Belgium  
and Luxembourg for another  
three years.

Turnover and profitability
In 2013, Computacenter Group delivered 
its fourth successive year of turnover 
growth and achieved adjusted* profitability 
growth in the face of significant headwind  
in our French business. 
At a headline level, turnover grew by 
5.4 per cent and broke through the 
£3 billion barrier for the first time to reach 
£3,072.1 million. On a constant currency 
basis turnover growth was 2.5 per cent. 
Adjusted* profit before tax increased 
by 3.0 per cent from £79.3 million to 
£81.7 million, with the impact of exchange 
rates accounting for half of this increase.
After taking account of exceptional items 
primarily relating to the German onerous 
contracts and the non-cash impairment 
in France, statutory profit before tax 
decreased by 22.0 per cent from 
£64.8 million to £50.5 million.
The Group profitability performance 
was mixed across our main geographies. 
The German business has stabilised 
and returned a 48.8 per cent increase 
in adjusted* operating profit in constant 
currency, whilst the UK segment 
generated a 7.5 per cent increase. 
These improvements were largely offset 
by problems in France noted below which 
has fallen from a reported £4.3 million 
adjusted* operating profit in 2012 to a 
loss of £7.3 million in 2013.

receives regular rental income. Gross 
profit is also adjusted to take account 
of CSF finance costs. The reconciliation 
of statutory to adjusted results is further 
explained in the segmental reporting note 
(Note 4) to the financial statements. For the 
purposes of this statement, all subsequent 
references are to adjusted measures.
United Kingdom
UK revenues grew in 2013 by 7.6 per cent, 
increasing to £1,286.1 million. Supply Chain 
revenues increased by 8.4 per cent, driven 
by a larger customer base following the 
Contractual Services wins and further 
demand for workplace and Windows 7 
roll-outs. Services revenues overall grew 
a further 6.2 per cent following a strong 
15.3 per cent growth in 2012. Within 
this, Contractual Services revenue grew 
5.4 per cent despite the one-off impact of 
large transition billing in 2012. Professional 
Services in turn generated 8.4 per cent 
growth in revenues mainly due to 
migrations to Windows 7.
Margin in the Supply Chain business was 
broadly flat, following the decline in 2012, 
due to increasing work place product sales 
and continually evolving vendor partner 
terms of trade. However, Services margin 
increased due to improved execution, 
maturity of contracts and high utilisation 
of staff. This resulted in a UK total adjusted* 
gross profit increase from 15.4 per cent 
to 15.6 per cent of sales. SG&A rose by 
9.3 per cent, reflecting increased bid costs, 
increased commission and bonus for staff 
due to the UK performance and increased 
investment in improved governance 
required by the Group Operating Model, 
net of recharges to other Group Segments.
Overall this has resulted in a 7.5 per cent 
increase in adjusted* operating profit from 
£52.2 million to £56.2 million.
Germany
∆ German revenue growth recovered in 
2013 as the business continued to stabilise 
after a disappointing 2012. Revenue, as 
reported, grew in 2013 by 6.5 per cent to 
£1,271.4 million (2012: £1,193.8 million), 
albeit in local currency revenue increased 
by 1.7 per cent. 
Supply Chain revenues grew by 2.4 per 
cent in 2013, increasing the rate of growth 
over 2012 (2.0 per cent). Services revenues 
were flat with 0.3 per cent growth in 2013. 
We expected low Service revenue growth 
as the focus was on ensuring that business 
is conducted in accordance with increased 
governance in line with the Group Operating 
Model and the effort on resolving the 
onerous contracts. As the business 
grows more confident operating within 
the enhanced Group governance 
procedures we expect Services 
revenue growth to return.

∆ The revenue in the French segment 
decreased by 7.1 per cent in the year. 
Supply Chain revenue fell by 8.3 per cent 
due to continuing weakness in French 
macro-economic conditions and the impact 
of the unsatisfactory implementation of our 
Group ERP system on 1 June 2013 which 
affected our ability to ship orders on time 
resulting in an order backlog and a drop 
in customer service levels.
Services revenues contracted by 
0.8 per cent when compared to 2012 
which featured a number of new contract 
wins. The impact of the Group ERP 
implementation on the logistics function 
and specifically the maintenance parts 
business has adversely affected service 
levels leading to a decline in contract value.
Gross profit in 2013 has been impacted 
throughout the year by the weak 
demand for our Professional Services 
business which declined by 16.9 per cent, 
resulting in spare capacity which has 
had a significant impact on gross margins 
achieved. In addition, Services gross 
margins have been reduced by increased 
costs arising from the difficult Group ERP 
implementation from 1 June 2013.
In addition, gross margins in the Supply 
Chain business reduced mainly due to 
mix factors, in particular an increased 
proportion of low margin software business 
which has had a positive effect on revenue 
but generated little incremental contribution.
The result of these two issues is that overall 
gross margin reduced from 9.9 per cent to 
8.2 per cent. 
Gross margin return of the German 
business has increased from the restated 
12.1 per cent in 2012 to 12.4 per cent in 
2013. Supply Chain gross margin increased 
mainly due to a favourable product mix 
and, excluding the three onerous contracts 
highlighted in exceptional costs, Service 
margins increased due to improvement 
in other difficult contracts.
SG&A has continued to reduce following 
the reduction in the latter part of 2012 with 
a real focus on cost base reduction driven 
by the new German leadership team. 
One-off charges related to the restructuring 
of the German business have been incurred 
and disclosed as an exceptional item.
Overall, the German segment adjusted* 
operating profit increased by 55.9 per cent 
from £19.7 million to £30.6 million as 
reported, an increase of 48.8 per cent 
in constant currency.

29 Finance Director’s review continued
in 2013. Excluding the results of the 
acquisition, which has a services focus, 
gross profit margin has fallen to 
10.5 per cent.
SG&A, excluding the acquisition has 
increased 0.5 per cent and has increased 
by 28.3 per cent including the acquisition. 
Overall there has been a 2.4 per cent 
decrease in reported adjusted* operating 
profit from £1.9 million in 2012 to  
£1.8 million in 2013. This is a 6.8 per cent 
decrease in local currency and without 
the acquisition would have been a 
39.0 per cent decrease.
Exceptional items
As described in our Group Interim Results 
in August 2013, the rapid growth of our 
Services business in Germany during 
the fourth quarter of 2011, coupled 
with insufficient contractual governance 
procedures in place within our German 
business at that time, has resulted in a 
number of Managed Services contracts 
failing to achieve the margins anticipated 
at the time that they were agreed. Three  
of these contracts were deemed likely 
to be loss-making over the course of  
their lifetime. Detailed analysis and 
customer re-negotiation was conducted 
and an exceptional one-off provision  
of £10.7 million representing our best  
estimate of the losses expected to be 
incurred until the end of the contracts  
was made as outlined in our 2013  
Group Interim Results.
The three onerous contracts in Germany 
have continued to perform in line with our 
forecasts. Contractual performance has 
remained stable with improving service 
levels. We continue to forecast that these 
three contracts will be loss-making over the 
course of their lifetime and are comfortable 
with the level of further provisioning, 
£10.7 million, made in the results disclosed 
in the Group Interim report. Whilst any 
further movement away from our forecasts 
would also be deemed to be an exceptional 
item, local management will continue to 
be measured on the absolute performance 
of these contracts before the provision. 
It should be noted that, notwithstanding 
these specific contractual losses, the 
total business accruing from these three 
customers still makes an important 
contribution to the Group’s 
overall profitability.
As part of our normal processes, we 
have carried out a detailed evaluation of 
other long-term Services contracts across 
the Group. As a result of this on-going 
evaluation, management have calculated 
that a positive change in certain estimates 
has resulted in a one-off gain of £4.0 million. 
Due to the nature of the change in the 
estimates, and the size of the gain, it 
has been decided to highlight this as an 
exceptional item. This is consistent with 
the treatment of the previously identified 
onerous contracts and will provide a fairer 
and more balanced understanding of our 
underlying growth in profitability.
SG&A expenses have increased by 
1.2 per cent, largely reflecting the increased 
cost of the implementation of the Group 
ERP system in France and the increased 
time from Group resources cross-charged 
into the business as part of the efforts to 
realign local procedures with the Group 
Operating Model.
Overall, adjusted* operating profit as 
reported in France has therefore fallen from  
a profit of £4.3 million in 2012 to a loss of 
£7.3 million in 2013. 
Belgium
∆ Reported revenue increased by 6.0 per cent 
to £48.2 million (2012: £45.5 million) 
equating to an increase of 1.2 per cent 
in local currency. Excluding the results of 
IS which was acquired in December 2012, 
revenue decreased by 10.4 per cent. 
Supply Chain revenue fell by 19.2 per cent 
(19.6 per cent excluding IS) mainly due to a 
very significant one-off Supply Chain order 
from one customer in the first half of 2012. 
However in the second half of 2013 Supply 
Chain revenues were 2.6 per cent higher 
than in the second half of 2012. 
Services revenue, including the results of IS, 
grew 65.2 per cent. Excluding the results of 
the acquisition, organic Services revenue 
growth was 18.4 per cent. 
As the service mix of the business has 
increased, gross profit return on sales 
for Belgium overall has also lifted from  
11.0 per cent in 2012 to 12.5 per cent

Finance income and costs
Net finance costs of £0.5 million were 
incurred on a statutory basis in 2013 
(2012: net finance income of £0.2 million). 
This takes account of finance costs on 
CSF of £0.8 million (2012: £1.1 million). 
On an adjusted basis, prior to the interest 
on CSF , net finance income decreased 
from £1.3 million in 2012 to £0.3 million in 
2013. The decrease is primarily due to the 
reduced cash holdings impacting interest 
received as a result of our Return of 
Value to our shareholders and lower 
deposit rates.
Taxation
The effective adjusted tax rate for  
2013 was 23.7 per cent (2012 restated: 
22.0 per cent). The deterioration was due 
to a lower mix of overseas earnings in 2013 
compared to 2012. However, the Group’s 
tax rate continues to benefit from losses 
utilised on earnings in Germany and further 
benefits from the reducing corporation tax 
rate in the UK. 
Deferred tax assets of £13.5 million  
(2012: £15.7 million) have been recognised 
in respect of losses carried forward. During 
the year, an asset of £2.2 million relating to 
losses carried forward in France has been 
written off. At 31 December 2013, there 
were unused tax losses across the Group 
of £125.4 million (2012: £115.5 million) 
for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised. Of these losses, £54.5 million 
(2012: £61.6 million) arise in Germany and 
£67.6 million (2012: £50.6 million) arise 
in France. A significant proportion of the 
losses arising in Germany have been 
generated in statutory entities that no 
longer have significant levels of trade. The 
remaining unrecognised tax losses relate to 
other loss-making overseas subsidiaries.
The Group considers all movement in the 
recoverable amount of deferred tax assets 
relating to the recognition, de-recognition 
or utilisation of previously recognised 
losses, to be outside our adjusted results. 
Management’s view is that, due to their 
material nature and irregular timing, the 
inclusion of these movements within our 
adjusted tax charge distorts the underlying 
cash tax base and annual performance 
of the Group as a whole.
This has no impact on the adjusted or 
statutory results for this year. However, 
we expect net movements to be charged 
to exceptional tax in future periods as the 
utilisation of the previously recognised 
deferred tax assets in Germany exceeds 
the recognition of further tax losses.
Earnings per share and dividend
The adjusted* diluted earnings per share 
has increased in line with profit performance 
by 6.1 per cent from 40.8 pence in 2012 to 
43.3 pence in 2013. Due to the impact of 
exceptional charges in 2013, the statutory 
diluted earnings per share has reduced 
from 32.4 pence in 2012 to 23.0 pence 
in 2013.
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 12.3 pence per share, bringing 
the total dividend for the year to 17.5 pence 
(2012: 15.5 pence). Subject to the approval 
of shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) on 15 May 2014, the 
proposed dividend will be paid on  
20 June 2014. The dividend record date is 
set as 23 May 2014, and the shares will 
be marked ex-dividend on 21 May 2014.
Acquisitions
On 28 December 2012 the Group 
acquired 100 per cent of the voting shares 
of NEWIS SA and its subsidiary, Informatic 
Services IS SA.
The book and provisional fair values of the 
net assets acquired that were disclosed 
in note 16 of the 2012 Annual Report and 
Accounts, are now final and are unchanged.
As a result of the continued management 
restructure in Germany following the 
stabilisation of the contracts previously 
described,we have recognised related 
redundancy expenses of £3.1 million in the 
year. Due to the transformational nature of 
the restructuring and the events which 
preceded it, we have continued to 
classify these as exceptional costs.
Similarly, Computacenter in France has 
begun a programme to also reduce its 
SG&A and restructure its business and 
senior management in line with the Group 
Operating Model. Redundancy related 
expenses of £1.2 million have been 
included in the 2013 result.
Our French business transferred onto the 
Group ERP system on 1 June 2013 and 
has gone live in our Group Operating 
Model effective as of 1 January 2014. 
These milestones, along with the changes 
in business focus and governance that 
underpin them will be the drivers of 
change to transform our French 
business in the coming years.
The combination of the decline in the 
French economy leading to a reduction 
in demand for our Services, operational 
problems arising from the Group ERP 
implementation and the resulting financial 
impact has led to the requirement for a 
£12.2 million impairment of non-current 
assets as detailed in our Interim Results 
in August 2013. There arose a further 
requirement to fully write-off a 
£2.2 million deferred tax asset 
as at 31 December 2013.
Due to the continued adverse performance 
of our equity accounted associate ICS 
Solutions Limited we have decided to fully 
impair the £0.5 million recorded value of 
our investment.
Restatement
As reported in the 2013 Interim report, the 
2012 accounts have been restated, where 
necessary, to reclassify trading losses and 
provisions relating to the three onerous 
German contracts to provide a clearer 
picture of the performance of the business. 
The impact of the reclassification is 
summarised in the following table:

Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013
31 Finance Director’s review continued
Whilst the cash position remains robust, 
the Group continued to benefit from the 
extension of an improvement in credit 
terms with a significant vendor, equivalent 
to £41 million at 31 December 2013, an 
increase of £7 million from December 2012. 
This improvement in credit terms has 
been in operation since 2009 and, whilst 
the continuation of these terms is not 
guaranteed and can be withdrawn at any 
time, the terms are generally available to all 
material partners of that significant vendor. 
We no longer feel it is necessary to continue 
to highlight these terms in the operating 
review. However we will continue to 
reference this item in our Finance Director’ s 
report, but we will not routinely report the 
number in Interim Management Statements 
and similar external updates or within the 
accounts themselves. 
Customer Specific Financing (‘CSF’) 
increased in the year from £18.7 million 
to £18.9 million. CSF remains low against 
our historical standards due to a decision 
to restrict this form of financing in light 
of the current credit environment and 
reduced customer demand.
Taking CSF into account, net funds at 
the end of the year were £71.4 million, 
compared to £128.6 million at the start of 
the year but after the circa £75.0 million 
Return of Value to shareholders.
Customer specific financing
In certain circumstances, the Group enters 
into customer contracts that are financed 
by leases or loans. The leases are secured 
only on the assets that they finance. Whilst 
the outstanding balance of CSF is included 
within the net funds for statutory reporting 
purposes, the Group excludes CSF when 
managing the net funds of the business, 
as this CSF is matched by contracted 
future receipts from customers. 
Whilst CSF is repaid through future 
customer receipts, Computacenter retains 
the credit risk on these customers and 
ensures that credit risk is only taken on 
customers with a strong credit rating.
The committed CSF financing facilities, 
are thus outside of the normal working 
capital requirements of the Group’s 
product resale and service activities. 
The Group does not expect a material 
increase in the level of CSF financing 
facilities, partly as the Group applies a 
higher cost of finance to these transactions 
than customer’s marginal cost of finance. 
In addition, some of these requirements 
have been satisfied through utilising a 
sale of receivables process. 
Capital Management
Details of the Group’ s capital management 
policies are included within Note 27 to the 
financial statements.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise 
borrowings, cash and liquid resources, 
and various items that arise directly from its 
operations. The Group enters into hedging 
transactions, principally forward exchange 
contracts or currency swaps. The purpose 
of these transactions is to manage currency 
risks arising from the Group’s operations 
and its sources of finance. As the Group 
continues to expand its global reach and 
benefit from lower cost operations in certain 
geographies, such as South Africa, it has 
entered into Forward Exchange contracts 
to protect any further currency risk. The 
Group’ s policy remains that no speculative 
trading in financial instruments shall 
be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s 
financial instruments are interest rate, 
liquidity and foreign currency risks. The 
overall financial instruments strategy is to 
manage these risks in order to minimise 
their impact on the financial results of the 
Group. The policies for managing each 
of these risks are set out below. Further 
disclosures in line with the requirements 
of IFRS 7 are included in the financial 
statements.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a 
mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings 
and finance leases and loans for certain 
customer contracts. The Group’s bank 
borrowings, other facilities and deposits are 
at floating rates. No interest rate derivative 
contracts have been entered into. 
Return of Value
While the Group intends to continue to 
maintain a robust and prudent balance 
sheet, we decided that it was appropriate 
to undertake a Return of Value to 
shareholders, in addition to the normal 
dividend. We announced on 24 May 2013 
a one-off Return of Value to shareholders 
of approximately £75 million, or 48.7 pence 
for every existing ordinary share held at 
the close of trading on 11 June 2013. 
Computacenter will continue to monitor its 
balance sheet to ensure that it is efficient. 
Computacenter also returned £74.4 million 
to shareholders by way of a one-off capital 
return via a B Share structure in 2006 
equating to 39 pence per share.
Cash flow 
The Group’s trading net funds position 
excludes customer specific financing.  
There is an adjusted cash flow statement 
provided in note 31 that restates the 
statutory cash flow to take account of  
this definition. 
Net funds excluding CSF decreased from 
£147.3 million to £90.3 million by the end 
of the year. However, this reduced figure 
is after the circa £75.0 million Return of 
Value to shareholders which masked an 
underlying net funds improvement of 
£18.0 million on a like-for-like basis 
compared to the position at 31 December 
2012. The Group continued to deliver 
strong cash generation from its operations 
in 2013, with adjusted operating cash 
flow of £70.5 million (2012: £85.2 million).
In the year we spent over £25 million on 
capital expenditure primarily investments in 
IT equipment in our business and software 
tools to enable us to deliver improved 
service to our customers.
Challenges within working capital have built 
up in our French business due to backlogs 
within our ERP system preventing the timely 
processing of transactions impacting cash 
collection and payment of invoices. We 
estimate that this has impacted our cash 
flow by circa £10 million. We are confident 
of improving this position in 2014 and as 
this occurs, working capital should be 
released into cash.
32 Computacenter plc 
Enabling IT Users 
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013 denominated in Sterling and any material 
trading exposures are eliminated through 
forward currency contracts.
The Group has been increasingly successful 
in winning international Services contracts 
where services are provided in multiple 
countries. The Group aims to minimise 
this exposure by invoicing the customer 
in the same currency in which the costs 
are incurred. For certain contracts, the 
Group’ s committed contract costs are not 
denominated in the same currency as its 
sales. In such circumstances, for example 
where contract costs are denominated 
in South African Rand, the Group seeks 
to eliminate currency exposure for a 
foreseeable future period on these future 
cash flows through forward currency 
contracts. In 2013, the Group recognised a 
loss of £1.4 million (2012: gain of £0.5 million) 
through other comprehensive income in 
relation to the changes in fair value of related 
forward currency contracts, where the cash 
flow hedges relating to firm commitments 
were assessed to be highly effective.
Credit risk
The Group principally manages credit risk 
through management of customer credit 
limits. The credit limits are set for each 
customer based on the creditworthiness 
of the customer and the anticipated 
levels of business activity. These limits 
are initially determined when the 
customer account is first set up and 
are regularly monitored thereafter. 
There are no significant concentrations of 
credit risk within the Group. The Group’s 
major customer, disclosed in Note 4 to 
the financial statements, consists of entities 
under the control of the UK Government. 
The maximum credit risk exposure relating 
to financial assets is represented by 
carrying value as at the balance sheet date. 
Going concern
As disclosed in the Directors’ report, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue its operations for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
consolidated financial statements.
Fair balanced and understandable 
The UK Corporate Governance Code has 
a new requirement for the Board to state 
whether the Company’s Annual Report 
and Accounts are ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’ and ‘provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the company’ s performance, 
business model and strategy’.
We have continued to formalise the process 
through which we can provide comfort to 
the Board to make the relevant assertions 
within the Annual Report and Accounts.

Liquidity risk
The Group’ s policy is to ensure that it has 
sufficient funding and facilities in place to 
meet any foreseeable peak in borrowing 
requirements. The Group’s positive 
net funds position was maintained 
throughout 2013, and at the year-end 
was £90.3 million excluding CSF , and 
£71.4 million including CSF .
Due to strong cash generation over the 
past three years, the Group is currently 
in a position where it can finance its 
requirements from its cash balance, 
and the Group operates a cash pooling 
arrangement for the majority of 
Group entities.
During the year the Group entered into a 
specific committed facility of £40.0 million 
for a three-year term which expires in 
May 2016.
The Group has a Board monitored policy 
in place to manage its counterparty risk 
that places cash on deposit across a 
range of reputable banking institutions.
Customer-specific financing facilities 
are committed.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates primarily in the 
UK, Germany and France, with smaller 
operations in Belgium, Hungary, India,

Our Commitment
For Computacenter in 2013, the year has 
been about building a strong platform for the 
Group to enjoy sustained success. However, 
we recognise that the people that carry 
out business on our behalf, the people we 
do business with and the societies and 
environment in which we operate are vital 
contributors to delivering value and achieving 
our strategic objectives. Whilst we pride 
ourselves on the provision of technologically-
advanced information solutions, we 
recognise that our business occurs within 
a wider community including employees, 
contractors, shareholders, customers, 
suppliers and business partners. 
Since 2007, the Group has been committed 
to the 10 core principles of the United 
Nations Global Compact (‘UNGC’), aimed 
at demonstrating ethical, environmental 
and social responsibility towards our own 
workforce and in our business interaction 
within each community and country in 
which we operate. In 2009, the Group 
published its first Communication on 
Progress (‘CoP’) on the UNGC website, and 
we have been doing so on an annual basis 
ever since that time. We believe that the 
UNGC provides us with an appropriate 
framework through which to measure our 
development and progress in this area. 
Additionally, the Group retains its 
membership of the FTSE4Good 
Index Series. 
The Group’s Corporate Sustainable 
Development (‘CSD’) Policy is annually 
reviewed by the Computacenter plc  
Board of Directors, and is implemented 
and monitored through the Group’s  
Corporate Sustainable Development 
Committee, constituted out of 
representatives from across the  
Group as a whole.
Integral to our commitment, we strive to 
incorporate the UNGC and its principles 
into our strategy, culture and day-to-day 
operations. We do this through the 
development, communication and 
implementation of relevant policies to 
manage and monitor our progress towards 
these principles. Since our commitment 
to the core principles, we have adopted 
and revised a number of policies and 
procedures across the Group, and will 
continue to do so on an ongoing basis. 
We are communicating our sustainability 
efforts and achievements with all our 
shareholders in our Annual Report and 
Accounts, as well as on our Company 
website. We continue to believe that what is 
not measured is not effectively managed and 
in line with this, following the implementation 
of our Group ERP system across our main 
operating geographies, we are endeavouring 
to identify at least one standard indicator 
(‘SI’), as recognised by the Global Reporting 
Initiative (‘GRI’), per core principle. 
Much work remains to be done over 
the coming years, in relation to the 
measurement indicators we elect to 
demonstrate our progress.
We actively seek to collaborate with and 
encourage our suppliers, contractors and 
customers to operate in a similar socially 
responsible manner, as guided by the UNGC 
10 core principles. We have already secured 
support from the majority of our suppliers 
and contractors, but we acknowledge that 
this remains an ongoing task.

Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013 Our CSD approach for 2014
As outlined within our Strategic Report, during the reporting 
period, Computacenter has completed the implementation 
of its Group ERP system within its UK, German and 
French business subsidiaries. We look forward to using this 
standardised tool to measure progress in the area of CSD 
consistently across the Group. In alignment with our move 
towards a Group operating structure, this will also be the 
case for our approach on CSD, where new initiatives will be 
launched in 2014 to replicate the best progress being made 
in-country across the Group, and to discuss innovative  
ideas in this area more closely. Through a drive towards  
the efficiencies gained by working together more closely,  
we will continue to improve our CSD standards alongside 
the Group’s growth in revenue and profitability. We are 
committed to ensuring that we do business in the right way, 
and additionally to giving something back to the community 
which continues to allow our business to flourish. The UNGC 
is a wholly appropriate tool and framework to guide us 
towards achieving these aspirations and, as such, we will 
remain wholly committed to it during 2014.

39 Dear Shareholder
Commitment to Corporate Governance
The Board of Computacenter believes that long-term 
shareholder value creation is supported by high-quality 
governance. It is therefore committed to the principles of 
good governance and supports the best practice guidelines 
contained within the UK Corporate Governance Code, as 
amended in September 2012 (the ‘Code’). The Code is 
published by the Financial Reporting Council and can  
be found at www.frc.gov.uk. 
This Corporate Governance report outlines and explains the 
Company’s governance policies and practices, and sets out 
how the principles of the Code have been applied during the 
year ended 31 December 2013. I am able to confirm to you 
that, except where indicated and fully explained within this 
report, the Company has complied with each of the provisions 
of the Code throughout the year.
We have additionally, for ease of reference, prepared a separate 
report by reference to each of the Main Principles and separate 
provisions of the Code explaining how the Company has 
complied with each of these. This report can be found at  
www.computacenter.com/investors. 
Board Composition
The changes made to the Board during 2013 have been 
referred to within the Nomination Committee report on page 55. 
As previously announced by the Company during the period, 
we were pleased to welcome Regine Stachelhaus onto the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director in July 2013. In line with the 
Company’s procedure for new Directors, Ms. Stachelhaus 
received a full induction, which included meetings with the 
Chairman of the Board and its Committees, the CEO and CFO. 
Additionally, Ian Lewis stepped down from his position as a 
Non-Executive Director in September 2013, following eight 
years of valuable service in that role.

Board Effectiveness
Since the publication of the 2012 Annual Report and Accounts, 
an evaluation of the Board, its key Committees and each of the 
Directors has been carried out by an external and independent 
provider, NJMD Corporate Services Limited (‘NJMD’).  
Details of the full process carried out and the findings of the 
evaluation can be found on page 43 of this report. Following 
this evaluation, I am satisfied that the Board is functioning 
effectively and that its current constitution and range of skills 
are appropriate to ensure that the long-term interests of the 
Company and our shareholders are protected. I also remain 
satisfied that the members of the Board, in particular the 
Non-Executive Directors, have sufficient time to undertake  
their roles at Board and Committee level as currently required 
by the Company. However, I can assure you that in my role  
as Chairman of the Board, I will continue to assess both of 
these judgements to ensure that they remain the case on an 
ongoing basis. 
Board Visits
As in previous years, the Board held a meeting at one of the 
Company’s overseas operations. In 2013, this was held in 
Berlin, Germany. During the visit the Board discussed, with 
senior members of the in-country German management  
team, the progress made by the business following the 
implementation of Group Operating Model policies and 
procedures, and the associated strengthening of governance 
and internal controls within our German business at the 
beginning of the year. Board members were additionally  
given a tour of the Group Service Desk in Berlin. 
Diversity 
The Board continues to recognise the benefits that diverse 
skills, experience and points of view can bring to an 
organisation, and how it may assist the decision-making ability 
of the Board, thereby increasing its effectiveness. Whilst the 
Board continues to recognise the continuing debate around 
requirements for diversity, including that which has taken place 
within European Union legislating bodies during 2013, and  
the associated principles involved, appointments to the Board 
will continue to remain primarily based on merit. As at  
31 December 2013, the Computacenter Board had one  
female Non-Executive Director, Regine Stachelhaus, 
representing 12.5 per cent of total Board membership.
Shareholder Engagement
The Board remains committed to communicating with our 
shareholders and, where appropriate, submitting its views  
and considerations for consultation and feedback. Further 
details regarding this engagement with our shareholders  
can be found on page 43 of this report.
In accordance with the Code, all of the Directors will stand for 
re-election at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), with 
the exception of Regine Stachelhaus, who will be standing  
for election by shareholders for the first time, following her 
appointment to the Board in July 2013.

Board Composition and Independence
The membership of the Board as at 31 December 2013 is 
set out on pages 38 and 39, and on that date included six 
Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors. With 
the appointment of Regine Stachelhaus in July 2013, and the 
resignation of Ian Lewis from the Board in September 2013, 
there have been four different independent Non-Executive 
Directors, excluding the Chairman, on the Board during the 
course of the year. The attendance of the Directors at Board 
and Committee meetings is additionally set out on pages 38,  
51, 55 and 63 of this report. 
During the period, the Board has considered the independence 
of each Director, taking into account the guidance provided  
by the Code. The Chairman, Greg Lock, was considered by 
the Board to be independent on appointment, and each of 
Brian McBride, John Ormerod and Regine Stachelhaus are 
considered by the Board to be independent in their character 
and judgement. Brian McBride remains the Senior Independent 
Director, following his appointment to the Board in 2011. In this 
role, Mr McBride acts as an intermediary between the Chairman 
and the other Directors. The Chairman and Non-Executive  
Directors met twice throughout the year without the Executive 
Directors being present. 
The Board acknowledges that the Company is not in 
compliance with paragraph B.1.2 of the Code, which requires 
at least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, to be 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The founders of the 
Company, Philip Hulme and Peter Ogden, are Non-Executive 
Directors, but are not considered independent under the 
Code, due to their long tenure, substantial shareholding in the 
Company and their previously held executive positions with the 
Company. The Board continues to review this matter and, as 
a result of the external Board evaluation recently carried out,  
it remains clear that the contribution being made by these  
two Directors to the Board, not least due to their continuity  
of service and knowledge of the Company, is highly valued  
by its other members.
Roles and Responsibilities of the Board
The Board is responsible for the management and performance 
of the Group. It plays a key role in discussing, reviewing and 
approving the strategic objectives of the Group, and through 
the review of business plans and budgets submitted by the 
Executive Directors and senior management, is additionally 
responsible for ensuring that adequate resources are in place 
to meet these aims. The Board reviews the performance of 
the Executive Directors and senior management against the 
targets set for the delivery of these agreed objectives, including 
a monthly review of the financial performance of each of the 
Group’s in-country units. Additionally, the Board has the 
powers and duties conferred upon it by the relevant laws of 
England and Wales and the Computacenter plc Articles of 
Association. There is also a documented schedule of Matters 
Reserved for the Board which additionally include, amongst 
other things, the approval of acquisitions, major capital 
expenditure and Group strategy and budgets. This schedule 
is reviewed at least annually, or more frequently where required 
and, during the year, was updated once. This schedule can be 
found on our website at www.computacenter.com/investors. 
The Board held eight scheduled meetings during the year to 
deal with the standing items on its agenda, including reviewing 
and discussing any information provided to it by senior 
management. Additionally, the Board held a special meeting 
during the year to, amongst other matters, discuss and approve 
the return of approximately £75 million to the Company’ s 
shareholders, which was successfully completed in July 2013. 
Day-to-day management and operational activities are delegated 
to a duly authorised Group Executive Committee including, 
amongst others, the Executive Directors, Group Chief Operating 
Officer and Group Chief Commercial Officer. Other Board level 
matters are delegated to each of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, details of which can be found at 
pages 51 to 70 of this Annual Report and Accounts. The Terms 
of Reference for each Committee can be obtained from the 
Company’s website, www.computacenter.com/investors, or 
from the Company Secretary, upon request. The composition  
of each Committee appears on pages 51, 55 and 63 
following this report, as do reports from the Chairman of 
each Committee setting out the main responsibilities of their 
respective Committee and its main activities during the year. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate 
and their responsibilities are clearly defined in writing, reviewed 
annually and approved by the Board. In summary, the 
Chairman’s role is to lead and manage the Board, and to play a 
role in facilitating the discussion of the Company’s strategy by 
the Board. The Chairman actively encourages contribution from 
all Directors and is responsible for ensuring that constructive 
interaction is ongoing between the individual members of the 
Board. Externally, there have been no changes to the other 
significant commitments of the Chairman during the year which 
would impact the time he has to fulfil his role as Chairman of 
the Company.
The Chief Executive, in turn, is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of the Group’s operational activities and for the 
proper execution of strategy, as set by the Board. There is no 
dominant individual or group of individuals on the Board 
influencing its collective decision-making ability and the Board 
is comfortable that each of the Directors makes a valuable 
contribution to the Board. 
Board Effectiveness
Upon joining the Board, all Directors receive a comprehensive 
induction programme, tailored to their specific background and 
requirements. New Directors receive an induction pack which 
contains information on the Group’s business, its structure and 
operations, Board procedures, corporate governance related 
matters and details regarding Directors’ duties and 
responsibilities. All new Directors are introduced to the  
Group’s senior management team.

Enabling IT Users 
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013 Strategic report Governance Financial statements
All Directors receive appropriate documentation in advance  
of each Board and Committee meeting, including detailed 
briefings on all matters, in order to discharge their duties 
effectively in considering a matter and reaching a decision  
on it. 
A performance review of the Board, its Committees and 
Directors has been undertaken using an external facilitator, 
Nigel Davies, of NJMD. NJMD has no connection with the 
Company beyond this evaluation. The process this year 
involved each Director completing a detailed questionnaire, 
tailored to reflect the activities of the Board and its Committees 
during the year. Following this, a further follow-up interview was 
conducted with each Director, and the information from each 
questionnaire and interview was then analysed and included  
in a report for discussion and consideration by the Board as  
a whole. The review indicates that the Board is effectively run 
and administered, and is functioning well as a cohesive unit.  
It additionally found that there is appropriate opportunity for all 
Directors to participate in open and constructive debate, and 
did not find any major areas of concern or identify any matters 
which were of particular concern to individual Directors. It was 
noted that significant strategy review work had been carried 
out by the Board in 2013, and that the development of 
appropriate objectives against which to measure the 
Company’s future performance was work in progress. It was 
recommended that the role of the Senior Independent Director 
be formalised in writing, and plans are now in place to address 
this recommendation. 
The Company arranges insurance cover in respect of legal 
action against the Directors and, to the extent allowed by 
legislation, the Company has issued an indemnity to each 
Director against claims brought by third parties.
While the Company’s Articles of Association require a Director 
to be subject to election at the first AGM following his or her 
appointment and thereafter every third year, the Board has 
decided that, in accordance with the Code, with the exception 
of Regine Stachelhaus who will be standing for election for the 
first time, all Directors should be subject to re-election at the 
next AGM on 15 May 2014. All Directors will then be subject 
to re-election at each AGM thereafter. 
Board Support
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board 
on all corporate governance matters and for ensuring that all 
Board procedures are followed, applicable rules and regulations 
are complied with and the Board is continually updated on 
regulatory and governance matters. All Directors have access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
A procedure is in place to enable individual Directors to obtain 
independent professional advice, at the Company’ s expense, 
where they believe it is important to the furtherance of their duties.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises and values the importance of meeting 
the Company’s shareholders to obtain their views and has 
established a programme to communicate with shareholders, 
based on its financial reporting calendar. 
The Board is informed of any substantial changes in the 
ownership of the Company’s shares by the Company’s 
corporate brokers who provide monthly reports on that 
ownership. In addition, meetings are held with major 
shareholders following both the full-year and half-year results. 
Normally, these meetings are with the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director. The whole Board is briefed on the outcome  
of these meetings and any issues raised are discussed.
In addition, once a year, the Company’s top 15 shareholders 
are invited to meet individually with the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary to provide feedback on the Company’s 
management and raise other comments, albeit only a few 
shareholders take up this opportunity. Specifically, at these 
meetings, the Company Secretary discusses the Company’s 
corporate governance arrangements and invites feedback on 
any areas of particular interest from the relevant shareholder. 
The Chairman and the Senior Independent Director are 
contactable at the Company’s registered office to answer any 
queries that both institutional and individual shareholders may 
have. All of the Directors aim to attend the AGM and value the 
opportunity of welcoming individual shareholders and other 
investors to communicate directly and address their questions. 
In addition to mandatory information, a full, fair and balanced 
explanation of the business of all general meetings is sent in 
advance to shareholders. Resolutions at the Company’s 
general meetings have been passed on a show of hands and 
proxies for and against each resolution (together with any 
abstentions) are announced at such meetings, noted in the 
minutes, available on the Company’s website and notified to 
the market.

43 Accountability
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for maintaining and 
reviewing the Group’s systems of internal control and ensuring 
that the controls are robust and effective in enabling risks to be 
appropriately assessed and managed. The Group’s systems 
and controls are designed to manage risks, safeguard the 
Group’s assets and ensure the reliability of information used 
both within the business and for publication. This system of 
control is designed to reduce to a level consistent with the 
Board’s risk appetite, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board conducts an annual review of the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management systems. It is of 
the opinion that the Company has complied with the internal 
control requirements of the Code throughout the year. Where 
weaknesses or opportunities for improvement are identified, 
changes are implemented and monitored.
All systems of internal control are designed to identify, evaluate 
and manage significant risks faced by the Group continuously. 
The key elements of the Group’s controls are as follows:
Risk management
The primary responsibility for identifying and managing the  
risks faced by the Group lies with executive and operational 
management. A comprehensive risk management programme 
is developed and monitored by the Group Risk Committee, the 
members of which include senior operational managers across 
the Group, the Finance Director and the Group Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk. The Group Risk Committee is chaired by the 
Group’s Chief Operating Officer. 
The Board sets the Group’s risk appetite and, through the Audit 
Committee, reviews the operation and effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management activities. The Board receives regular 
reports from the Group Risk Committee and periodically 
reviews the strategic risks faced by the Group and key 
mitigation plans. 
Further information on the key risks facing the Company and 
the work of the Group Risk Committee can be found within  
the Risk report on pages 12 to 15. Through a programme  
of assessment, appropriate measures and systems of  
control are maintained and, where necessary, developed and 
implemented. Detailed business interruption contingency plans 
are in place for all key sites and these are regularly tested, in 
accordance with an agreed schedule.
Responsibilities and authority structure
The Board has overall responsibility for making strategic 
decisions and there is a written schedule of Matters Reserved 
for the Board. The Group Executive Committee meets on  
a monthly basis to discuss day-to-day operational matters  
and, with the implementation of the Group Operating Model 
within the UK and Germany thus far, ultimate authority and 
responsibility for operational governance sits at Group level. 
The decision has been made to implement the model 
additionally within the Group’s French business, and we 
anticipate that this will have been completed by the end  
of the first half of 2014. 
Control environment
The Group operates defined authorisation and approval 
processes throughout all of its operations. Access controls 
exist where processes have been automated to ensure the 
security of data. Management information systems have been 
developed to identify risks and to enable assessment of the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal control. Accountability  
is reinforced and further scrutiny of costs and revenues 
encouraged, by the linking of staff incentives to customer 
satisfaction and profitability.
Planning and reporting processes
A three-year strategic plan is prepared or updated by  
senior management annually and reviewed by the Board.  
A comprehensive budgetary process is completed annually 
and is subject to the approval of the Board. Performance  
is monitored through a rigorous and detailed financial and 
management reporting system, by which monthly results are 
reviewed against budgets and agreed targets for the period 
which, additionally, are compared to historic data as deemed 
appropriate, such as for the previous year. The results and 
explanations for variances are regularly reported to the Board. 
Appropriate action is taken where variances arise.
Management and specialists within the Finance Department 
are responsible for ensuring the appropriate maintenance  
of financial records and processes that ensure financial 
information is relevant, reliable, in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations and distributed both internally and 
externally in a timely manner. A review of the consolidated 
financial statements is completed by management to ensure 
that the financial position and results of the Group are 
appropriately reflected. All financial information published 
by the Group is subject to review by the Audit Committee.
Capital expenditure and investments
Procedures exist and authority levels are documented to 
ensure that proposals for capital expenditure are properly 
reviewed and authorised. Cases for all investment projects are 
reviewed and approved at divisional level. Major investment 
projects are subject to approval by the Board, and Board input 
and approval is sought for all merger and acquisition proposals.

Centralised treasury function
The Board has established and reviews regularly key  
treasury policies over matters such as counterparty exposure, 
borrowing arrangements, and foreign exchange exposure 
management. All cash payments and receipts are managed 
by centralised finance functions within each of the Group 
operating companies. During 2013, consistent with the 
ongoing implementation of the Group Operating Model, a 
coordinated Group treasury function has been established. The 
management of liquidity and borrowing facilities for customer 
specific requirements, ongoing capital expenditure and working 
capital of the business are all undertaken by the Group treasury 
function which reports to the Finance Director, with regular 
reporting to the Board.
Quality and integrity of staff
Rigorous recruitment procedures are in place to ensure 
that new employees are of a suitable calibre. Management 
continuously monitors training requirements, and ongoing 
appraisal procedures are in place, to ensure that required 
standards are maintained across the Group. Resource 
requirements are identified by managers and reviewed  
by the relevant Executive Committee.
Compliance Policies
The Company has in place a number of compliance policies 
which are applied, including those relating to Business Ethics 
and Anti-bribery. Any breach of these policies by an employee 
is considered a disciplinary matter and is dealt with accordingly. 
The Company’s Business Ethics policy outlines a procedure 
for ‘Whistleblowing,’ where concerns of wrongdoing can be 
reported to the Group Head of Internal Audit and Risk or the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Internal audit
The Group has an internal audit function led by the Group 
Head of Internal Audit and Risk who reports to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
The Board, acting through the Audit Committee, has directed 
the work of the Internal Audit Department towards those areas 
of the business that are considered to be of the highest risk. 
The Audit Committee approves a rolling audit programme, 
ensuring that all significant areas of the business are 
independently reviewed over, approximately, a three-year 
period. The programme and the findings of the reviews are 
continually assessed to ensure that they take account of the 
latest information and in particular, the results of the annual 
review of internal control and any shifts in the focus areas of  
the various businesses. The effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
department and the Group’s risk management programme  
are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held on 15 May 2014 at 
Computacenter House, 93-101 Blackfriars Road, SE1 8HL. The 
AGM notice of meeting sets out each of the resolutions being 
proposed. This notice will shortly be available for download

How this was calculated
We have used the main requirements of 
the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition).
Emission factors used are from the UK 
Government’s Conversion Factors 
supplied by the Department of 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
This activity has been conducted as 
part of our UK Environment 
Management System registered to ISO 
14001:2004 (EMS 71255).
Group properties included in this report 
are all current locations in the UK, 
Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, 
South Africa, Luxembourg, Switzerland, 
Malaysia and Hungary. 
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. 
Limitations to data collection
Less than 5 per cent of emissions were 
estimated or based on an average 
usage per square foot.
Our action to reduce carbon 
emissions in the UK
Installation of 4 Voltage Optimisation 
Units saving 7-10 per cent of electricity 
usage per year.
£4.5m of renewable electricity has been 
purchased for the UK sufficient for two 
years usage over the period 2013-2014.
Installation of eight new efficient gas 
heating systems across the UK.
£250,000 of investment in new 
technology helping to reduce emissions 
produced by our datacenters.  
The volume of electricity required for  
our datacenters is 45 per cent of the 
total required for the UK. They host 
customers’ Information Technology  
in the form of servers, thus reducing 
their carbon footprint. However, this 
increases the level of emissions that 
Computacenter produces. 
Investment was made in the 
replacement of nine new gas boiler 
systems, located at Hatfield and  
the London office, in order to  
increase efficiency.

Corporate governance
Under Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.2, the Company is 
required to include a Corporate Governance report within the 
Directors’ report. Information on our corporate governance 
practices can be found in the Corporate Governance report  
on pages 40 to 45, and the reports of the Audit, Remuneration

This Directors’ report, together with the other reports, forms 
the Management Report for the purposes of Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 4.1.8.
Results and dividends
The Group’s activities resulted in a profit before tax of  
£50.5 million (2012: £64.8 million). The Group profit for the 
year, attributable to shareholders, amounted to £33.2 million  
(2012: £49.1 million). The Directors recommend a final 
dividend of 12.3 pence per share totalling £16.7 million 
(2012: £15.8 million). Dividends are recognised in the accounts 
in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final 
dividend, when approved by the shareholders. As such, the 
amount recognised in the 2013 accounts, as described in note 
12, is made up of last year’s final dividend (10.5 pence per 
share) and the interim dividend (5.2 pence per share).
The final ordinary dividend for 2013, if approved at the 
forthcoming AGM, will be paid on Friday 20 June 2014. The 
dividend record date is set on Friday 23 May 2014 and the 
shares will be marked ex-dividend on Wednesday 21 May 
2014. The Company paid an interim dividend of £7.0 million  
in October 2013.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association set out the 
procedures for governing the Company. A copy of the Articles 
of Association, which were amended once during the year 
in order to facilitate the return of approximately £75 million 
to shareholders, is available on the Company’s website 
(www.computacenter.com/investors). 
Directors and Directors’ authority
The Directors who served throughout the year ended 31 
December 2013 were T ony Conophy , Philip Hulme, Greg Lock, 
Brian McBride, Mike Norris, John Ormerod and Peter Ogden. 
Additionally , Regine Stachelhaus was appointed to the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director in July 2013, and Ian Lewis stepped 
down from his position as a Non-Executive Director in September 
2013. Biographical details of each director , as at the date of this 
report, are given on pages 38 and 39. The Company’ s Articles of 
Association require at each AGM that those Directors who were 
appointed since the last AGM retire, as well as one-third of the 
Directors who have been the longest serving. The Board has 
decided, in accordance with the Code, that all Directors, with the 
exception of Regine Stachelhaus, will retire at each forthcoming 
AGM and offer themselves for re-election. The Nomination 
Committee has considered the re-election of each Director and 
recommends their re-election. Further details on the Committee’ s 
recommendations for the re-election of the Directors are set out  
in the Notice of AGM, as is the brief Curriculum Vitae of each 
Director, which collectively illustrate the skills and experience  
that the Directors bring to the Board. At the 2014 AGM,  
Ms Stachelhaus will offer herself for election to the Board for  
the first time following her appointment in July 2013. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide for a Board of 
Directors consisting of not fewer than three, but not more than 
20 Directors, who manage the business and affairs of the 
Company. The Directors may appoint additional or replacement 
Directors, who shall serve until the following AGM of the 
Company, at which point they will be required to stand for 
election by the members. A Director may be removed from 
office at a general meeting of the Company, by the passing of 
an Ordinary Resolution (provided special notice has been given 
in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006).
Members have previously approved a resolution to give the 
Directors authority to allot shares, and a renewal of this authority 
is proposed at the 2014 AGM. This authority allows the 
Directors to allot shares up to the maximum amount stated in 
the Notice of AGM (approximately one-third of the issued share 
capital) and this authority would generally expire at the following 
AGM. In addition, the Company may not allot shares for cash 
(unless pursuant to an employee share scheme) without first 
making an offer to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
existing holdings. This is known as rights of pre-emption. A 
resolution to allow a limited waiver of these rights was passed 
by the members at last year’s AGM. It is proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM that a similar waiver should be granted, 
which will represent approximately five per cent of the issued 
share capital. Full details of the proposed waiver are in the 
Notice of AGM. The current waiver expires at the conclusion  
of the 2014 AGM.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has executed deeds of indemnity with each 
of the Directors. These deeds contain qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions, indemnify the Directors to the extent 
permitted by law and remain in force at the date of this report. 
The indemnities are uncapped and cover all costs, charges, 
losses and liabilities the Directors may incur to third parties, 
in the course of acting as Directors of the Company or its 
subsidiaries.
Directors’ conflicts of interests
The Board has put in place a process whereby the Directors 
are required to notify the Company Secretary of any situations 
(appointments, holdings or otherwise), or any changes to such, 
which may give rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest 
with the Company. These notifications are then reviewed by the 
Board and recorded in a register maintained by the Company 
Secretary and, if appropriate, are considered further by the 
Directors who are not conflicted in the matter, to (if deemed 
appropriate) authorise the situation. The register of notifications 
and authorisations is reviewed by the Board twice a year. 
Where the Board has approved an actual or potential conflict, it 
has imposed the condition that the conflicted Director abstains 
from participating in any discussion or decision affected by the 
conflicted matter.

Capital structure
As at 28 February 2014, there were 138,965,137 fully paid ordinary shares in issue, all of which have full voting rights and there  
were no restrictions on the transfer of these shares. Additionally, there were 153,931,830 deferred shares in issue. Pursuant to the 
Company’ s share schemes, there are two employee trusts which, as at the year-end, held a total of 3,107,098 ordinary shares of  
6⅔ pence each, representing approximately 2.2 per cent of the issued share capital. 
During the year , the trusts purchased a total of 338,000 shares in order to ensure that the maturities occurring pursuant to these share 
option schemes could be satisfied. In the event that shares are held by these trusts before being transferred to employee participants 
pursuant to the schemes then, in line with good practice, the T rustees do not exercise the voting rights attaching to such shares. In the 
event that another entity or individual takes control of the Company , the employee share schemes operated by the Company have change 
of control provisions contained within them that would be triggered. Participants may , in certain circumstances, be allowed to exchange 
their options for options of an equivalent value over shares in the acquiring company . Alternatively , the options may vest early , in which case, 
early vesting under the executive schemes will generally be on a time-apportioned basis and under the Sharesave scheme, employees will 
only be able to exercise their options to the extent that their accumulated savings allow at that time. The Company was granted authority at 
the 2013 AGM, to make market purchases of up to 15,393,182 ordinary shares of 6⅔ pence each. This authority will expire at the 2014 
AGM, where approval from shareholders will be sought to renew the authority . During the period no shares were purchased for cancellation.
Significant agreements and relationships
Details regarding the status of the various borrowing facilities used by the Group are provided in the Finance Director’ s review on pages 
28 to 33. These agreements each include a change of control provision, which may result in the facility being withdrawn or amended upon 
a change of control of the Group. It is also not extraordinary within our business sector for our longer term Services contracts to contain 
change of control clauses that allow a counterparty to terminate the relevant contract in the event of a change of control of the Company .

Financial instruments
The Group’ s financial risk management objectives and policies are 
discussed in the Finance Director’ s review on pages 28 to 33.
Employee share schemes
The Company operates executive share option schemes 
and a performance-related option scheme for the benefit of 
employees. During the year, no options were granted under 
the executive share option schemes.
At the year-end, the options remaining outstanding under these 
schemes were in respect of a total of 592,000 ordinary shares 
of 6⅔ pence each (2012: 1,033,000 shares). During the year 
options over 441,000 shares were exercised and options over 
nil shares lapsed. The Company also operates a Performance 
Share Plan (‘PSP’) to incentivise employees. During the 
year, 1,049,579 ordinary shares of 6⅔ pence each were 
conditionally awarded (2012: 1,179,689 shares). At the year-end, 
awards over 3,066,742 shares remained outstanding under this 
scheme (2012: 3,207,545 shares). During the year , awards over 
571,821 shares were transferred to participants and awards over 
618,561 shares lapsed. In addition, the Company operates 
a Sharesave scheme for the benefit of employees. At the 
year-end, 3,292,614 options granted under the Sharesave 
scheme remained outstanding (2012: 2,971,058).
Corporate Sustainable Development
The Board recognises that acting in a socially responsible 
way benefits the community, our customers, shareholders, 
the environment and employees alike. Further information can 
be found in the report on pages 34 to 37 and covers matters 
regarding health and safety, the environment, equal opportunities, 
employee involvement, employee development and charitable 
donations. During the year, the Group did not make any political 
donations to any political party or organisation and it did not incur 
any political expenditure within the meaning of Sections 362 to 
379 of the Companies Act 2006.
Equal opportunities
The Group acknowledges the importance of equality and 
diversity and is committed to equal opportunities throughout the 
workplace. The Group’ s policies for recruitment, training, career 
development and promotion of employees, are based purely 
on the suitability of the employee and give those who may be 
disabled equal treatment to their able bodied colleagues. Where 
an employee becomes disabled, subsequent to joining the 
Group, all efforts are made to enable that employee to continue 
in their current job. However if, due to the specific circumstances, 
it is not possible for an employee to continue in their current job, 
they will be given suitable training for alternative employment 
within the Group or elsewhere.
The Group monitors and regularly reviews its policies 
and practices to ensure that it meets current legislative 
requirements, as well as its own internal standards. The Group 
is committed to making full use of the talents and resources 
of all its employees and to provide a healthy environment 
that encourages productive and mutually respectful working 
relationships within the organisation. Policies dealing with 
equal opportunities are in place in all parts of the Group, 
which take account of the Group’s overall commitment 
and also address local regulatory requirements.

Employee involvement and development
The Group is committed to involving all employees in significant 
business issues, especially matters which affect their work and 
working environment. A variety of methods are used to engage 
with employees, including team briefings, intranet, email and 
in-house publications. The Group will use one or more of  
these channels to brief employees on the Group’s performance 
and the financial and economic factors affecting the Group’s 
performance. In particular, the Group operates a Save As  
You Earn (‘SAYE’) share scheme, which is open to eligible 
employees, where employees are encouraged to save a fixed 
monthly sum for a period of either three or five years. Upon 
maturity of the scheme at the end of the relevant saving period, 
participants can purchase shares in the Company at a price  
set at the commencement of the saving period. The primary 
method used to engage and consult with employees is through 
team briefings, where managers are tasked with ensuring that 
information sharing, discussion and feedback happen on a 
regular basis.
The development of employee skills and careers, as well as the 
communication of Company goals, are driven by our e-FACE 
tool. Annual assessments via our e-FACE tool are a formal 
requirement of all managers. 
Employee consultative forums exist in each country to consult 
staff on major issues affecting employment and matters of policy, 
and to enable management to seek the views and opinions of 
employees on a wide range of business matters. Should there 
be cross-jurisdictional issues to discuss, a facility exists to 
engage a European forum made up of representatives from each 
country forum. The Group regularly reviews the performance of 
its employees through a formal review process, in order to 
identify areas for development. Managers are responsible for 
setting and reviewing personal objectives, aligned to corporate 
and functional goals. The Board closely oversees and monitors 
management skills and the development of talent to meet the 
current and future needs of the Group. The Board directly 
monitors and reviews closely, succession and plans for 
developing identified key senior managers. 
Business ethics
An ethics policy is operated by the Group, which commits 
Computacenter employees to the highest standards of ethical 
behaviour in respect of customers, suppliers, colleagues and 
other stakeholders in the business. The policy includes a 
requirement for all employees to report abuses or non-
conformance with the policy (‘Whistle blowing’) and sets  
out the procedures to be followed. The Group has additionally 
adopted a Code of Ethics specifically aimed at the prevention 
of bribery.

Computacenter’ s business activities, business model, its 
strategic goals and its performance are set out within the 
Strategic report on pages 2 to 37. The financial position of the 
Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are set out within the Finance Director’ s review on pages 28  
to 33. In addition, notes 26 and 27 to the financial statements 
include Computacenter’ s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, 
details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit  
and liquidity risk. Computacenter’ s balance sheet strength, its 
long-term contracts with customers and suppliers, as well as  
the different geographies within which it operates, provide the 
Directors with confidence that Computacenter is well placed  
to manage its business risks even during a prolonged period  
of economic uncertainty.
The Directors have, after due consideration and investigation, a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in 
office as auditor and a resolution approving the reappointment 
of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditor will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Pages 1 to 71, inclusive, of this Annual Report comprise the

Dear Shareholder
Set out from pages 51 to 54 is the Audit Committee report. 
In reporting to you, we have sought to respond to stakeholders’ 
changing requirements and expectations of audit committees. 
In particular we have:
• Set out in more detail how the Committee has reviewed  
and challenged the accounting policies and judgements 
which underlie our reported financial information;
• Identified how we assess the quality of our external  
audit and monitor the auditor’s independence;
• Initiated a process for an audit tender in 2014; and
• Assisted the Board in formally confirming that the 2013 
Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and 
understandable.
This is no doubt the start of improved communication  
between audit committees and shareholders, and we  
welcome feedback. 
John Ormerod
Chairman of the Audit Committee 
10 March 2014
 
Responsibilities of the Audit Committee
The key responsibilities of the Audit Committee include the 
review of financial information released by the Company, 
including its annual and half-year statements and results. The 
Committee is required to review, challenge, and report to the 
Board on the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting 
policies and the key judgements made in the preparation of 
financial information. The full responsibilities of the Committee 
can be found within its Terms of Reference on our website,  
at www.computacenter.com/investors 
Committee Membership, Meetings 
and Performance
All members of the Audit Committee are Independent Non-
Executive Directors of the Company, and are considered by  
the Board to have a wide range of business and financial 
experience to enable the Committee to perform effectively.  
The Board considers the Chairman of the Audit Committee to 
have recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes 
of the Code. The Committee met four times during the course 
of 2013. Meetings are attended by members and, at the 
Committee’s invitation, the Chairman of the Board, Chief 
Executive Officer, Finance Director, Group Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk and representatives of the external auditor. 
Others are invited to the Committee’s meetings to participate  
in topics relevant to their responsibilities or experience. The 
Committee also meets privately, at least on an annual basis, 
with the external auditor and the Group Head of Internal Audit 
and Risk. The Chairman of the Committee has regular informal 
discussions with the Finance Director, Group Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk and our external auditor. He also receives the 
reports of the Internal Audit department as they are issued, and 
additionally receives feedback on the preparation and audit  
of accounts as that work progresses and as any significant 
judgements arise. 
Main activities and significant 
areas considered
The Committee reviewed the primary areas of judgement  
made in the preparation of the Company’s financial information 
in 2013, and these included the following: 
Contract accounting and revenue recognition
The complexity of the contractual arrangements with several 
large customers requires significant consideration to be given 
to the most appropriate accounting treatment, and judgements 
made by management in particular around the recognition 
of revenue accruing from separate component parts of these 
contracts. During 2013, Management was able to reassess 
the expected outturn on certain long-term contracts. As  
the contracts progressed and uncertainties were resolved, 
the overall contract profitability was reassessed and a one-off  
gain of £4.0 million recognised. The Committee has reviewed the 
judgements made in this area by management and, after due 
challenge and debate, was content with the assumptions 
made and the judgements applied.

Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013
51 Following the Managed Services contract issues which 
arose within the Group’s German business in 2012, the 
Audit Committee directed that a full review of the current and 
forecasted financial performance for each problem contract 
within that business be undertaken by Management and 
reviewed by the Group’s auditors. The completion of this 
work established that three of these contracts were likely to 
be loss-making over the course of their lifetime. Following 
robust challenge and questioning around the work carried 
out, including the assumptions used and judgements made 
by Management in calculating the level of future losses on the 
contracts, the Committee agreed with the recommendation 
of Management that a provision of £10.7 million be taken 
within the Group’s 2013 Interim Accounts for forecasted 
losses on these three contracts both during the second 
half of 2013 and over the remainder of their lifetime.
Presentation of exceptional items
Exceptional items, such as for contract losses and 
reorganisation costs, have been disclosed within the Group 
financial statements in each of the past two years, and 
Management has now reclassified prior year numbers, 
specifically in relation to the contract losses in Germany 
outlined above, to ensure that corresponding numbers are 
consistently presented. Given the size of these losses and the 
desire to enable readers of the Company’s accounts to 
understand the underlying trading performance of the business 
in 2012 and 2013, it was considered necessary to treat these 
as exceptional in 2013, and to restate the 2012 results 
accordingly. The Committee received input from the external 
auditors in considering carefully all matters identified as 
‘exceptional’ in the Group’s financial results, to confirm that 
such accounting treatment is consistent with appropriate 
accounting standards and practice. The Committee concluded 
that the classification of items detailed as ‘exceptional’ within 
the Group financial results was appropriate. 
Impairment
The Committee considered whether the non-current and 
intangible assets within the Group’s French business should  
be impaired following the poor financial performance by  
the Group’s French business in the first half of 2013. The 
judgements in relation to asset impairment largely relate to  
the assumptions underlying the future performance of the 
business. As such, the Committee received relevant financial 
reports from Management, from which, it challenged and 
debated the assumptions underlying the forecasted information 
provided and Management’s recommendation as to the 
quantum of the impairment charge that should be taken.  
As a result the Committee agreed with the recommendation  
of Management that a non-cash impairment of £12.2 million  
be made to goodwill and acquired intangibles within the  
French business.
Going concern basis 
The application of the going concern basis was discussed by 
the Committee, in the context of the Group having returned 
approximately £75 million to its shareholders during the course 
of 2013 and suffered a statutory loss in the first half of the year. 
The review by the Committee of analysis prepared by 
Management supported the Board’s decision to seek an 
additional committed facility of £40 million for the Group to 
provide significant financial headroom to meet unexpected 
cash requirements if required, prior to it approving the return of 
capital transaction. The financial projections and review were 
updated at the end of the year and on that basis the 
Committee agreed that the 2013 financial statements were 
appropriately prepared on a going concern basis. 
Deferred tax assets
In 2012, the Company recognised certain deferred tax assets, 
stemming from accumulated tax losses within its French and 
German subsidiaries. The level of deferred tax asset recognition 
in relation to accumulated tax losses is underpinned by a  
range of judgements, and is substantially based on the future 
forecast profitability of these entities. The performance of the 
French business in 2013 has resulted in the need to write off 
£2.2 million of deferred tax assets as an exceptional item in 
2013. The Committee has therefore received and challenged 
appropriately the financial information relating to future 
profitability, and the assumption made within that information 
such as to the likelihood of their recoverability. 
Group ERP System
The Group successfully implemented its ERP system into its 
UK and German businesses in 2011. However, in 2013, the 
implementation of this system within its French business was 
less successful for a number of reasons. This resulted in a 
number of operational problems affecting, for a short period, 
the ability of the French business to manage the delivery of 
product and parts through its logistics system. This, in turn, 
had a resultant negative impact on the visibility and 
transparency of management reporting during the second half 
of 2013. Whilst it is clear that the financial performance of the 
French business has been impacted by these issues, they have 
now been resolved and the relevant order backlogs have been 
cleared. As difficulties with the ERP system are overcome, it  
will facilitate the implementation of the Group Operating Model, 
which will be used, amongst other things, as the engine to 
drive an improved business performance in the Group’s French 
business over the medium term. The Committee monitored the 
response of management to these issues and, in particular, 
received reports from management and the Group’s auditors 
that assured the Committee that they did not impact the 
reliability of the Group’s reported results.

Annual report
At the request of the Board, the Committee assisted with 
oversight of the procedures performed to provide the formal 
assurance now required from the Board that the Annual Report 
and Accounts is fair, balanced and understandable and that it 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. The 
new procedures are largely the formalisation of prior practice. 
The Committee advised the Board that appropriate procedures 
had been applied. 
Internal audit and controls
The Board accepts and acknowledges its overall responsibility 
for the Group’s systems of Internal Control and Risk 
Management, and to ensure that these work appropriately 
and effectively. On behalf of the Board, during the year, the 
Committee monitored the Group’s risk management and 
reviewed the effectiveness of its internal control procedures. 
A number of detailed areas for improvement are routinely 
identified and actions implemented as a result of the review 
of internal controls by Management and the internal audit 
function. The Committee monitors implementation of agreed 
improvements. In 2012, there were serious control failures 
in relation to the bidding and take-on of Managed Services 
contracts in Germany where much work has been done and 
improvements are ongoing. With the exception of those issues 
outlined above concerning the implementation of the Group 
ERP system into France, no other material control failures 
were identified in 2013. 
The Committee continues to oversee the Internal Audit 
function, and carried out a review of the department’s 
resources. The Committee received an update from the Group 
Head of Internal Audit and Risk at each meeting during the year 
on current audit activities, and any associated issues resulting 
from the completion of such work. The Chairman of the 
Committee additionally meets with the Group Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk on a number of occasions throughout the year, 
through which he is continually updated on the activities of the 
internal audit function, and receives a frequent assessment as 
to whether the function is adequately resourced. 
Following the contractual services issues which arose within the 
Group’ s German subsidiary in 2012, the Committee gave 
direction to the Group’ s internal audit function to focus on the 
large contract lifecycle. This has resulted in work and reports 
being reviewed by the Committee around the end-to-end 
contract bid, take-on and in life-service governance processes. 
Additionally, work has been carried out to review adherence 
across the Group to newly implemented industrialisation 
processes and authorisation structures, as part of the new 
Group Operating Model in place within the UK and Germany, 
and currently being rolled out across our French business. The 
Committee has also received reports and updates on the effect 
of the implementation of the now Group-wide ERP system in 
France, and carried out its periodic review of certain controls 
including treasury, foreign exchange, tax compliance and tax risk.
External audit
The Audit Committee is required to oversee the 
Company’s relationship with its external auditor, and to 
make recommendations in relation to the Board concerning 
the appointment, reappointment and remuneration of the 
external auditor. 
Appointment and independence of external auditor
The Committee considers the appointment or reappointment 
of the external auditor, including the timing of rotation of the 
incumbent audit partner, on an annual basis. Ernst & Young 
LLP have served as the Company’s auditors since it listed in 
1998. The Committee recommended that Ernst & Young LLP 
be appointed for the 2014 audit. In accordance with good 
governance practice, the Committee agreed to carry out an 
audit tender in 2014, with its recommendation to be put before 
shareholders for approval at the Company’s AGM in 2015.
Effectiveness
The Committee reviews the effectiveness and quality of the 
external audit process by:
• Reviewing the audit plan and monitoring changes in 
response to new issues or changing circumstances;
• Receiving reports on the results of the audit work 
performed;
• A post-audit review; and
• Considering the report of the Audit Inspection Unit on 
Ernst & Young LLP .
The Committee receives and reviews the annual audit plan 
from Ernst & Young LLP identifying the key risks to the 
business which will be subject to their audit process. In 2013, 
these risks included contract accounting and revenue 
recognition, presentation of exceptional items, impairment, the 
going concern basis of accounting, deferred tax assets and the 
effect of the Group ERP system implementation in France on 
the visibility and transparency of management reporting, due to 
the inherent Management judgements required in, or as a 
result of, these issues. At this planning stage, the Committee 
agrees with the auditors their assessment of materiality 
and overall scope of work and approves the audit fee 
arrangements. The Committee additionally assesses the 
quality of the audit process through the audit reporting from 
Ernst & Young LLP in relation to such issues. 
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external 
audit process by means of a detailed questionnaire which 
is completed by key stakeholders and relevant internal 
management. The results of the questionnaire were then 
discussed as a specific agenda item at the Committee meeting 
immediately following the completion of the questionnaire 
process, and any actions requested by the Company to 
enhance effectiveness were followed-up and appropriately 
monitored thereafter. The Committee additionally receives and 
reviews reports from Ernst & Young on their quality controls 
and independence policies. 
Computacenter plc 
Enabling IT Users 
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013
53 Auditor independence
The Committee places considerable importance on ensuring 
the continuing independence of the Group’s auditors. This 
topic is reviewed at least annually with the auditors, who also 
have procedures in place, to ensure they bring to bear 
appropriate scepticism and avoid conflicts of interest. 
In support of maintaining the auditor’s independence, the 
Committee has established a policy in relation to the scope 
and extent of provision of non-audit services by the Group’s 
auditors which is summarised on this page. During the year, 
the Committee monitored compliance with this policy by 
approving the audit fee and monitoring the level of non-audit 
work provided by the external auditor, resulting in non-audit 
fees being 22 per cent of the Ernst & Young LLP overall  
audit fee during 2013. This related primarily to additional tax, 
compliance and consulting work done on the Return of 
Value to shareholders. The Committee deemed appropriate 
to use the Company’s auditors for this work due to their 
existing and detailed prior knowledge and understanding 
of the business.
Summary of policy for engagement of 
auditors to undertake non-audit work
The external auditor is appointed primarily to report on the 
annual and interim financial statements. The Committee 
places a high priority on ensuring that this independent role of 
reporting to shareholders is not compromised. The Committee 
recognises, however, that there are occasions when the 
auditors are best placed to undertake other accounting, 
advisory and consultancy work in view of their knowledge 
of the Company’s business, confidentiality and cost 
considerations. The Committee has therefore established 
procedures to ensure that any non-audit work is only 
undertaken by auditors where there is no risk of compromise 
to their independence.
To this end, the Committee has formally defined areas of work 
for which the auditors will be prohibited from engagement and 
areas where, subject to following the stipulated processes of 
authorisation and where appropriate, competitive tendering, the 
auditors may be engaged. The former areas of work include 
the preparation of accounting records and financial statements 
which will ultimately be subject to audit. Currently, the latter 
areas of potential engagement may include acquisition due 
diligence and tax compliance and advice. In all cases significant 
non-audit engagements are subject to prior approval by the 
Audit Committee or if approval is required between meetings, 
by the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Other than in 
exceptional circumstances, the Committee does not expect the 
value of non-audit services to exceed the aggregate value of 
audit and audit related services in any financial year.

available on our website, www.computacenter.com/investors.
Membership and attendance
The members of the Nomination Committee are the 
independent Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman of 
the Board. However, input from all the Directors is sought by 
the Committee and it involves the Board as a whole when 
performing its key responsibilities. Details of the membership 
and attendance at Committee meetings during the year are 
provided opposite.
The Company Secretary is the secretary to the Committee.
Main activities of the Committee during 2013
The Nomination Committee met on three occasions during 
2013 and its work included:
•  Undertaking the process of identifying and nominating 
an additional Board member, following which Ms. Regine 
Stachelhaus was appointed to the Board in July 2013. 
The Committee engaged the executive search and 
recruitment firm Spencer Stuart for this process which, 
aside from for this type of engagement, has no other 
connection with the Company. 
•  Reviewing the performance of the Directors who stood for 
re-election at the 2013 AGM and recommending their 
re-election.
•  Reviewing, in my absence, the renewal of my appointment 
as Chairman of the Board.
•  Considering the composition of the Board through a review 
of the skills, knowledge and experience of the individual 
members and concluding on the appropriateness of the 
Board’s combined ability to adequately challenge and 
support the Company’s aspirations.
John Ormerod, currently the Company’s Audit Committee 
Chairman and a Non-Executive Director of the Board, was 
appointed to these roles on 31 October 2006. Under the terms 
of the Code, after nine years of service as a member of the 
Board, he will no longer be considered independent. As such, 
Mr Ormerod has notified the Company of his intention to step 
down as a Non-Executive Director of the Company and 
Chairman of the Company’s Audit Committee by no later than 
the date of the Company’s Annual General Meeting in May 
2015. The Company will now take steps to facilitate this 
change and, as part of this process, in 2014 the Nomination 
Committee will commence a process to recruit a new 
Non-Executive Director to chair the Company’s 
Audit Committee.

55 Annual Statement from the Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Remuneration Committee report  
for the financial year ended 31 December 2013. It is our first 
such report to be prepared in accordance with the new reporting 
regulations introduced in the UK during the course of 2013. 
In accordance with the new requirements, the remainder of this 
report is split into two sections. The first of these reports, from 
pages 57 to 62, sets out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
report, which will be offered for a binding shareholder vote at 
the Company’ s Annual General Meeting in 2014 (‘AGM’). 
There is additionally, from pages 63 to 70, our Annual 
Remuneration report. This discloses how the Group’ s current 
remuneration policy has been implemented in 2013, and includes 
information concerning the amount paid to the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors of the Board during 2013. In addition 
to this Annual Statement, it will be subject to an advisory vote  
of shareholders at the AGM. 
Aligning Executives and Shareholders
As a principle underlying its decision-making in 2013, the Committee 
has sought to ensure that the amount paid to Computacenter’ s 
Executive Directors is clearly linked with their performance and, most 
importantly , to the value that they have delivered to our shareholders 
during that time. The Committee did not believe it necessary to 
change the overall structure of Computacenter’ s remuneration  
policy during the year in order to achieve this objective.

Our performance is explained in more detail within the Strategic 
report on pages 2 to 37. However , broadly speaking 2013 was 
a year of good progress for the Group. Turnover and adjusted 
profitability grew for the fourth consecutive year , the Group carried 
out a return of cash of approximately £75 million to its shareholders, 
and increased its proposed ordinary dividend per share for the 
year to 17.5 pence. 
However , the Board has been disappointed with the performance 
of the Group’ s French business. It is also aware of the impact  
that the overall performance of our three onerous contracts in 
Germany has had on shareholder value at certain times during  
the reporting period, notwithstanding that the Group had made 
significant progress in stabilising the operational and financial 
performance of these contracts by the end of the year.
Remuneration outcomes for 2013
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors were not 
increased at the beginning of the reporting period, and will 
remain at their current level during the course of 2014.
The level of variable remuneration paid out to the Directors in 
respect of 2013 was affected by the result of our performance  
in France and the isolated issues within our German business 
referred to above. As a result, 61.2% of total potential bonus was 
paid out to the CEO, whilst the Group’ s Finance Director (‘CFO’) 
received 61.9% of his total potential bonus for the year . 
The Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards granted in March 
2011, which were due to vest in March 2014, will not be paid 
out for the Executive Directors or the top levels of senior 
management in the Group as relevant financial performance 
conditions were not met. 
Y ou will find more detail on these outcomes at pages 63 to 70 
of this report. 
It has been the role of the Committee to ensure that the 
performance of the Group is reflected in the remuneration paid 
out to its Executive Directors. It hopes that, having read this 
report, shareholders are of the opinion that we have performed 
this role appropriately and in line with their interests. 
Remuneration for 2014
Further detail on how our Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be 
applied in practice for the 2014 financial year, conditional on its 
proposed approval at our forthcoming AGM, is set out from 
pages 63 to 70 of this report. 
Shareholder views
During the year , I provided the Committee with general feedback 
from our major shareholders in respect of executive remuneration, 
particularly as a result of the consultation we carried out in respect 
of the most recent vesting of our PSP scheme, as is outlined in 
more detail on page 62. 
Where we have engaged with shareholders, we are grateful 
for the feedback that we have received. We continue to be 
committed to regular dialogue with them and hope to receive 
their support at our AGM in May 2014.

Computacenter’s Remuneration Policy report
This section is the Group’s Remuneration Policy (‘Policy’), as reviewed and approved by its Remuneration Committee.  
As required, it complies with Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013.
It is intended that the Policy will be put before shareholders for approval by way of a binding vote at the Company’s AGM  
on 15 May 2014. If approved by shareholders, the Policy will have effect immediately thereafter. Prior to that date, the 
Company’s existing remuneration policy will continue to apply. 
In implementing the Policy, it should be noted that the Remuneration Committee considers pay and working conditions 
in the wider group, as is further outlined on page 62.

executives of the calibre required to deliver  
the Group’s strategy.
Will reflect an individual’s responsibilities, performance,  
skills and experience.
Reviewed annually on 1 January taking into account the level  
of pay settlements across the Group, the performance of the 
business and general market conditions.
Salary levels at other organisations of a similar size, complexity 
and business orientation will be reviewed for guidance.
An exceptional review may take place to reflect a change in

Benefits
To provide a competitive level  
of employment benefits
No special arrangements are generally made for Executive Directors. 
Benefits currently include a car benefit appropriate for the role 
performed, participation in the Company’s private health and 
long-term sickness schemes, life insurance and income continuance 
schemes, and participation in all-employee share plans on the  
same basis as other eligible employees.
All of the Group’s UK and German tax-resident employees are 
eligible to participate in the Company’s SAYE Scheme.
If new benefits are introduced for a wider employee group,  
the Executive Directors shall be entitled to participate.
If, in the opinion of the Committee, a Director must relocate to 
undertake and properly fulfil his/her executive duties, a one-off  
cash payment may be made to cover reasonable expenses.
While there is no maximum amount as the cost of benefits is 
dependent upon costs in the relevant market, benefits will be 
set at levels which are competitive, but not excessive. 
n/a
Pension
To provide an income for retirement No special arrangements are made for Executive Directors.  
They are entitled to become members of the Group’s defined 
contribution pension scheme, which is open to all UK employees.
If the Executive Director so chooses, he/she may take the 
pension contribution as a cash alternative, which will be the  
same percentage of salary as the pension contribution foregone.
Pension contributions or allowances will not exceed 15 per cent 
of base salary.

Performance Related Pay
Annual Bonus
To incentivise the delivery of annual, short-term, 
stretching financial and non-financial objectives.
To align pay costs to affordability and the value 
delivered to shareholders.
The total sum due is paid in cash after completion of the 
relevant performance period.
The maximum annual bonus achievement will be  
200 per cent of Base Salary.
The Committee has discretion to vary bonus payments 
downwards or upwards if it considers the outcome would not 
be a fair and complete reflection of the performance achieved 
by the Group and/or the Executive Director. To the extent that 
this discretion is exercised, this will be disclosed in the relevant 
Remuneration Committee report and may be the subject of 
shareholder consultation if deemed appropriate.
The current bonus opportunities in 2014 are 130 per cent of Base 
Salary for the CEO and 100 per cent of Base Salary for the CFO. 
Increases above the current opportunities, up to the maximum limit 
may be made to take account of individual circumstances, which may 
include an increase in the size or scope of role or responsibility. 
Financial measures will normally 
be used to calculate at least a 
majority of bonus achievement 
and the remainder of annual 
bonus will normally be attributed 
to non-financial measures. 
Financial measures will normally 
include profitability , cost management, 
cash management and other 
appropriate measures. Non-financial 
targets will be stretching targets 
set by the Committee.
Targets are reviewed and approved 
annually by the Committee to 
ensure that they are stretching and 
adequately reflect the strategic aims 
of the Group.
Performance Share Plan
To align the interests of Executive Directors  
and shareholders. 
To incentivise the achievement of longer-term 
profitability and returns to shareholders, and growth 
of earnings in a stable and sustainable manner.
An annual grant of shares, or options to acquire shares, will be 
made subject to performance criteria. Awards normally vest after 
a three-year period.
The current maximum face value of annual awards granted in  
2014 is 200 per cent of salary for the CEO and 175 per cent  
of salary for the CFO.
Details of the performance conditions applied to awards granted 
in the year under review and to be granted in the forthcoming year 
are set out on pages 65 and 66. 
The Committee will review performance criteria in line with  
business priorities to ensure they are challenging and fair.
The maximum opportunity contained within the plan rules is:
Ordinarily 200 per cent of annual Base Salary or 400 per cent  
of annual Base Salary in exceptional circumstances. 
The Committee has discretion to vary the percentage of awards 
vesting downwards or upwards if it considers that the outcome 
would otherwise not be a fair and complete reflection of 
performance over the plan cycle. 
Earnings per share is the primary 
measure for our Performance Share 
Plans, and the Committee may 
exercise its discretion to introduce 
additional or alternative measures.
In the event of serious misconduct 
of an Executive Director, or the 
misstatement of financial results, 
these awards may be subject to 
malus or clawback provisions at 
the discretion of the Committee.

Other
Chairman and Non-Executive Director Fees
To ensure that the Group is able to attract and retain 
experienced and skilled Non-Executive Directors.
Fee levels are determined with reference to those paid by other 
companies of similar size and complexity and taking into account 
the scope of responsibilities and the amount of time that is expected 
to be devoted during the year. No individual is involved in the 
process of setting his/her remuneration. 
Fee levels are normally reviewed bi-annually. They may also be 
increased on an ongoing or temporary basis to take into account 
changes in the working of the Board. 
The Chairman of the Board receives a fixed fee. Other Non-
Executive Directors receive a basic fee and additional fees are 
payable for the Chairmanship of the Board Committees and for the 
additional responsibility of being the Senior Independent Director. 
Travel expenses and hotel costs are also paid where necessary. 
2014 fee levels for the incumbents are as follows:
Non-Executive Chairman: £170,000 
Non-Executive Director Base Fee: £45,000 
Supplementary Fee for Senior Independent Director: £6,000
Fee for:
Audit Committee Chair: £14,000 
Remuneration Committee Chair: £8,000
Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Group’s 
incentive arrangements or share 
schemes and are not eligible for 
pension or other benefits.
Share Ownership Guidelines
To strengthen alignment between Executives 
and shareholders.
Levels are set in relation to annual base salary, and are normally 
required to be built over a three-year period. The Committee retains 
discretion to extend this on an individual basis, if it believes that it is 
fair and reasonable to do so.
Options which have vested unconditionally, but are as yet 
unexercised, will be included on a net basis, for the purposes of 
calculating shareholdings, as will shares held by an Executive’s 
spouse or dependants. 
The Committee will regularly review the minimum  
shareholding guidelines.
There is no maximum, but minimum levels have been set at 200 per 
cent of Base Salary for the CEO and 100 per cent of Base Salary for 
other Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors are not required 
to hold shares in the Company.

Further detail on the Policy
Changes made to policy
There have been no changes to the policy for salary, annual 
bonus, pension or other benefits included in the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration package since the release of our 
2012 Annual Report and Accounts.
However, within the Policy it is proposed that a change be 
made to the long-term incentive plan, which will include 
an arrangement to claw-back awards which have previously 
vested in Executive Directors, in certain circumstances.
Additionally, as from April 2013, and as referred to in our 
2012 Annual Report and Accounts, the period granted for 
compliance with the minimum shareholding requirements 
has been reduced from five to three years.
Explanation of performance measures
The performance measures in respect of variable remuneration 
outlined within the Policy are heavily weighted towards the 
financial performance of the Group, and therefore to the value 
that the business delivers to its shareholders. 
In the period following our 2012 Annual Report and Accounts, 
the Committee has carried out a full review of potential 
performance criteria for the PSP scheme. This has taken place 
with the assistance of the Group’s remuneration consultants, 
Mercer, and has resulted in the performance criteria structure 
outlined in the Policy, and the measures for 2014 as outlined 
on page 65.
It should be noted that no performance targets are set for the 
Group’s SAYE scheme, in which the Executive Directors can 
participate. This plan is open to all eligible Group employees, 
and is designed to incentivise them to build a shareholding in 
the Company, thus aligning their interests with those of the 
Group’s shareholders. 
Computacenter plc 
Enabling IT Users 
Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013
59 Policy for the remuneration of Group employees
The remuneration of employees more generally across the Group 
is based on three fundamental principles. Firstly , that it allows the 
Group to retain the level of talent necessary to implement the 
strategy as set by the CEO and Board. Additionally , that levels of 
remuneration should be sufficient to achieve this aim, but should 
never be higher than is necessary to do so. Finally, with limited 
exceptions, the more significant the ability of an employee to 
influence the Company’ s financial results through their individual 
performance, the higher the proportion of their remuneration 
should be performance-based.
The level and design of variable pay takes into account the 
need to avoid incentivising the Group’s employees to act in  
a manner that is inconsistent with the Group’s risk appetite,  
as set by the Board.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The remuneration package awarded to a newly-recruited 
Executive Director will be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee in accordance with the terms of the Policy. Each 
component will be subject to the same limits as specified in  
the Policy. Additionally, to facilitate recruitment, the Committee 
will normally offer shares to any newly-appointed Executive 
Director up to the value of, and subject to similar performance 
and timing criteria as, shares and cash bonuses given up as  
a result of terminating prior employment to join the Company. 
Any such award made will be subject to clawback and  
malus provisions that the Remuneration Committee deems  
to be appropriate.
Where a newly appointed Executive Director is required 
to relocate internationally, the Group may pay the costs of 
relocation including housing, travel, taxation advice, shipping 
costs and education for dependants. Additionally, any 
Executive Director based outside of the UK will be eligible 
to participate in insurance and other benefits in line with 
local practice. 
Non-Executive Directors will be appointed in accordance 
with the terms set out in the Policy by way of an appointment 
letter. The level of fee for a newly-appointed Chairman 
would take into account fee levels in the market, the nature 
of the commitment required and the experience of the 
individual concerned.
Service Contracts and Loss of Office Payments
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment  
are kept for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s 
registered office. 
Executive Directors
The Executive Directors each have a service contract with 
the Company, which provides for a 12-month notice period 
from each party. 
Fixed Pay
If an Executive Director’s employment is terminated, any 
compensation arrangements will not normally be beyond 
those set out in their service contract. In the normal course of 
events, an Executive Director will work their contractual notice 
period and receive usual salary payments and benefits during 
this time. In the event of a termination where Computacenter 
requests that the Executive Director ceases work immediately, 
a payment in lieu of notice may be made that is equal to fixed 
pay, pension entitlements and other benefits. 
Variable Pay
Whilst outstanding awards under the performance-linked 
elements of an Executive Director’s package will normally 
lapse if he or she leaves the Company before the payment 
or vesting date, the Company may still make a pro-rated 
performance-related payment of annual bonus or unvested 
long-term incentives. This will be based on the period of time 
served from the start of the performance period to the date  
of termination. Such a payment may be made if the individual 
concerned is deemed by the Committee to leave the Company 
as ‘a good leaver’. The circumstances under which a departing 
Executive Director will be a ‘good leaver’ include death, 
disability, injury, ill-health, redundancy, retirement, the award 
holder’ s employing company or business being transferred  
out of the Group, or any other reason the Committee  
deems appropriate. 
Any such payment will normally be delayed until the applicable 
performance conditions have been determined for the relevant 
period, but may be paid out immediately at the discretion of 
the Committee. Other than in these ‘good leaver’ scenarios,  
no pay-outs will be made for performance-linked elements 
of remuneration. 
Where the Executive Director participates in one or more of the 
Company’s all-employee share schemes, his awards may vest 
upon termination in accordance with applicable scheme rules. 
In the event of a takeover or winding-up of Computacenter 
(which is not part of an internal re-organisation of the Group), 
PSP awards may also vest to the extent determined by the 
Committee taking into account the period that has elapsed 
since the awards were granted, and the performance  
achieved by the Executive Director against any applicable 
performance targets. 
In any event, the Committee shall not sanction rewards for 
failure and will seek to mitigate any termination payments 
where possible.
Additional Expenses
In the event that a Director’s employment is terminated 
for any reason other than gross misconduct, reasonable 
outplacement, legal fees and, where applicable, repatriation 
costs for the exiting Director may be paid by the Company, 
at the discretion of the Committee.

Remuneration Committee report  continued Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Non-Executive Directors
In respect of Non-Executive Directors, the Company’s policy 
is that all Non-Executive Directors shall be appointed pursuant 
to a letter of appointment. These provide for an initial period of 
three years, subject to renewal by the Company thereafter. The 
appointment may be terminated, by either the Company or the 
Non-Executive Director on three months’ written notice. There 
is no obligation on the Company to pay compensation for loss 
of office. All Non-Executive Directors are currently subject to 
annual re-election by shareholders at the Company’s AGM, 
in accordance with the Code.
Additional arrangements for loss of office
There are no agreements currently in place between the 
Company and any of its Directors providing for additional 
compensation for loss of office or employment, other than 
as disclosed in this report.
Exceptions to the Policy
The Policy, as set out in this report, comprises the full suite 
of possible components for the remuneration of Directors 
at Computacenter.
Notwithstanding the restrictions laid out in the Policy, where 
the Company has made a commitment to a Director which:
• was in accordance with the then prevailing remuneration 
policy at the time that the commitment was made; and/or
• was made before the Director became a Director; and/or
• was made before the rules on binding votes on 
remuneration policies came into effect,
then the Company will continue to give effect to it, even if it 
is inconsistent with the remuneration policy of the Company 
which is in effect at that time. Accordingly, earlier remuneration 
policies of the Company will continue to apply in relation to 
such awards granted under any company long-term incentive 
plan and options granted under the Company’s all-employee 
Sharesave Scheme, prior to the approval of the Policy, as these 
may be granted under one policy and vest or be exercised 
under a later one. Details of these previous commitments are 
included within previous Computacenter Annual Reports at 
www.computacenter.com/investors.

61 In developing the scenarios, the following assumptions 
have been made:
Minimum threshold 
• Only total fixed pay is received (i.e. base salary, benefits  
and pension), and there is no vesting of any of 
Computacenter’s variable remuneration schemes; 
• Benefits are those projected to be received by the 
Executive Director in 2014; and
• Pension is measured by applying cash in lieu rate  
against salary in 2014.
Base Benefits Pension Total Fixed
Group CEO £500,000 63,863 25,000 588,863
Group CFO £325,000 16,866 16,250 358,116
On-target
This is based on what an Executive Director would receive 
if performance was in line with the Company’s expectations, 
which would result in the following scenario:
• Fixed pay is received;
• Annual bonus pays out at 77.5 per cent of total potential 
bonus award (i.e. 130 per cent of Base Salary for the 
CEO and 100 per cent of Base Salary for the CFO) for 
performance in line with expectations; and
• A PSP award with a face value of 200 per cent of base salary 
for the CEO and 175 per cent of base salary for the CFO (in 
line with the awards being granted to the Executive Directors 
in 2014), pays out at 50 per cent of maximum, being the 
appropriate threshold level of vesting.
Maximum 
This is based on what an Executive Director would receive if 
performance was in line with the following scenario:
• Fixed pay is received;
• Full pay-out of annual bonus (i.e. 130 per cent of salary 
for the CEO, and 100 per cent of salary for the CFO); and
• A PSP award with a face value of 200 per cent for the  
CEO and 175 per cent of base salary for the CFO (in line 
with the awards being granted to the Executive Directors 
in 2014) pays out at 100 per cent of maximum. 
It should be noted that, as required by the regulations, 
performance share plan awards are set out at face 
value, with no share price growth assumptions. 
External Appointments 
The Executive Directors are permitted to serve as Non-
Executive Directors of other companies provided that their 
appointment has first been approved by the Chairman of 
the Board. The Board will review the time commitment of 
all outside appointments and ensure that it is satisfied that 
this will not negatively impact upon the executive’s time 
commitment to Computacenter. The Executive Directors 
are allowed to retain their fees for such appointments.
Statement of consideration of employment 
considerations elsewhere in the Group
When setting executive remuneration, consideration is 
given to pay and employment conditions of employees of the 
Company and policies elsewhere in the Group. The average 
annual salary increase of Computacenter Executive Directors  
in 2013 was 0 per cent, compared to a possible increase of  
5 per cent for full-time employees achieving a very high level  
of performance.
Whilst only Executive Directors and senior executives participate 
in the PSP plan, other full time employees in the UK and 
Germany can participate in the Group’s All Employee SAYE 
scheme. This plan is not subject to performance conditions, 
but requires the employee to remain employed at the end of 
the term of the scheme which they have joined. This plan has 
been extremely successful, and is increasing in popularity 
amongst our employees, with take-up increased by 87  
per cent in 2013. 
There has additionally been a rise of 7.1 per cent in the  
base fee for Non-Executive Directors in 2014, which took  
place following a benchmarking exercise carried out by 
the Company’s remuneration consultant, Mercer. Fees 
were previously increased in January 2012.
Whilst the Company has not formally consulted with employees 
when drawing up the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the 
Committee has considered any informal feedback received 
via employee staff surveys or other channels and updates 
provided to it by the Group HR Director, Barry Hoffman. 
Statement of consideration of shareholders’ views
The Remuneration Committee takes very seriously the view 
of shareholders when making any changes to executive 
remuneration arrangements. It continues to welcome 
shareholders’ views on executive remuneration packages.
The Group consulted with its major shareholders during  
the second half of the year around its decision to include 
exceptional losses arising from the three onerous contracts in 
Germany, within the calculation for the vesting of PSP awards 
granted in 2011, which were due to vest in March 2014. As  
a result, there has been no PSP related vesting payout for the 
Executive Directors or the top levels of senior management  
in respect of that scheme. 
The Chairman of the Board also met with a number of the 
Company’s largest shareholders in December 2013, following 
which remuneration based feedback in respect of the 
Executive Directors was fed back to each of the Board 
and the Remuneration Committee.

Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
The key responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are 
to determine on behalf of the Board:
•  The Company’s general policy on executive remuneration; 
and
• The specific remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors, the Chairman of the Board and senior executives 
of the Company including, but not limited to, base salary, 
annual performance-related bonuses and long-term share 
incentive awards.
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors. All Directors are subject 
to the overriding principle that no person shall be involved in 
the process of determining his or her own remuneration. 
The full responsibilities of the Committee are contained within 
its terms of reference, which are available on our website at 
www.computacenter.com/investors.
Membership and attendance
The Remuneration Committee is made up of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board, 
who was considered to be independent on appointment. 
Details of the membership of the Committee and attendance 
of the members at Committee meetings during the year, is 
provided below. 
The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings by invitation, 
as does the Group’s Human Resources Director and Group 
Head of Financial Planning where financial information 
provided requires additional background or explanation to 
facilitate the considerations of the Committee. The Group 
Company Secretary is the secretary to the Committee.
The principal adviser to the Committee is Mercer, who was 
first selected by the Committee in 2010 by way of a tender 
process. During the year, Mercer provided advice to the 
Company in respect of the benchmarking of Director and Senior 
Management remuneration, and the contents of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Committee report as set out on pages 56 to 70. 
The total fees paid by the Company to Mercer in 2013 in respect 
of this advice was £43,000. The Committee considers the advice 
that it receives from Mercer to be independent considering, 
amongst other things, that Mercer provided no other services to 
the Company during the year other than those outlined above.  
Mercer is a founder member of the Remuneration Committee 
Group, and adheres to its code.
The Committee considers comparative practice in the 
European technology sector, FTSE techmark 100 companies 
and FTSE 250 companies. However, such market data is 
used by the Committee to inform rather than drive policy 
and decision making.

As a result, 61.2 per cent of maximum bonus was paid to the CEO, and 61.9 per cent was paid to the CFO. The actual 
performance targets set at the beginning of the performance period are not disclosed as they are considered to remain 
commercially sensitive at this time. We will generally disclose these targets retrospectively at a time that the Committee  
considers that they are no longer commercially sensitive. 
LTIPs/PSPs
There were no pay-outs pursuant to the 2011 PSP Scheme as the relevant performance criteria threshold was not reached due 
to an exceptional item being included within the calculation of performance. The performance criteria for these awards are set out

Minimum Shareholding Requirements
In accordance with the Group’ s minimum shareholding guidelines, the Chief Executive Officer is required to build up a shareholding 
that is equal to 200 per cent of his/her gross salary. In respect of the Chief Financial Offer, the threshold that is expected to be 
achieved is 100 per cent of his/her gross salary. It is additionally expected that the Executive Director will achieve these levels within 
three years of appointment. For the purposes of these requirements, options which have vested unconditionally, but are as yet 
unexercised, will be included on a net basis, for the purposes of calculating shareholdings, as will shares held by an Executive’ s 
spouse or dependants. There is no requirement for the Non-Executive Directors of the Company to hold shares.

Note: There have been no changes to this position as at 28 February 2014. 
1.  There are no conditions relating to the performance of the Company or individual for the vesting of this scheme.
2. There are performance conditions for this scheme as set out below the table on page 66.
3. Based on the Company’s closing share price as at 28 February 2014.
Executive Directors are deemed to be interested in the unvested shares held by the Computacenter Employee Benefit Trust 
(3,065,133 ordinary shares held as at 31 December 2013) and the Computacenter Quest Trust (41,965 ordinary shares held 
as at 31 December 2013).
Dilution Limits
Computacenter uses a mixture of both new issue and market purchase shares to satisfy the vesting of awards made under 
its Option, PSP and Sharesave plans. In line with best practice, the use of new or treasury shares to satisfy awards made 
under all share schemes, is restricted to 10 per cent in any 10-year rolling period, with a further restriction for discretionary 
schemes of 5 per cent in the same period. As at the year-end, the potential dilution from awards under all share plans during 
that 10 year period was approximately 3.79 per cent and the potential dilution from awards under the discretionary schemes 
was approximately 1.38 per cent. 
Payments to past Directors and Payments for Loss of Office
There have been no payments made to past Directors. Ian Lewis stood down as a Non-Executive Director of the Board  
during the year, but did not receive any payment for loss of office.

which runs to the conclusion of the third Annual General Meeting following their appointment, which may be renewed at that 
point for a further three-year term. The letters of appointment provide that should a Non-Executive Director not be re-elected  
at an AGM before he is due to retire, then his or her appointment will terminate. The Board has agreed that all Directors will  
be subject to re-election at the AGM on 15 May 2014, with the exception of Ms Regine Stachelhaus, who will be subject to 
election for the first time at that meeting.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year
Executive Director Remuneration for 2014 will be in accordance with the terms of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
as set out on pages 57 to 62 of this report. 
2014 Base Salaries
The base salaries of the CEO and CFO are not increasing in 2014. 
2014 Annual Bonus Scheme 
The performance measures and weightings for the 2014 Annual Bonus Scheme will be as follows: 
The proposed levels for 2014 have been set to be challenging relative to our 2014 business plan. The targets themselves, as  
they relate to the 2014 financial year, are deemed by the Committee to be commercially sensitive and therefore have not been 
disclosed. To the extent that they are deemed to no longer be commercially sensitive, these targets will be included within our 
2014 Annual Report on Remuneration. 
2014 PSP Scheme
The award levels of Performance Shares for the Executive Directors in the 2014 financial year are 200 per cent of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 150 per cent of salary for the Chief Financial Officer. The 2014 financial year LTIP awards will be subject to 
the following performance conditions:
Below Threshold 
(0% vesting)

(25% vesting)
On-target 
(50% vesting)
Maximum 
(100% vesting)
Absolute Growth of Company Earnings per Share < than 7.5% 7.5% 10% 20%
In respect of the growth of Earnings per Share, awards will vest on a straight line between these points. These targets will require 
management to deliver a strong, sustainable performance over the period.

The Committee is grateful for the continuing support of shareholders, and in order to ensure that this continues, the Committee 
will ensure that it consults with shareholders on major issues on which it feels it is appropriate to do so. It will also continue to 
adhere to its underlying principle of decision-making that Executive Director pay must be linked to performance and the 
sustainable delivery of value to our shareholders.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation 
to the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
company law and regulations and those International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.  
Under Company law, the Directors must not approve the Group 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are required to 
prepare financial statements for each financial year which present 
fairly the financial position of the Company and of the Group  
and the results and cash flows of the Group for that period. In 
preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable;
•  state whether applicable accounting standards have  
been followed, subject to any material departures being 
disclosed and explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper and adequate 
accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy,  
at any time, the financial position of the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the accounts and the Directors’ Remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence, taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Annual Report and  
Accounts 2013
71 We have audited the Group financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 34. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 71, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We identified the following risks that we believe to have the greatest impact on our audit strategy and scope; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
• accounting for long-term contracts, including the timing of revenue recognition and the assessment of costs to complete  
on a percentage of completion contract, and loss-making contracts;
• the presentation of items as exceptional within the income statement;
• the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets in respect of the French operating segment;
• the implementation of the Group ERP system in France during the year; and
• the recognition and measurement of deferred taxation assets in France and Germany.

Our application of materiality
We applied the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effects of misstatements  
on our audit and the financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person relying on the financial statements, would be changed or influenced. We also determine a level of 
performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability 
that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be 
material for the financial statements as a whole. We determined materiality for the Group to be £3.5 million, which is approximately 
5% of profit before taxation and non-recurring exceptional items. On the basis of our risk assessment, together with our assessment 
of the Group’ s overall control environment, our judgement is that overall performance materiality for the Group should be 75%  
of materiality, namely approximately £2.6 million. Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that total detected and 
undetected audit differences do not exceed our materiality of £3.5 million for the financial statements as a whole.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.2 million,  
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit focused on three operating locations which were subject to full scope audit for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
T ogether with the Group functions, which were also subject to a full scope audit for the year ending 31 December 2013, these 
locations represent the principal business units of the Group and account for 98 per cent of the Group’ s total assets, 96 per cent  
of the Group’ s revenue and 93 per cent of the Group’ s operating profit. Audits of these locations are performed at a materiality  
level calculated by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned. 
The Group audit team follows a programme of planned site visits, either meeting with the teams in the component locations or in 
which the component team attends meetings in the UK. This is designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor has direct 
contact with the full scope location teams on a regular basis.
The way in which we scoped our response to the risks identified above was as follows:
• we carried out testing over those controls supporting contract accounting and the recognition of revenue in respect of 
contract income. We read contracts and contract financial models and challenged management’s assumptions on costs  
to complete, where appropriate. For a sample of contracts, we performed testing of revenue, analytical procedures and 
assessed whether the disclosure and selection of contract accounting policies complied with IFRS;
• we considered items classified as exceptional to ensure that they warranted the additional disclosure outlined in IAS 1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’.
• we challenged management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for Computacenter France, described in note 15 to 
the financial statements, including specifically the cash flow projections, discount rates, perpetuity rates and sensitivities used;
• we tested processes and controls, both prior to and subsequent to the implementation of the Group IT system, in France  
and performed audit procedures on the cutover of data on introduction of an IT system;
• we considered the appropriateness of management’s assumptions and estimates in relation to the likelihood of generating 
suitable future profits to support the recognition of deferred tax assets described in note 10, challenging those assumptions 
and considering supporting forecasts and estimates.

73 Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading. 
In particular , we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair , balanced and understandable and whether the annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 50, in relation to going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 
2013 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

79 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
The consolidated financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised for issue  
in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 March 2014. The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by 
MJ Norris and FA Conophy. Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are 
publicly traded.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’),  
as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 
and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000)  
except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at 
31 December each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent 
company, using existing GAAP in each country of operation. Adjustments are made on consolidation for differences that may 
exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profit and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have 
been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date  
on which the Group no longer retains control.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group  
and is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders’ equity.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year. Except as noted below, 
adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group. They may however give 
rise to additional disclosures. The other pronouncements which came into force during the year were not relevant to the Group:
IFRS 12: Disclosure of interests in other Entities
IFRS 12 sets out the requirements for disclosures relating to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates 
and structured entities. The requirements in IFRS 12 are more comprehensive than the previously existing disclosure 
requirements for subsidiaries. This amendment has had no effect on the Group’s financial position, performance or 
its disclosures.
IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when  
an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. IFRS 13 defines  
fair value as an exit price. As a result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group re-assessed its policies for measuring fair values,  
in particular, its valuation inputs such as non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities. IFRS 13 also requires 
additional disclosures.
Application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements of the Group. Additional disclosures where 
required, are provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined.
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income – Amendments to IAS 1
The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in OCI. Items that will be reclassified (‘recycled’) to profit  
or loss at a future point in time (e.g., net loss or gain on cash flow hedges) have to be presented separately from items that  
will not be reclassified (e.g., revaluation of land and buildings). The amendments affect presentation only and have no impact  
on the Group’s financial position or performance.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
IAS 1 Clarification of the requirement for comparative information (Amendment)
These amendments clarify the difference between voluntary additional comparative information and the minimum required 
comparative information. An entity must include comparative information in the related notes to the financial statements when  
it voluntarily provides comparative information beyond the minimum required comparative period. The amendments clarify that 
the opening statement of financial position (as at 1 January 2012 in the case of the Group), presented as a result of retrospective 
restatement or reclassification of items in financial statements does not have to be accompanied by comparative information in 
the related notes. As a result, the Group has not included comparative information in respect of the opening statement of financial 
position as at 1 January 2012. The amendments affect presentation only and have no impact on the Group’s financial position 
or performance.
Critical judgements and estimates
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires management to make judgements on how to apply the Group’s 
accounting policies and make estimates about the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements  
and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
The more significant judgements and estimates, where a risk exists that a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets  
and liabilities in the next financial year could occur, relate to:
• revenue recognition where, on a limited number of support and managed services contracts, an estimate of the total  
contract costs is required to determine the stage of completion. The policy on recognition of contractual services revenue 
explains how any losses on contracts are accounted for;
• estimation of residual value of assets owned to support certain contracts;
• impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, which is based upon estimates of future cash flows and discount rates for  
the relevant cash-generating units;
• the estimate of the value of the contingent consideration payable on acquisitions where that consideration is based on  
future performance or conditions;
• recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward, which are dependent upon estimates of future 
profitability of certain Group companies; and
• other estimated tax positions, where the decisions of tax authorities are uncertain.
Further information is provided within this note summarising significant accounting policies, and notes 10 and 15 to the 
financial statements.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold buildings 25–50 years 
Short leasehold improvements shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease
Fixtures and fittings
– Head office 5–15 years
– Other shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease
Office machinery, computer hardware 2–15 years
Motor vehicles 3 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the 
asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the 
income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of 
the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value  
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease 
liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly 
against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Intangible assets
Software and software licences
Software and software licences include computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware. These assets are 
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value. Amortisation is calculated on straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful life. Currently software is amortised over four years.
The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the 
estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Software under development
Costs that are incurred and that can be specifically attributed to the development phase of management information systems  
for internal use are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, once the asset becomes available for use.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business are carried initially at fair value. Following initial recognition intangible assets are 
carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no 
residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative 
expenses as follows:
Existing customer contracts 5 years
Existing customer relationships 10 years
Tools and technology 7 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 (Revised) using the purchase method. Any excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  
is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised. Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity 
accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed 
for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, 
usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount. Where an asset does not have independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is assessed for the cash-generating 
unit to which it belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset 
or cash-generating unit. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense 
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the 
assets or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has  
been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognised.  
The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior 
years. As the Group has no assets carried at revalued amounts, such reversal is recognised in the income statement.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Investment in associates
The Group’s interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither 
subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes  
in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual 
investments. The Group income statement reflects the share of the associate’s results after tax. Where there has been a change 
recognised in other comprehensive income of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any such change in the Group 
statement of other comprehensive income.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete  
or slow-moving items. Costs include those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, on a first-in, 
first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to  
make the sale.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised at their fair value which initially equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable 
transaction costs associated with the investment.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described in each category below.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30–90 day terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an 
allowance for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer 
probable. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments comprise deposits held for a term of greater than three months from the date of deposit and which is 
not available to the Group on demand. Subsequent to initial measurement, current asset investments are measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits  
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs.
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described in each category below.
Interest-bearing borrowings
All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. Borrowing costs are recognised  
as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is  
derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
• the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the  
risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset.

83 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Cash flow hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: the effective portion of the  
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, 
while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating expenses. The Group uses 
forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and firm commitments. 
The ineffective portion is recognised in other operating income.
Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement, within other operating expenses, 
when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial expense is recognised.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Forward 
contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair 
value at each reporting date. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange 
rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in 
cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the 
Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The 
documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being 
hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the 
exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to 
be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows and are addressed on an ongoing basis to determine that they 
actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they are designated.
If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised  
in equity is transferred to the income statement within other operating expenses. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until after the forecast transaction 
or firm commitment affects profit or loss.
Any other gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to other operating expenses in 
the income statement.
Foreign currency translation
The Group’s presentation currency is Pounds Sterling (£). Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and 
items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign 
currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate  
as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries are Euro (€), US dollar (US$), South African rand (ZAR) and Swiss franc 
(CHF). As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation 
currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated 
at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the 
income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation
Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or 
paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or 
charged to the statement of comprehensive income. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
• where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
• trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the balance sheet.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts and 
rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before 
revenue is recognised:
Supply Chain
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on 
dispatch of goods.
Professional Services
Revenue is recognised when receivable under a contract following delivery of a service or in line with the stage of work 
completed. The stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs 
of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income. If the total estimated costs and revenues of a contract 
cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred. A provision is made as soon 
as a loss is foreseen.
Contractual Services
Contractual Services revenue includes revenue from Support Services and Managed Services contracts, and is recognised as 
services are delivered. Unrecognised contracted revenue is included as deferred income in the balance sheet. Amounts invoiced 
relating to more than one period are deferred and recognised over their relevant life.
On a limited number of Contractual Services contracts revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis which is 
determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract. Unbilled revenue is 
recognised within accrued income. If a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is restricted to the extent that costs have 
been incurred.

85 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
If the performance of one of these limited number of contracts results in a margin that was less than anticipated at the time  
that it was agreed then the future financial performance of that contract will be reviewed in detail. If, after further customer 
negotiation and financial analysis the full financial consequence of the contract can be reliably estimated, and it is determined  
that the contract is loss-making, then the best estimate of the losses expected to be incurred until the end of the contract  
will be provided for.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate and revenue 
thereon is measured at the fair value of the consideration received.
Finance income
Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.
Operating leases
Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme available to all UK employees. Contributions are recognised as an expense  
in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. There are no material pension 
schemes within the Group’s overseas operations.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods 
and to assess better trends in financial performance.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Executive Directors) of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at 
which they are granted. The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given 
in note 29. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions  
set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which 
the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled 
to the award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the 
vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors’ best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. As the schemes do not include any market-related performance 
conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share 
(see note 11).
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.  
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as  
a deduction from equity (see note 28).
Own shares held
Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders’ equity as ‘own shares held’ and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements  
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.

3 Restatement of 2012 results
The rapid growth of our Services business in Germany during the fourth quarter of 2011, coupled with insufficient contractual 
governance procedures in place within our German business at that time has resulted in a number of Managed Services 
contracts failing to achieve the margins anticipated at the time they were agreed.
Actions taken in response to these issues, including a full review of our governance procedures, have had a positive effect, 
helping to stabilise the business and turnaround a number of operational issues. However, the Group has determined that  
three of these contracts, following further customer negotiation and extensive financial analysis, will be loss-making over  
the course of their remaining life.
The Group has therefore held an exceptional one-off provision of £7.5 million representing our best estimate of  
the losses expected to be incurred between 2013 and the end of the three contracts.
In order to give investors a clearer picture of the past performance of the business, the Group has reclassified trading losses  
and provisions previously incurred on these three onerous contracts in 2012 as exceptional items, and has accordingly  
restated its 2012 results for the German segment and the Group as a whole results, as follows:

87 4 Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical segments, with each segment determined by the location 
of the Group’s assets and operations. The Group’s business in each geography is managed separately and held in separate 
statutory entities.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the below reportable operating segments.
Management monitors the operating results of its geographical segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about 
resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profit or loss 
which is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Adjusted operating profit or 
loss takes account of the interest paid on customer-specific financing (‘CSF’) which management consider to be a cost of sale. 
Excluded from adjusted operating profit is the amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items as management do not 
consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of a segment.
Restatement of prior year comparative information
Included within exceptional items in the German segment results in 2012 are losses and provisions incurred in relation to three 
onerous contracts that were previously classified within operating profit. Further details of the restatement have been provided 
within note 3.

6 Exceptional items continued
Included within the current year are the following exceptional items:
In Germany three managed service contracts have been identified as onerous. A £2.1 million provision was made in December 2012 
for these contracts. A provision for estimated future losses of £7.5 million was held as at December 2013. This further provision has 
been classified as an exceptional item due to its size and nature and the 2012 result has been restated to be consistent.
Included within the German segment results in 2012 and 2013 are losses incurred in relation to these onerous contracts.  
In order to provide a clearer understanding of the performance of the remainder of the business, losses previously recognised 
within the German operating result for these contracts have now been reclassified within exceptional items. In 2012 trading 
losses of £5.9 million were incurred on revenues of £15.4 million. In 2013 trading losses of £8.2 million have been incurred 
on turnover of £23.0 million.
The deterioration in the performance of Computacenter France has led to an assessment of their non-current assets. It has  
been concluded that the forecasted cash flows for the French cash-generating unit do not fully support the value of non-current 
assets in the business. This has resulted in an impairment of £12.2 million of intangible assets in the French cash-generating unit.
During 2013 Computacenter Germany continued its programme, from late 2012, to reduce its net operating expenses. As a 
result, redundancy costs of £3.1 million were incurred during the year which, due to their size and nature, have been included 
within exceptional items.
Similarly, Computacenter France has begun a programme to also reduce its SG&A and restructure its business and senior 
management in line with the Group Operating Model. Redundancy related expenses of £1.2 million have been included in the 
2013 result.
Due to the continued adverse performance of our equity accounted associate, ICS Solutions Limited, we have decided to fully 
impair the £0.5 million recorded value of our investment.
As part of our normal processes, we have carried out a detailed evaluation of other long-term Services contracts across the 
Group. As a result of this on-going evaluation, management have calculated that a positive change in certain estimates has 
resulted in a one-off gain of £4.0 million. Due to the nature of the change in the estimates, and the size of the gain, it has been 
decided to highlight this as an exceptional item. This is consistent with the treatment of the previously identified onerous contacts 
and will provide a fairer and more balanced understanding of our underlying growth in profitability.
During the year a deferred tax asset relating to losses carried forward in France has been written off for £2.2 million.
Tax relief from prior period Research and Development project spend on the Group ERP platforms has resulted in prior year 
adjustment credited in the statutory tax charge for year. Due to the timing, materiality and one-off nature of this relief, it has been 
decided to classify it an exceptional tax item.
Included within the prior year are the following exceptional items:
During the year, Computacenter France consolidated its operations in a new office and began the move to a new warehouse. 
In January 2013, RDC relocated to new premises in Braintree. The one-off costs in relation to the relocation of these premises  
of £2.4 million that have been disclosed as an exceptional item relate principally to:
• operating lease rental expense charged on new properties during the fit-out period and prior to occupation;
• redundancy costs paid as a result of the relocation; and
• rental expense related to legacy properties once they had been vacated.
In the second half of 2012, Computacenter Germany undertook a programme to reduce its net operating expenses by approximately 
£1.2 million annually. The related redundancy expenses of £1.5 million, due to their size and nature, have been included within 
exceptional items.
The income statement impact of both items has been shown as an exceptional tax item.

c) Tax losses
Deferred tax assets of £13.5 million (2012: £15.7 million) have been recognised in respect of losses carried forward.
In addition, at 31 December 2013, there were unused tax losses across the Group of £125.4 million (2012: £1 15.5 million) for which no 
deferred tax asset has been recognised. Of these losses, £54.5 million (2012: £61.6 million) arise in Germany and £67 .6 million (2012: 
£50.6 million) arise in France. A significant proportion of the losses arising in Germany have been generated in statutory entities that  
no longer have significant levels of trade. The remaining unrecognised tax losses relate to other loss-making overseas subsidiaries.
d) Deferred tax
Deferred income tax at 31 December relates to the following:

At 31 December 2013, there was no recognised or unrecognised deferred income tax liability (2012: £nil) for taxes that would be 
payable on the unremitted earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries as the Group expects that future remittances of earnings from its 
overseas subsidiaries will be covered by the UK dividend exemption.
e) Impact of rate change
The main rate of UK Corporation will be reduced to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014 and to 20 per cent from 1 April 2015,  
as enacted in the Finance Act 2013. Deferred tax has been restated accordingly in these financial statements.
11 Earnings per ordinary share
Earnings per share (‘EPS’) amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year (excluding own shares held).
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year (excluding own shares held) adjusted for the effect of dilutive options.
Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS are presented to provide more comparable and representative information. Accordingly, 
the adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS figures exclude amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items.

Management have considered that the deterioration in the performance of Computacenter France during 2013 provides sufficient 
evidence to test the non-financial assets in the business for impairment as at 31 December 2013. Computacenter France,  
which is equivalent to the France segment, is the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) at which impairment is assessed. The recoverable 
amount of the Computacenter France CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The discount rate used  
is 12 per cent (2012: 12 per cent). As a result of the deterioration in performance, an impairment of £12.2 million has been 
recognised in this CGU, which has resulted in an impairment to goodwill and acquired customer relationships. In France, adverse 
changes to the assumptions, such as a 0.5 per cent increase in the discount rate, a 0.5 per cent reduction in the market growth 
rate or a 5 per cent fall in long-term operating profit, would cause the carrying value of the remaining non-current assets in the 
French cash-generating unit to exceed the carrying amount.

Additions to goodwill in 2012 arose from the acquisition of Belgium IS. Belgium IS is managed and therefore reported as part  
of the Belgium segment, however as it retains its own identifiable cash flows, it is considered as a CGU itself.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The recoverable amounts of all six CGUs have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation. To calculate this, cash flow 
projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period and on long-term 
market growth rates of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent (2012: between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent) thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for all CGUs for 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 are:
• budgeted revenue, which is based on long-run market growth forecasts;
• budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted 
year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends; and
• the discount rate applied to cash flow projections ranges from 11.0 to 15.0 per cent (2012: 11.0 to 15.0 per cent) which 
represents the Group’s pre-tax discount rate adjusted for the risk profiles of the individual CGUs.
Except in France, each CGU generates value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each of them. 
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the 
carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount. In France, adverse changes in the assumptions, such  
as a 0.5 per cent reduction in market growth rate or an increase in the discount rate of 0.5 per cent would cause the carrying 
value to exceed its recoverable amount.

Cash at bank and in hand earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made 
for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, 
and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is £91,098,000 
(2012: 138,149,000).
Due to strong cash generation over the past three years, the Group is now in a position where it can finance its requirements from its 
cash balance. The Group does, however, retain overdraft facilities where required. The uncommitted overdraft facilities available to 
the Group are £17.3 million at 31 December 2013 (2012: £20.3 million). During the year the Group entered into a new committed 
facility of £40.0 million for a three-year term which expires in May 2016. At 31 December 2013 the facility was not utilised.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following at 31 December:

Cash pooling
The Group operates a notional cash pooling facility whereby Group companies have instant access to a facility into which excess 
funds can be deposited or withdrawn to meet funding requirements. Due to the nature of this facility, all balances related to this 
arrangement are disclosed within cash at bank and in hand.

Cash flow hedges
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income reflect the change in fair value of foreign 
exchange forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the expected contract costs in South African Rand 
where sales on those contracts are in Sterling, based on highly probable forecast transactions. Financial assets and liabilities 
through profit or loss are those foreign exchange contracts that are not designated in hedge relationships as they are intended  
to reduce the level of foreign currency risk for expected sales and purchases.
The Group also enters into other foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to reduce the foreign exchange risk of 
expected sales and purchases. When these other contracts are not designated in hedge relationships they are measured at fair 
value through profit and loss within other operating expenses.
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency costs and changes in the foreign 
exchange forward rates.

The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated for the expected highly probable forecast transactions 
to which hedge accounting has been applied. No significant element of hedge ineffectiveness required recognition in the 
income statement.
The cash flow hedges of the forecasted costs were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of £1,403,000 
(2012: gain of £494,000) with a deferred tax asset of £326,000 (2012: £120,000 deferred tax liability) relating to the hedging 
instruments is included in the other comprehensive income. The amounts retained in the other comprehensive income of 
£1,403,000 are expected to mature and affect the income statement in 2014 and 2015.

Customer contract provisions are based on the Directors’ best estimate of the amount of future losses to completion on certain 
contractual services contracts. Whilst there is uncertainty around the future performance of these contracts and the exact timing 
of cashflows, Management remains comfortable with the level of the provision.
Assumptions used to calculate the property provisions are based on the market value of the rental charges plus any contractual 
dilapidation expenses on empty properties and the Directors’ best estimates of the likely time before the relevant leases can be 
reassigned or sublet, which ranges between one and 10 years. The provisions in relation to the UK properties are discounted at 
a rate based upon the Bank of England base rate. Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based 
on Euribor.
26 Financial instruments
An explanation of the Group’s financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Finance 
Director’s Review on pages 28 to 33.
Credit risk
The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits. The credit limits are set for each 
customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity. These limits are initially 
determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter. The balance of trade receivables 
relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default. In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the 
Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the 
reporting date. The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, current 
asset investment and forward currency contracts, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with 
a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents. The Group manages its counterparty credit risk 
by placing cash on deposit across a panel of reputable banking institutions, with no more than £50.0 million deposited at any one 
time except for UK Government backed counterparties where the limit is £70.0 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, invoice 
factoring in the UK and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts. The Group’s bank borrowings, other facilities and 
deposits are at floating rates. No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into. When long-term borrowings are 
utilised, the Group’s policy is to maintain these borrowings at fixed rates to limit the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held 
constant, of the Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the 
Group’s equity.

The impact of a reasonably possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the 
profit before tax of the same magnitude.
Fair values
The carrying value of the Group’s short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values. The fair 
value of all other financial instruments carried within the Group’s financial statements is not materially different from their 
carrying amount.
Forward currency contracts
At 31 December 2013 the Group held foreign exchange contracts as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected 
payments to suppliers. The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk. The terms of 
these contracts are detailed below:

Exchange rate sensitivity
The majority of the transactions in each of the Group’s geographical segments are denominated in the functional currency of that 
segment. There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists. In these instances 
the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk. At the end of the 
year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was a liability of £2,360,000 (2012: £554,000).
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Group’s functional currency, reasonably 
foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of +10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Group’s 
profit before tax or equity.

Fair value measurements recognised in the consolidated balance sheet
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on 
the degree to which the fair value is observable. The three levels are defined as follows:
•  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
•  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 December 2013 the Group had a current asset investment, which was measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial 
recognition, to the value of £nil (31 December 2012: £10.0 million).
At 31 December 2013 the Group had forward currency contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial 
recognition, to the value of a liability of £2,360,000 (31 December 2012: £554,000).
The realised losses from forward currency contracts in the period to 31 December 2013 of £1,806,000 (2012: £386,000), are 
offset by broadly equivalent realised gains on the related underlying transactions.
27 Capital management
Computacenter’s approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the 
development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
Consistent with the Group’s aim to maximise return to shareholders, the dividend policy is to maintain a dividend cover of 
between 2–2.5 times. In 2013 the cover was 2.5 times, on a pre-exceptional basis (2012: 2.3 times).
The Group’s capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements. The Group seeks  
to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash flow. As a consequence, the UK has sourced an increasing 
proportion of its product business via distributors in order to reduce the working capital requirements of the business.

27 Capital management continued
Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Group’s exposure to exchange rates. Each country finances  
its own working capital requirements, typically resulting in borrowings in France with cash on deposit in the UK and Germany.  
During 2013, a notional cash pooling arrangement was introduced, which Group companies can access and allows the Group  
to pool its funds.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases, which are secured only on the 
assets that they finance, or loans. Whilst the outstanding amounts of this ‘customer specific financing’ (‘CSF’) are included within 
net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes this ‘customer specific financing’ when managing the net funds 
of the business as this outstanding financing is matched by committed future revenues. These financing facilities, which are 
committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Group’s product resale and services activities.
In certain circumstances, the Group deposits its funds in short-term investments that do not fulfil the criteria to be classified as 
cash and cash equivalents. The Group considers these deposits when managing the net funds of the business, and accordingly 
includes these deposits within net funds excluding CSF .
Capital, defined as net funds, that the Group monitors is:
2013
£’000
2012

Net funds excluding CSF 90,271 147,327
Customer specific financing (18,857) (18,701)
Net funds 71,414 128,626 
The Group continued to benefit from the extension of an improvement in credit terms with a significant vendor, equivalent to 
£41 million at 31 December 2013, an increase of approximately £7 million over the course of the year.
Each operating country manages working capital in line with Group policies. The key components of working capital, i.e. trade 
receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget 
process, in order to ensure efficient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital efficiently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour  
at an Account Manager and Account Director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level. This is achieved by 
increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by 
customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.
The Group regularly reviews the adequacy of its facilities against any foreseeable peak borrowing requirement. At 31 December 
2013, the Group had available £17.3 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities (2012: £20.3 million of uncommitted overdraft  
and factoring facilities).

The Company has a number of share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Company’s shares have been 
granted to certain executives and senior employees (note 29).
Return of Value
On 12 June 2013 the Company effected a capital reorganisation under which each ordinary share of 6 pence was divided into 
one ordinary of 6⅔ pence and one B share of 0.01 pence (with the B shares to be redeemed and cancelled at a future date). 
Following this sub-division every 10 ordinary shares of 6 pence were consolidated into 9 ordinary shares of 6⅔ pence. As a result  
of the 9 for 10 consolidation, 153,931,830 ordinary shares of 6 pence became 138,538,647 ordinary shares of 6⅔ pence.
The holders of the B shares could elect to either sell the shares or receive a one-off dividend income. Both options to be remitted 
to shareholders on 5 July. The holders of B shares are then not entitled to any further profits of the Company.
The holders of A Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per 
share at the general meetings of the Company. On a winding up of the Company, holders of A Ordinary Shares may be entitled  
to the residual assets of the Company.
Share premium
The share premium account is used to record the aggregate amount or value of premiums paid when the Company’s shares are 
issued/redeemed at a premium.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the Company’s capital following the purchase and cancellation of its own 
shares. During the year the Company repurchased nil of its own shares for cancellation (2012: nil).
Own shares held
Own shares held comprise the following:
i) Computacenter Employee Share Ownership Plan
Shares in the parent undertaking comprise 3,065,133 (2012: 4,072,849 6 pence ordinary shares) 6⅔ pence ordinary shares  
of Computacenter plc purchased by the Computacenter Employee Share Ownership Plan (‘the Plan’). The principal purpose  
of the Plan is to be funded with shares that will satisfy discretionary executive share plans. The number of shares held represents 
2.2 per cent (2012: 3.4 per cent) of the Company’s issued share capital.
None of these shares were awarded to executives of the Company under the Computacenter (UK) Limited Cash Bonus and 
Share Plan. Options previously awarded are to be held on behalf of employees and former employees of Computacenter (UK) 
Limited and their dependants, excluding Jersey residents. The distribution of these shares is dependent upon the trustee holding 
them on the employees’ behalf for a restrictive period of three years.
Since 31 December 2002 the definition of beneficiaries under the ESOP Trust has been expanded to include employees who 
have been awarded options to acquire ordinary shares of 6⅔ pence each in Computacenter plc under the other employee share 
plans of the Computacenter Group, namely the Computacenter Services Group plc Approved Executive Share Option Plan, the 
Computacenter Employee Share Option Scheme 1998, the Computacenter Services Group plc Unapproved Executive Share 
Option Scheme, the Computacenter Performance-Related Share Option Scheme 1998, the Computacenter Sharesave Plus 
Scheme and any future similar share ownership schemes.
All costs incurred by the Plan are settled directly by Computacenter (UK) Limited and charged in the accounts as incurred.
The Plan Trustees have waived the dividends receivable in respect of 3,065,133 (2012: 4,072,849) shares that it owns which  
are all unallocated shares.
ii) Computacenter Qualifying Employee Share Trust (‘the Quest’)
The total shares held are 41,965 (2012: 327,489), which represents 0.03 per cent (2012: 0.1 per cent) of the Company’s 
issued share capital. All of these shares will continue to be held by the Quest until such time as the Sharesave options granted 
against them are exercised. The market value of these shares at 31 December 2013 was £267,737 (2012: £673,450). The 
Quest Trustees have waived dividends in respect of all of these shares. During the year the Quest subscribed for 374,760 
(2012: 705,000 6 pence ordinary shares) 6⅔ pence ordinary shares.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries.

Note
1 Issued under the terms of the Computacenter Performance Share Plan 2006, as amended at the AGM held on 13 May 2011. One quarter of the shares will 
vest if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 5 per cent per annum. One half of the shares will vest if the compound annual 
EPS growth over the performance period equals 7.5 per cent and will vest in full if the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period equals 
10 per cent. If the compound annual EPS growth over the performance period is between 5 and 10 per cent, shares awarded will vest on a straight-line basis. 
The performance period usually covers a period of three years from 1 January of the year the award is granted. A limited number of PSP awards are granted 
with a performance period of two years.

113 31 Adjusted management cash flow statement
The adjusted management cash flow has been provided to explain how management view the cash performance of the 
business. There are two primary differences to this presentation compared to the statutory cash flow statement, as follows:
1) Items relating to customer specific financing are adjusted for as follows:
 a. Interest paid on customer specific financing is reclassified from interest paid to adjusted operating profit; and
 b.  Where customer-specific assets are financed by finance leases and the liabilities are matched by future amounts 
receivable under customer operating lease rentals, the depreciation of leased assets and the repayment of the capital 
element of finance leases are offset within net working capital; and
 c.  Where assets are financed by loans and the liabilities are matched by amounts receivable under customer operating 
lease rentals, the movement on loans within financing activities is offset within working capital.
2)  Net funds excluding CSF is stated inclusive of current asset investments. Current asset investments consists of a deposit held 
for a term of greater than three months from the date of deposit which is available to the Group with 30 days notice. The fair 
value of the current asset investment as at 31 December 2013 is not materially different to the carrying value.

Annual Report and

115 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities Strategic report Governance Financial statements
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2013  
which comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 10. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies  
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not  
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit  
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 71, the Directors are responsible for  
the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with  
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the  
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the  
Companies Act 2006; and
• The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not  
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• The Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2013.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Computacenter plc were approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors  
on 10 March 2014. The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and FA Conophy.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the applicable  
UK Accounting Standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.  
The profit after tax for the Company was £531,000 (2012: £131,792,000).
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D(b) of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and has  
not disclosed information required by that standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company  
is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Intellectual property
Licences purchased in respect of intellectual property are capitalised, classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the licence, normally 20 years.
Depreciation of fixed assets
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the 
cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings 25 years 
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. In addition, subsequent to the adoption of  
UITF Abstract 41, investments in subsidiaries also include the FRS 20 cost of share-based payments.
Impairment of assets
The carrying values of assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are 
taken to the profit and loss account.
Share-based payment transactions
The expense for share-based payments is recognised in the subsidiary companies employing the relevant employees.  
The Company records a corresponding increase in its investments in subsidiaries with a credit to equity which is equivalent  
to the FRS 20 cost in the subsidiary undertakings.
Taxation
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current tax rate. Where Group relief is surrendered from other 
subsidiaries in the Group, the Company is required to pay to the surrendering company an amount equal to the loss surrendered 
multiplied by the current tax rate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

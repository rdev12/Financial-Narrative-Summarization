communities. It is through intimate knowledge 
of these chosen communities that we can 
service our customers most effectively. 
W e have a well balanced portfolio of businesses, with exposure to both mature markets 
and higher growth Emerging Markets*. Over the last six years we have increased our 
exposure to fast growth Emerging Markets. Since 2005 our revenues from China and 
other Emerging Markets have grown 162% to £207.1m.

Section 1: 2011 Review
2011 Review
2011 has been a very successful year for UBM. 
Revenues were £972.3m, up 9.3% over 2010; 
adjusted operating profit was £201.9m, up 17.5%; 
and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were up 
13.1% to 56.8p – the highest in the UBM’ s history. 
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 20.0p 
per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 
26.3p, also a record level for UBM.
The 2011 financial results demonstrate tangible 
returns on the substantial investment we have made in 
the organisational structure and culture of UBM and 
illuminate management’ s remarkable progress in 
systematically repositioning our business portfolio 
– through organic development together with our 
very active and disciplined acquisitions program. 
Over the last five years, UBM revenues have grown at 
a 4.9% CAGR, but a very substantial shift underlies this 
growth, with expansion in new businesses offsetting 
significant print declines. Events generated more than 
40% of revenue in 2011, up from under 30% in 2006; 
while Print has declined from over a third of revenues 
five years ago to 11.6% last year. Revenues generated 
in Emerging Markets have more than doubled, 
and now comprise over a fifth of UBM’ s revenues. 
UBM is a fundamentally different business from 
what it was five years ago.
Strategic Progress
UBM continued to deliver on its strategic objectives 
during the year by investing in our organisational 
resource needs and in our core activities. Progress in 
Events was underpinned by important acquisitions 
and organic initiatives. Our acquisitions included 
Ecobuild, the world’ s largest exhibition dedicated to 
sustainable building products and the UK’ s fastest 
growing trade event with over 55,000 attendees in 
2011. Ecobuild both complements our existing 
construction portfolio and affords highly attractive 
geo-adaptation opportunities into growth markets 
such as China, where Ecobuild will operate alongside 
our existing Expobuild event in 2012. As with all 
acquisitions, we expect Ecobuild to generate returns 
in excess of our cost of capital in the first full year 
of trading, further illustrating management’ s 
continuing discipline and prudence in the pursuit 
of accretive growth.
Several important organic initiatives also 
underpinned our results, particularly the integration 
of Canon which performed well, and the continued 
impact made through GEM
1
 in systematic 
geo-adaptation and promoting best practice across 
our fastest growing segment. 
W e also continued to invest in our other 
businesses: in new product development in Data 
Services; technology , new products and sales force 
in PR Newswire; and new product development 
in our Online activities where we have substantially 
expanded our presence in virtual events and 
community engagement products. With the recent 
divestitures of Farmers Guardian, Pulse, and Daltons 
as well as the announced disposals of the F rench and 
Belgian medical titles there has been a marked 
acceleration in the rationalisation of our print magazine 
activity , which is increasingly focused on communities 
where print magazine advertising forms one element 
of an integrated marketing services offering.

Organisational Progress
Our People
Continued investment in our people and business 
culture is also showing tangible returns. Over the 
last five years 100 high potential managers have 
participated in our Business Leadership Program 
(‘BLP’), contributing not only to their capacity to lead 
businesses, but creating a common lexicon and culture 
across UBM. The ongoing value of the BLP is 
reflected in the vibrant regional BLP alumni group 
activity as well as the emergence of alumni as senior 
leaders of our businesses. The BLP is complemented 
by a number of regionally-focused leadership 
programs – 2011, importantly , saw the launch of the 
first China Leadership Development Program.
Success in our investment in UBM’ s culture has 
also been evident in usage of the UBM Wiki, which 
continues to grow and is used increasingly as a tool 
for effective collaboration across UBM. Our second 
annual “ubm VOICE” global employee engagement 
survey noted a significant increase in participation 
and engagement scores.
W e have also reinforced our headquarters team 
to strengthen UBM’ s capacity to support continued 
growth and development – notable senior hires 
include Rorie Devine, our Group CIO.
Sustainability
W e continue to focus on using our events 
management skills to support key community 
initiatives reflected in the expansion of our NGO 
Events series to include a new event in the UK with 
a further event scheduled in India in 2012.
Our policy to limit our environmental impact 
and in particular to reduce UBM’ s carbon footprint 
has yielded highly encouraging results this year. 
W e have now completed the second year of our global 
environmental reporting initiative, with substantial 
expansion of energy and waste data collection and 
have established a group wide objective to reduce our 
carbon footprint by 5% by the end of 2012. Our 
people and businesses have received numerous awards 
recognising leadership in carbon reduction – most 
recently, in November 2011, UBM was ranked in the 
top 4% of the UK CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme’ s 
performance league table.
The Board
The Board has continued to demonstrate 
extraordinary commitment to UBM, both at 
its regular meetings, including in Shanghai and 
New Y ork during 2011, and through on-going 
engagement with senior executives, mentoring 
relationships and participation in UBM leadership 
and training programs. 
Looking back at progress over the past five years, 
I would like to thank the Board, management and 
UBM’ s staff and particularly our CEO David Levin 
for all their efforts, culminating in a successful 2011. 
As I look back at my five years as Chairman of UBM 
I am very encouraged by the quality of the business 
and people and believe that UBM is increasingly well 
positioned for sustainable growth.
Finally , both the Board, and I personally , would 
like to acknowledge the hard work and effort of all the 
people at UBM who have helped to generate another 
exceptional set of results.

2011 Results
UBM had a strong year in 2011. Revenues grew 9.3% 
to £972.3m (2010: £889.2m) and adjusted operating 
profit increased 17.5% to £201.9m (2010: £171.8m). 
The adjusted operating profit margin over the year 
was 20.8% (2010: 19.3%), reflecting the strong 
performance in our events businesses and also the 
consistent on plan delivery of our other businesses. 
Adjusted profit before tax* increased to £177.4m 
(2010: £156.4m). Fully diluted adjusted EPS 
was 56.8p, an increase of 6.6p over the prior year 
(2010: 50.2p).
2011 Achievements
W e have made great progress across all our businesses 
in the course of 2011. Further acquisitions, notably 
of events businesses, and disposals of print assets 
together with organic growth initiatives continue our 
strategy of focusing on attractive communities and 
growing economies. Product investment around PR 
Newswire and our Data Services businesses will raise 
the value of our business in the coming years.
The strength and resilience of our Events business 
continues to underpin overall Group performance, 
accounting for 40.9% (2010: 34.9%) of Group 
revenue and 62.5% (2010: 51.7%) of Group 
operating profit excluding corporate costs. In 2011 
we successfully delivered over 400 events (2010: 
over 300). Events were organised in 31 different 
countries (2010: 21 countries) and there were 11 new 
geo-adapted events. Events floor space for our annual 
events was 1.2 million m
2
 in 2011 compared to 
0.9 million m
2
 in 2010, and the number of attendees 
at our events grew from 1.2 million to 1.5 million (up 
25%) further illustrating our determination to offer 
an ever bigger and better face-to-face experience to 
the business communities we serve.
Our ‘GEM’ initiative, driving best practice across 
both new and geo-adapted events, is focused on 
enhancing the performance of our ‘live media’ 
business both around the quality of our product 
offering and the resulting customer experience. 
Underlying growth in the Events business was 
14.6% and this reflects the growing strength of our 
core franchises. 2011 also saw the acquisition of eight 
events-related businesses for £71.2m. The most 
notable acquisition was Ecobuild, the world’ s leading 
sustainable building exhibition and the fastest 
growing trade event in the UK for an initial cash 
consideration of £31m and a performance based 
consideration of up to £20m. Ecobuild fits well with 
the existing UBM Built Environment portfolio with 
strong potential for multiple geo-adaptations. A first 
edition has now been launched for China in 2012. 
Ecobuild will run in March 2012 and is on track with 
our acquisition case. Other acquisitions in the Events 
space during the year have helped to consolidate our 
drive to leverage markets and communities exhibiting 
long-term structural growth characteristics.
Biennial events in 2011 have delivered £36.2m in 
revenues compared to £18.5m in 2010. Comparing 
our 2011 biennial events (including Marintec and 
FIE) to the same portfolio’ s performance in 2009, 
revenue for these shows has grown by 27%. Section 1: 2011 Review „

PR Newswire revenues increased by 3.6% during 
2011 to £187.8m (2010: £181.2m). Our US 
Distribution revenue increased 0.6% to £88.7m while 
US revenues other than distribution (comprised of 
Engagement, W orkflow/Data and Filing Services) 
decreased by 1.8% to £39.3m. 
PR Newswire’ s global operating margin was 
21.8% which, while down on the previous year’ s 
23.2%, was ahead of the target we had set of 20.8% 
and reflected a shift in mix as well as significant 
investments in our products, our technology, and 
in sales and marketing to drive continued growth 
in the changing competitive and technological 
environments. Expansion of our newer businesses in 
Europe, China and in other Emerging Markets affects 
PR Newswire’ s margin. Similarly, growth in Vintage 
printing and filing revenues also has a dilutive effect 
on margins. PR Newswire’ s non-US revenue 
increased to 31.8% of total global revenues from 
29.3% in 2010 and this represented a 12.6% growth 
over the year. 
Overall Data Services revenues of £187.0m 
(2010: £184.7m) were robust in 2011. Operating 
margins achieved were 16.2% (2010: 18.5%), in line 
with guidance provided to the market. Softness in 
the margin was partially driven by the anticipated 
ongoing decline in higher margin print directory 
advertising together with the continuing focused 
investment in developing online and workflow 
products. Continued weakness in T rade & T ransport 
was somewhat offset by strong advances elsewhere, 
most notably in T echnology & IP but also in Health 
and Pulp & Paper. 
Importantly the structural migration from print 
data to digital formats continues to be a prominent 
feature of the revenue mix, with online data and 
services this year accounting for 69.5% of Data 
Services’ revenues (2010: 66.7%). 
In 2011, as with the previous year, the Online 
segment was one of our fastest growing segments, 
up by 27.9% to £88.5m (2010: £69.2m), driven 
primarily by strong banner advertising and continued 
traction in the roll out of our attractive new online 
communities and digital environments. 2011 has 
been another exceptionally strong year for Digital 
Environments with the successful delivery of over 250 
(2010: 103) discrete events across the globe. 
Digital Environments continue to expand from the 
initial virtual events that delivered online trade shows 
to delivering digital experiences across multiple 
environments and communities including 
recruitment and in-company communication. 
W e continue to see digital environments as symbiotic 
to our live, in person events business.
Print revenues fell 22.2% during the year in line 
with previous guidance to the market. As a segment, 
Print now accounts for 11.6% (2010: 16.2%) of total 
Group revenues, reflecting the success of our strategy 
to rationalise our print business. Disposals during the 
year included the French healthcare newspaper 
‘Quotidien du Medecin’ and its related weekly 
and monthly titles as well as the UK ‘Publican’ , 
and two US healthcare journals. As a result of the 
rationalisation process, segmental margins now stand 
at 5.4% (2010: 6.9%). Subsequent to the year end we 
made further disposals, notably of Farmers’ Guardian 
and Pulse. Decreases in print-related operating profit 
are now being made up by increases in operating 
profit derived from digital subscriptions.
UBM has gone through tremendous change 
in the past five years – in its business mix, the 
geographies in which it does business and also in 
developing an increasingly distinctive and open 
culture. I would like to state my personal thanks to 
our Chairman John Botts, who will stand down later 
in the year, for his advice and support to me over the 
past five years while we have gone through all of these 
developments. UBM has benefitted hugely from his 
infectious energy, his deep understanding of the 
business and his huge passion for its people and 
I personally have benefitted from his counsel.

Our business model
UBM seeks to help companies make connections, 
communicate their proposition and do business 
effectively. 
W e transfer the skills, knowledge and experience 
we gain in serving one community across and 
between markets, transferring best practice and 
innovation from one community to another, from 
one geography to another and from one product type 
to another. From one company to many, we enable 
the flow of information, directing messages and 
assessing their impact on specific audiences. 
Community understanding
As the graph on page 3 highlights we operate 
in a variety of specialist communities which have 
attractive growth characteristics. W e seek to know 
who’ s who in the community , have relationships with 
key participants, create rich databases of relevance 
to those professionals, understand the key themes 
affecting their community , their information needs 
and how they operate. It is through this thorough 
understanding that we are able to service them 
most effectively . 
Quality offering
By having a broad range of quality services and 
products we can create an offering specifically 
designed to meet the needs of each community being 
served. As described in more detail below, we think 
the media industry is shifting to a more integrated 
approach and therefore having a full range of 
products and services is increasingly important.
Geographic diversity
The transformation to a global economy leads us 
to believe that diverse geographic experience and 
infrastructure is advantageous. It also provides 
us with access to high growth opportunities in 
Emerging Markets and quality revenues from 
more mature markets.
Business model
UBM’s marketplace 
The B2B marketplace which UBM operates in is 
extremely fragmented, reflecting the number and 
variety of communities and geographies we serve 
and the diversity of products and services we offer. 
Estimates of its size and growth prospects vary 
considerably. Outsell estimates that the ‘information 
industries’ marketplace (which includes HR 
information, Search, Aggregation & Syndication, 
Market Research, B2B T rade publishing and 
directories) is worth $462bn and is expected to 
have grown 2.9% in 2011. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
meanwhile estimate the more narrowly defined 
‘Business to Business’ market (which excludes live 
events, but includes business information, trade 
magazines and directory advertising) at $148.5bn 
for 2011 and expect CAGR of 3.5% between 2011 
and 2015. 
There are two key influences on the long term 
development of the marketplace: the continuing 
impact of the ‘digital revolution’ and the shift towards 
the Emerging Markets.

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 9
W e are seeing a trend towards a more integrated 
marketing approach with digital at its core. Perhaps 
stimulated by the global recession, we are seeing a 
greater degree of client focus on efficiency and 
profitability; for example our customers want to 
be able to measure the impact of their marketing 
campaigns, or our audiences, who have access to a 
proliferation of content, are now looking for quality 
and accessibility. The distribution channels are 
changing, with mobile apps becoming increasingly 
important, and we are seeing a trend from solely 
traditional media platforms to a combination 
which offer a high level of engagement and are 
more embedded in professionals’ workflow . 
The importance of relationship marketing 
remains and we believe that face-to-face interactions 
will continue to be a crucial element of the B2B 
industry. One could even argue that in an increasingly 
environmentally conscious world it is appealing 
to attend a single event and meet a multitude 
of contacts, rather than travelling to meet each 
contact individually. 
The other factor influencing the long term 
development of the marketplace is the 
macroeconomic environment and the shift towards 
the ‘Emerging Markets’ . In the short term the industry 
as a whole should benefit from the global recovery 
– with improvements in the corporate spending 
environment and in the proportion of spend allocated 
to marketing. The speed of growth will vary, with the 
expectation that Emerging Markets will deliver the 
highest levels of growth. 
The digitalisation trends and Emerging Markets 
shift are driving development both of new media 
products and services, and of new business models to 
support them, across all sectors and in all geographies. 
W e view UBM’ s diversity as a distinct advantage – 
our varied portfolio and breadth of geographic 
exposure enables us to be agile and capitalise on 
changes in our marketplace. 
Our strategy
Positioning UBM to benefit from these macro, 
long term shifts in the industry is our primary 
strategic objective. 
Our strategy is to take a leading role in the Live 
Media and B2B Communications markets, in chosen 
communities, by building businesses which are well 
positioned to prosper in the digital age and have the 
potential for global growth. The graphs above show 
how, over the last five years, we have re-shaped the 
portfolio and geographic exposure of UBM.
Whilst our strategy remains consistent, we’ve 
changed how we articulate it and are adopting a more 
granular approach. W e have identified five priorities 
for delivering our strategy:
1. Organic revenue growth
2. Growth through acquisition
3. People and culture
4. Responsible business
5. Appropriate processes
W e have made good strategic progress in 2011 – 
evidenced through the financial key performance

Data Services
With content now becoming more available 
through the internet it is important we 
invest and innovate to deepen our data sets 
and enhance the delivery channels to our 
customers. W e are also looking to improve 
the quality of revenues (increasing the 
proportion of digital revenues) and diversify 
the delivery channels (the mix between 
‘ subscription’ , ‘professional services’ and 
‘ advertising’ revenues).
Marketing Services – Online 
The rapidity of technological advance 
means that we must continually innovate 
to ensure we are best serving our clients. 
W e seek to capitalise on the trend towards 
an integrated marketing approach through 
developing our high engagement offering 
and growing the number of live online 
events and increasing the proportion of 
lead generation and other revenues. 
Marketing Services – Print
Although print publishing in general is 
in decline we believe there is a role for 
leading community titles. W e continue 
to manage the print portfolio to focus 
on leading titles. W e believe that it now 
makes sense to start the process of 
combining our print segment with 
online for an integrated marketing 
services product offering.

W e select targets which are complementary to our 
existing business in terms of geography , segment or 
community . Below is a table showing the acquisitions 
made in 2011. 
Strict ﬁnancial discipline 
A target acquisition also has to satisfy financial criteria

Our people
A key element for creating long term growth 
is our ability to attract, develop and retain 
the most talented people at all levels. Our 
people are our most valuable asset. W e do 
this through a variety of initiatives including:
Talent management – robust succession 
planning and talent development processes, 
most notably our Business Leaders Program 
and our Leadership Development Programs 
in China and Europe
Adopting employment policies which offer 
flexible working, paid leave and sabbaticals 
Appropriate reward incentives – 
including bonus, long term incentives 
and Sharesave schemes
Promoting the wellbeing of our people 
– wellness clinics and programs, health 
checkups, healthclub reimbursement 
schemes etc
Our culture
Equally important is the culture of the 
Group – we have continued to make progress 
in developing a positive culture which is 
meritocratic, intellectually honest, 
entrepreneurial and innovative, which 
values respect and integrity , and which is 
agile and responsive to changes in our 
workplace. W e believe that clear and open 
communication is fundamental to fostering 
this positive culture. W e use a variety of 
means to communicate: the UBM Wiki, 
staff surveys, town hall meetings, 
e-newsletters etc. Encouragingly , our 
second UBM-wide engagement survey 
demonstrated an improvement in employee 
engagement, with feedback that employees 
are more motivated by the vision of UBM, 
have greater trust in leadership than in 2010 
and, consistent with last year, feel that their 
jobs are interesting and challenging, with 
good management capabilities and practices 
in place. 
Structure & control 
It is important to ensure we have the 
appropriate processes in place to carefully 
and efficiently measure and control 
performance within the business. 
The CEO hosts monthly meetings/
video calls with each of the divisional CEOs. 
W e have a thorough quarterly review process 
in which the divisional CEOs update on 
performance and expectations against 
budget. Rewards are also aligned with 
strategy through incentives to achieve 
budget and specific personal objectives.
Focus on KPIs 
As highlighted on page 9 the Board reviews 
certain financial KPIs and operational 
performance indicators. The quarterly review 
process, mentioned above, also looks at the 
financial performance of each of the 
divisions.
Sound risk management
Sound risk management is an essential 
discipline for running the business 
efficiently and pursuing our strategy 
successfully. Our internal audit function 
manages a UBM-wide annual risk mapping 
exercise to identify the key risks in each 
division as well as the procedures and 
controls to mitigate them. This process is 
complemented by top-down review of key 
risks by our executive management team.
This entire process is reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and then by the Board, to 
ensure a consistent and coherent approach to 
the principal risk factors and to those other 
risk factors that may arise or which may 
become material in the future. Divisional 
performance and associated risks are regularly 
discussed on CEO monthly calls and we also 
conduct scenario planning exercises involving 
divisional and Group management to ensure 
that we are able to respond robustly to 
new challenges.

Appropriate
processes
The issues of climate change and 
sustainability affect us all and, as a global 
company, we are committed to ensuring 
that we engage positively with society and 
minimise any negative and social impacts 
from our operations. Acting with respect is 
central to the way we do business, and we 
believe that acting in a responsible manner 
is key to delivering sustainable value for 
our shareholders.
Environment 
As a leading organiser of events all around 
the world we recognise the impact that 
our business can have on the environment. 
W e seek to reduce our carbon footprint over 
time and improve our recycling efforts.
Community 
W e recognise the importance of our 
relationship with the communities in which 
we operate. Over time we have been shifting 
our community focus away from more 
passive philanthropic activities, such as 
simple cash donations, to more active 
engagement, looking to bring our expertise 
to bear in how we serve the communities in 
which we operate. 
NGO Events 
These are unique, free events bringing 
together charities, NGOs and companies. 
W e believe that the best way for us to support 
the communities in which we do business is 
by doing what we do best – running events. 
W e harness UBM’ s commercial resources, 
and the expertise and experience of our staff 
in a not-for-profit environment. The NGO 
Events series has the personal commitment 
of David Levin, CEO, who is the sponsor at 
Board level. UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 14
Section 1: 2011 Review
The business model – 
UBM creates value by:
Expansion into niche business communities 
exhibiting attractive growth characteristics
Developing and reinforcing the brand awareness of 
our events to ensure longevity of customer loyalty
Maximising growth opportunities via both 
acquisitions and geo-adaptation into new 
geographies, particularly into attractive emerging 
markets such as China
Managing our existing portfolio of events, up to 
and including making accretive disposals to ensure 
a continued focus on growth and market strength
Revenues are driven by: 
The number of events
The size and commercial success of events
The pricing achieved with exhibitors, attendees 
and sponsors
Attractions of the Events industry:
Often stand space deposits are paid a year in advance 
therefore generating attractive cash and working 
capital characteristics
Forward order book visibility
Events where revenues are predominantly derived 
from standholders exhibit far less cyclicality of 
earnings than attendee led events
Potential challenges:
Government and associations influence – UBM 
maintains strong relationships where necessary, 
including recently creating a managerial position in 
Beijing whose primary mandate is to manage and  
co-ordinate UBM’s overall China relationships
Event maturity – we closely monitor the life cycle of 
our events and manage our event brands accordingly
Infrastructure constraints within Emerging Markets
Changes in legislation with regards to Health & 
Safety and Sustainability
The pace of technological change
Venue constraints
Our Events business spans large industry exhibitions and 
conventions, to forums, fairs and tradeshows. Direct contact 
between buyers and sellers in the context of sales and marketing 
remains of paramount importance. Growth in live exhibitions 
continues unabated and is complemented by the increasing 
emergence of digital formats.

The marketplace 
AMR, the events industry analysts, estimate that in 
2011, the global events industry revenues recovered 
significantly from the flat performance of the prior 
year, increasing by 4% to $26bn. Factors driving this 
increase include the increasing professionalisation of 
exhibitions in emerging markets which are seeing 
upward pricing pressure as international organisers 
continue to enter new markets led by the need to 
meet increasing demand. More mature events markets 
are predicted to grow slightly above GDP with 
significant variation across markets. Events revenues 
at UBM contrastingly, grew 28% in 2011 or 
14.6% on an underlying basis, across our annual 
event portfolio.

UBM’ s strength in events is driven by our ability to 
provide high quality events, servicing an increasingly 
broad range of communities in an ever wider range of 
geographies and markets. The brand strength of our 
top events remains key to our continued performance. 
Our top 20 annual events account for 43.5% of total 
Events revenue.
Our Events strategy remains firmly anchored in 
the pursuit of growth in key emerging markets such as 
China, India, Brazil, Malaysia, Vietnam and T urkey. 
The proportion of UBM’ s Events revenues derived 
from emerging markets in 2011 stood at 39.5% 
(2010: 38.7%), versus the 16.1% share of the global 
events market that these countries represent. For these 
reasons, UBM continues to enjoy outstanding long 
term growth prospects.

Segmental Performance continued
2011 performance 
W e are delighted by the progress of our Events 
business which, following encouraging growth in 
revenues and an improved margin performance, 
now accounts for 40.9% of UBM’ s revenues (2010: 
34.9%) and 62.5% of total adjusted operating profit, 
excluding corporate costs (2010: 51.7%).
During 2011 we organised over 400 events 
including over 250 tradeshows. The total 
number of events has increased since 2010 as a result 
of 24 launches (including 11 geo-adaptations) and 
over 60 events acquired (including the majority of the 
Canon events where we did not report the financial 
results in 2010). 
T otal reported revenues for Events grew by 28.0% 
to £396.9m (2010: £310.0m) partly driven by the 
positive biennial effect. In 2011 we organised 20 
biennial events (2010: 16 events) which contributed 
£36.2m of revenue (2010: £18.5m). V ersus the 2009 
editions these events grew by 27.0% or 28.5% on a 
constant currency basis.
Annual event revenues grew by 23.7% to 
£360.7m (2010: £291.5m) driven by an increase in 
floor space (m
2
). W e saw stand revenues rise by 26.9% 
to £247.8m (2010: £195.3m), attendee revenues rise 
by 13.0% to £41.6m (2010: £36.8m) and sponsorship 
and other revenues increase by 20.3% to £71.4m 
(2010: £59.4m).
A total of 49,000 exhibitors attended our 
annual events during the year which is an 
increase of 32% (2010: 37,000) with square 
metres for our annual portfolio increasing by 
30% to 1,204,000 (2010: 925,200) and visitor 
numbers increasing by 25% to 1,520,000 
(2010: 1,220,000).
W e continue our drive to ensure events 
organised by UBM are best in class and our 
events best practice initiative, ‘Global Events 
Momentum’ (GEM), is expanding with Company-
wide engagement and focus in areas such as 
customer value, technology innovation, new revenue, 
sustainability and financial insight. 
In 2011, we continued to expand through both 
geo-adaptations and acquisitions. W e held events in 
31 different countries (2010: 21 countries) including 
T urkey, Malaysia and Vietnam. W e launched 11 
geo-adapted events around the world, with notable 
expansions in Indonesia and India as well as in the 
USA. During 2011 we invested a total of £71.2m 
in buying 100% of, or majority interests in, eight 
events related businesses which contributed £7.9m 
to the 2011 reported Events revenues. Had they 
been owned since 1 January 2011 they would have 
contributed approximately a further £15.4m. In 2011, 
we have realised the full year benefit of our significant 
acquisition in 2010 of Canon Communications 
which contributed £31.8m of event revenue in 2011 
(2010: £1.1m).
Five of our 2011 acquisitions operate events in 
high growth sectors in Emerging Markets. W e have 
significantly expanded our business in South East 
Asia through the acquisition of AMB Exhibitions 
with events in Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines 
serving the water, livestock, energy, and mechanical/
electrical industries.

Jewellery and Gem Fairs
UBM serves the global jewellery industry with a range 
of international tradeshows, publications and online 
products. Its ﬂagship tradeshow, Hong Kong Jewellery 
& Gem Fair was established in September 1983 in a hotel 
ballroom attracting around a hundred exhibitors. The 
September edition achieved its status as the biggest 
jewellery event in the world in 2009 with the concept of 
product sectorisation that allowed the event to take place 
in two venues in Hong Kong occupying 130,000 sqm. 
In 2011, the Fair reached another record year with a total 
number of 3,454 exhibitors from 46 countries and regions 
and 51,500 visitors from 155 countries and regions. 
In addition to the local expansion by launching its 
June edition in 1986, UBM extended its jewellery event 
portfolio in China by developing the China International 
Gold, Jewellery & Gem Fair in Shenzhen in 2003, 
Guangzhou in 2004 and Shanghai in 2005. It continued 
its geographical expansion in Japan and India. Further 
expansion continued through the acquisition in Turkey 
of a 65% interest in Rotaforte, the country’s largest 
jewellery event.

W e continue to invest in India with acquisitions 
including SA TTE, which is India’ s largest travel & 
tourism event, Renewable Energy and a majority 
stake in Index Fairs, which is India’ s largest interiors 
tradeshow .
The UK Ecobuild acquisition reflects our 
strategy in action: a fast-growing world leading 
event in the attractive sustainable design and 
building construction sector which has performed 
consistently, has excellent geo-adaptation 
opportunities (China event already announced for 
2012) and has global synergies with our existing 
Built Environment business.
On an underlying basis revenues grew by 14.6% 
during the year. This figure represents the constant 
currency organic growth of our continuing annual 
events portfolio (stripping out biennials, discontinued 
activities and acquired businesses). Our 2011 top 20 
annual trade shows represented 43.5% of our Events 
business in terms of revenue, and 62.9% of Events 
adjusted operating profit. 
The table below shows annual event revenues by 
geography. Emerging Markets revenues remain at 
40% of our total annual event portfolio despite 
growth of 22.8% since 2010. The geographical split 
is impacted by the addition of the Canon events in 
North America. The positive Emerging Markets 
growth has been driven by our acquisitions made in 
the year, and by strong underlying growth (including 
new launches) of 24.6%.
North America performance is largely driven by 
Canon along with strong underlying events such as 
Black Hat (IT Security) and Interop (T echnology) 
where revenues grew by 25.4% and 22.1% 
respectively. Game Developer Conference celebrated 
its 25th anniversary with record attendees.
Our business in Europe has grown by 
51.9%. This is partly due to the addition of the 
Canon European events but also strong growth in 
CPhI W orldwide of 10.4% (this is our second 
largest event in revenue terms and accounts for 
40% of our 2011 European revenues for 
annual events).
Revenues from our UK events have 
decreased by 1.7% partly due to tougher macro 
economic conditions together with the decision 
to discontinue some events.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 
44.6% to £135.2m (2010: £93.5m) with an 
increase in operating margin to 34.1% (2010: 
30.2%). This is partly impacted by the biennial 
effect as our biennials in 2011 operated at a 
higher margin. W e continue to invest in new 
launches and geo-adaptations which have not 
materially impacted our overall margin performance.

Creating new products which enable marketing, 
investor relations and communications professionals 
to do their job more effectively
Revenues are driven by:
The number of press and earnings releases
The types of releases
New products which aid marketing, investor 
relations and communications professionals
Attractions of PR Newswire’s industry:
Increasing necessity for clients to engage with 
a targeted audience
Potential growth of the global disclosure market

The scalability of technology platforms
Potential challenges:
Reputational risk arising from unauthorised or 
fraudulent releases

The remaining PR Newswire revenues are derived 
from our engagement business. Multiple product 
offerings reflect the increasingly rich way in which 
organisations now communicate with their audiences, 
through the addition of photos and video that 
drive increased levels of audience engagement. 
Consequently, we have seen an accompanying 
increase in the employment of MNR’ s (Multimedia 
News Releases).

Both of these revenue drivers are being propelled by 
the structural trend globally in increasing levels of

W e see this trend as continuing over the long term.

Section 1: 2011 Review
Operating and Financial Review 
Segmental Performance continued
2011 performance 
PR Newswire generated solid results in 2011. 
The full year saw a 3.6% increase in headline revenue 
to £187.8m (2010: £181.2m), and 6.6% growth on a 
constant currency basis. Operating profit declined to 
£41.0m (2010: £42.1m), while margin was 21.8%.
US Distribution revenue increased 4.6% to 
£88.7m, on a constant currency basis, due in large 
part to a 2.6% increase in press release volumes to 
195,700 releases (2010: 190,700). W e estimate that 
the overall press release market in the US increased 
by 5.4% in terms of volumes, driven largely by 
smaller competitors who focus largely on small 
and medium-sized entities. Our enhanced release 
offerings have been significantly aided by the growth 
in social media and the increasing widespread 
practice of using multimedia content in company 
communications and marketing. Enhanced releases 
enable us to better service customers’ evolving needs. 
Statistics continue to suggest that we are the clear 
market leader in the multimedia press release market. 
In 2011, we launched iReach, our competitively 
priced offering aimed at capturing a greater portion 
of the small and medium-size enterprise space. 
W e have increased efforts to migrate our US customer 
base from pay-as-you-go arrangements to long term 
committed revenue contracts. In 2011, revenues 
from long term contracts were approaching £20m 
and now account for about 15% of total US revenues. 
US Other revenue (comprised of Engagement 
and W orkflow/Data) decreased by 2.7% to £21.4m, 
on a constant currency basis, reflecting the reduced 
marketing effort associated with our legacy 
W orkflow/Data products as we prepare for the 
launch of Agility (our new integrated workflow 
platform) offset partially by increased volumes from  
MultiV u’ s broadcast and production business. 
US Vintage revenues were up 5.3%, reflecting in 
large part the roll-out of XBRL services to our filing 
and financial printing customers.
The drive to diversify our revenue base has led to 
a strong performance outside US where revenue grew 
12.6% to £59.8m. 
PR Newswire Europe revenues rose by 38.5% 
to £18.7m primarily due to the October 2010 
acquisition of the French data provider, Hors 
Antenne and growth in distribution revenues 
in the UK, the Nordic countries and Germany.

As expected H2 2010 margin 
was a low point, 2011 margin 
was a solid 21.8%
Europe’ s disclosure and news distribution business is 
evolving rapidly and consequently exhibits attractive 
growth opportunities. 
Revenues from emerging businesses in Asia and 
Latin America increased 4.0% to £10.3m due in large 
part to expansion across China. Revenues from 
Canada Newswire increased 3.7% to £30.8m due to 
an increase in distribution revenues and the roll-out 
of the Media V antage workflow platform. 
Our margin was 21.8% as compared to 23.2% 
in 2010, and in line with guidance. W e have made 
significant investments in our products, our 
technology, and in sales and marketing to drive 
continued growth in the changing competitive and 
technological environment. In addition, growth in 
new businesses, including Vintage and in Emerging 
Markets, was dilutive to our operating margin as a 
percentage of revenues.
In summary, 2011 was characterised by growth in 
our core wire distribution business, the development 
and successive beta launches of new products such as 
Agility and iReach, and expansion into high growth 
markets such as China. Our strategy of migrating 
pay-as-you-go customer relationships to committed 
long term contracts has resulted in further 
enhancement of the quality of earnings, particularly 
in terms of improved visibility and stability.

The business model – 
UBM creates value by:
Creating unique high quality data sets which address 
customer needs and are essential for their operations
Building deep, long term relationships with 
customers and industry partners
Commercialising shared data sets with a range 
of different end user segments through multiple 
subscription products and delivery channels
Revenues:
The diversity of businesses within our Data Services 
division means there are different types of revenues 
and therefore different associated drivers
Broadly speaking the drivers are the number of clients 
and how much they are willing to pay to either be 
included in part of the data set or to use the data 
information and services provided
The majority of revenue comes in the form of 
annual commitments either for subscriptions or to 
a bundle of services. A minority of revenue comes 
from projects
Attractions of the Data Services industry:
Profitability that can be achieved from a strong 
market position
Growth prospects of targeted communities as they 
become more information intensive
Growth opportunities from adjacent communities 
and new geographies
Potential challenges:
Investment to support systems and processes for 
increasingly sophisticated digital products
Managing the decline of heritage print products

The marketplace 
There is increasing demand in both the public and 
commercial sectors to make critical decisions on the 
basis of the best available data and market intelligence. 
This increasing ambition of our clients creates 
demand for high quality data sets, information 
portals, data manipulation and decision support 
tools and related services. This market opportunity 
supports UBM Data Services in its drive to be the 
foremost provider of indispensible and custom 
subscription based data sets and analytics to selected 
professional communities.
PwC provide research on the ‘Business 
Information’ segment within the B2B marketplace for 
data analytics. Encompassing a broad array of sectors 
including financials, marketing and industry, data 
based products constitute the most significant part 
of the B2B marketplace and in 2011 was valued at 
$77.9bn (2010: $76.0bn). Market softening in 2010 
of 5.2% was followed by growth in 2011 (2.5%). 
PwC estimate that 2012 will see a return to growth 
of 5.1% with improving single digit growth over the 
medium to long term.
With regards to the ‘directory advertising’ 
market, PwC estimate the market in 2011 to be 
valued at $27.0bn (2010: $28.0bn) of which 81.6% 
constitutes the market for print directory advertising. 
Over the next four years, it is predicted that print 
directory advertising revenues may weaken by 
9.3% (2011–2015 CAGR), while digital directory 
advertising revenues will increase by 21.1%  
(2011–2015 CAGR) as end-users reinforce the 
general migration from print to digital.

Operating and Financial Review 
Segmental Performance continued
2011 performance 
Data Services demonstrated a solid performance in 
2011 generating revenues of £187.0m (2010: £184.7m) 
up 1.2%, and adjusted operating profit of £30.3m 
(2010: £34.1m) down 11.1%. Adjusting for 
acquisitions, discontinued items and the impact of 
currency changes, underlying revenues increased 3.0%.
In 2011, we continued to manage the transition 
from print directories to online digital products and 
workflow solutions to enhance the value of our data. 
The overall market trend from print to digital is 
exemplified in the healthcare vertical where we have 
seen significant demand for our digital subscription 
services as hospitals and healthcare providers across 
Europe and Asia increasingly adopt the use of 
sophisticated data in their information systems.
As the use of healthcare data services grows and 
matures within Emerging Markets we expect to see 
increased demand for our products. Preliminary 
indications of demand are very encouraging with 
initial orders for healthcare data services already in 
from various Latin American markets including 
Brazil. W e continue to make progress in the 
Middle East.
Demand for reference and integrated drug 
information systems grew in 2011 on the back of 
new customer wins in the hospital market.
T rends seen in 2011 included the ongoing migration 
from print to digital and the evolution of web and 
smartphone interfaces for data services. W e remain 
committed to continually maintaining the utmost 
quality of our data sets in order to better serve key 
communities while expanding into new geographies 
such as Latin America. W e strive to maximise the 
growth potential of key verticals and to invest 
where a competitive advantage can be maintained 
while making improvements to internal process 
efficiency through automation and back-office 
system development.
Subscription and listing fee revenues declined 
0.5% to £117.9m (2010: £118.5m) principally 
reflecting the weakness in the T rade & T ransport 
sector. Professional Services revenues remained strong 
in 2011 at £54.0m (2010: £48.5m). Revenue growth 
of 11.3% was principally driven once again by 
increasing demand for our T echnical Intelligence and 
Intellectual Property (IP) services. 
Advertising revenues decreased by 14.7% to 
£15.1m (2010: £17.7m) largely driven by the ongoing 
decline in print advertising within the healthcare and 
transport verticals, specifically in certain print 
directory products.

and existing customers in the IP and custom technical 
intelligence market spaces. On top of this the number 
of large customers served has increased substantially. 
The T rade & T ransport community remains 
under economic pressure and this is reflected in the 
10.5% decline in revenues to £38.5m. While print 
products remain in structural decline, we have seen 
solid demand for digital products from our core 
institutional customers. W e made important strides 
in further enhancing both the quality of our products, 
and their distribution, with expansion in the financial 
information sector.
The revenue of our Paper related products and 
services rose 7.4% to £14.5m helped by our pulp 
& paper economic analysis product and some 
currency appreciation. 
Despite challenging conditions faced by the 
UK construction sector, Data Services revenues in 
our Built Environment vertical increased by 0.8% 
to £12.8m (2010: £12.7m) largely underpinned 
by a good performance in ABI’ s data business, 
incorporating the newly acquired Lead-In 
Research product.
Adjusted operating profit for Data Services fell 
11.1% to £30.3m (2010: £34.1m). As expected, there 
was a decline in the margin to 16.2% (2010: 18.5%). 
As described at our Investor Day in November 2011, 
there is a high level of focus on margin improvement. 
These steps include product rationalisation, cost 
reduction and product enhancement along with 
the launch of new products.

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 27
The marketplace 
Analysis produced by PwC in 2011 provides a helpful 
context to the trends we are seeing at UBM in terms 
of the market for digital advertising. The ‘Digital 
advertising –T rade magazines’ segment of the 
‘Business to Business’ marketplace as seen by PwC 
was estimated to be valued at $2bn in 2011 and is 
forecast to grow by 18.3% CAGR between 2011 
and 2015.
Methods of accessing target audiences via online 
marketing initiatives continued their rapid rate of 
change in 2011. The success of online marketing 
campaigns can be determined by the level of active 
customer engagement and participation. The online 
market is becoming increasingly sophisticated in 
how it both generates and measures these levels of 
interaction. The advent of social media is providing 
further avenues for audience engagement and 
consequently the marketplace is seeing more B2B 
media businesses developing capability in this space. 
One of the other principal areas of focus for 
UBM in 2011 was the further extension of our live 
events service offering into the hosting of live online 
events. This part of UBM known as ‘Digital 
Environments’ (previously referred to as ‘Virtual 
Events’) saw considerable market growth in 2011. 
Unisfair’ s survey of 550 marketers, released in 
February 2012, found that 60% of the respondents 
plan to increase spending for virtual environments 
and events, and 66% are contemplating hosting 10 
or more virtual events in the next 12 months.
UBM’s market position
Fragmentation remains the predominant feature 
of the ‘digital environments’ space and from a base 
of 103 events hosted in 2010, 2011 saw UBM 
organise over 250 digital events, allowing us to 
further consolidate what we believe to be the market 
leadership position. This position has been greatly 
aided by the establishment of a strong online market 
presence and online branding recognition.

Segmental Performance continued
2011 performance
2011 saw continued favourable market trends. 
Revenue increased 27.9% to £88.5m (2010: £69.2m). 
On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by 
31.7%. Whilst profitability improved significantly in 
2011, we continue to invest to capture future growth 
opportunities. Adjusted operating profit was £3.6m 
(2010: £1.3m) and margins improved to 4.1% 
(2010: 1.9%).
Advertising, primarily in our T echnology vertical, 
grew 24.4% in 2011 driving overall underlying 
Online revenue growth of 16.4%. The Healthcare 
vertical generated revenue growth of 40% over 2010 
levels. This was driven predominantly by increasing 
budgets for digital marketing services among 
pharmaceutical clients. 
W e are seeing growing demand from marketers 
for products which help them develop and sustain 
online communities. These products attracted an 
increasing proportion of corporate marketing budget 
spend in 2011. UBM has capitalised on this trend 
by launching Marketing as a Service (MaaS). MaaS 
leverages UBM’ s existing online platforms, systems 
and content management approach and serves 
marketers through lead generation, banner and 
sponsorship models. Online broke new ground 
this year in selling its new MaaS programs to 
the medical, electronics and financial markets, 
contributing significantly to the 2012 forward 
order book.
Lead generation revenues grew to £28.9m (2010: 
£21.8m). The number of virtual events more than 
doubled, with over 250 events organised (2010: 103). 
The virtual events market is evolving to encompass 
broader digital environments including webinars, 
virtual trade shows, recruitment events and e-learning 
programs. Comdex Virtual was UBM’ s highest 
grossing virtual event for the second year running and 
generated increasing levels of customer participation 
and interaction.

In 2011, UBM has taken virtual events to the next level 
and moved to the ﬁrst perpetual virtual career fair 
environment. In addition to hosting career fairs for the 
military community, which drew over 102,000 visitors, 
the Milicruit service remained available throughout the 
year allowing military veterans the opportunity to visit
employer booths and view/apply for vacancies even 
when there was no career fair taking place. Milicruit 
conducted 15 virtual career fairs in 2011, and will deliver 
the ﬁrst virtual career fair for soldiers still serving in the

The biggest contributor to 2011 Online revenues 
continues to be our technology community which 
generated headline growth of 24.5%. 
As in 2010, the Online segment launched a

higher audience engagement. The business also

UBM’s market position
Through a process of continual review, UBM aims to 
focus primarily on profitable publications that offer 
attractive synergies with the expanding online and 
events parts of the business. Our print portfolio will 
continue to generate rationalisation opportunities 
and we aim to maintain a presence in markets and 
communities where we can command a strong 
leadership position.
2011 performance 
In 2011, Print as a proportion of total revenues 
declined to 11.5% (2010: 16.2%), and 2.8% 
(2010: 5.5%) of Group adjusted operating profits, 
excluding corporate costs.
Print revenue declined by 22.2% to £112.1m 
(2010: £144.1m) and adjusted operating profit 
decreased by 39%, reflecting ongoing portfolio 
rationalisation. In 2011 we closed, exited or divested 
31 titles predominantly in the healthcare vertical but 
also in technology and lifestyle, and due to the dilutive 
effect of these disposals in aggregate, Print margin 
declined to 5.4% (2010: 6.9%). U nderlying revenues 
decreased by 4.6%.
Our strategic objective remains to leverage both the 
strength of existing brands and the value of our 
registration databases to drive a profitable ‘paid for 
content’ model and to develop integrated Marketing 
Services offerings.

Section 1: Overview
Financial summary*
2011 has been a successful year for UBM, 
demonstrating significant progress in repositioning 
our business portfolio through organic development 
and our acquisition program. Revenues in 2011 were 
£972.3m, 9.3% higher than in 2010 (2010: £889.2m) 
driven by strong underlying performance of the 
Events, PR Newswire and Online segments and the 
revenue contribution from acquisitions, particularly 
UBM Canon, acquired in October 2010. Adjusted 
operating profit
1
 for 2011 was 17.5% higher at 
£201.9m (2010: £171.8m). Higher margins
1
 
reflected the particularly strong performance of our 
Events business, partially offset by higher net corporate 
costs due to lower offsetting income at the centre. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt 
at 31 December 2011 of £526.4m (the equivalent of 
2.4 times 2011 EBITDA
1
 (2010: 2.6 times)) – an 
increase from the net debt of £484.6m reported at 
the end of 2010, reflecting the substantial cash 
investment in acquisitions during the year of £62.5m.
Corporate costs
T otal corporate costs for 2011 were £19.3m (2010: 
£15.9m). These corporate costs are partially offset 
by gains on disposals and other sundry income not 
attributable to segmental results resulting in net 
corporate costs of £14.3m (2010: £9.2m). 
Exceptional items
Impairment
W e have reviewed the carrying value of our  
intangible assets (including goodwill) in light of 
current trading conditions and expectations and 
consider that no provision for impairment is required 
at 31 December 2011. 
The carrying value of investments in joint 
ventures and associates and equity investments have 
been impaired by £3.1m and £0.6m, respectively. 
Exceptional items relating 
to acquisitions
The exceptional charge for integration costs of £3.6m 
is related to the integration of UBM Canon, acquired 
in October 2010. This includes £2.0m relating to 
redundancy costs and £1.6m relating to business 
reorganisation costs. 
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) 
from 1 January 2010, acquisition costs of £2.9m for 
2011 have been expensed, rather than included in 
the calculation of goodwill on acquisition. For the 
year ended 31 December 2011 an exceptional credit 
of £1.9m was recognised, relating to the revision 
of the contingent consideration estimates for 
acquisitions made.

Exceptional ﬁnance expense
Exceptional finance expense comprises:
In September 2011, UBM redeemed the £75m 
Floating Rate Reset Bonds. As provided under their 
terms, UBM has paid the fair market value of the 
options associated with the Bonds, totalling £19.1m, 
which has been reflected as an exceptional financing 
charge (further information provided in Note 20).
An exceptional interest expense of £8.5m due to the 
reassessment of the amortised cost carrying amount 
of the €53.1m Structured Reset Loans 2012. Further 
details are given in the Capital Structure section below. 
£1.8m relating to fair value movement on put options 
over non-controlling interests. 
Interest
Net interest expense represents interest payments on 
UBM’ s bonds and bank loans, net of interest receipts 
on cash holdings. Net interest expense in 2011 was 
£27.6m, compared with £18.7m in 2010. This is 
mainly a result of a higher average debt for the year 
and higher costs from lengthening debt maturity. 
Further information is set out in the Capital Structure 
section below .
Financing income includes an IAS 19 pension 
interest credit of £3.1m (2010: £3.2m). 
Net financing income – other includes net 
income of £0.5m (2010: net financing expense – 
other £1.4m) taken in respect of ineffective fair 
value hedges and net investment hedges and foreign 
exchange gain on forward contracts. 
Income tax
UBM’ s effective rate of taxation
1
 for the year was 
14.8% (2010: 15.0%). 
Movements in our tax creditor balance during 
2011 were as follows:
£m
Current tax liability at 1 January 2011 69.6
Acquisitions 1.1
Current tax charge 25.6
Tax paid (29.9)
Foreign Exchange and other movements (0. 5)
Current tax liability 
at 31 December 2011 65.9
Overall our current tax liability decreased from 
£69.6m as at 31 December 2010 to £65.9m as 
at 31 December 2011. The tax creditor includes 
provisions for tax settlements in various 
jurisdictions in which UBM operates.
W e have necessarily made judgements as 
to the outcome of tax matters not concluded. 
This creditor has been consistently classified as 
a short term liability in accordance with our 
accounting policy although we do not expect the

US dollar: 1.5444 and Euro: 1.1649.
Recent guidance released by the FRC requires the 
Group to comment on its exposure to risks from the 
Eurozone crisis. 
Euro revenues are a relatively small part of UBM’ s 
total revenue, accounting for 12.3% total revenue 
in 2011, of which over 75% is intra-county and 
approximately 7% relates to customers in Spain and 
Portugal. Given our large and diverse customer base, 
there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group’ s liquidity risk is considered low – 
whilst the Group’ s revolving credit facility is 
normally at least partially drawn in Euros (£24.2m 
at 31 December 2011) this could alternatively be 
drawn in other currencies, and there is headroom 
of £212.2m on the Group’ s borrowing facilities at 
31 December 2011. The Group’ s treasury policy does 
not allow significant exposures with counterparties 
that are rated less than A by Standard & Poor’ s, 
Moody’ s or Fitch and we monitor the concentration 
of risk constantly. 
Capital Structure
Balance sheet
UBM’ s consolidated net debt at 31 December 2011 
stood at £526.4m, up from £484.6m at the end of 
2010. During 2011, cash generated from operations 
rose to £203.7m (2010: £154.7m). UBM paid 
£62.5m for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and 
contingent and deferred consideration payments in 
relation to acquisitions made in prior years, together 
with £61.5m of dividends to shareholders (excluding 
dividends paid to non-controlling interests).
Pensions
UBM operates a number of defined benefit and 
defined contribution schemes, based primarily in the 
UK. The most recent actuarial funding valuations for 
the majority of the UK scheme liabilities were carried 
out in 2011, and updated to 31 December 2011 using 
the projected unit credit method. 
At 31 December 2011, the aggregate deficit 
under IAS 19 was £31.5m, an increase of £18.8m 
compared to the deficit of £12.7m at the previous 
year end.
The IAS 19 pension interest credit was £3.1m, 
representing the excess of expected asset growth 
during 2011 over the interest accretion on the 
scheme liabilities. UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 36

Operating and Financial Review

Chief Financial Officer’ s review continued
Debt and Liquidity
Our funding strategy is to maintain a balance between 
continuity of funding and flexibility through the 
use of capital markets, bank loans and overdrafts. 
T o facilitate access to these sources of funds we seek 
to maintain a long term investment grade credit 
rating with Moody’ s (current rating Baa3 – with a 
stable outlook) and Standard & Poor’ s (current rating  
BBB – with a stable outlook). 
At the end of 2011, we had a strong liquidity 
position including undrawn facilities of £212.2m 
and cash on hand of £106.6m. In May 2011, 
we entered into a five year £300m variable rate 
multi-currency credit facility to replace the £325m 
variable rate multi-currency facility due to expire on 
27 July 2012; the new facility matures in May 2016. 
At 31 December 2011, all conditions precedent 
were met and UBM had drawn £87.8m from the 
syndicated bank facility leaving £212.2m available. 
Details of the new facility are given in Note 20. 
W e also have £250m of Sterling bonds with a 
November 2016 maturity and an annual interest 
coupon of 6.5% and $350m of US bonds with a 
November 2020 maturity and an annual interest 
coupon of 5.75%. 
In September, UBM redeemed the £75m Floating 
Rate Reset Bonds issued in September 2008 (the 
‘Bonds’). UBM paid the fair market value of the 
Bonds (£75m) and the option value (£19.1m) with 
the proceeds of a drawdown under UBM’ s £300m 
2016 Revolving Credit Facility and existing Group 
cash resources.
In March 2009, UBM raised €53.1m (£44.4m) 
through two Floating Rate Reset Loans (the ‘Loans’). 
The Loans bear interest for the first three years at six 
month EURIBOR plus 1.80% (currently 3.48%). 
Under the terms, the lender has the option to put 
them back to UBM at par (€53.1m) in March 2012 
and every three years until maturity in March 2024.
If the Loans are not put then one of three events 
will occur:
1.  The interest rate on the loans are reset to 4.16%, 
respectively, plus UBM’s 3 year credit spread until 
the next put date;
2.  UBM exercises its call option and pays the fair 
value of the instruments at date of exercise to the 
current holders; 
3.  There is no credit spread quote available and 
UBM pays the fair value of the swap at the next 
interest date.

Section 2: Governance „
Section 3: Financial statements „
Since the onset of the 2008/2009 credit crisis, long 
term swap rates have fallen below the reset interest 
rate of 4.16%. This combined with a material increase 
in market volatility has increased the fair value of the 
loans as at 31 December 2011 to €64.0m (£52.9m). 
It is probable the instruments will be repaid in March 
2012. W e have therefore reassessed the future 
estimated cashflows associated with the loans and 
adjusted the carrying amount of the loan accordingly. 
This results in an expense of £8.5m which has been 
recognised as an exceptional financial expense in the 
income statement.
Capital management
UBM maintains conservative capital ratios in order 
to support its businesses and maximise shareholder 
value. At the end of 2011, the net debt to adjusted 
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation

Our policy is to maintain investment grade ratings

In assessing the leverage ratios of net debt to adjusted 
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation, both Moody’ s and Standard & Poor’ s 
take account of a number of other factors, including 
future operating lease obligations and any 
pension deficit.

Operating and Financial Review

Cash ﬂow
Cash generated from operations rose to £203.7m 
from £154.7m in 2010, reflecting lower restructuring 
payments and increase in profits. Cash conversion
1
 
was 100.7% of adjusted operating profit
1
 (2010: 
97.9%). Free cash flow
1
 prior to cash invested in 
acquisitions was £127.3m, £76.3m ahead of 2010, 
reflecting the additional tax payment to HMRC of 
£46.5m in 2010. 
W e expect to continue to generate significant 
free cash flow in 2012 because of our business model 
and believe that our cash on hand, cash from our 
operations and available credit facilities will be 
sufficient to fund our cash dividends, debt service 
and acquisitions in the normal course of business. 
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for the year was £20.0m. 
The largest capital investments were to enhance 
PR Newswire’ s existing products and to upgrade its 
IT infrastructure. W e do not expect that the capital 
expenditure levels for 2012 will be significantly 
different to those of 2011. 
Acquisitions and disposals
W e invested £46.7m in the acquisition of eight new 
businesses (£71.6m including expected contingent 
and deferred consideration). These acquisitions were 
closely aligned to our strategic priorities, increasing 
our exposure to attractive communities and 
geographies. W e also generated £12.1m in net cash 
proceeds from asset disposals, providing additional 
resources to invest in our strategic priorities.

Section 1: Overview
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that UBM has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
In reaching this conclusion, the directors have 
had due regard to the following: 
After taking account of available cash resources, 
committed bank facilities and short term borrowings 
none of UBM’s borrowings fall due within the next 
two years that require refinancing from resources not 
already available. Further information is provided in 
Notes 20 and 21.
The strong cash generated from operations, 
committed facilities and UBM’s ability to access debt 
capital markets, taken together, provide confidence 
that UBM will be able to meet its obligations as they 
fall due.
Further information on the financial position of 
UBM, its cash flows, financial risk management 
policies and available debt facilities are described in 
the Financial Review on the preceding pages. UBM’s 
business activities, together with the factors likely to 
impact its future growth and operating performance 
are set out in the Operational Review.
Conclusion
The 2011 results reflect notable achievement against 
our strategic and financial objectives. Supporting 
strategic change – while maintaining strong financial 
disciplines – has required outstanding effort from the 
Group as a whole and the finance function in 
particular. I would like to close by thanking my 
colleagues for their contribution to the success in 2011, 
and to the confidence with which we enter 2012.

UBM principal risks
Risks Potential impact How it is managed
Sector trends 
UBM operates in highly competitive international 
markets which change in response to technological 
innovation and other global political factors. It is 
not possible to predict with certainty the changes 
which may affect the competitiveness of the business, 
or whether technological innovation or disruptive 
technologies will render some existing products and 
services partially or wholly obsolete. With increased 
agility and innovation within UBM’ s businesses, our 
current organisational structure and control systems 
may not evolve at the same pace and lose alignment 
with the business needs.
UBM’ s strategy of creating a balanced portfolio of 
products improves our ability to meet the changing 
needs of our customers. W e have responded to the 
continuing digital revolution by acquiring and developing 
innovative digital products, while at the same time 
actively managing the contraction of our print magazine 
portfolio. W e closely monitor trends relevant to our 
businesses and regularly discuss with senior management. 
W e consider relevant risk factors in the development of 
new products and services, and develop appropriate 
control systems for new products. W e aim to achieve 
a balance between the requirement for increasing 
innovation and agility which enable us to compete, 
with the requirement for control and scalability.
Economic conditions 
Advertising and other discretionary marketing spend 
tends to be cyclical. An economic slowdown or 
recession, possibly exacerbated by the Eurozone 
crisis, could impact revenue as companies spend less 
on advertising. Any downturn may also result in 
slower debt collections, thereby affecting cash flow .
UBM’ s business is diversified across many different 
markets and geographies, some of which exhibit lower 
levels of cyclicality than others. The geographic spread 
of the business helps to limit the impact of economic 
downturn in any specific country or region. Market 
trends are closely monitored at a divisional level and 
regularly reported upon. Each division closely manages 
credit risk monitoring collections performance and 
reviewing credit policies.
Attracting retaining 
and succession 
planning for key 
management 
personnel
UBM operates in a number of industry segments in 
which there is intense competition for experienced and 
highly qualified individuals. The ability to attract talent 
and retain highly skilled, experienced, and motivated 
personnel plays an important part in the continued 
successful execution of the strategy.
W e place significant emphasis on succession planning 
and developing and retaining management talent. W e do 
this through a variety of means – including incentive 
schemes, by developing a more agile, entrepreneurial and 
innovative company culture and by running a number 
of talent management and specific succession planning 
programs to develop high calibre business leaders.
Geographic and 
Emerging Market 
exposures 
UBM has businesses in many geographic regions 
including growing operations in rapidly developing 
countries. Operations in these new territories may 
present logistical, political and management challenges 
due to different business cultures, laws and languages. 
In addition, foreign exchange rate fluctuations could 
adversely affect our earnings and the strength of our 
balance sheet. Expansion in geographical locations 
remote from the centres of management increases 
the spans of control and oversight.
W e are addressing each of the control, operational and 
reputation risks by sending experienced employees into 
new regions to form part of local management teams 
and through review by internal audit, and close board 
monitoring. Foreign currency exposures are hedged 
under a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies 
where significant transaction exposure exists. UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 42
Section 1: Overview
Operating and Financial Review
UBM principal risks continued
Risks Potential impact How it is managed
Force majeure
A disaster or natural catastrophe, terrorism, political 
instability or disease could affect our ability to continue 
to do business if it renders offices unavailable and/or 
curtails travel.
W e have developed business continuity arrangements, 
including IT disaster recovery plans and back-up delivery 
systems, to minimise any business disruption in the event 
of a major disaster. Insurance coverage may reduce losses 
in certain circumstances. W e also strengthen terms and 
conditions of contracts to minimise liabilities, plan for 
alternatives and diversify to reduce dependence on 
particular products or countries.
Acquisitions: 
identification, 
execution and 
integration
Our strategy involves acquiring companies which are 
accretive to UBM’ s performance. The availability of 
suitable acquisition candidates, obtaining regulatory 
approval for any acquisition and changes in the 
availability or cost of financing may affect our ability to 
execute on this strategy. Where businesses are acquired, 
any delays in integration or unexpected costs or liabilities, 
as well as the risk of failing to realise operating benefits or 
synergies from completed transactions may affect the 
impact of the acquisition.
Risks are mitigated by applying strict financial criteria to 
any potential acquisition including the costs associated 
with financing the transaction, and subjecting the process 
to close monitoring and review by internal audit and the 
Board. The liquidity profile of UBM is closely managed 
by T reasury. Senior management and directors are 
involved in acquisitions on a regular basis and strict 
processes are applied to integrations including a rigorous 
review process for major acquisitions which is designed 
to identify and rectify integration issues at an early stage. 
W e also provide in-house integration training as part of 
career development for certain management positions.
Credit/ counterparty 
exposure and access 
to capital
W e seek to limit interest rate and foreign exchange 
risk by the use of financial instruments. As a result 
we have an unsecured credit risk from the potential 
non-performance by counterparties to these financial 
instruments. The credit risk is normally limited to the 
amount of any mark to market gain on the instrument 
and not the notional amount being hedged. W e also 
have credit exposure for the amount of cash and cash 
equivalents on the balance sheet. UBM liquidity issues 
or restrictions in access to capital may curtail the ability 
to make certain acquisitions, while local liquidity issues 
could have a negative reputational impact, particularly 
with suppliers.
UBM’ s central treasury is principally concerned with 
managing internal and external funding requirements and 
monitoring our working capital. The Head of T reasury is 
accountable to the Chief Financial Officer and the Board. 
W e maintain a balance between continuity of funding 
and flexibility through the use of capital markets, bank 
loans and overdrafts. W e maintain a range of borrowing 
facilities to fund requirements at short notice and at 
competitive rates. T o facilitate access to these sources of 
funds we seek to maintain a long term investment grade 
credit rating with both Moody’ s (current rating: Baa3 – 
stable outlook) and Standard & Poor’ s (current rating: 
BBB – stable outlook).
Credit risk is controlled by T reasury policy which restricts 
the counterparties with whom funds can be invested and 
derivative contracts can be entered into, principally to 
licensed commercial and investment banks with strong, 
long term credit ratings. The policy does not allow 
significant exposures with counterparties that are rated 
less than A by Standard & Poor’ s, Moody’ s or Fitch 
and we monitor the concentration of risk constantly. 
Given our large and diverse customer base, there are no 
significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to 
trade receivables. No single customer accounts for more 
than 1% of UBM’ s revenues. UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 43

Risks Potential impact How it is managed
Major project 
execution 
Significant projects may be required to secure future 
revenue streams and may involve significant capital 
investment (specifically IT and system development). 
The failure to manage and execute these projects 
successfully could lead to increased costs, delays in 
completion or erosion of UBM’ s competitive position.
W e seek to mitigate project-related risks through 
robust project management discipline, monitoring by 
internal audit and assigning responsibility for projects 
at an executive management level within UBM.
Litigation, regulation 
and compliance 
The global nature of UBM means we are subject to 
laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. 
W e are therefore exposed to the risk of unfavourable 
changes in applicable law and its interpretation. These 
risks include, among others, disputes over intellectual 
property, trade terms with customers and/or suppliers, 
customer losses resulting from our IT system delay or 
failure (for example, arising from a breach of Payment 
Card Industry Data Security Standards) and violations 
of data protection and privacy laws. The initiation of a 
claim, proceedings or investigation could have a material 
effect on our reputation, business or financial position. 
New legislation changes may inhibit our ability to grow 
(e.g. requirements to maintain marketing data under data 
protection issues) or have an adverse effect on revenues 
(e.g. changes in government health policies on the use 
of generic drugs may adversely affect the pharmaceutical 
companies’ advertising spend).
Risks are managed through legal reviews, operational 
reviews and staff training to raise awareness of the need 
for compliance in certain areas. The divisions seek to 
monitor legislative changes and regularly discuss with 
senior management.
Tax
The management of tax liabilities is a matter of 
regulatory compliance and legal structure. Failure to 
comply with the necessary legislation could expose 
UBM to penalties or challenges to legal structures such 
that future tax payments may exceed recorded liabilities. 
Similarly changes to taxation legislation may result in 
higher levels of taxation than previously guided to.
W e manage our tax affairs actively including monitoring 
tax developments, liaising with external advisors and 
regularly reviewing the tax planning schemes.
Pensions
The cost of providing pension benefits to existing and 
former employees is subject to changes in pension fund 
values and changing mortality. Asset returns might be 
insufficient to cover changes in the schemes’ liabilities 
over time.
W e mitigate this by active management of the investment 
portfolio and additional contributions have been made 
to the UK schemes. UBM has acted to close its defined 
benefit schemes to new members and neither the CEO 
nor the CFO belongs to such a scheme. Section 1: Overview

Operating and Financial Review
Introduction
This year we have changed the name of our report 
to Sustainability which we believe more accurately 
reflects our approach to creating long term 
shareholder value as well as making a difference to 
our various stakeholders. For us, being a sustainable 
business isn’t just about being green, it’ s about how 
UBM achieves business success today, which includes 
being profitable, whilst assuring its success tomorrow, 
through long-term responsible management and 
stewardship. Our approach encompasses the 
following key areas:
People – how we engage, motivate and support 
our employees;
Environment – how we manage our environmental 
impact;
Communities – how we support the communities 
in which we work; and
Governance – how we ensure good governance 
and manage risk. (Y ou can find out more about 
this in the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 65 to 70.)
2011 has been a year of significant achievement, 
building strongly on the foundations we laid in 2010.
Our highlights of 2011 include:
Expanding our flagship Events serving the charity 
and NGO community, adding a new annual event 
in the UK – Responsible Partnerships – to our 
successful annual Brazilian event – ONG Brasil 
– and planning a further event launch for India in 
2012. I am proud of what we are achieving here and 
of the energy, commitment and expertise of our 
people in delivering these successful not-for-profit 
events; 
A 3.5% reduction in absolute carbon emissions, 
whilst growing the business, and a significant 
improvement in environmental data capture; 
A new program to increase the number of women 
in senior positions, with commitment and support 
from the Board; and
Strong and improved participation in our second 
Global Employee Engagement Survey.
UBM and people
A key element to creating long term shareholder value 
is our ability to attract, develop and retain the most 
talented people at all levels. W e do this in a variety 
of ways: 
Diversity 
W e are a global business with employees, customers, 
partners and suppliers from a wide range of cultures 
and backgrounds. In the At a glance section you 
will have seen how international UBM is in terms 
of its revenues and offices locations. During 2011 
we employed an average of 6,565 people around 
the world. The figures below highlight the diversity 
of our people.

Allowing diversity to flourish and recognising and 
harnessing the unique talents that every individual 
can bring to the business enables us to respond to the 
rapidly changing business environment, to meet the 
diverse needs of our customer base, and to enhance 
creativity and personal development. 
W e have equal opportunities policies and programs 
in place to ensure employees are selected and 
promoted solely on the basis of their skills and ability 
to do the job. 
Job openings at UBM are posted to the Help 
W anted area of the UBM Wiki, so that all employees 
are aware of the opportunities for them to advance 
their careers with UBM.

Employees receive training on diversity (including 
an online test, on induction, for new employees), 
equality and anti-harassment issues. 
W e offer a wide range of flexible working policies to 
enable employees to balance the demands of work 
and personal responsibility including working from 
home, flexible hours, sabbatical leave, enhanced 
parental leave, part-time working, job-sharing and 
compressed working week. 
W e recognise the specific needs of individuals and, 
in particular, ensure that appropriate adjustments 
are made to enable the employment of disabled 
persons. Should employees become disabled 
during employment every effort is made, through 
appropriate training or other adjustments, to 
accommodate their disability and enable them 
to continue to pursue their career.
Our Code of Core Labour Standards guides business 
relationships and sets high standards for ethical 
working practices. 
In 2011, UBM established a goal to increase the 
number of women in senior business leadership roles 
and put in place a number of initiatives to ensure 
that our talented female employees can achieve their 
career aspirations with UBM. This process began in 
May 2011 with a series of workshops, during which 
85 of UBM’ s high potential women shared their 
experiences of developing their careers with the 
Group, and in October non-executive director 
Karen Thomson participated in our Executive 
W omen’ s Forum held in New Y ork. Further details 
on gender diversity appear in the Corporate 
Governance Statement on page 67. 
Talent management
W e place a particular emphasis on the development 
of our people to achieve their full potential, and in 
2011 we continued our targeted talent management 
initiatives and programs. Strong succession planning 
and talent review processes are now embedded into 
the fabric of business management practices, and 
leadership teams across UBM’ s businesses engaged
in the fourth cycle of a robust and systematic review 
of leadership roles and capability requirements in 
order to identify implications for succession planning 
and talent development.
Our 2011 achievements include:
The 2011 cohort of our flagship Business Leaders 
Program (BLP), with 17 high-potential participants 
drawn from seven countries, participated in modules 
in the UK and US, and were each mentored by a 
UBM senior executive or non-executive director. 
During 2011, three alumni of the BLP 2010 
program and one of the BLP 2011 participants 
have been promoted into leadership roles in other 
parts of UBM.
W e launched our China Leadership Development 
Program (C-LDP), run in Mandarin, with 20 
participants from mainland China, Hong Kong 
and T aiwan. 
The European Leadership Development Program 
(E-LDP), refreshed in 2010, completed the first cycle 
of the re-launched program, with 24 participants 
drawn from UBM’s businesses in the UK, Holland, 
France and the UAE. 
Our online 360 tool for the Emerging Leaders 
Framework (to express the leadership capability 
requirements for the broader management 
population) were rolled out to the organisation in 
multiple languages, with over 200 individual 360’s 
completed in 2011. 
During 2011, several UBM Board members 
participated actively in UBM’s leadership 
development interventions. Four non-executive 
directors have participated as guest speakers at 
the Business Leaders Program and the regional 
Leadership Development Programs in Europe 
and China, and five have actively mentored high 
potential executives. In addition, directors have 
had the opportunity to meet with participants and 
alumni of UBM’s leadership development programs 
in the US, Europe and Asia. Section 1: Overview

Communication 
UBM is looking to foster an open, entrepreneurial, 
innovative business culture which allows individuals to 
excel. W e believe that clear and open communication 
with employees is fundamental to fostering a positive 
culture and achieving our business aims. 
Operating and Financial Review
Sustainability continued
UBM’S online community 
The primary way in which we communicate, connect 
and collaborate is via our online community, the 
UBM Wiki. Since 2008 we have pioneered the use 
of social business technology and our Wiki is a 
vibrant media platform connecting employees around 
the world, who share ideas, knowledge, expertise and 
experiences. During 2011 activity in the community 
grew by 28%, active members increased by 15% and 
92% of employees now have accounts. Annual page 
views increased 22% to 4.6 million.
Despite having 6,600 employees across over 40 
different countries our online community is bringing 
our dispersed company closer together than ever 
before. W e have an established culture of sharing and 
learning and our employees can tap into the 
experience and expertise of colleagues, as evidenced 
by a 45% growth in the number of discussions, where 
employees post requests seeking everything from 
answers to specific questions, to help with strategic 
challenges to feedback on new ideas. 
Our online community has succeeded in 
breaking down organisational barriers, creating a 
welcoming place where positive culture thrives, both 
mirroring and reinforcing our ‘in-person’ culture. 
The number of active members in Asia leapt 44% 
and China is now the third most active country after 
the US and UK. Decision-making, planning and 
execution are all enhanced and accelerated, making 
UBM increasingly nimble both in response and 
strategic positioning, and all of UBM’ s knowledge 
is increasingly available to all of UBM’ s employees.
An ongoing dialogue with employees is also 
promoted through appraisals, e-newsletters, town 
hall meetings, web chats, blogging and webinars. 
The employee consultative forums such as town hall 
meetings offer a valuable vehicle for the exchange 
of information with management and also give 
employees the opportunity to meet and share views.
Employment packages – Reward 
strategies and policies, health, welfare 
and beneﬁts
W e have developed policies on compensation, 
rewards and benefits that ensure that the best talent 
is recruited, retained and engaged. The objective is 
to ensure that all staff in all locations are treated fairly 
and we aim to follow best employment practices 
within the local markets in which we operate. 
W e promote and reward based on merit and the 
individual’ s contribution to the business. Reward 
arrangements include bonus and long term incentive 
schemes payable on the achievement of financial and 
personal objectives.
Detailed employment policies are in place across 
our businesses, covering areas such as recruitment, 
training, flexible working, paid leave (e.g. maternity, 
paternity, adoption, parental, carer and sabbatical 
leave), diversity, data protection, anti-malpractice 
(‘Whistle-blowing’) and other policies tailored 
to meet our core principles. 
ubmVoice 
In 2011, we undertook our second UBM-wide 
employee engagement survey – ubmVoice 
– giving colleagues across all businesses 
and in all countries the opportunity to give 
feedback on their experience of working for 
UBM. Participation in the 2011 survey increased 
by 17% to 77% of eligible employees, 
demonstrating their conﬁdence that the survey 
process would result in action being taken to 
address feedback. 
Areas where we performed signiﬁcantly 
above the external norm include:
Feeling part of a team
Feeling valued and respected
Trust in leadership
Making business choices that support the 
environment.
In 2010 we identiﬁed areas for improvement 
around UBM’ s Group identity and communicating 
what the future holds for UBM and our 2011 
scores show how we have improved in these 
areas, most notably with a 12% increase in how 
UBM’ s leadership is communicating a vision for 
the future that motivates employees. This has 
been achieved in a number of ways, including 
new, regular webinar and Wiki Q&A sessions with 
divisional senior management, who give updates 
on progress, strategy and what management is 
thinking, as well as with UBM-wide updates from 
the CEO.
We still have work to do and will be focussing 
on these areas in 2012. Section 1: 2011 Review „
Section 2: Governance „
Section 3: Financial statements „
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47
W e are serious about taking care of our employees and 
offer a wide-range of initiatives to achieve this such as:
Gym/health club reimbursement schemes
Cycle2W ork schemes, secure parking for bikes 
and shower/changing facilities
W ellness clinics and programs
Flu vaccinations
Private medical cover
Health checks-ups
Free eye tests 
Discounted prescriptions
A wide range of other benefits are also available, with 
local variations between markets. Benefits include 
Sharesave, encouraging employee saving and share 
ownership, Company pension schemes and life 
assurance. In the event of redundancies we ensure that 
proper procedures are followed with affected staff in 
accordance with Company policies and local laws, 
and that redundant staff are treated fairly in 
accordance with local best practices.
UBM and the environment 
UBM’ s principal environmental issues are energy 
usage, waste recycling, transport, and paper sourcing 
and usage. In 2010 we produced our first global 
Carbon Report, setting the baseline of performance 
for energy usage and waste, and in 2011 we made 
significant progress in these areas. Building on this 
success we expanded our work to cover travel and 
map our global carbon footprint, and we report our 
carbon footprint baseline figures opposite. Last year 
we set ourselves the target of reducing absolute carbon 
emissions by 5% by 2012 (from the 2010 baseline), 
and in 2011 we took a large step towards that in 
achieving a 3.5% reduction, whilst growing the 
business and employing more people. 
2011 Environmental successes
1.  UBM is rated in the top 4% of the UK’s CRC 
Energy Efficiency Scheme Performance League 
Table. 
2.  First global travel survey conducted to gather 
data on UBM commuting and business travel.

Sustainable events
As a leading organiser of events all around the world 
we aim for excellence in running our events by 
conducting business operations in a sustainable 
manner, and we recognise that we have a key role in 
raising awareness of sustainability issues amongst our 
suppliers and customers. In 2011 UBM Live became 
one of the first companies in the global events 
industry to achieve the BS8901 accreditation for 
sustainable event management, and our CPhI 
W orldwide and FI Europe Events in 2011 were 
our first events to be BS8901 accredited. 
T o achieve BS8901 UBM Live demonstrated 
that we genuinely care about the impact that our 
business has on our employees, our customers and 
on the environment and that we have proper systems 
in place to minimise any negative impacts of our 
business activities. Clear objectives and targets have 
been set, relating to reducing energy usage, water 
usage and waste; training for employees; promoting 
health and safety of employees, exhibitors and 
visitors; promoting sustainability in the stakeholder 
supply chain; monitoring the sustainability 
performance of suppliers and contractors; reviewing 
and continually striving to improve the Sustainability 
Management System; being profitable and ensuring 
long term success; and ensuring that sufficient 
resources have been allocated to meet our 
commitments and continually improve our 
sustainability performance.
Having set the standard, we now aim to lead 
the way in our stewardship of the Events sector and 
to drive best practice across UBM. 
Environmental reporting – Results for 2011
Whilst UBM has grown signiﬁcantly over the course 
of 2011, there has still been a reduction in absolute 
emissions. 2011 when compared to 2010 is illustrated 
by the graph below:
Reduction in absolute emissions 
% 
Absolute carbon emissions
1
3.5
Carbon emissions per head 7.6
1 On track for target 5% by end of 2012.
These reductions have been made through space 
rationalisation and ofﬁce consolidations; improved technology 
and continued management at existing locations; energy 
saving measures built into new ofﬁce relocations, making our 
new ofﬁces much more energy efﬁcient; reductions to waste 
and landﬁll emissions – our Head Ofﬁce in London is no 
longer sending any waste to landﬁll and instead it is sent to 
centres where waste is converted into energy; and more 
accurate data collection – over 25% of our global ofﬁce 
square footage now has energy usage measured by smart 
meters, increasing the accuracy of the data and our ability 
to inﬂuence it. 
Reporting is now part of a continual improvement 
process, and we have improved both the accuracy and 
the amount of data collected, as expressed below:

UBM in the community
NGO Events – Making a difference
Our NGO Events are unique, free events for the charity/NGO 
community, bringing together charities, NGOs and 
companies as well as CR practitioners on a large scale. They 
form a key component in how we operate as a responsible, 
sustainable business and are UBM’ s most signiﬁcant 
community investment, in terms of time, money and 
resources. We believe that the best way for us to support the 
communities in which we do business is by doing what we 
do best – running Events. We harness UBM’ s commercial 
resources, and the expertise and experience of our staff in a 
not-for-proﬁt environment. The NGO Events series has the 
personal commitment of David Levin, CEO, who is the 
sponsor at Board level.
Launched in Brazil in 2009, we have been pushing 
ahead with developing a global series of Events to support 
the NGO and charitable communities. 2011 saw the third 
annual Brazilian NGO Event – ONG Brasil http://www.
ongbrasil.com.br/en/ – and the ﬁrst UK Event – 
Responsible Business 
http://www.responsiblebusinessevent.org/, while we 
will add an event in India in 2012 – NGO India http://www.
india-ngo.com and in the USA in 2013. This series of free 
events enables NGOs to network; share best practice; raise 
their proﬁle and build partnerships with business. The total 
cost to UBM of the NGO Events series during 2011 was 
£397,365.
Since 2009 ONG Brasil has more than doubled in 
size as it becomes a ﬁxture in the NGO calendar, and last 
year saw 453 exhibiting NGOs, 753 conference delegates 
and 10,500 visitors, while Responsible Business 2011 saw 
138 exhibiting NGOs, 350 conference delegates and 2,000 
visitors.
The NGO Events series is also supported by PR 
Newswire, the primary wire distributor for the Events, who in 
2011 supplied free distributions, a media room to promote 
the UK event and ﬁve free media rooms to NGOs, worth 
a total of £152,713.
W e also offer complimentary or discounted services 
to not-for-profit entities – for example: 
PR Newswire offered free services for charities, 
NGOs and corporations offering relief services 
during the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, worth 
£78,500. 
PR Newswire also provided complimentary 
news releases to all charities and NGOs declaring 
commitments at the 2011 Clinton Global Initiative 
Conference, worth £45,000. 
Via its partnership with CSRwire, PR Newswire 
provided expanded distribution to media, analysts 
and stakeholders to any PR Newswire member that 
has a CSR/Sustainability communication initiative.
W e frequently donate Events stands to NGOs 
to enable them to get closer to specific industries. 
Our Events in the US coordinate with venues 
and local not-for-profit agencies to organise food 
donations from Events to local soup kitchens and 
support centres. At many of our Events we raise 
money for charity and The Asian A wards in London 
raised £77,000 for Save The Children. In total our 
awards Events raised £152,000 for charity in 2011.
UBM employees are also encouraged to undertake 
volunteering activities and are given time off each 
year, with pay, to volunteer. UBM LLC Foundation, 
our community foundation in the US, is pioneering 
initiatives to blend our volunteering and pro bono 
activities with our Events, delivering UBM resources 
to charities and not-for-profit entities, from skilled 
expertise to free exhibitor space, and last year the 
Foundation won the San Francisco Bay Area 
Community Involvement Corporation A ward, 
which annually recognizes one business that operates 
an outstanding employee community involvement 
program. In 2011 more than 20 Events benefitted 
local communities in the US, for example, our Game 
Developer Conference developed a free web-based 
Flash game for adults that presents online safety 
instruction for children, in non-profit partnership 
with W eb WiseKids, promoting youth safety in the 
digital world; and students were awarded grant 
funding at EE Times’ Annual Creativity in 
Engineering A wards for their school to receive 
STEM (science, technology, engineering and 
math) materials.  Section 1: Overview
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 50
W e operate a matched giving scheme through which 
fundraising efforts by UBM’ s employees are matched 
by the Company, together with a payroll giving 
scheme in the UK, whereby regular donations by 
employees are matched. The cash donations to charity 
are based either on proposals generated by employees, 
or by reference to the level of volunteer work 
undertaken by employees. 
In the Spring 115 UK employees, led by the 
CEO, supported the pilot of ‘W ork for Oxfam for a 
day’ by donating a day, half day or hour of salary, 
raising over £9,000, which UBM then matched.
In addition to the expanded commitments 
around the NGO Events we also made cash 
donations to charities of £270,097 (2010: £437,971) 
and in total committed cash, resources and services 
of £943,675 (which includes the NGO Events).
Health and safety
W e recognise that providing a safe working 
environment for our employees, and for the 
exhibitors and visitors to our many Events, is an 
essential responsibility of management and employees 
at all levels. Health and safety policy lies with the 
Board and each divisional CEO is responsible for 
making sure that their business operates in 
compliance with relevant health and safety legislation 
and procedures. Divisional CEOs also undertake 
health and safety awareness training. 
Our principal health and safety issues relate to 
the operation of our Events which had 1.6m visitors 
in 2011. While local legal requirements may vary, 
our aim is to set benchmark standards for managing 
health and safety at our Events around the world. 
Contractors and exhibitors are made aware of our 
demanding requirements with detailed health and 
safety guidance, and the majority of contractors have 
either undertaken formal health and safety training 
or plan to do so because we demand it. W e have 
continued to seek to apply the highest standards in 
each of our Events – taking account of local 
regulations and norms but also applying our own 
approach. Risk assessments are conducted at our 
Events and a health and safety manager is on site for 
the duration of the Event. UBM works closely with 
external health and safety experts to undertake regular 
independent health and safety audits of our Events 
and we continually seek to improve and share best 
practice. Our Internal Audit department reviews 
health and safety issues at Events, with particular 
emphasis on Emerging Markets. 
Office-based employees undertake annual online 
health and safety training courses and workplace 
risk assessments.
Suppliers
W e aim to do business in a consistent, responsible and 
appropriate manner. By working closely with venues, 
suppliers and contractors we encourage sustainability 
and environmentally responsible activities and sound 
sourcing. Through regular communication we ensure 
that our partners meet the same high standards that 
we set for ourselves, including adherence to local laws 
and best practice.
W e conduct surveys with suppliers, listen to their 
feedback and share our knowledge with them. Major 
suppliers and contractors are audited on their green 
initiatives, and wherever practicable we use locally 
sourced supplies.

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 51
Explanation of UBM’ s business measures
Financial measure How we deﬁne it Why we use it 
U nderlying revenue and underlying 
operating profit
Underlying measures are adjusted for the estimated effects 
of acquisitions, discontinued products, foreign exchange 
and biennial events.
The Group believes underlying revenue and underlying 
operating profit assists investors in their assessment and 
understanding of our underlying business trends, without 
distortion from the effect of acquisitions, discontinued 
products, biennial events and foreign currency movements 
during the period.
Adjusted operating profit  
and EBITDA
Adjusted margin
Operating profit excluding amortisation of intangible 
assets arising on acquisitions, exceptional items and share 
of taxation on joint ventures and associates. EBITDA 
is adjusted operating profit before depreciation.
Margin relates to our adjusted operating margin. It is 
adjusted operating profit expressed as a percentage of 
total revenues.
The Group believes adjusted operating profit, adjusted 
operating margin and adjusted EBITDA assists investors in 
their assessment and understanding of our earnings and is 
also a measure commonly used by shareholders to measure 
our performance.
Adjusted profit before tax  
and adjusted EPS
Before amortisation of intangible assets arising on 
acquisitions, exceptional items, share of taxation on profit 
from joint ventures and associates, net financing income/
(expense) – other. EPS also excludes deferred tax on the 
amortisation of intangible assets. Diluted EPS includes 
the impact of share options.
The Group believes adjusted profit before tax and adjusted 
EPS assists investors in their assessment and understanding 
of our earnings and is also a measure commonly used by 
shareholders to measure our performance.
Net debt Net debt is current and non-current borrowings less cash 
and cash equivalents.
Provides a measure of indebtedness in excess of the current 
cash available to pay down debt.
Net debt to EBITDA
Net debt to L TM EBITDA
Net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA.
EBITDA adjusted to include a full year of pro forma 
operating profit from acquisitions made during 2011.
Provides a measure of financial leverage.
Free cash flow Net cash provided by operating activities after meeting 
obligations for interest, tax, dividends paid to non-
controlling interests, capital expenditures and other 
investing activities.
Helps assess our ability, over the long term, to create value 
for our shareholders as it represents cash available to repay 
debt, pay dividends and fund future acquisitions. 
Adjusted operating cash flow 
 
 
Cash conversion
Adjusted to exclude non-operating movements in 
working-capital, such as expenditure against reorganisation

Introduction from Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
Directors’ remuneration report
Business context
2011 has been a very successful year with revenues up 9.3% and adjusted 
operating profits increased by 17.5%; adjusted fully diluted earnings per share 
and dividend payouts are at a record high for the Group.
Underlying these financial results is the delivery against key strategic objectives. 
The strategic focus in 2011 has been on the provision of sought after products, 
to growth communities, in growing markets. Good progress has been made in 
these areas with expansion in new business offsetting significant print declines; 
the Events portfolio has continued to grow in significance and now delivers 
more than 40% of revenues and 21.3% of revenues generated from high growth 
Emerging Markets such as China, India and Brazil.
As reported the measures agreed under the 2011 annual bonus plan reflected this 
mix of financial and strategic objectives for the Group. The bonus outcomes are 
87.7% for David Levin and 90.3% for Robert Gray respectively. These outcomes 
reflect the considerable progress made by the Group over the year against both 
the strategic and financial goals. 
Remuneration policy 
A wards made under UBM’ s long term incentive plans (the Bonus Investment 
Plan (‘BIP’) and Performance Share Plan(‘PSP’)) in 2010 were subject to a 
performance condition based on relative TSR. In 2011 the Committee reviewed 
the performance conditions for these plans to ensure that they continued to 
represent appropriate measures to both align performance with shareholder 
interests and to reward structural growth of the business. In doing so the 
Committee took account of feedback from shareholders who had indicated a 
preference for more than one performance measure. The Committee decided to 
retain the TSR performance condition for awards made under the PSP in 2011 
and to adopt an EPS based condition on the BIP requiring growth in EPS of RPI 
+5% to +10% per annum.
In considering the performance conditions for awards to be made in 2012 the 
Committee proposes to retain the TSR measure for PSP awards. A wards made 
under the BIP will no longer be linked to RPI but will be absolute EPS growth 
targets. It was felt that the link to a UK-based measure, such as RPI, was no 
longer appropriate due to the international nature of UBM. The Committee 
agreed that the EPS growth target for awards made under the BIP in 2012 will 
be EPS growth of between +5% to +9% per annum.
Alan Gillespie  
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Alan Gillespie
Dear Shareholder, 
I am pleased to present the remuneration report for the 2011 financial year.
The Committee has not made any fundamental changes to the structure of 
remuneration for the directors during the year however, to further encourage and 
recognise the need for alignment with shareholders, we have decided to introduce 
a formal shareholding guideline for executive directors. For the CEO this will 
be 1.5 times base salary and for the CFO 1 times base salary, to build up over 
a suitable period. 
During the year the Committee also decided to make an award of 150,000 
market priced share options to Robert Gray, CFO. The Committee made this 
decision to further increase Mr Gray’ s alignment with shareholders through 
equity awards and provide additional lock-in over the next few years. The 
Committee considered market priced share options to be the most appropriate 
incentive, in this instance, as the inherent share price hurdle ensures that any 
payout is aligned with the value created for shareholders. The option grant is also 
subject to stretching EPS performance conditions over three years. The 
Committee was also mindful that the aggregate PSP awards made to Mr Gray 
since his appointment in September 2009 are lower than the equivalent of the 
stated policy of 150% of base pay per annum. 
During the year, of the awards made to David Levin in 2008, 37.8% of the shares 
awarded under the 2008 Performance Share Plan vested, with a value at vesting of 
£204k. The shares awarded under the other Long T erm Incentive Plans in 2008 
and due to vest in 2011 did not meet their respective performance conditions. 
The aggregate value of the shares which lapsed was approximately £1.36m. As 
Robert Gray joined the Board in 2009 no performance related awards were due 
to vest in 2011. Further details of performance and non-performance related 
awards are included in the main outcomes section of this report. Section 2: Governance

Both the BIP Matching and ESOS awards granted in 2008 were subject to a 
performance condition based on EPS. UBM’ s EPS did not grow over the period 
from 2008 to 2010, therefore none of the BIP Matching shares and none of the 
ESOS award vested in 2011. BIP Bonus shares were not subject to any 
performance condition.
The PSP award granted in 2008 was subject to relative TSR performance against 
a selected comparator group, as described on page 59. During the period 2008 
to 2010 UBM’ s average TSR was 1.7% above the comparator group and 
consequently 37.8% of the PSP awards vested in 2011. The remaining 62.2% 
of the PSP award lapsed.
The ERP award, as described on page 60, was not subject to a performance 
condition and vested on the second anniversary of the date of grant.

Contents of the report
The information in the Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in 
accordance with paragraph 11 and Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
This report on directors’ remuneration includes the following:
 – A description of UBM’s policy on executive remuneration for 2012 and 
subsequent years. 
 – Details of each director’s remuneration earned in 2011 and awards under long 
term incentive plans. 
 – Information regarding the constitution and duties of the Remuneration

appropriate to do so, and to invite shareholders to approve it. Accordingly, 
a resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 10 May 2012.
Remuneration at a glance
Key principles of UBM’s executive remuneration policy
UBM recognises the need to attract, retain and incentivise executives with the 
appropriate skills and talent to manage and develop the Group’ s businesses in 
such a way as to drive the Group’ s strategy and deliver shareholder value. The 
main principles of UBM’ s executive remuneration policy are:
 – To achieve total remuneration packages that are competitive in the sector and 
countries within which the Group operates and with the market in general. 
 – To provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration 
that rewards high levels of performance. Base salary levels are designed to 
be at median while variable remuneration is linked to key measures of both 
corporate and personal performance and rewards significant outperformance 
of targets. 
 – To incentivise and retain management and to align their interests with those 
of shareholders. 
The policy aims to ensure that executives are rewarded for a combination 
of absolute and relative performance and share-based incentive plans are 
an important element of variable remuneration, linking reward to share 
price performance. Section 1: 2011 Review „

2011 Annual Bonus outcomes
The table below sets out the range of performance criteria that were applied 
to assess the executive directors’ 2011 bonus eligibility and the level of bonus

At least 25% of the bonus earned for 2011 will be paid in the form of deferred 
shares to be awarded in 2012 under the Bonus Investment Plan, which is

The results reflected UBM’ s solid financial performance, while achievement of 
personal objectives included considerable achievements in strategic goals; growth 
in Emerging Markets; transition and recruitment of senior executives at divisional 
level; sustainability; financial reporting; and capital structure. 
For 2012, the maximum bonus opportunity for both executive directors will

2012 Annual Bonus Performance measures
Executive directors are eligible for an annual bonus dependent on the

and sustainability.
The equivalent percentages for Robert Gray are 60% of salary linked to financial

 – Engagement with shareholders.
During 2011 the Committee was advised by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC), who were appointed by the Committee. PwC also advise the Group 
in relation to taxation and HR matters. Kepler Associates conducted interim 
valuations of the Performance Share Plan (TSR-based) and provide no other 
services to the Company.
The Committee was also advised by the Company Secretary, Anne Siddell, 
who is secretary to the Committee, and Jane Allen, Head of Reward.
The Committee has written terms of reference which may be viewed on the 
Group’ s website at www .ubm.com. Copies may be obtained from the 
Company Secretary.
As part of the Board effectiveness review completed during 2011 the 
Committee’ s performance was reviewed. The amount of time available for 
meetings was increased during 2011, as a direct response to feedback from 
the review . 
Remuneration components
The various elements of executive directors’ remuneration packages are 
described below:
Base salary
In determining base salaries, the Committee customarily benchmarks salary 
levels for comparable roles at companies within UBM’ s TSR peer group as well 
as other companies of similar size to UBM and the FTSE 250, and considers 
matters such as inflation, the individual’ s responsibilities, the Company’ s 
performance and the salary policy throughout the Group as a whole. 
Salary levels are reviewed annually.
In line with a general pay freeze for UBM employees, David Levin’ s salary was 
not increased in 2009 or 2010. Robert Gray joined the Board in September 2009 
and his salary was not reviewed in 2010. Both executive directors were awarded 
a 3% salary increase in 2011. In agreeing this increase the Committee took note 
of the fact that the average salary increase across the Group’ s general employee 
population in 2011 was 3%.
Therefore for 2011 David Levin’ s salary was £621,260 and Robert Gray’ s was 
£437,750.
Since joining UBM in April 2005, David Levin’ s average salary increase, up to the 
end of 2011, has been 3.7% per annum, and since joining UBM in September 
2009 Robert Gray’ s average salary increase has been 2.4% per annum. In 2012 
both David Levin and Robert Gray will receive salary increases of 3% in line with 
average salary increases across the Group. Therefore for 2012 David Levin’ s salary 
will be £640,000 and Robert Gray’ s will be £451,000.
Bonuses
Executive directors are eligible for an annual bonus dependent on the 
achievement of targets which take account of corporate performance as well as 
individual objectives. These targets are reviewed annually and new objectives set 
by the Committee for each director at the start of the financial year.
In 2011 David Levin had a maximum bonus opportunity of 170% of base salary 
and Robert Gray had a maximum opportunity of 120% of base salary.
Details of 2011 Bonus outcomes and 2012 Bonus performance measures are 
described on page 57.
Long term incentive awards
In 2011 executive directors received awards under the Performance Share Plan 
and the Bonus Investment Plan in respect of their bonuses for 2010; Robert Gray 
also received an ESOS award with an option price of 439.53p.
Performance Share Plan 
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards are in the form of nil cost options over 
the Company’ s shares or restricted shares. A wards will vest in whole or in part 
on the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided the director remains in 
the Group’ s employment, and subject to the performance conditions being met, 
as described below . A wards may also vest in part, subject to the performance 
conditions being met, if employment ceases due to redundancy, disability, injury, 
death, retirement or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.

Performance condition
The PSP requires UBM’ s TSR to outperform, over a three-year period, that of a 
peer group of companies selected by the Committee: Relative TSR v peer group.
Outperform median by 10% pa 100% of award vests
Median 25% of award vests
Below Median 0% vests
In between these positions Vests on a straight-line basis
The comparator group for awards made in 2011 comprised the following 17 
companies, which were selected for their mix of business and geographic 
representation:
Aegis Group McGraw-Hill
WebMD DMGT
Euromoney W olters Kluwer
Pearson Lagardere
Reed Elsevier APN News & Media
Informa Global Sources
Tech T arget Thomson Reuters
Axel Springer WPP
IHS
The Committee reviews the peer group at least once a year, to confirm that it 
continues to represent an appropriate benchmark. There were no changes to the 
peer group during 2011.
The Committee must also satisfy itself that the reported TSR is a genuine 
reflection of the Company’ s underlying financial performance over the three-year 
performance period before releasing any awards. The maximum award allowed 
under the PSP in any financial year is 2 times salary, although awards normally 
do not exceed 1.5 times base salary in any financial year. In 2011 the Committee 
made awards of 1.5 times salary to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer. Details of awards held by directors under the PSP are set out in A wards 
under long term incentive plans table on page 63.

* Based on relative TSR performance v peer group as at 31 December 2011.  
Bonus Investment Plan
The Bonus Investment Plan (‘BIP’) requires part of participants’ annual bonus to 
be deferred into UBM shares, which must be held for three years. The plan also 
provides the opportunity to earn matching shares based on performance against 
stretching EPS targets as set out below . BIP awards are in the form of nil cost 
options over the Company’ s shares or restricted shares. 25% of bonus is 
automatically deferred into UBM shares, calculated using the average share price 
for the month preceding the start of the relevant financial year. Participants may 
also elect to defer up to a further 25% of their bonus into UBM shares calculated 
by reference to the market value as at the date such award is made. A wards will 
vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided the director remains 
in the Group’ s employment. V esting of the matching shares is dependent on the 
performance targets being met, as described opposite. A wards may also vest in 
part, subject to the performance conditions being met, if employment ceases due 
to redundancy, disability, injury, death, retirement or in other circumstances at 
the discretion of the Committee.
The cash value of the bonus option shares, calculated in accordance with the rules 
of the BIP , was included in the directors’ remuneration table in respect of the year 
in which they were earned.
The key features of the BIP awards made in 2011 are:
Automatic bonus 
deferral – 25%

Details of awards held by directors under the BIP are set out in A wards under 
long term incentive plans table on page 63.
Under the rules of the BIP participants have the potential to receive up to three 
matching shares for every bonus share held, subject to the performance 
conditions being met. For BIP awards made in 2011 the Committee decided, 
as in previous years, to limit the match to a maximum of two matching shares per 
bonus share held. Shares that vest under the BIP accrue dividends.
Participation in the BIP is at the discretion of the Committee which may, from 
time to time, choose to make alternative incentive awards which it considers are 
of an equivalent nature.
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Company operates a shareholder approved Executive Share Option Scheme 
(the ‘ESOS’) under which options are awarded to senior employees, including 
executive directors, to reward past performance and to incentivise future 
performance. Options are granted at market value. The Committee determines 
the appropriate level of each grant having regard to corporate objectives, market 
forces and individual circumstances. The maximum face value of options awarded 
will generally not exceed 3.5 times base salary in any financial year.
ESOS awards will vest in whole or in part on the third anniversary of the date of 
grant, provided the individual remains in the Group’ s employment, and subject 
to the performance conditions being met. A wards may also vest, subject to the 
performance conditions being met, if employment ceases due to redundancy, 
disability, injury, death, retirement or in other circumstances at the discretion 
of the Committee.
The ESOS award granted to David Levin in 2008 was subject to a performance 
condition based on growth in EPS. UBM’ s EPS did not grow over the period 
from 2008 to 2010, therefore none of the ESOS award vested in 2011.
Executive directors did not receive any awards under the ESOS in 2009 and 
2010. In 2011 Robert Gray received an award of 150,000 shares under the ESOS 
at an option price of 439.53p. The award has a performance condition based on 
achievement against absolute growth in EPS over the three-year vesting period. 
25% of the Option will vest if EPS growth over the vesting period is equal to an 
average of  7% p.a., 100% of the Option will vest if EPS growth over the vesting 
period is equal to an average of 10% p.a. and straight-line vesting will occur 
between these points.
A wards made in 2009 and 2010 to employees below Board level had a 
performance condition based on achievement against budgeted EPS over a 
12-month period. The performance conditions have been met and the awards 
will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. A wards made in 2011 to 
employees below Board level are not subject to a performance condition and 
are subject to continued employment by the participants.
2011 ESOS outcome
Performance period EPS performance/estimate Vesting/estimate
2008–2010 (matured 2011) Nil growth Zero vested
Executive Retention Plan
The Company grants restricted share awards in special circumstances to 
individuals, as a recruitment or retention tool. The Company awarded restricted 
shares with a value of £100,000 to the Chief Financial Officer, Robert Gray, 
when he joined the Company in September 2009. The award was not subject 
to any performance conditions and vested in September 2011.
No awards were made to executive directors under the Executive Retention Plan 
in 2011.
Sharesave
Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave scheme, under 
which all eligible employees around the Group may acquire options over ordinary 
shares of the Company at a discount of up to 20% of their market price, using the 
proceeds of a related SA YE contract.
Pensions
All UBM’ s defined benefit schemes are closed to new employees joining the 
Group. For new recruits (including executive directors) it is UBM’ s policy to 
offer defined contribution pension provision, or an alternative cash allowance. 
In 2011 UBM operated an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme 
(‘EFRBS’) as an alternative vehicle for pension provision. Between January and 
March 2011 contributions for David Levin were made into the EFRBS and from 
April 2011 he received a cash allowance, while Robert Gray received a cash 
allowance. In each case the pension contribution/allowance was 20% of salary. 
Performance conditions
In 2005, UBM started reporting its results in line with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). In order to achieve consistency of measurement, 
the Committee retained UK GAAP as the basis for measuring performance 
conditions for awards maturing since 2005, up to and including 2010. IFRS will 
be used as the measurement basis for awards maturing in 2011 and beyond.
Dilution limits
The use of newly issued or treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Group’ s long 
term incentive plans is limited to 10% of UBM’ s issued share capital. A wards 
made under the Performance Share Plan, Bonus Investment Plan and the 
Restricted Share Plan are expected to be satisfied with market-purchased shares 
held by an employee benefit trust. Outstanding options under UBM’ s other long 
term incentive plans which could require shares to be issued currently account for 
approximately 3.9% of UBM’ s issued share capital.
Executive directors’ service contracts
It is the Company’ s policy that all executive directors should have service contracts 
that are terminable on no more than one year’ s notice and that contracts should 
not have a fixed term. Any payments on early termination by the Company would 
be by reference to the unexpired period of notice, subject to a duty to mitigate. 
Executive directors’ contracts provide for automatic termination at age 65.
The dates on which each executive director’ s current service contract commenced 
are as follows:
David Levin – 5 April 2005
Robert Gray – 14 September 2009

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61
Policy on external appointments
The Company considers that by permitting executive directors to hold office as 
a non-executive director of another company, they will increase their knowledge 
and experience, thereby benefiting UBM. The policy allows executive directors 
to accept not more than one outside corporate directorship, subject to Board 
approval. Directors are entitled to retain the fees earned.
Robert Gray is an advisory board member of Codere S.A. and received fees 
of €42,921 during 2011 (2010: €38,654).
Non-executive directors 
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration
The Board’ s policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration is to pay fees which 
reflect their responsibilities, are competitive with those of other FTSE 250 
companies, and which align directors’ interests with those of shareholders.
The Board as a whole considers and approves the fees of the non-executive 
directors, with the exception of the Chairman whose fees are approved by 
the Committee. 
Non-executive directors’ fees are paid partly in cash and partly in UBM shares. 
These shares are reflected in the Directors’ interests in shares table on page 64.
Additional fees are paid to the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees and to the Senior Independent Director.
The fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors are denominated in Euros 
and paid at the annual rates shown below:
Cash 
€
Shares 
€
Chairman 190,000 150,000
Non-executive director 38,076 19,038
Additional fee for Remuneration Committee 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director 25,384 –
Additional fee for Audit Committee Chairman 12,692 –
Additional fee for membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees 4,000 –
Following a review of non-executive directors’ fee levels, and with effect from 
1 January 2011, non-executive directors received a fee of €4,000 per annum in 
respect of membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, and travel 
allowances were paid in respect of attendance at Board meetings requiring an 
overnight stay outside the individual’ s country of residence. The allowances are 
€1,000 per meeting or €2,000 per meeting involving intercontinental travel. 
There were no other changes to fees during 2011.
Non-executive directors’ contracts
Upon his appointment as Chairman in December 2007, John Botts entered into 
a three-year contract, terminable by either party on not less than 12 months’ 
notice. Following a review in 2010, the Chairman’ s contract was extended for 
18 months until May 2012 and his fee increased to a total of €340,000 of which 
€190,000 is paid in cash and €150,000 is paid in UBM shares.
Other non-executive directors do not have a service contract with the Company 
but are engaged under a letter of appointment which provides for an initial term 
of three years, unless terminated earlier by either party on not less than three 
months’ notice. None of the non-executive directors’ terms of appointment 
contain any provision for payment of compensation on early termination.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in the Company’ s share 
incentive plans or pension schemes.
Each director’ s appointment (including that of the Chairman) is reviewed every 
three years. Set out below are the dates on which each non-executive director was 
first appointed to the Board and the year in which he or she was elected or last 
re-elected by shareholders.

Notes to directors’ remuneration table
1. The fees of the Chairman and non-executive directors are denominated in Euros and include an element which is paid in the for m of ordinary shares as described on page 61. The table reflects the 
sterling equivalent of those fees. From 1 January 2011 non-executive directors received an additional €4,000 per annum in respect of membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
There were no other changes in 2011. The difference between the fees shown and the comparative figures for 2010 is the result of fo reign exchange movements and/or changes in allowances (see note 
3 below). The exchange rate used was the actual rate at the date of each monthly payment.
2. The executive directors receive the benefit of private medical insu rance. The figure for Robert Gray includes both UK and US pri vate medical cover of £19,286, a relocation allowance of £39, 037 
and a cash allowance in lieu of pension contribution of £87,550. The figure for David Levin includes private medical cover of £747 and a cash allowance in lieu of pension contribution of £93,189.
3. John Botts, Jonathan Newcomb and Pradeep Kar received payments in respect of applicable Irish PRSI and Income T ax equalisation of £2,484, £3,279 and £2,740 respectively for the period to 
31 December 2011, to ensure that the effect of the change of domicile of UBM during 2008 was tax neutral. Additionally, travel allowances are paid to each non-executive director in respect of 
attendance at Board meetings requiring an overnight stay outside their country of residence. The fee is €1,000 per meeting or €2,000 per meeting requiring intercontinental travel. The sterling 
equivalent of the travel allowances are shown in the Allowances column above.
4. The bonus column reflects the cash value of bonus earned in respect of 2011. At least 25% of the total bonus earned will be co nverted into ordinary shares based on a share price of 671.67p 
(which was the average share price in December 2010) and David Levin and Robert Gray will be given provisional awards over these shares in 2012.
5. The total comparative figure for 2010 includes a decrease of £7,989 to Robert Gray’ s 2010 total, being an adjustment to the me dical cover component for 2010. Greg Lock was appointed in 
February 2010 and the comparative figure for 2010 reflects his fees from the date of appointment. 
Directors’ pension provision
Between January and March 2011 contributions for David Levin were made into the EFRBS. From April 2011 he received his pension contribution as a cash 
allowance. Robert Gray currently receives his pension contributions as a cash allowance. Cash allowances are shown in the Directors’ remuneration table above

Divisional incentive plans
UBM operates a number of cash-based Long T erm Incentive Plans for senior managers in various businesses. These incentives are ta ilored to the strategic objectives 
of each business but all are focused on achievement of exceptional levels of sustained earnings growth over a period of up to 5 years. T argets are set by reference to the 
business plan for each individual business and aimed at a level which would exceed current market expectations. The maximum pote ntial payment under these Plans 
would be £22m if operating profit increases by £64m between 2010 and 2015. As at 31 December 2011 no accrual has been made in respect of these potential future 
payouts, based on performance to date of the relevant business. Accruals will be made in 2012 and future periods on the basis of the relevant businesses’ operating 
performance during the period and management’ s judgement of future performance. No executive directors participate in these Plans.
Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.

Corporate governance statement
Chairman’s introduction
John Botts
Governance became an important theme in society around the world in 2011, 
with public awareness of issues such as corruption and corporate excess growing 
in many countries. As a Board, we are ultimately responsible for framing 
and executing the Group’ s strategy and for overseeing risk management. 
Management of risk is not limited to financial or strategic matters but 
increasingly encompasses areas such as business conduct and ethics which 
can materially affect corporate reputations.
W e consider the practice of good governance to be integral to the Board’ s role 
and we remain committed to maintaining high standards of financial reporting, 
transparency and business integrity in all the Group’ s undertakings.
The following report describes in more detail how we seek to embed good 
governance in the Board’ s activities.
John Botts 
Chairman 
UBM plc
Compliance Statement
The Board of UBM is responsible for the Group’ s policy on corporate 
governance. This statement explains how UBM has applied the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). The directors consider that 
during 2011 UBM complied with all provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code, 
with the exception of section B.7.1 (Annual Re-election of Directors). This 
provision first applied to the Company with effect from 2011 and was considered 
by the Board at the start of the year. It was decided not to adopt the requirement 
in 2011 but to keep it under review, having regard to developing market practice. 
The Board has now resolved to adopt this provision with effect from the Annual 
General Meeting to be held in 2012. 
As a company with its shares listed on the London Stock Exchange, UBM is 
subject to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and complies with 
the provisions of the Code and relevant institutional shareholder guidelines as 
described in this statement.
Although UBM is not subject to UK companies legislation, the Board considers 
it appropriate to provide shareholder safeguards which are similar to those that 
would have applied to UBM plc and are consistent with the relevant provisions 
of the UK Companies Acts.
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility to shareholders for the management of 
the Group. The primary function of the Board is to set the Group’ s strategy and 
to oversee the effective implementation of that strategy. A formal schedule of 
matters to be considered by the Board is in place and is reviewed annually, most 
recently in February 2012. Responsibilities reserved to the Board include:
 – Approval of the annual budget (including capital expenditure) 
and Treasury policy;
 – Approval of the Group’s strategy;
 – Approval of the interim and annual financial statements;
 – Succession planning;
 – Dividend policy;
 – Major acquisitions and disposals and substantial property transactions; and
 – The Group’s system of internal controls.
Decisions on operational matters are delegated to the executive directors and 
to divisional boards under formally documented authorities.
There is an established agenda of items to be considered at Board meetings, 
which provides regular updates on the Group’ s finances, operations, strategy and 
development. Presentations are made by executive directors and by divisional 
management and other senior executives on specific issues. Papers for Board and 
committee meetings are generally circulated at least six days before the relevant 
meeting and include written reports from the CEO and CFO and Company 
Secretary. Other papers relating to matters such as talent management, potential 
acquisitions and divisional presentations are included as appropriate. Board 
meetings usually last for between three and four hours and are generally followed 
by a dinner to which members of divisional management and other guests are 
frequently invited. The Board has six scheduled meetings per annum and 
meetings may be convened at other times as and when necessary; six scheduled 
Board meetings were held during the year. Four meetings were held in Dublin, 
one in New Y ork and one in Shanghai, where the Board also visited the Furniture 
China Exhibition, one of UBM’ s largest exhibitions, operated by our Chinese 
joint venture company UBM Sinoexpo.  Section 2: Governance

Board committees
The Board is assisted in fulfilling its responsibilities by three principal 
committees, the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Details of 
the activities of the Audit Committee are set out in a separate report on page 69 
while those of the Remuneration Committee are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 64.
Membership of the Board committees was reviewed during the year, having 
regard to the requirements of the Code, and a number of changes were made 
in May 2011; Jonathan Newcomb stepped down from the Remuneration 
Committee and was replaced by Greg Lock; and T erry Neill and Karen Thomson 
were appointed to the Nomination Committee.
The terms of reference for all committees may be viewed on the Company’ s 
website and copies can be obtained from the Company Secretary, who acts as 
secretary to all three committees.
Nomination Committee
John Botts
Terry Neill
Jonathan Newcomb Karen Thomson
Alan Gillespie
The Nomination Committee is usually chaired by John Botts; its other members, 
all of whom are independent non-executive directors, are Jonathan Newcomb, 
Alan Gillespie and (with effect from May 2011) T erry Neill and Karen Thomson. 
The role of the Nomination Committee is to ensure an appropriate balance of 
experience and abilities on the Board, by reviewing the size and composition of 
the Board and recommending any proposed changes.
During 2011 the Nomination Committee undertook the following activities:
 – Initiating the search for a new Chairman to replace John Botts, who retires  
 in May 2012;
 – Considering the re-election of Directors at the 2011 Annual General 
 Meeting, specifically assessing the independence of Jonathan Newcomb,  
 who has been a Non-Executive Director for more than nine years;
 – Reviewing committee membership and recommending a number of changes,  
 which were adopted by the Board as outlined under the previous section  
 (headed “Board Committees”);
 – Considering and making recommendations to the Board as to the use of an 
 external facilitator to undertake the Board evaluation process. 
In accordance with provision B.2.1 of the Code, the Senior Independent 
Director Alan Gillespie chaired the Committee for the purpose of dealing with 
the Chairman succession. The process was as follows:
The Committee appointed an external search firm (selected from a shortlist of 
three firms) and prepared a detailed role specification which was then reviewed 
and input provided by other Board members. A list of potential candidates whose 
experience and skills matched the specification was identified and considered by 
the Committee, and a short list prepared. The shortlisted candidates were 
interviewed by the Committee and by other Board members and an appointment 
is expected to be made at or prior to the 2012 Annual General Meeting.  Section 1: 2011 Review „
Section 2: Governance „
Section 3: Financial statements „

The Nomination Committee’ s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’ s website.
Board balance and independence
At the date of this statement there are nine Board members, comprising 
the Chairman (part-time), two executive and six non-executive directors. 
Alan Gillespie is the Senior Independent non-executive director.
The Board believes that a strong presence of non-executive directors is a key 
aspect of effective corporate governance and seeks to maintain an appropriate 
balance of expertise and knowledge of the Company’ s business. The tenure 
of the respective non-executive directors ranges from 2 years to 10 years as 
shown opposite. 
The Board considers all its non-executive directors who served during 2011 to be 
independent. The Board assesses and periodically reviews the independence of its 
non-executive directors; in making its assessment it has regard primarily to the 
personal qualities demonstrated by each director, particularly their character and 
judgement and the nature and effectiveness of their contribution to debate at 
Board and committee meetings. It also takes account of the factors specifically 
identified in section B.1.1 of the Code as potentially relevant in determining 
independence.
Jonathan Newcomb has served for more than nine years on the Board, having 
been a non-executive director since September 2001. The Board highly values 
Mr Newcomb’ s experience and detailed knowledge of the sector within which 
UBM operates, and considers that the quality of his continuing contribution 
to Board debate amply demonstrates an appropriate measure of objective 
analysis and challenge. Accordingly the Board considers Mr Newcomb to be 
independent. The Board also considers that the presence on the Board of five 
other independent non-executive directors provides an appropriate balance 
of experience, as illustrated in the graph opposite.
Non-executive directors’ appointments are reviewed every three years. With 
effect from 2012 their appointments will also be subject to annual re-election 
by shareholders.
Biographies of all the directors currently in office are set out on pages 52 and 54 
and illustrate their range of experience.
A process is in place to address possible conflicts of interest of directors. Any 
relevant conflicts and potential conflicts that arise are required to be disclosed at 
the next Board meeting for consideration and, if appropriate, approval by relevant 
Board members. No conflicts of interest were disclosed during 2011.
Under the Company’ s Articles of Association, at each Annual General Meeting 
any director then in office who has been appointed by the Board since the 
previous Annual General Meeting and any director who at the date of the notice 
convening the meeting had held office for more than 30 months since he was last 
appointed or re-appointed by the Company in general meeting shall retire from 
office but is eligible for re-appointment. 
The Board considered the new requirement of the Code for the annual 
re-election of directors in 2011 and agreed to keep this under review, having 
regard to developing market practice. With effect from the Annual General 
Meeting to be held in 2012 all directors will stand annually for re-election.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, and a summary of their 
respective responsibilities is set out in writing and has been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman is responsible for overseeing the operation of the Board 
but takes no part in the day-to-day running of the business. He spends an average 
of two days per week in carrying out his responsibilities and oversees the 
operation of Board procedures through the Company Secretary.

Gender diversity
The Board has taken note of the recommendations of the Davies report on 
Gender Diversity and of the changes to the Code that are to be introduced for 
reporting periods starting on or after 1 October 2012. The issue of diversity in 
Board composition was specifically addressed as part of the Board Evaluation 
process that was undertaken in 2011 (see “Board Evaluation” below). The Board 
supports the principle of improving gender imbalance both at Board level and 
throughout its businesses, and is addressing this as described below .
In 2011, UBM established a goal to increase the number of women in senior 
business leadership roles and put in place a number of initiatives to ensure that 
our talented female employees can achieve their career aspirations with UBM. 
A series of workshops was held in May, during which 85 of UBM’ s high potential 
women shared their experiences of developing their careers with the Group. 
As an outcome of these workshops, UBM has put in place guidelines to ensure 
that all job opportunities are posted openly internally, and to ensure that 
shortlists for executive roles include qualified female candidates. A pilot of a 
training program for senior executives to develop awareness of unconscious bias 
is underway, and all Divisions are being encouraged to promote greater take-up 
of flexible working policies. The Group’ s succession planning and talent review 
process has highlighted a number of high potential women who UBM will be 
investing in through targeted development activity. 
The Board receives regular reports on the progress of this and other management 
development initiatives and will use this information to assist in formalising 
its policy. Section 2: Governance
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 68
Board evaluation
The Board evaluation in 2010/2011 was conducted as an internal exercise, 
through the use of confidential questionnaires which were completed by all 
Board directors and the responses discussed further in individual meetings with 
the Group People and Culture Director. A separate questionnaire was completed 
in respect of the Chairman’ s performance and the results collated by the Senior 
Independent Director. 
The Board considered the results in February 2011; the consensus view was that 
the Board was operating to a good degree of effectiveness. Areas identified for 
action included:
 – Reviewing the structure of the Board agenda and allocation of time for the 
Board to discuss progress towards strategic goals;
 – Clarifying the remit and composition of the Nomination Committee;
 – Keeping directors up to date on relevant developments in legislation and 
corporate governance
Good progress was made during the year in addressing these issues through 
changes made to the Board agenda and allocation of additional time specifically 
for discussion on strategy; changes to the Nomination Committee as described 
on page 66; and formal presentations to the Board from external advisors on 
relevant legislation and corporate governance practice.
It was agreed that the Board evaluation in 2011/2012 should be conducted 
through an external facilitator and Lintstock were appointed in September 2011 
to conduct this process. Lintstock provide an on-line corporate governance 
management system to the Company but have no other connection with it. The 
process involved confidential questionnaires which were completed by directors 
and other senior executives who attend Board or committee meetings or 
otherwise interact with the Board; individual interviews with directors were then 
conducted by Lintstock to develop the responses to the questionnaires. The areas 
covered included Board composition, expertise and dynamics; time management 
and Board and Committee support; strategic oversight; risk management and 
internal control; and succession planning and human resource management. 
The results were distilled into a report which was considered by the Board in 
February 2012 and the findings will be reviewed further during the year.
Evaluation of the performance of individual non-executive directors is carried 
out by the Chairman with input from the Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) 
and Chief Executive; the Chief Executive’ s performance is evaluated by the 
Chairman and SID and the Chief Financial Officer’ s performance is evaluated 
by the Chief Executive.
The non-executive directors met on several occasions during the year without 
executives present.
Information and professional development
A procedure exists whereby directors may seek independent professional advice if 
they consider it appropriate to do so in the furtherance of their duties. All 
directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who 
has primary responsibility for keeping directors updated and informed of general 
developments which may be of relevance to their responsibilities. The Company 
Secretary is not a Board director.
All directors are offered the opportunity to further their professional 
development by means of attendance at seminars and briefings. An induction 
process is in place for all directors on appointment; this includes discussions 
with the Chairman and executive directors as well as one-to-one briefings and 
presentations from other directors and senior management on matters relating 
to the Group’ s businesses and procedures.
Non-executive directors are also encouraged to increase their knowledge and 
understanding of the Group’ s businesses through site visits and meetings with 
employees and executives at divisional level. During 2011, several non-executive 
directors participated actively in UBM’ s leadership development interventions. 
Four participated as guest speakers at the Business Leaders Program and the 
regional Leadership Development Programs in Europe and China, and five have 
actively mentored potential executives. In addition, directors have also had the 
opportunity to meet with participants and alumni of UBM’ s leadership 
development programs in the US, Europe and Asia.
Relations with shareholders
The Company’ s shareholders are kept informed about the activities and progress 
of the Group primarily by means of the annual report and interim management 
statements, and by the publication of updated trading information at the 
Annual General Meeting. Financial and other information about the Company 
is published on its website, which has links to the websites of other businesses in 
the Group.
The Company also maintains an ongoing dialogue with its major institutional 
shareholders by means of a scheduled program of meetings, which are generally 
undertaken by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The Chairman 
also undertakes periodic meetings with major investors and is responsible for 
ensuring that the views of shareholders are communicated to other directors. 
Feedback from investor meetings is provided to all directors, as are analysts and 
brokers’ reports.
The Senior Independent Director is available for consultation by shareholders 
in the event that they have concerns which are inappropriate to raise with the 
Chairman. No such concerns were raised during 2011.
Consultation is undertaken with investors and with bodies representing 
shareholders’ interests on matters which the Company considers appropriate. 
During 2011 the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee consulted with a 
number of the Company’ s largest institutional investors regarding issues relating 
to executive remuneration.
All shareholders are welcome at the Annual General Meeting where they are 
able to ask questions of all the directors, including the Chairman, as well as the 
chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
V oting at the Annual General Meeting takes place by poll and the results are 
notified via a regulatory information service and displayed on the Company’ s 
website as soon as practicable following the meeting. All resolutions proposed at 
the 2011 Annual General Meeting were passed with a majority in excess of 98% 
of votes cast. V otes were cast at the meeting in respect of over 185 million shares, 
representing approximately 76% of issued equity.
Risk management and Internal control 
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the risks 
it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives. It is also responsible for 
maintaining the effectiveness of the Group’ s system of internal controls and for 
reviewing the effectiveness of such systems. The system is intended to enable the 
Group to identify and manage the risks inherent in its business and accordingly 
can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
mis-statement or loss.
A formal process is in place for identifying, evaluating and managing the key 
financial, operating and compliance risks faced by the Group. This risk mapping 
process, which was in place throughout 2011 and continues in force, accords with 
the FRC Guidance on Internal Control (October 2005) and is reviewed annually 
by the Board. As part of its overview of strategy the Board regularly considers 
specific risks facing the Group.
Corporate governance statement continued Section 1: 2011 Review „
Section 2: Governance „
Section 3: Financial statements „
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 69
The process aims to identify and evaluate risks which are specific to each of the 
Group’ s businesses. The risk maps and associated action plans are compiled by 
the respective management teams, reviewed centrally by UBM executive 
management, and considered by the Audit Committee, which in turn reports 
to the Board.
The Group’ s system of internal controls includes the following:
 – All staff are required to comply with a formal system of delegated authorities 
which is in place for all divisions and head office.
 – Further guidance on Group policies and procedures is set out in various 
manuals including the financial policies and procedures manual and employee 
handbooks.
 – An anti-malpractice policy is in place throughout the Group which provides 
a mechanism for confidential reporting by staff of possible concerns about 
financial or other matters.
 – The Group has a comprehensive financial reporting system, with the annual 
budget being approved by the Board and monthly trading results, balance 
sheets and cashflow summaries recorded against corresponding figures for the 
budget and the previous year. 
 – The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for certifying 
the Company’s annual financial statements, which process is supported by 
certification for the individual businesses from divisional CEOs and finance 
directors.
 – Established procedures are in place for the evaluation of potential acquisitions 
and their integration into the Group. Monitoring of post-acquisition 
performance against detailed business plans is conducted on an ongoing 
basis by the internal audit department and reviewed regularly by the Audit 
Committee.
 – The internal audit department undertakes periodic reviews of individual 
businesses to assess their control status and makes recommendations to the 
Audit Committee. The work of the internal audit department is prioritised 
to concentrate on the areas of greatest risk as identified through the Group 
risk management process. The Head of Internal Audit attends meetings of the 
Audit Committee, which oversees the role and structure of the internal audit 
department and makes recommendations to management.
The Board continued to assess the effectiveness of the risk management processes 
and internal controls during 2011 and to the date of this report. Such assessment 
is based on matters such as:
 – the ongoing review of strategy which aims to identify potential risks to the  
 Group’s achievement of its overall objectives;
 – monthly financial reporting against budgets and the review of results and  
 forecasts by executive directors and line management, including particular  
 areas of business or project risk;
 – the authorisation of proposed investment, divestment and capital   
 expenditure through the Board’s Committees and the Board itself;

Audit Committee
Jonathan Newcomb
Terry Neill
Karen Thomson 
Greg Lock
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jonathan Newcomb and its other members 
are T erry Neill, Karen Thomson and Greg Lock. During the review of 
membership of the committee that took place during 2011, the Board specifically 
considered Mr Newcomb’ s chairmanship, having regard to the provisions of 
section B.1.1 of the Code concerning independence. It was noted that the Board 
evaluation had concluded that he continued to operate as an effective Chairman 
of the Committee and that the presence of three other independent non-
executive directors on the Committee was in compliance with the requirements 
of Section C.3.1 of the Code.
Members of the Committee have broad financial experience which has been 
gained in a variety of disciplines, and which the Board considers appropriate to 
enable the Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The Committee met on 
three occasions during 2011 and details of individual attendance are set out in the 
table on page 66. The Chairman of the Audit Committee provides a verbal 
report to the Board following each Committee meeting and the minutes of 
Committee meetings are available to other Board members.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee and others invited to 
attend Committee meetings include the Chief Financial Officer, Group Chief 
Accountant, Head of Internal Audit, Head of T axation and external auditors. 
At each meeting the Committee meets with external auditors without 
management present.
The Committee operates within written terms of reference, which are reviewed 
periodically. These terms of reference may be viewed on the Company’ s website.
T o assist in ensuring auditor objectivity and independence, the Audit Committee 
has established a formal procedure regarding the undertaking of non-audit 
services by the external auditor, which identifies a number of categories of work 
where the auditors will not normally be employed, including financial due 
diligence on potential acquisitions and financial systems consultancy.
Appointment of the external auditor for other non-audit services may only 
be made with the prior approval of the Audit Committee. Approval for 
projects with anticipated fees not exceeding specified limits is delegated to 
the Group Operations Director or Group Chief Accountant and is reported 
to the Committee. Section 2: Governance
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 70

Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated statement 
of financial position, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the 
Consolidated statement of cashflows and the related Notes 1 to 35. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the IASB 
(International Accounting Standards Board).
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body, in accordance 
with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and our engagement 
letter dated 28 February 2011. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we

permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement on page 72 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view . Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’ s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
In addition, the Company has also instructed us to:
 – report to you our opinion on whether the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements;
 – review the directors statement in relation to Going Concern as set out on page 
40, which for a premium listed incorporated company is specified for review 
by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority; and
 – review certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board on 
directors’ remuneration, which for a premium listed UK incorporated 
company are specified for review by the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’ s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 
2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the 
IASB; and 
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991.
 
Opinion on other matters 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
W e have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 – proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review.
Where the Company has also instructed us to review: 
 – the directors’ statement in relation to Going Concern; and
 – certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board on directors’ 
remuneration.

Notes:
1. The maintenance and integrity of the UBM plc web site is the responsibility of the directors; 
the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, 
accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred 
to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site.
2. Legislation in Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Independent auditor’ s report to the members of UBM plc Section 2: Governance
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 72
Report of the directors
The directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2011.
Business review
During 2011 the Group’ s principal activities were in the areas of Events; PR 
Newswire, Data Services; Marketing Services – Online and Marketing Services 
– Print. The review of the Group’ s business and the description of the principal 
activities, risks and uncertainties and future developments is included in the 
Operating and Financial Review – CEO Statement, UBM Strategy, Segmental 
Performance, Financial Review, Principal Risks, Sustainability – on pages 6 to 50.
Results for the year and dividends
The results for the year are set out in the Group consolidated income statement 
on page 75. The balance to be transferred to reserves is £86.1m. The directors 
have announced a second interim dividend (in lieu of a final dividend) of 20p per 
share for the year ended 31 December 2011 to be paid on 17 May 2012 to those 
shareholders on the register on 13 April 2012. An interim dividend of 6.3p 
per share was paid on 13 October 2011, making a total for the year of 26.3p 
(2010: 25p).
Pursuant to the Dividend Access Plan put in place by the Company in 2008, 
the second interim dividend will be paid by UBM (GP) No.2 Limited, a UK 
subsidiary of UBM, to those members who have elected (or who are deemed to 
have elected) to be paid dividends from a UK source in accordance with the rules 
of the Dividend Access Plan.
Change of Company name
On 11 May 2011 the name of the Company was changed from United Business 
Media Limited to UBM plc. The vast majority of the Group’ s businesses now 
have UBM as part of their divisional name and this has strengthened the external 
recognition of the connection between the corporate parent, its divisional 
businesses and their individual product brands. The change of name therefore 
cements this development.
Directors and their interests
Biographical details of the directors in office as at 28 February 2012 are set out on 
pages 52 to 54. The following directors held office during the year:
John Botts, David Levin, Alan Gillespie, Robert Gray, Pradeep Kar, Greg Lock, 
T erry Neill, Jonathan Newcomb, Karen Thomson.
John Botts will retire as Chairman at the AGM on 10 May 2012, having been 
a non-executive director since July 1997 and Chairman since December 2007, 
and will therefore not be standing for re-election. In accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code all directors, with the exception of John Botts, will 
submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting. David Levin 
and Robert Gray each have a service contract which is subject to 12 months’ 
notice on either side. None of the non-executive directors have a service contract 
and all are considered by the Company to be independent. Jonathan Newcomb 
has served on the Board since September 2001, however the Board considers 
Mr Newcomb to be independent. For further comments on this please refer 
to the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 65 to 70.
The interests of the directors in office at 28 February 2012 in the shares of 
the Company and its subsidiary undertakings are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 55 to 64.

with the Company or any subsidiary at any time during the year.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. The Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991 requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial period in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
prescribed for the purposes of the Law for market traded companies. The 
financial statements of the Company are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of, or be presented fairly in all material respects so as to show, the state of 
affairs of the Company at the end of the period covered by the accounts and of 
the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors should:
 – Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
 – Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
 – Specify which generally accepted accounting principles have been followed 
in their preparation.
 – Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping accounting records which are sufficient 
to show and explain the Company’ s transactions and are such as to disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements prepared by the Company comply 
with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. Section 1: 2011 Review „

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at 31 December 2011  
 
  
1. General information 
UBM plc (formerly United Business Media Limited) is a public company limited by shares incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
The address of the registered office is Ogier House, The Esplanade, St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Jersey. UBM plc is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland. The nature 
of the Group’ s operations and its principal activities are set out in Note 3. 
The Group ’ s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue on behalf of the Board of Directors and signed on the Board’ s behalf 
by Robert Gray on 28 February 2012. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the parent company , UBM plc. All amounts are rounded to the nearest £0.1m. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 2. 
2. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and IFRIC interpretations. These financial statements are in compliance with the provisions of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instr uments and hedged items that have been 
measured at fair value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are designated as hedged items in fair value hedges that would otherwise be carried 
at amortised cost are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged in effective hedge relationships. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. I t also requires management to exercise its 
judgement in the process of applying the Group’ s accounting policies. Management continually evaluate these estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available 
information and experience, as detailed in Note 2. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011. Refer to page 40 
of the Financial Review for further details. 
Basis of consolidation 
(a) Subsidiaries 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of UBM plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December each year . The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are prepared to the same reporting date as the parent company , using consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group by virtue of the Group holding the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally resulting from a shareholding of 
more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. Losses incurred within a 
subsidiary from 1 January 2010 are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if they result in a deficit balance. 
The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is classified as a financial liability that is within the scope 
of IAS 39 is recognised in profit or loss. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value (under the full goodwill method) or at the 
proportionate share of the acquiree’ s identifiable net assets. Where the full goodwill method is used, the fair value of the non-controlling interest is estimated using a 
multiples approach with assumed adjustments for the lack of control that market participants would have by reference to the purchase price paid by the Group. 
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and are included in exceptional items related to acquisitions. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and 
(in the case of business combinations achieved in stages) the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference 
is recognised directly in profit or loss. 
If a business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the Group’ s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value 
at the acquisition date through profit or loss. When a disposal results in the Group ceasing to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is 
remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. Where there is a change in ownership of a subsidiary without a change in 
control held by the Group, the difference between the consideration paid/received and the relevant share of the carrying value of net assets acquired/disposed of the 
subsidiary is recorded in equity . 
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 80 2. Significant accounting policies continued 
(b) Joint ventures 
The Group ’ s interests in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These are entities over which the Group has entered into a contractual 
agreement with a third party to share control. The reporting dates of the joint ventures and the Group are identical and the accounts are prepared on the basis of the 
Group’ s accounting policies. 
U nder the equity method, the income statement reflects the Group’ s aggregate share of the results of operations of the joint ventures. Where there has been a change 
recognised directly in the joint ventures’ other comprehensive income or equity , the Group recognises its share of any such changes. The investments in joint ventures are 
carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group ’ s share of net assets of the joint ventures. 
When the Group ’ s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other un secured receivables that form part of the net 
investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
(c) Associates 
The Group’ s investments in its associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These are entities in which the Group has significant influence through 
the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures. The financial statements of the 
associates are used by the Group to apply the equity method. The reporting dates of the associates and the Group are identical and the accounts are prepared on the basis 
of the Group ’ s accounting policies. 
U nder the equity method, the income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associates. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the 
associates’ other comprehensive income or equity , the Group recognises its share of any such changes. The investments in associates are carried in the statement of financial 
position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group ’ s share of net assets of the associates. 
When the Group’ s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables that form part of the net investment 
in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
U pon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying 
amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit and loss. 
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of the Group’ s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Management continually evaluate these judgements, estimates and assumptions based on 
available information and experience.  
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity in order to apply the Group’ s accounting policies are:  
– Unrecognised deferred tax assets (Note 9) 
– Identification of cash generating units and assumptions used in annual impairment testing of goodwill (Note 12) 
– Assumptions used in determining retirement benefit obligations (Note 25) 
– Identification of intangible assets arising on business combinations (Note 30) 
The areas requiring management estimates are: 
– Current tax liabilities – T axation accounting policy (Note 2) 
– Forecast cash flows used in annual impairment testing of goodwill (Note 12) 
– Provision estimation (Note 24) 
– Contingent consideration valuations (Note 30) and put options over non-controlling interests (Note 22) 
Changes to accounting policies 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the adoption from 1 January 2011 of the following new , revised 
and improved IASs, IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations: 
Improvements to IFRSs 2010 – the IASB issued its third collection of minor amendments to standards, each adopted by the Group from 1 J anuary 2011. 
None of the amendments are considered to have an immediate impact on the financial position or performance of the Group, although the following amendment 
may impact the accounting for future transactions: 
– IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (Measurement of non-controlling interests) – the choice of measuring non-controlling interests at fair value or at 
the proportionate share of the acquiree’ s net assets applies only to instruments that represent present ownership interests and entitle their holders 
to a proportionate share of the net assets in the event of liquidation. All other components of non-controlling interest are measured at fair value 
unless another measurement basis is required by IFRS.

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
The following improvements have affected the disclosures in these financial statements: 
– IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (Contingent consideration arising from a business combination prior to the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised 2008)) – the 
improvement clarifies that IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ , IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’ , and IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ , continue to apply to contingent consideration that arose from business combinations whose acquisition dates precede the 
application of IFRS 3 (revised in 2008) on 1 January 2010. Disclosures are provided in Note 21. 
– IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ – the amendment reduces the volume of disclosures around collateral held and requires qualitative information 
to provide context to quantitative information. Disclosures for financial instruments are provided in Notes 21 and 22. 
Other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs 2010 to the following standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position 
or performance of the Group or the disclosures in the financial statements: 
– IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of IFRS 1’ 
– IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ (un-replaced and voluntarily replaced share-based payment awards) 
– IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Instruments’ 
– IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ 
– IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ 
– IFRIC 13 ‘Customer loyalty programmes’ 
The following new , revised and amended standards and interpretations have also been adopted from 1 January 2011, but have had no impact on the financial position 
or performance of the Group for 2011 or presentation of these financial statements. The changes may impact the accounting for future transactions. 
– IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (revised), effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The revision amends the definition of a 
related party. 
– IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation – classification of rights issues’ (amended), effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010. 
The amendment alters the definition of a financial liability to allow rights, options or warrants to acquire a fixed number of the entity’ s own equity instruments 
for a fixed amount of any currency to be classified as equity instruments provided the entity offers the rights, options or warrants pro rata to all of its existing 
owners of the same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments. 
– IFRIC 14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’ (amended), effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2011. The amendment permits prepayments of future service costs where there is a minimum funding requirement, by permitting recognition 
as a pension asset. 
– IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Liabilities with Equity Instruments’ , effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. This interpretation clarifies the 
requirements of IFRSs when a lender agrees to accept the entity’ s shares or other equity instruments in settlement of a financial liability in part or in full. 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services, net of trade discounts, V A T , other sales related taxes, and after eliminating sales within 
the Group. Revenue is recognised as follows: 
For sales of services, revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction assessed 
on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided. 
For sales of goods, revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably . Where sales consist of two or more independent components whose value can be reliably measured, revenue i s recognised on each component 
as it is completed by performance, based on attribution of relative value. 
Events: Revenue is recognised upon event completion. Advance deposits are recorded as deferred income in the statement of financial position. 
PR Newswire (formerly T argeting, Distribution and Monitoring): Revenue from news releases is recognised on message delivery . Revenue from subscriptions 
is recognised over the life of the subscription. 
Data Services: 
– Directories: Linage and advertising revenue is recognised on delivery of the directory and copy sales revenue is recognised on the sale of the directory. 
– Data services: Revenue from data subscriptions is recognised over the life of the subscription. Revenue from data projects for immediate delivery is recognised 
on delivery of the data. Revenue from data projects is recognised on a percentage completion basis over the life of the project. 
Marketing Services – Online (formerly Online – Marketing Services): Revenue is recognised at the point of delivery or fulfilment for single/discrete services and over 
the life of subscriptions for subscription services. 
Marketing Services – Print (formerly Print – Magazines): Advertising revenue is recognised on publication. Revenue from subscriptions is recognised over the life 
of the subscription. 
 
  
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 82 2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Foreign currencies 
T ransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement, 
except where hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group’ s net investment in a foreign operation. These 
are taken directly to other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated 
throughout the year at the prevailing monthly exchange rate. The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity , which was reset to 
zero on first time adoption of IFRS. On disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation 
is reclassified from other comprehensive income and the separate component of equity to profit or loss. 
Interest and other income 
(a) Interest income 
Income is recognised using the effective interest method; that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
(b) Dividend income 
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the payment is established. 
(c) Rental income 
Rental income arising from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases. 
Interest expense 
Interest expense (as calculated under the effective interest method) directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use or sale is capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other interest expense is recognised as finance expense 
when incurred. 
Leases 
The Group does not have any finance leases. Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
(a) Group as a lessee 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
(b) Group as a lessor 
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis 
as rental income. 
T axation 
Income tax represents both current tax based on taxable profits, and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it arises from a 
transaction or event recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity or a business combination. T ax relating to transactions or events recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity , is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively . 
The Group is a multi-national group with tax matters in many geographical locations. This inherently leads to complexity to the Group’ s tax structure and requires 
estimation and judgement. The calculation of the Group ’ s total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax 
treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process. The timing 
of resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve. Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an 
accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items. As a result, there can be substant ial differences between the tax charge 
in the income statement and tax payments. The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and/or cash flow variances. 
The Group has an accrual for tax liabilities which is measured at the directors’ estimate of tax that may become payable. These tax accruals are estimates and the actual 
amounts and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the 
period such determination is made. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of goodwill (for deferred tax liabilities) or of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for . 
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured as described in the basis of consolidation. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’ s 
cash-generating units (CGU s) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those 
units. Details of the Group ’ s CGU s are provided in Note 12. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. The impairment 
test requires management to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the 
CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects management’ s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of the CGU . Fair value less costs to sell 
is measured using an earnings multiple approach which uses revenue and EBIT A multiples, obtained from comparable businesses and transactions in comparable business 
in the professional media sector . 
Management is assisted by external advisors in calculating the fair value less costs to sell and value in use of its CGU s. Further details are given in Note 12. 
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
The goodwill associated with an operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. 
Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately (including website development costs relating to the application and infrastructure development, graphical design and content 
development stages incurred with third parties) are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised in 
accordance with the accounting policy for business combinations and measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Internally generated intangible assets, including internally generated software, that do not qualify for recognition as an intangible asset under IAS 38 are recognised 
as an expense in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. All research costs are expensed as incurred. 
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less any amortisation and any impairment losses. Intangible assets 
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows: 
Brands 10–15 years 
Software 5–6 years 
Customer contracts and relationships 1–10 years 
Subscription lists 2–5 years 
Tr ad e m a r ks 10 years 
Databases 2–10 years 
W ebsite development costs 3 years 
U seful lives are re-examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis. The Group does not have any intangible assets with 
indefinite lives. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property , plant and equipment is stated at cost less any depreciation and any impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on all items except freehold land. Depreciation 
rates are calculated so that assets are written down to the residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years 
Leasehold improvements T erm of lease 
General plant, machinery and equipment 5–20 years 
Computer equipment 3–5 years 
Motor vehicles 3–5 years 
An item of property , plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the 
assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 84 2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Impairment of non-current assets (excluding goodwill) 
Property , plant and equipment, intangible assets, investments in joint ventures and associates and other investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’ s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’ s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For purposes of assessing impairment, assets 
that do not individually generate cash flows are assessed as part of the cash-generating unit to which they belong. Cash-generating units are the lowest levels for which there 
are cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. 
Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first in first out method and comprises materials 
and directly attributable production costs. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion 
and costs necessary to make the sale. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash 
flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, as appropriate, the risks specific to the liability . 
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Management reassesses the amounts of these provisions at 
each balance sheet date in order to ensure that they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimates is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Further details are 
given in Note 24. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets in the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (derivative financial assets), loans and receivables (trade and 
other payables and cash and cash equivalents), or available-for-sale financial assets (other investments). Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (derivative financial liabilities) or financial liabilities at amortised cost (borrowings and trade and other payables). 
When financial instruments are recognised initially , they are measured at fair value, and in the case of investments not at fai r value through profit or loss, after taking 
account of directly attributable transaction costs. 
(a) T rade and other receivables 
T rade receivables, which generally have 30–90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. 
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when there is no expectation of recovery .  
(b) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash equivalents are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow 
statement, cash and cash equivalents (as defined above) are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
(c) T rade and other payables 
T rade and other payables are recognised at original cost. 
(d) Borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings. 
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost taking into account any differences between the proceeds and the maturity 
amount, including issue costs and any discounts or premiums due on settlement. Any difference between the proceeds and the maturity amount is recognised as interest 
expense in the income statement over the expected life of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The amortised cost calculation is revised periodically to 
reflect changes in the expected cash flows and the expected life of the borrowings including the effects of the exercise of any prepayment, call or similar options. 
Any resulting adjustment to the carrying amount of the borrowings is recognised as interest expense in the income statement. 
(e) Other investments 
The Group classifies its investments at initial recognition as available-for-sale financial assets. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose 
of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Listed and unlisted investments are stated at fair value except in respect of unquoted equity investments 
where there is no active market and where the fair value cannot be reliably measured, in which case they are measured at cost less any impairment. Gains and losses on 
remeasurement to fair value are included in other comprehensive income until the investment is disposed of or impaired. On disposal or impairment, the cumulative 
gains of losses are reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.

2. Significant accounting policies continued 
(f) Put option arrangements 
Put option agreements that allow non-controlling interest shareholders to require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest are treated as derivatives over equity 
instruments in accordance with IAS 39. The options are initially recognised at fair value within derivative financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge directly to 
equity , recognised separately as put options over non-controlling interests. 
The fair value is based on the present value of expected cash outflows on forecasted future earnings, which would be payable on exercise of the option. Subsequent changes 
in the fair value of the liability are recognised in the income statement within financing income/expense – other . 
(g) Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Where any Group company purchases the Company’ s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income 
taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold 
or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable 
to the owners of the Company . 
(h) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current 
forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market rates of interest. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting, as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability; cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or 
liability or a forecast transaction; or as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations. More details on the Group ’ s hedges are given in Note 21. 
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting 
and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective and are assessed on an ongoing 
basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. 
For fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the 
income statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised 
in the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised directly as other 
comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve. Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged 
firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement. 
Net investment hedges take the form of foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts. All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of net 
investments are recorded in other comprehensive income and included in cumulative translation differences. Borrowings and forward currency contracts used as hedging 
instruments in a net investment hedge are revalued at closing exchange rates. The resulting gains or losses are taken to other comprehensive income to the extent that 
they are effective, with any ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in 
time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs, when they are 
transferred to profit or loss. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred 
to profit or loss. 
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets 
A financial asset is derecognised where: 
– the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or 
– the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under 
a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or 
– the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
(b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
Where the Group has transferred its right to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset nor 
transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the Group’ s continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a 
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could 
be required to pay . 
  
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 86 2. Significant accounting policies continued 
Financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the 
carrying amounts of the original liability and the fair value of the new liability is recognised in the income statement. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes. 
For the defined contribution schemes, the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of employee service rendered during the accounting period are recognised 
as an expense in that period. 
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the liability for the benefits earned by employees in return for service rendered in the current and prior periods is determined 
using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by independent qualified actuaries. This is based upon a number of financial assumptions, the 
determination of which is significant to the balance sheet valuation. These are set out and discussed in Note 25. 
The following are charged to operating profit: 
– the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period; 
– the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest; and 
– gains and losses arising on settlements/curtailments. 
A credit in respect of the expected return on the schemes' assets and a charge in respect of the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes' liabilities 
because the benefits are one period closer to settlement are shown in the income statement as ‘Financing income – Pension schemes’ . 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur . They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in other comprehensive income. 
Defined benefit pension surpluses are recognised where scheme rules indicate that such surpluses are recoverable by the Group in the form of either an unconditional right 
to refund if the scheme were to be wound up or reductions in future contributions. Surpluses are expected to be recoverable under all of the UK defined benefit pension 
schemes. The minimum funding requirement of the UK defined benefit schemes is included in the assessment of whether an IAS 19 surplus is expected to emerge. Future 
tax payable on surplus refunds is shown as an irrecoverable surplus. Adjustments to the amount of irrecoverable surplus are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Share-based payments 
Employees (including directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange 
for shares or rights over shares (‘ equity-settled transactions’). 
Equity-settled transactions 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ to all grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested 
at 1 January 2005. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the equity instruments granted. The fair value 
is determined by an external advisor using the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo methods as appropriate, and takes into account any market vesting conditions or 
non vesting conditions. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity , over the periods in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled, 
ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense 
is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’ s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions 
and of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition or a non-vesting condition, be treated 
as vesting as described below . The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry 
in equity . 
No expense or increase in equity is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. A wards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions 
(i.e. vesting conditions) are satisfied. 
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately . 
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of the entity or the employees are not met. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Future changes in accounting policies 
The following new IFRSs and amended IASs have been issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2011 and are expected to impact the Group ’ s financial 
statements upon adoption: 
– IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – the requirements of IFRS 9 complete the classification and measurement phase of the IASB’ s project to replace IAS 39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ . Financial assets will be classified using a single approach to determine whether measured at amortised 
cost or fair value, replacing the many different rules under IAS 39. Liabilities will be measured in accordance with the existing requirements of IAS 39, but with 
a change for measuring own credit: an entity choosing to measure a liability at fair value will present the portion of the change in its fair value due to changes 
in the entity’ s own credit risk in other comprehensive income, rather than in the income statement. The new standard becomes effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will address hedge accounting and impairment of financial assets. The Group will quantify 
the effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’ s financial assets and liabilities in conjunction with the other phases, when issued, to present a 
comprehensive position. 
– IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (and related amendments to IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’) – replaces the 
portion of IAS 27 that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It establishes a single control model for establishing whether entities should 
be consolidated by a parent, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact of this new standard. 
– IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’ – this new standard contains a number of additional disclosure requirements in relation to an entity’ s 
interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
– IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ – a new standard which establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements including 
additional disclosures, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
– IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (amended)* – the amendment revises the presentation of other comprehensive income so that items that 
could be reclassified to profit or loss at a future point in time are presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012 and affects presentation only. 
– IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (amended) – the amendments, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, include the removal of the 
corridor mechanism and the concept of expected returns on plan assets, as well as other clarifications and wording changes. As the Group does not apply the 
corridor mechanism, this amendment will not impact the financial position or performance of the Group. The expected return on assets and interest cost 
(based on the discount rate) are replaced with net interest on the item in the statement of financial position. As the Group’ s schemes are currently in deficit, this 
amendment will result in a financing expense being recognised, rather than the current financing income. 
The following new and amended IFRSs and amendments to IASs have been issued but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2011 and are not expected 
to impact the Group ’ s financial statements upon adoption: 
– IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ (amended)* – transfer transactions of financial assets, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. 
– IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ (and related amendments to IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’) – a new standard replacing IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint V entures’ , 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The new standard revises the types of joint arrangements to only joint ventures or joint 
operations and removes the option to account for (formerly defined) jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation. As the Group applies 
the equity method to such entities, no change is expected to the financial position or performance of the Group. 
– IAS 12 ‘Income T axes’ (amended), effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012. 
– IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (amended) – renamed and consequential amendments following the issue of IFRS 10, effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
– IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint V entures’ (amended) – renamed and consequential amendments following the issue of IFRS 11, effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
– IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amendment) – addresses inconsistencies in current practice when applying the offsetting criteria by clarifying 
the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off ’ and that some gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement. 
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. 
* Amendments have been endorsed by the European Union; all other new and amended standards have not yet been endorsed. 
  
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 88 3. Segment information 
Operating segments 
The chief operating decision maker (‘CODM’) for the purpose of reporting under IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ is the executive management team – the Group 
Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer. The Group operates in a number of different markets and communities and considers that 
presentation of financial results on a products and services basis is the most appropriate way to demonstrate the performance of the Group. For the purpose of 
resource allocation and assessment of performance, the CODM regularly reviews information based on the products and services at a revenue and adjusted 
operating profit level (as detailed below). 
Consistent with reporting for the year ended 31 December 2010, the Group considers there to be five reportable operating segments organised around products 
and services: 
– Events which provide face to face interaction in the form of exhibitions, trade shows, conferences and other live events; 
– PR Newswire (formerly T argeting, Distribution and Monitoring) which operates in the targeting and distribution of company information and the evaluation 
of its impact on targeted audiences; 
– Data Services which provide a range of services including data-based workflow products, intellectual property consultancy and analytical services and sales lead 
generation program; 
– Marketing Services – Online (formerly Online – Marketing Services) which provides website sponsorships and banner advertising as well as online directory 
products; and 
– Marketing Services – Print (formerly Print – Magazines) which publishes magazines and trade press to specialist markets. 
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments. The Group ’ s management reporting and controlling systems use the accounting 
policies that are the same as those referred to in Note 2. 
Segment measures 
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments through revenue results and a measure of segment profit or loss which is referred to as adjusted operating 
profit. Adjusted operating profit represents operating profit excluding amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, exceptional items and share of taxation 
on results of joint ventures and associates. This measure is reported to the CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance. 
Finance income/expense and taxation are not included in the adjusted operating profit measure which is reviewed by the CODM. T ax and treasury balances 
are managed centrally . 
Segment assets and liabilities are not regularly provided to the CODM. The Group has elected, as provided under IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ (amended 2009) not 
to disclose a measure of segment assets or liabilities where these amounts are not regularly provided to the CODM. 
Intersegment revenue is recorded at values that represent estimated third-party selling prices. 
With respect to geographical regions, revenue is generally allocated to countries based on the location where the products and services are provided. Non-current assets are 
disclosed according to the location of the businesses to which the assets relate.

In 2011, the Group made significant progress in the integration of UBM Canon (formerly Canon Communications LLC), acquired in October 2010. The exceptional 
charge of £3.6m includes £2.0m relating to redundancy and £1.6m relating to business reorganisation costs.  
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised 2008) from 1 January 2010, acquisition costs of £2.9m have been expensed, rather than included in the calculation of 
goodwill on acquisition. For the year ended 31 December 2011 a further exceptional credit of £1.9m was recognised, relating to the revision of the contingent 
consideration estimates for acquisitions made in 2010 and 2011. Details of the acquisitions made in the year ended 31 December 2011 are given in Note 30. 
The carrying value of investments in joint ventures and associates and other investments have been impaired by £3.1m and £0.6m respectively . 
Y ear ended 31 December 2010 
During 2010 the Group continued to actively manage its product portfolio, closing or exiting 13 print magazine titles and reducing the frequency of two others. 
The Group also made further progress in the restructuring of a number of its businesses, particularly within the Data Services segment. The exceptional charge of £5.8m 
included £3.0m relating to redundancy , £1.7m relating to restructuring and business reorganisation costs and £1.1m relating to vacant property . Of the redundancy 
and restructuring costs charged, £3.2m was incurred in 2010 and the balance was committed to be incurred in 2011. The property costs of £1.1m related to vacant 
property and other property costs, which will be incurred over the remainder of the lease terms. 
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised 2008) from 1 January 2010, acquisition costs of £6.1m were expensed, rather than included in the calculation of goodwill 
on acquisition as previously required by the standard. Of this cost, £3.3m related to the costs incurred in respect of the acquisition of Canon Communications LLC. 
For the year ended 31 December 2010 a further exceptional net credit of £1.0m was recognised, relating to revised contingent consideration estimates for acquisitions 
made in 2010. Details of the acquisitions made in the year ended 31 December 2010 are given in Note 30.

value movement of the hedged portions of the £250m fixed rate sterling bonds and the $350m fixed rate dollar bonds (Note 21). 
The exceptional interest expense within borrowings and loans relates to the reassessment of amortised cost carrying amount of the €53.1m floating rate reset loans. 
Further details are provided in Note 20.

– £1.8m relating to the fair value movement on put options over non-controlling interests. 
– In September 2011, UBM redeemed the £75m floating rate reset bonds. As provided under their terms, the Group has also paid the fair market value of the 
options associated with the bonds, totalling £19.1m. This resulting loss has been included in exceptional financing expense – other.

At 31 December 2011, there was no recognised deferred tax liability for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group ’ s subsidiaries as the 
Group has determined that profits of these subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. 
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to £6.0bn 
(2010: £5.6bn). There are no income tax consequences to the Group arising from the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.

The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £55.6m relating to deductible temporary differences and £148.1m (of which £102.7m will expire between 2019 and 
2031) relating to unused tax losses (2010: £76.8m and £134.9m (of which £90.5m will expire between 2019 and 2030) respectively). No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of these amounts due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams. The Group also has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £51.6m 
(2010: £55.4m) relating to unused capital losses which can only be utilised against future capital gains. 
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 98 10. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the year (reflecting the movements set out in Note 26). 
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year (adjusted for the effects of dilutive options). 
The Group has one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market 
price of the Company’ s ordinary shares during the year . The impact of dilutive securities in 2011 would be to increase weighted average shares by 4.3 million shares 
(2010: 4.2 million shares) for employee share options. 
The weighted average number of shares excludes ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (the ‘ESOP’) and the Qualifying Employee Share 
Ownership T rust (the ‘QUEST’). 
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on net profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent entity before amortisation of intangible assets arising on 
acquisitions, deferred tax on amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and net financing income/(expense) – other, divided by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year . Amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, deferred tax on amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional 
items and net financing income/(expense) – other are excluded from this calculation, as due to their nature and the infrequency of the events giving rise to them, separate 
presentation allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance for the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess 
better the trends of financial performance.

The proposed second interim dividend has not been recognised as a liability in these financial statements. 
Pursuant to the Dividend Access Plan (‘DAP’) arrangements put in place as part of the Scheme of Arrangement, shareholders in the Company are able to elect to receive 
their dividends from a UK source (the ‘DAP election’). Shareholders who held 50,000 or fewer shares (i) on the date of admission of the Company’ s shares to the London 
Stock Exchange and (ii) in the case of shareholders who did not own the shares at that time, on the first dividend record date after they become shareholders in the 
Company , unless they elect otherwise, will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the DAP arrangements. Shareholders who hold more than 50,000 
shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make a DAP election. All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked. U nless shareholders 
have made a DAP election, or are deemed to have made a DAP election, dividends will be received from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly . 
12. Goodwill 
Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a cash generating unit (‘CGU’) level, consisting of the 13 business units operating within each of the Group’ s 
operating segments. Not all business units are active in all segments; there are 31 CGU s at 31 December 2011 (2010: 31 CGU s). For reporting purposes, the CGU s have 
been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below . The 31 CGU s have been individually tested for impairment in 2011.

Goodwill transferred between segments of £34.7m relates to UBM Canon, acquired in October 2010. The purchase price allocation exercise was completed in 2010; 
in 2011 the allocation of goodwill to CGU s has been finalised due to the access to more detailed information on the constituent parts of the business.  
Within the aggregate Events goodwill, the Group considers the UBM T ech W eb Events and UBM Live Events CGU s to be significant. The carrying value of goodwill 
attributed to these CGU s at 31 December 2011 was £171.5m and £339.0m respectively (2010: £168.9m and £292.5m respectively). Within the aggregate Data 
Services goodwill above, the Group considers the UBM Medica Data Services CGU to be significant. The carrying value of UBM Medica Data Services goodwill 
at 31 December 2011 was £192.0m (2010: £196.0m). The PR Newswire CGU as reported above is also considered to be significant.

Impairment tests for goodwill 
A summary of the goodwill allocation to the Group’ s CGU s is given in the above tables. Management tests goodwill annually for impairment as at 30 September each year 
or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill may be impaired. 
31 December 2011 
The carrying amount of each CGU is compared with its estimated value in use. In calculating the value in use of its CGU s, management is assisted by the work of external 
advisors. 
31 December 2010 
The carrying amount of each CGU was compared with its fair value less costs to sell. In addition, the carrying amount of each CGU: UBM Medica Data Services, 
UBM T ech W eb Events and UBM A viation Data Services was compared with its value in use. 
Value in use impairment test 
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
management’ s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital of the CGU . The following key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculation for the 
above mentioned CGU s: 
 
Pre-tax 
discount rate 
% 
Perpetuity 
growth rate 
% Cash flow forecasts 
Events 11.5–14.3 1.3–3.5 Event revenue is expected to continue to grow strongly with continued expansion in Emerging markets. 
PR Newswire 11.7 2.0 Continued steady growth of the core wire distribution, engagement and workflow/data businesses.
Continued expansion in high growth markets such as China. 
Continued investment in products, technology and in sales and marketing to drive continued growth 
in the changing competitive and technological environments. 
Data Services 11.5–14.8 1.3–3.2 The continued rebalancing of the product portfolio with migration from print to digital.
Margin improvements due to restructuring and business reorganisation plans, that have taken place 
or which have been committed to in 2011. Each restructuring program aims to either rebalance the 
product portfolios to better meet the needs of customers and audiences, or to ensure the support 
platforms and divisional structures are cost efficient. Improvements are undertaken by a combination 
of cost reductions and ongoing expenditure to continue to enhance the data products. The cash flow 
projections take into account these margin improvements. They do not include any cash flows relating 
to restructuring not carried out or committed at the time of the impairment test. 
Marketing Services – Online 11.4–12.0 1.3–1.7 The continued rebalancing of the product portfolio, away from print to digital. 
Marketing Services – Print 11.5–12.3 1.3–2.5 The continued rationalisation and optimisation of the print portfolio with a number of non-core titles 
now either closed or sold expected to result in stabilisation of print margins.

Forecast cash flows 
For each CGU , the forecast cash flows for the first five years are based on the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management. The forecast cash flows, 
budgets and forecasts based on assumptions that reflect past experience, long term trends, industry forecasts and growth rates and management estimates. The table above 
summarises the key assumptions specific to each group of CGU s. 
For each CGU , the forecast cash flows beyond the period covered by the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management are based upon the 
weighted average projected real gross domestic product growth rate in 2015 of each of the territories in which the CGU s operate (2010: 2014). Growth rates for each 
territory have been weighted based on contribution to 2012 budgeted revenue (2010: contribution to 2011 budgeted revenue). The growth rates used in the value in use 
calculation range from 1.3% to 3.5%, depending on the territories and industries in which each CGU operates. 
Discount rate 
The risk adjustment for the systematic risk, beta, of the CGU reflects the risks specific to the CGU for which the forecast cash flows have not been adjusted. 
The adjustment to the rate has been determined by management using an average of the betas of comparable companies within respective sectors. 
Details of the pre-tax discount rates used for each CGU are provided in the table above. 
Sensitivities 
Other than as disclosed below , management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU 
to exceed its recoverable amount. The estimated recoverable amounts of the following CGU s are not significantly higher than the carrying amounts. The table shows the 
carrying amount of each CGU with limited headroom, the amount by which recoverable amount exceeds carrying amount (the headroom) and the reasonably possible 
percentage changes needed in isolation in each of the key assumptions that would cause the recoverable amount of each CGU to be equal to its carrying amount.

Fair value less costs to sell impairment test 
The fair value less costs to sell of each CGU was measured in 2010 based on an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBIT A multiples obtained from comparable 
businesses and transactions in comparable businesses in the professional media sector . A discount to the multiples from the peer group has been applied due to the smaller 
size of the CGU s compared to the peer group. The multiples ranged from 0.1 to 3.3 for revenue and 0.7 to 12.3 for EBIT A. 
The calculation used actual sales and EBIT A results for 2010 and forecast sales and EBIT A for 2011, based upon financial budgets approved by management. Costs to sell 
are estimated to be 3% of the value of a CGU , based on experience of prior disposals by the Group. 
The discount rate for each CGU is based on the risk -free rate for 30-year US government bonds in the respective market, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased 
risk of investing in equities, the systematic risk of the specific CGU and taking into account the relative size of the CGU and the specific territories in which it operates. 
The increased risk of investing in equities is assessed using an equity market risk premium which reflects the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by 
an investor who is investing in the whole market. The equity market risk premium used is based on studies by independent economists and historical equity market 
risk premiums. 
In the determination of fair value less costs to sell in 2010, the calculations of fair value are most sensitive to the precedent transaction multiples used. Based on the 
conditions at the balance sheet date, management determined that a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause an impairment to be 
recognised in respect of each CGU .

Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months and 
earn interest at the respective short term deposit rates. The Group classifies all its cash and short term deposits as loans and receivables. The majority of the Group’ s surplus 
cash is deposited with major banks with rating of A (Standard & Poor’ s) or A2 (Moody’ s). 
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2011 is £106.7m (2010: £125.9m).

The Group classifies all its derivative financial instruments and put options over non-controlling interests at fair value through profit and loss and its bank overdrafts, bank 
loans and bonds as financial liabilities at amortised cost. 
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability , or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash 
flow hedge), or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). Further details are given in Note 21. The Group only enters into derivative 
contracts with major banks of high quality credit standing and with which it has a lending relationship. 
Put options over non-controlling interests 
Put option agreements that allow non-controlling interest shareholders to require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest are treated as derivatives over equity 
instruments in accordance with IAS 39. They are recorded at fair value based on discounted cash flows models as no observable market data is available. The terms of the 
put options over non-controlling interests granted during 2011 in relation to Rotaforte and Catersource are detailed in Note 30. Details of put options granted in 2010 
in relation to Navalshore and Sienna Interlink are also provided in Note 30.

€53.1m floating rate reset loans 2012 
In March 2009, UBM raised €53.1m through two floating rate reset loans. The loans bear interest for the first three years at six month EURIBOR plus 1.80% (currently 
3.48%). U nder the terms, the lender has the option to put the loans back to the Group at par (€53.1m) in March 2012 and every three years until maturity in March 2024. 
If the loans are not put then one of three events will occur: 
1. The interest rate on the loans are reset to 4.16%, respectively, plus the Group’ s 3 year credit spread until the next put date; 
2. The Group exercises its call option and pays the fair value of the instruments at date of exercise to the current holders; or 
3. There is no credit spread quote available and the Group pays the fair value of the swap at the next interest date. 
Since the 2008/2009 credit crisis, long term swap rates have fallen below the reset interest rate of 4.16%. This, combined with a material increase in market volatility , has 
increased the fair value of the loans and the associated call options as at 31 December 2011 to €64.0m (£53.5m). As it is likely that the Group will exercise its call options 
and repay the loans in March 2012, the future estimated cash flows have been re-assessed to include the cost of settling the option. This results in an expense of £8.5m 
which has been recognised as an exceptional interest expense in the income statement.

£325m variable rate multi-option facility 2012 
The £325m multi-currency unsecured revolving facility (repayable on 27 July 2012) was cancelled by the Group in May 2011 and replaced by the £300m variable rate 
multi-currency facility 2016, detailed below . The facility interest rate was LIBOR plus 0.325%.

The undrawn portion of this facility at 31 December 2010 was £304.7m. 
£300m variable rate multi-currency facility 2016 
On 11 May 2011, the Group arranged a five year £300m variable rate multi-currency facility to replace the cancelled £325m variable rate multi-currency facility detailed 
above. The £300m facility currently bears interest of LIBOR plus 1.0% whilst the UBM plc rating is BBB-/Baa3. The future interest rate is dependent on the credit rating 
of UBM plc: the rate will be revised to LIBOR plus 1.35% for a downgrade to BB+/Ba1; LIBOR plus 1.75% for downgrade to BB/Ba2 or lower; LIBOR plus 0.85% 
for an upgrade to BBB/Baa2; or LIBOR plus 0.75% or an upgrade to BBB+/Baa1 or higher . The new facility will mature on 11 May 2016. Drawings under the facility

Bonds 
£75m floating rate reset bonds 
On 26 September 2011, the Group redeemed the £75m floating rate reset bonds issued in September 2008. As provided under their terms, the Group also paid 
the fair market value of the options associated with the bonds, totalling £19.1m. This resulting loss has been included in exceptional financing expense (Note 8). 
The bonds incurred interest at six month LIBOR plus 0.68%. 
£250m fixed rate sterling bonds 2016 
Issued at 99.384% of par, the bonds pay an annual interest coupon of 6.5% on 23 November until maturity in 2016. The coupon of 6.5% would be increased by 
1.25% in the event the Group ’ s long term credit rating were to be reduced below investment grade by either Standard & Poor’ s (below BBB-) or Moody’ s (below Baa3). 
The Group entered into currency and interest rate swaps so that approximately £150m has been swapped into floating rate US Doll ars, at a rate of US LIBOR plus 
3.14% (further details in Note 21). The Group also entered into currency swaps so that approximately £100m has been swapped into fixed rate US Dollars, at a rate 
of 6.34% (further details in Note 21). 
$350m fixed rate dollar bonds 2020 
On 3 November 2010, the Group issued $350m fixed rate dollar bonds at 98.295% of par . The bonds pay a 5.75% coupon on a semi annual basis on 3 May and 
3 November until maturity in 2020. The coupon of 5.75% would be increased in the event the Group ’ s long term credit rating were to be reduced below investment 
grade by either Standard & Poor’ s (below BBB-) or Moody’ s (below Baa3). The increase to the coupon would be 0.25% per ‘ratings notch’ per agency . The proceeds 
were primarily used to repay outstanding bank debt drawn to finance the acquisition of Canon Communications LLC. The Group entered into interest rate swaps 
so that $150m of the bonds has been swapped into floating rate US Dollars, at a rate of US LIBOR plus 2.63% (further details in Note 21).

The fair value of cash at bank and deposits approximates to their book value due to their short maturity . The fair values of interest rate swaps and forward currency 
contracts are calculated by the external counterparties to the contracts and verified using present value of future cash flows at discount rates implied by the forward 
curve. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. 
The fair values of put options over non-controlling interests (including exercise price) and contingent considerations on post 1 January 2010 acquisitions are based 
on discounted cash flows models as no observable market data is available. The terms of instruments granted during 2011 and 2010 are detailed in Note 30. 
The fair values of the £75m floating rate reset bonds and the €53.1m floating rate reset loans are calculated by external counterparties to the debt. Market values have 
been used to calculate the fair value of the £250m fixed rate sterling bonds 2016 and the $350m fixed rate dollar bonds 2020. 
The fair values of contingent consideration on post 1 January 2010 acquisitions have been determined by reference to the projected financial performance in relation 
to the specific contingent consideration criteria for each acquisition (Note 30). 
For all other financial assets and liabilities the carrying amount has been used.

Fair value hierarchy 
The table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree 
to which the fair value is observable. The fair value measurement technique for each category of financial instrument is detailed in the fair values section above. 
Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly (e.g. prices) or indirectly 
(e.g. derived from prices). 
Level 3:  techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

U nder two of the US dollar cross currency interest rate swap contracts totalling $166.7m, the Group will pay annual interest of 6.336% and receive annual interest of 6.5% 
on £100.0m until 23 November 2016. U nder the other two contracts totalling $250.1m, the Group will pay annual interest of US LIBOR plus 3.14% and receive GBP 
LIBOR plus 2.90% on £150m until 23 November 2016. 
U pon maturity of the Japanese yen forward exchange contracts in January 2011, the Group received £15.4m and paid ¥1,940.0m.  
Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and the changes in fair values of the forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps are included in other 
comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investment in these subsidiaries. These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at

A decrease in equivalent basis points would result in the exact opposite effect on profit before tax. In 2009 the Group entered into £150m of fair value interest rate swaps to 
increase the exposure to interest rates following the issuance of the £250m fixed rate sterling bonds. In 2010 the Group entered into $150m of fair value interest rate swaps 
to increase the exposure to interest rates following the issuance of the $350m fixed rate US dollar bonds.  
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group manages its 
credit risk in relation to its operating activities (trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions and other 
financial instruments. 
Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits 
The following financial instruments and cash deposits are exposed to credit risk:

Short term deposits 78.5 88.2
Interest rate swaps 23.3 6.8
Forward currency contracts – 0.1
 130.0 132.8
The majority of the Group’ s surplus cash is deposited with major banks of high quality credit standing. The Group enters into derivative contracts only with major banks 
of high quality credit standing. The maximum credit risk associated with the Group’ s financial instruments and cash deposits is equal to their carrying value as set out in 
Note 19. 
T rade receivables 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group ’ s established policy , procedures and controls relating to customer credit management. 
Credit limits are established for all customers and are based inter alia on bank references and credit checks. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’ s customer base being large and unrelated. The maximum credit risk associated 
with the Group’ s trade receivables is equal to their carrying value as set out in Note 18.

Provisions recognised by the Group are based on reliable estimates determined by management of the amounts payable based on available information. The amounts 
recorded in the above tables are continually evaluated by management. 
Liabilities for reorganisation and restructuring 
I n 2011, the Group incurred an exceptional charge of £3.6m relating to the integration of UBM Canon (N ote 7). The remaining provision arising during the year of £2.8m 
relates to other reorganisation and restructuring projects, reported within operating expenses. W e expect the provision balance of £4.8m to be utilised within one year . 
Liabilities on properties 
The Group has lease obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property , the quantification of which depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet 
the properties, and for dilapidations on certain leasehold properties which are dependent principally on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases. The provision in 
respect of these obligations at 31 December 2011 has been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases in question, 
which range from one to five years. The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital. The amounts discussed under liabilities for reorganisation and 
restructuring relating to vacant property have been included within liabilities on property . 
Liabilities relating to disposals in prior periods 
The Group has made a number of disposals of businesses in prior years. W arranty and other claims may be brought against the Group in relation to these disposed 
businesses generally over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal. The provision in respect of these items has been determined based upon the contract terms 
of each disposal and are reassessed on an annual basis over the period during which claims may be brought against the Group. 
Liabilities arising from former financial services activities 
A subsidiary of the Group was formerly engaged in the selling of personal pensions prior to 1996. As a result of the industry-wide review into pension misselling by the 
Personal Investment Authority , the Group was exposed to actual and potential future claims by investors in respect of policies found to have been missold. The provision 
was fully utilised during 2010 and no further claims are expected.  
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 118 25. Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas. The charge for the year in relation to defined 
contribution schemes was £5.7m (2010: £6.4m). 
The defined benefit pension schemes included in the following disclosures are: 
(i) UK schemes: the United Pension Plan, the United Magazines Final Salary Scheme, the defined benefit section of the United Group Pension Scheme 
(‘UGPS’), the United Newspapers Executive Pension Scheme and the OAG Pension Scheme (which was transferred to the UGPS on 8 September 2010); 
(ii) US schemes: the CMP Media LLC Cash Balance Retirement Plan and the CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan; and 
(iii) Retirement Indemnity Plans in France. 
The most recent actuarial funding valuations for the majority of the UK scheme liabilities were carried out in 2011 and updated to 31 December 2011 for accounting 
purposes by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

Any surplus on the UK schemes ultimately repaid to the Company by the T rustees would currently be subject to a 35% tax charge prior to being repaid. The application 
of IFRIC 14 is such that this tax is shown as irrecoverable surplus. T wo of the UK schemes are in surplus at 31 December 2011 (2010: two UK schemes).

The sale of the F rench print business and associated retirement indemnity liabilities resulted in a £1.8m settlement credit in 2011, included in the calculation of profit 
on disposal (Note 31). 
Of the total pension credit, a £1.2m credit and a £3.1m credit (2010: £0.9m charge and £3.2m credit) were included in ‘Operating expenses’ and ‘Financing income’ 
respectively . The total pension credit for 2012 is currently expected to be £1.8m. 
The main UK schemes are closed to new members, hence under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost (expressed as a percentage of the salaries of the 
remaining members) will increase as the remaining active members of the scheme approach retirement. 
In 2009, the Group agreed to make special contributions to the UK pension schemes over the next five years of £3.1m per annum plus a one-off contribution in 2009 
of £1.3m. This contribution schedule remains in place until the 2011 funding valuations are finalised (expected in the first half of 2012). The Group also agreed, as 
part of merger agreements for several of the pension schemes, to arrange letters of credit to be issued to the scheme trustees from one or more of the Company’ s bankers. 
The value of the letters of credit issued to the scheme trustees in 2011 is £17.0m (2010: £17.0m). The main conditions under which these letters of credit could be drawn 
relate to events which would imperil the interests of the scheme, such as insolvency , or the Group failing to make agreed payments. 
The Group expects to contribute £3.1m to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012.

In 2010, the UK Government announced its intention to adopt consumer price inflation (CPI) rather than retail price inflation (RPI) for statutory minimum pension 
revaluations/indexation from 1 January 2011. This change impacts the UK schemes where pension revaluation is linked to the statutory minimum. The reduction in 
liability at 31 December 2010 from the first application of the CPI assumption was £8.0m and is included in the actuarial gains, reported in other comprehensive income. 
The mortality assumptions used at 31 December 2011 for UK schemes have been updated. The life expectancy rates used are 110% of the ‘SAPS’ S1 tables 
(2010: 130% of the ‘2000 series’ standard tables) based on the year of birth of scheme members, which is currently on average 1941 for pensioners (2010: 1939) and 
1956 for non-pensioners (2010: 1956). Allowances for future improvements in mortality rates are in line with the CMI 2010 projections with a 0.75% p.a. long term 
trend rate (2010: medium cohort with a 1% underpin). These projections allow for life expectancy to improve over time due to improvements in medical treatments 
and other lifestyle factors such that younger members who have not yet reached pensionable age are expected to live longer than current pensioner members. 
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 21.1 years for males and 23.3 years for females (2010: 20.2 years and 22.7 years respectively). 
For current non-pensioner members who have not yet reached pensionable age, the assumed average life expectancy at age 65 is 22.1 years for males and 24.5 years for 
females (2010: 22.1 years and 24.5 years respectively). The average rate of improvement underlying the standard tables is an increase of approximately 0.6 years’ life 
expectancy in every ten years. 
For the valuation of US scheme liabilities, RP 2000 tables are used in both years for all members. The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members 
at age 65 is 19.0 years for males and 20.9 years for females (2010: 18.8 years and 20.8 years respectively). For current non-pensioner members who have not yet reached 
pensionable age, the assumed average life expectancy at age 65 is 20.5 years for males and 22.4 years for females (2010: 18.8 years and 20.8 years respectively). 
Additional assumptions used for valuing the UK scheme liabilities are an allowance for all non-pensioners to take 15% of pension as tax free cash upon retirement 
(2010: 15%). 
Plan assets mainly consist of equity instruments and fixed income investments. The expected rate of return on equities at 31 December 2011 is based on an expected 
long-term out-performance of equities over government bonds of 4.5% p.a. (2010: 3.5%). 
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 120 25. Retirement benefit obligations continued 
Management has used judgment to determine the assumptions used in calculating the pension obligations. The assumed discount rate, salary increases and mortality all 
have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation. The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions.

Executive share option scheme 
On 18 April 2000 the Group established a share option program for full-time directors and certain employees. Grants are no longer made under the 2000 Executive scheme. 
On 2 June 2008 the Group adopted the 2008 Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘2008 Executive scheme’) for full-time directors and certain employees. All participants 
in the 2008 Executive scheme must be employed by UBM plc or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options. Options were granted for the first time under 
the 2008 Executive scheme in 2009; the number of options granted to a participant under the 2008 Executive scheme is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Options under both schemes may be exercised after the third anniversary of the grant date subject to satisfactory completion of performance conditions. Options must 
normally be exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of the grant. Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death or ceasing to be employed due to 
retirement, injury , disability or redundancy . 
The number of shares that may be allocated under the 2008 Executive scheme on any day cannot exceed: 
– 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately before that day, when added to the aggregate of the number of shares allocated in the 
previous ten years under the 2008 Executive scheme and any other discretionary share plan adopted by the Company; and 
– 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately before that day, when added to the aggregate of the number of shares allocated in the 
previous ten years under the 2008 Executive scheme and all other share plans adopted by the Company. 
The exercise price to be paid by a participant when exercising options granted will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. The price shall not be lower than 
the closing middle market price of shares of that class as listed on the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on the day prior to the grant date or the average closing 
middle market price of shares of that class on the three days prior to the grant date (if so decided by the Remuneration Committee).

Executive Retention Plan 
In 2005 the Group established the Executive Retention Plan (ERP), for certain directors and employees. All participants in the ERP must be employed by UBM plc or 
one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the awards. The value of awards granted to a participant under the ERP is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
A wards are made in special circumstances to individuals as a recruitment or retention tool. 
The awards are made in the form of options exercisable on payment of a nominal value of £1, or conditional share awards for employees in the US. Options must normally 
be exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of the grant. Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death.  
A wards will generally vest after three years subject to continued employment and are generally not subject to any other performance conditions. 
Where awards are granted as a monetary value rather than as a number of shares, the number of ordinary shares over which a monetary award is made is calculated by 
dividing the monetary value of the award by the price of UBM plc ordinary shares at the time of grant. 
A wards outstanding at the end of the year expiring on 1 November 2011, 14 September 2011, 27 March 2014, 11 March 2015, 27 May 2015, 31 August 2015, 
27 October 2020, 11 November 2020 and 18 March 2021 were nil (2010: under 0.1m), nil (2010: under 0.1m), under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m), 0.1m (2010: 0.2m), 
under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m), under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m), 0.1m (2010: 0.1m), under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m) and 0.1m (2010: nil) respectively . 
2000 Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan 
In April 2000 the Group established the Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan (‘SEEPP’) for certain directors and employees. Shares are purchased on the open 
market and financed through bonuses sacrificed by senior executives (the ‘Bonus Option’) under the terms of SEEPP .  
The SEEPP has now been closed and no further grants will be made under the scheme. 
Matching options may be exercised after the fourth anniversary of the grant date subject to satisfactory completion of performa nce conditions. One-third of Matching 
options vest subject to adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) – see Note 10 – growth exceeding retail price index (‘RPI’) growth plus 3%; one-third of options vest subject 
to adjusted EPS growth exceeding RPI growth plus 5% per annum over four years; the final third is not subject to performance criteria.  
Options must normally be exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of the grant.  
Share options outstanding at the end of the year were nil (2010: 0.1m).

Save As Y ou Earn Option Schemes 
In May 2004, the Group established the 2004 Sharesave Scheme (‘2004 SA YE’) for directors and employees. Grants are no longer made under the 2004 SA YE. 
In June 2008 the Company adopted the 2008 Sharesave Scheme (‘2008 SA YE’) for directors and employees. U nder the 2008 SA YE scheme participants must be 
employed by UBM plc or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the options. Options were granted for the first time under the 2008 SA YE in 2009. 
The number of shares that may be allocated under the 2008 SA YE scheme on any day cannot, when added to the aggregate of the number of shares allocated in the 
previous ten years under the 2008 SA YE scheme and any other share plan adopted by the Company , exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue 
immediately before that day . 
Options under both schemes may be exercised after either the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant date in accordance with each employee’ s Savings Contract. 
Options must normally be exercised within six months of the date the options are exercisable or within 12 months in the case of death. Options may be exercised earlier 
in the event of death, or ceasing to be employed due to retirement, injury , disability or redundancy .

Medium T erm Incentive Plan 
Only market-purchased shares may be used for awards under the Medium T erm Incentive Plan (‘MTIP’).  
The value of the MTIP award is based on a percentage of salary as determined by the Remuneration Committee each year, following assessment of the employee/ 
Company performance over the prior financial year (the performance year).  
Grants are no longer made under the MTIP . 
Options may be exercised in two stages: 50% of options may be exercised in January of the second financial year after the year in which they were granted; the remaining 
50% may be exercised in January of the third financial year after the options were granted. Options may only be granted subject to satisfactory completion of performance 
conditions. Options must normally be exercised before the expiry of seven years from the date of the grant. Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death or ceasing 
to be employed due to retirement, injury , disability or redundancy . 
The exercise price of the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2011 is nil (2010: nil), and the weighted average life of the share options is two years 
(2010: four years). 
A wards outstanding at the end of the year expiring on 3 April 2013, 4 April 2014 and 20 March 2015 were under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m), under 0.1m (2010: under 
0.1m) and under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m) respectively . 
Performance Share Plan 
In 2005 the Group established an incentive plan for full-time directors and senior executives. All participants in the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) must be employed by 
UBM plc or one of its subsidiaries at the time of granting the awards. The value of awards granted to a participant under the PSP is at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, but may not exceed 1.5 times base salary , save that in exceptional circumstances awards of up to 2 times base salary may be made. 
Grants were made during the year under the PSP to full-time directors and senior executives, which requires UBM’ s total shareholder return (‘TSR ’) to outperform 
a comparator group of companies over a three year period. 25% of the award will vest if TSR is at median position (subject to a maximum value of 25% of base salary) 
and 100% if TSR exceeds the median by 10% per annum. In between these positions, the award will vest on a straight line basis. 
The awards are made in the form of options exercisable on payment of a nominal value of £1, or conditional share awards for employees in the US. Options must be 
exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of the grant.  
The number of ordinary shares over which an award is made is calculated by dividing the monetary value of the award by the price of UBM plc ordinary shares at the time 
of grant. 
The number of ordinary shares over which awards may be granted under the Performance Plan may not result in more than 10% of the ordinary share capital being issued 
or issuable under the Company’ s incentive plans in any ten-year period. I t is expected that market purchased shares will generally be used to satisfy awards under the PSP . 
A wards outstanding at the end of the year expiring on 7 November 2015, 13 March 2016, 31 July 2016, 27 March 2017, 20 March 2018, 13 March 2019, 14 September 
2019, 17 March 2020, 26 April 2021 and 11 August 2021 were under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m), under 0.1m (2010: under 0.1m), 0.1m (2010: 0.1m), under 0.1m 
(2010: under 0.1m), 0.1m (2010: 0.2m), 0.4m (2010: 0.4m), 0.1m (2010: 0.1m), 0.3m (2010: 0.3m), 0.4m (2010: nil) and under 0.1m (2010: nil) respectively .

Bonus Investment Plan 
In 2005 the Group established the Bonus Investment Plan (BIP), which replaced the SEEPP . This enables participants to defer part of their annual bonus into UBM plc 
ordinary shares and provides the opportunity to earn further shares. 25% of any annual bonus award will be automatically be deferred into shares to be held for three years, 
and the participant may also elect to defer up to a further 25% into shares for the same period.  
For BIP awards made in 2011 and prior to 2010, at the end of three years if the employee remains in service with the Company then the participant could receive a 
matching award of up to two additional shares for every share held if the Company’ s adjusted earnings per share have grown by more than an average of at least 10% 
(8% for awards prior to 2010) per annum above UK retail price index growth over the three year period. A lower ratio of matching shares may be earned if earnings per 
share have grown by between 5% and 10% (3% and 8% for awards made prior to 2010) per annum above UK retail price index growth. 
BIP awards made in 2010 require UBM’ s total shareholder return (‘TSR ’) to outperform a comparator group of companies over a three-year period. 25% of the award will 
vest if TSR is at median position (subject to a maximum value of 25% of base salary) and 100% if TSR exceeds the median by 10% per annum. In between these positions, 
the award will vest on a straight-line basis. 
The number of ordinary shares which may be placed under option under the BIP depends on the monetary value of the bonus awarded to an employee during the year . 
The amount of bonus depends upon employee/Company performance over the prior financial year (the year of performance measuremen t). For the element which is 
mandatorily paid in shares, the number is calculated by dividing 25% of the monetary value of the bonus by the average December share price in the year preceding the 
year of performance measurement. For any further element which the employee elects to defer into shares, the number is calculated by dividing the relevant monetary 
value by the share price at the time of the award. 
A wards are made in the form of options which are exercisable on payment of a nominal £1, or conditional awards for employees in the US. Options, once vested, must 
normally be exercised before the expiry of ten years from the date of grant. Options may be exercised earlier in the event of death, or ceasing to be employed due to 
retirement, injury , disability or redundancy . 
The number of ordinary shares over which awards may be granted under the BIP may not result in more than 10% of the ordinary share capital being issued or issuable 
under the Company’ s incentive plans in any ten-year period. I t is expected that market purchased shares will generally be used to satisfy awards under the BIP . 
A wards outstanding at the end of the year expiring on 13 March 2016, 7 March 2017, 20 March 2018, 13 March 2019, 17 March 2020 and 26 April 2021 were under

Valuation of share-based payments 
Options granted under the 2008 Executive Share Option Scheme and the SA YE plans were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing models. Nil cost options and 
restricted shares (excluding the PSP awards and the 2010 BIP match awards with TSR-based performance conditions) were valued based on the share price at grant date 
less the value of any dividends foregone during the period to exercise. The following table provides the weighted averages of the assumptions used to value options granted 
during the year ended 31 December: 
 
2011 2010 
Dividend yield  5.0% 5.0%
Expected volatility  30.0% 30.0%
Risk-free rate 1.7% 1.9%

 Nil cost options/share awards without TSR condition 478p 457p 
 Nil cost options/share awards with TSR condition 275p 309p 
Expected life  Equal to vesting period Equal to vesting period 
The expected volatility is based on management’ s view of future expectations and consideration of the Group’ s historic average volatility .  
A Monte Carlo simulation model was used for valuing PSP awards and 2010 BIP awards which have a performance condition based on the ranking of UBM plc TSR 
growth relative to a group of media-related comparator companies. The additional assumptions made for this purpose are that the average correlation of TSR growth 
between companies is 28% (2010: 23%) and the average of the individual volatility assumptions used for each comparator company is 45% (2010: 48%). 
The total charge for the year relating to the employee share-based payment plans was £5.8m (2010: £3.5m). Of this amount, £5.0m (2010: £3.2m) related to equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions. The remaining £0.8m (2010: £0.3m) relates to that 25% of cash bonus earned which may be deferred for shares under the BIP at the 
option of the employee, which is treated as a cash-settled liability at 31 December 2011 until the actual deferral amount is known. At 31 December 2011, the cash-settled 
liability was £0.7m (2010: £0.3m). 
The total charge for the year includes an amount in relation to 0.5 million nil cost BIP options that are expected to be issued in 2012 based on services provided and 
performance over 2011. The weighted average fair value for these awards is 558p and the awards are expensed over four years starting in January 2011. The expense will be 
adjusted in 2012 where appropriate to allow for the actual number of awards granted and fair value at grant date. In the 2010 total charge for the year, it was expected that 
0.4 million nil cost BIP options were to be issued in 2011 with a weighted average fair value of 289p and the awards are expensed over four years starting in January 2010. 
The Group has adopted the exemption in IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ to fair value options granted from 7 November 2002 onwards.

The Group has acquired 100% of the voting rights in all cases where acquisitions involved the purchase of companies unless otherwise stated below . All 2011 acquisitions 
where less than 100% of the voting rights of a company were purchased have been accounted for using the full goodwill method, as permitted by IFRS 3 (revised 2008). 
As none of these companies are listed, no market information is available. Therefore, the fair value of the non-controlling interest for each acquisition has been estimated 
using a multiples approach with assumed adjustments for the lack of control that market participants would have by reference to the purchase price paid by the Group. 
Acquisition costs of £2.9m have been expensed as exceptional items in the income statement (Note 7) and are included in operating cash flows in the statement of cash 
flows. £0.5m of these costs relate to the acquisition of Ecobuild. 
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 130 30. Acquisitions continued 
Ecobuild 
On 19 July 2011, the Group acquired International Business Events Limited – owner of the Ecobuild exhibition business – for initial cash consideration of £31.2m and 
further performance-based consideration of up to a maximum of £20.0m payable over the following 12 months. Contingent consideration of £11.1m was included in the 
acquisition accounting and calculation of goodwill, based on the projected financial performance at the time of acquisition. This estimate has been subsequently revised to 
£12.7m, reflecting improved performance and projections for the March 2012 event. The movement of £1.6m is reported within exceptional items relating to acquisitions 
within the income statement. 
Ecobuild is the world’ s largest exhibition dedicated to sustainable building products and is the fastest-growing trade event in the UK. The acquisition is an excellent fit with 
UBM Built Environment’ s existing UK media portfolio which includes industry-leading online and print publications such as Property W eek and Building, as well as a 
range of events such as Interiors, Sleep, BSEC and RESI. Ecobuild is also a strong complement to the Group’ s existing international construction portfolio which includes 
Expobuild in China, the Concrete Show in Brazil and India as well as Building Future Education in U AE. These media platforms will support Ecobuild and the Group’ s 
global events infrastructure will support the expansion of Ecobuild to other countries, building on the event’ s existing international audience. 
The goodwill of £29.7m arising from the acquisition of Ecobuild relates to the following factors: 
– the acquisition gives the Group a market leading position in the growing UK sustainable construction market; 
– expected increases in customers and revenues resulting from increased market penetration; 
– buyer specific cost and tax synergies; and 
– acquired assembled workforce. 
None of the goodwill recognised on acquisition of Ecobuild is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
Other acquisitions 
Events acquisitions 
The goodwill of £24.8m recognised for other acquisitions relates to certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated. These include items such as customer 
loyalty , market share, skilled workforce and synergies expected to arise after the acquisition completion. Of the goodwill arising, an amount of £1.0m is expected to be

strategy to enhance and expand its international presence in geographic regions of significant growth. There are put and call options over a further 15% of the equity

two years. The acquisition of AMB accelerates the expansion of the Group’ s Events business into South East Asia. 
On 17 June 2011, the Group acquired a 70% equity interest in UBM Catersource LLC, a limited liability company which owns the trade and assets of the Catersource

three-month period after the 2013 events and for a three-month period after each subsequent event. The vendor also has a put option over their 30% interest exercisable 
after 17 June 2013. Both put and call options are priced at 6x EBIT A (capped at $7.2m (£4.5m)). The fair value of the put option including exercise price at acquisition 
date and at 31 December 2011 was £2.0m. The put option is included in derivative financial instruments. The value of the call option is not material to the Group.

Canon Communications LLC 
On 21 October 2010, the Group acquired Canon, a leading provider of tradeshows and related media products serving the global advanced manufacturing sector, 
for cash consideration of $287.0m (£183.2m). The acquisition of Canon will complement three of the Group ’ s reportable segments: 
– Events: Canon brings event leadership to the Group in the attractive, growing medical device design and manufacturing market. The company’ s US events 
expertise, databases and marketing services capabilities will augment and advance the Group’ s existing US tradeshows in markets such as packaging, ingredients 
and speciality chemicals. It will also provide the Group with the opportunity to geo-clone events in fast growing economies such as China, India and Brazil. 
– Marketing Services – Online: Canon’ s Marketing Services – Online product portfolio complements the Group’ s existing position in the electronic engineering 
market, broadening the Group’ s portfolio of information products and services for the electronic design and engineering community. 
– Marketing Services – Print: Canon’ s print product portfolio complements the Group’ s existing position in the electronic engineering market, broadening the 
Group’ s portfolio of information products and services for the electronic design and engineering community. 
The goodwill of £150.4m arising from the acquisition of Canon relates to the following factors: 
– the acquisition provides the Group with a market leading position in the growing medical devices events market and provides growth opportunities, particularly 
in emerging markets, through leveraging the Group’ s international tradeshow infrastructure and expertise on Canon’ s existing business; 
– management expects a high proportion of new customers; the revenue streams associated with new customers have been reflected in goodwill. The value of existing 
Canon customers is included in the intangible asset detailed below; 
– buyer specific tax shields reflecting net operating losses and unrecognised deferred tax assets which are expected to remain within the combined UBM and Canon 
business; and 
– acquired skilled workforce. 
None of the goodwill recognised on acquisition of Canon is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
Other acquisitions 
The goodwill of £69.0m recognised above for other acquisitions relates to certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated. These include items such as 
customer loyalty , market share, skilled workforce and synergies expected to arise after the acquisition completion. Of the goodwill arising, an amount of £2.3m is expected

– 60% interest in N avalshore, a Brazilian shipbuilding industry tradeshow and conference for cash consideration of R$2.9m (£1.1m). The acquisition of a majority

7x EBIT A. The vendor also has a put option over their 25% interest exercisable after 31 December 2016 and priced at 7x EBIT A. The carrying value of the put option

On 12 August 2010, the Group acquired The Route Development Group Limited for initial cash consideration of £8.0m and further performance-related consideration

recognised as a result of remeasuring the previous equity interest to fair value. 
– the Group purchased the remaining 10% equity interest in PR Newswire Argentina for cash consideration of $40,000 (£27,000). The transaction has been accounted

Independent auditor’ s report to the members of UBM plc 
W e have audited the parent company financial statements of UBM plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the parent company profit and loss 
account, the parent company balance sheet, and the related notes 1 to 16. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards. 
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and our engagement letter 
dated 28 February 2011. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’ s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’ s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement on page 72 the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view . Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
In addition, the Company has also instructed us to report to you our opinion on: 
– whether the section of the Directors' Remuneration Report that is described as audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation 
described therein; and 
– whether the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the parent company’ s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
– give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’ s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its loss for the year then ended;  
– have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards; and 
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
Opinion on other matters 
In our opinion: 
– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that has been described as audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation 
as described therein; and 
– the information given in the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the parent company financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
W e have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
– the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matters 
W e have reported separately on the Group financial statements of UBM plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 145 Notes to the parent company financial statements 
at 31 December 2011

Law 1991. The address of the registered office is Ogier House, The Esplanade, St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Jersey. UBM plc is tax resident in the Republic of Ireland. 
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the UBM Group (‘the Group’). The Group is organised into five operating 
segments, as detailed in Note 3 of the Group financial statements of UBM plc. Each of the segments operations are:

generation program;

products; and 
– Marketing Services – Print (formerly Print – Magazines) which publishes magazines and trade press to specialist markets. 
The shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock Exchange’ s market for listed securities (the ‘London Stock Exchange’). 
2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. They were approved by the Board of Directors for issue on 28 February 2012. They are presented in the Company’ s functional currency, pounds sterling. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991 and United Kingdom accounting standards. 
These separately presented Company financial statements comprise the profit and loss account, balance sheet and related notes. The Company has utilised the 
exemptions provided under FRS 1 (Revised) and has not presented a cash flow statement. A consolidated cash flow statement has been presented in the Group 
financial statements of UBM plc. 
The UBM plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 contain financial instrument disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’ and these would also comply with the disclosures required by FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ . Accordingly, the Company 
has taken advantage of the exemptions provided in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 not to present separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company. 
Changes to accounting policies 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial period, except for the adoption of the new Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘FRSs’), amendments to existing FRSs and U rgent Issues T ask Force (‘UITF’) abstracts listed below . The adoption of these items has not had any impact on the 
financial position, performance, presentation or disclosures of the Company. 
– Amendment to FRS 25 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ on the classifications of rights issues, effective 1 February 2010. 
– FRS 30 ‘Heritage assets’ – heritage assets kept for their contribution to knowledge and culture, effective 1 April 2010. 
– Improvements to FRSs, effective 1 January 2011: 
– Amendments to SSAP 25 ‘Segmental reporting’ . 
– Amendments to FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ – the definition of a related party was updated to be consistent with IAS 24. 
– Improvements to FRS 29 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’ . 
– UITF 47 ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’ , effective 1 July 2010. 
Significant accounting policies 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. The Company reviews investments for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company assesses whether such indicators exist at each reporting date. If any such 
indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the investment is less than the 
carrying amount, an impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. 
Foreign currencies 
Foreign currency transactions arising from operating activities are translated from local currency into pounds sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the period end exchange rate. Foreign currency 
gains or losses are credited or charged to the profit and loss account as they arise.  
Section 3: Financial statements
UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2011 146 2. Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments in the scope of FRS 26 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. Financial liabilities in the scope of FRS 26 are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(borrowings, amounts owed to subsidiaries and other creditors). When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, and in the 
case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, after taking account of directly attributable transaction costs. 
All bank and other loans are initially recognised at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the loans. After initial 
recognition, bank and other loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost and any difference between the proceeds and redemption value is recognised in the 
income statement using the effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have 
occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: 
– provision is made for taxable gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement 
assets, only to the extent that there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available 
evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the 
replacement assets are sold; 
– provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent 
that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable; and 
– deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which 
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period on which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates 
and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Share-based payments 
Where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled 
in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 ‘Share-based 
payments’ , with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent. Consequently, the Company has recognised an addition to 
investments in subsidiaries of the aggregate amount of these contributions that accrued in the year of £5.0m (2010: £3.2m) with a corresponding credit to equity 
shareholders’ funds. Full details of share-based payments transactions are provided in Note 28 of the Group financial statements.

The Company has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £0.5m (2010: £0.3m) relating to unused tax losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these 
amounts due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams. 
In the foreseeable future, the Company’ s tax charge will continue to be influenced by the nature of its income and expenditure in the subsequent accounting periods.

Dividend Access Plan
Pursuant to the Dividend Access Plan that was put in place in 2008, shareholders can elect to receive their dividend from a UK source. Shareholders who hold more 
than 50,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividend from a UK source must make an election. Shareholders who held 50,000 or fewer UBM shares on the date 
of admission of the Company’ s shares to the London Stock Exchange or (if later) on the first dividend record date after they became shareholders in the Company, 
will be automatically deemed to have elected to receive a UK-sourced dividend. All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked. Unless shareholders have 
made, or are deemed to have made, an election under the Dividend Access Plan, their dividend will be paid from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.

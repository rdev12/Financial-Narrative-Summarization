Vision and strategy
Realising our vision
Our vision is to become one of the pre-eminent 
independent exploration and production companies  
in the Middle East and North Africa region, and to be  
viewed as a preferred operator and partner.
Business strengths
We consider our key strengths in 
achieving our strategy to be: 
n The relationships that we have formed 
in Syria and elsewhere in the MENA 
region, primarily via Mahdi Sajjad, our 
President
n The reputation for efficient cost 
effective operation that we have built 
up in Syria
n The balanced and complementary 
skill set and expertise of our executive 
team
n The enthusiasm, competence and 
dedication of our staff
Strategy
Our long-term objective is to deliver significant growth in shareholder value via the exploration 
and development of oil and gas fields in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) region.
We intend to achieve this primarily by investment in early stage exploration and appraisal 
opportunities but do not rule out the acquisition of more mature assets if the opportunity  
exists for us to add material value.
Where possible we prefer to act as operator, as this allows us to retain control of project 
execution risk and financial exposure, but will invest in non-operated situations if we are 
confident that our own interests are sufficiently protected and the operator is capable of 
managing the business just as well, if not better, than us.
Our first priority is to maximise the potential in Syria, in particular to capture the available 
upside in Block 26 before the final expiry of the exploration period in August 2012. We will  
also be looking for ways to add further assets in Syria, capitalising on the strength of the 
relationships that we have forged over the last decade.
We have ambitions to build a significant business in Iraq in the mid to longer term, where we 
believe that the opportunities for smaller E&P companies will increase in coming years. Our 
focus will remain outside Kurdistan until we are satisfied that the issues concerning the 
exploitation of Kurdistan’s hydrocarbon potential have been satisfactorily resolved. We will 
seek to participate in projects that offer significant upside and can deliver returns that are 
commensurate with the challenges presented by those projects, and we will assess our risk 
exposure and capital commitment both on an individual project basis and for the country  
as a whole.
We will seek attractive opportunities to enter other countries in the region, but will scrutinise 
such opportunities carefully to ensure they represent compelling justification for investment.
We intend to dispose of our US business as and when we assess the time is right to do so. In 
the meantime we will pursue a strategy of selective reinvestment in this business in order to be 
in a position to commence a disposal process when market conditions are favourable.
Finally, we aim to follow a relatively conservative financing policy, ensuring that any leverage is 
kept at prudent levels and that we have the financial resources available to finance necessary 
investment even in adverse economic conditions.

Chairman’s statement
A year of solid progress
We ended the year with unrestricted cash balances  
of $57.6 million and no debt.
Andrew West Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
It gives me much pleasure to report on 
another year of solid progress towards 
our goal of becoming a leading 
independent exploration and production 
company in the Middle East and North 
Africa (“MENA”) region. A number of key 
achievements are worthy of mention.
Proven and Probable working interest 
reserves increased by 25% to more than 50 
mmboe, all of which increase related to our 
assets in Syria.
We ended the year with unrestricted cash 
balances of $57.6 million and no debt. This 
strong financial position has been crucial to 
our ability to continue to function unimpeded 
by the very difficult financial circumstances of 
the past 18 months and leaves the Group 
well placed to fund our plans for development 
and exploration in Syria from our own 
resources. 
The “investment profile” of the Group 
improved significantly during the course of 
the year. We are now covered actively by 
research analysts at eight independent 
brokerage firms. Liquidity in our shares has 
improved considerably, with an approximate 
average daily volume of 420,000 shares 
during the first two months of 2010. More 
than 200 institutional investors are now 
represented on our share register, while our 
previous Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer have ceased to be substantial 
shareholders following sales of their shares.
We made a number of key management 
appointments during the year, the foremost 
being that of Khalid Almogharbel, a Syrian 
citizen with many years experience working 
for Schlumberger in the Middle East, as our 
Operations Manager for Syria and as General 
Manager of our joint venture with the Syrian 
Petroleum Company.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the Syrian Government, the Syrian Petroleum 
Company and Syria’s General Petroleum 
Corporation for the exemplary level of 
support and cooperation we continue to 
receive from them. As but one example, the 
increase in the capacity of the early 
production facility in Khurbet East to 18,000 
bopd was achieved at minimal cost and 
within a timeframe of months that would not 
have been possible without such assistance. 
Your Board regards the strong relationship 
we enjoy with our Syrian partners as one of 
the Group’s most important intangible assets.
I would also like to welcome Sinochem, our 
new Chinese partners in Block 26 and we 
look forward to a long and fruitful 
collaboration.
Against this backdrop we approach the 
coming year with confidence. Our overriding 
priority is to complete the full field 
development of the Khurbet East field but we 
are also proceeding “full ahead” in our pursuit 
of the remaining exploration potential of Block 
26.
As this Report goes to press, there are 
modestly encouraging signs of a pending 
improvement in relations between Syria and 
the United States. Any progress in this 
direction can only be to the Company’s 
advantage.
Our efforts to secure additional exploration 
opportunities in a new country in the MENA 
region have recently borne fruit in the form  
of the farm-in to two exploration licences  
in Tunisia, where we believe there is 
significant potential.
Finally, we continue to believe that our 
longstanding efforts in Iraq will begin to show 
tangible results as the obstacles to 
development of that country’s massive oil 
and gas resources have at last begun to be 
removed. We are cautiously optimistic of 
being able to report positive progress in this 
regard during the year.
Yours sincerely,
Andrew West
Chairman

Chief Executive’s statement
Potential for growth
2009 was a very successful year  
for the Group as a whole.
Richard Malcolm Chief Executive
In Syria, the focus was primarily on 
increasing oil production and reserves 
through the drilling of the Khurbet East oil 
field. This resulted in a 70% increase in 
production over the year to approximately 
17,000 bopd (gross) by year-end, exceeding 
our year-end target of 16,000 bopd (gross). 
2P oil reserves at Khurbet East have 
increased by 28% to 38 mmbbls and 
Yousefieh 2P oil reserves have increased 
42% to 8 mmbbls. After production of 2.3 
mmbbls in 2009, we now have 46 mmbbls of 
2P oil reserves in Syria compared with 35 
mmbbls a year ago (all reserves numbers on 
a working interest basis).
This production performance from Syria has 
delivered the Group its first profit after tax of 
$27.8 million and has placed us in a strong 
financial position with net cash of $57.6 
million at year-end. Assuming no unexpected 
surprises, we anticipate being able to meet all 
capital expenditure requirements in Syria and 
the USA throughout the forthcoming year 
from operating cash flow.
Syria
At Khurbet East, seven wells were drilled, 
three of which were delineation wells and four 
were producers. The upgrading of processing 
facilities at the early production facility (“EPF”) 
from 10,000 to 18,000 barrels of oil per day 
(“bopd”) capacity was completed safely in 
July, and tenders were issued in October for a 
new central production facility (“CPF”) with a 
capacity of 50,000 barrels of fluid per day 
(“bfpd”), the contract for which is expected to 
be awarded imminently. In addition, two 
appraisal wells on the Yousefieh oil field were 
successfully completed. Both wells flowed oil 
to surface on test, and approval by the Syrian 
Government to develop the field was received 
in January 2010.
A large three dimensional (“3D”) seismic 
survey of approximately 850 km² of good 
quality data was acquired in the first six 
months of the year on time, safely and within 
budget. In combination with seismic data 
acquired from a previous adjacent 3D survey, 
a total of approximately 1,100 km² of data has 
now been processed and a preliminary 
interpretation completed. Four exploration 
prospects and two leads have been identified. 
The exploration well on the first prospect 
(Zaman-1), completed in February 2010, 
discovered only a small non-commercial oil 
pool. Drilling of the second exploration well, 
Hanoon-1, is nearly complete and the results 
are anticipated in April.
A second smaller 3D seismic survey was 
acquired on a sole risk basis in November 
over the Taramish anticlinal structure located 
in the north east corner of Block 26. The 
processed data was delivered in March 2010 
and interpretation is under way.
In order to accommodate our expanding 
workforce in Syria, now numbering over  
70 people (including contract staff), we have 
moved to new offices located just outside  
the city of Damascus and strengthened our 
management team with appointment of 
Khalid Almogharbel as Operations Manager. 
A new HSE policy and management system 
was adopted by the Group during the year 
2010 Objectives

and a HSE Manager appointed to the 
Damascus office. I am pleased to report that 
Gulfsands’ excellent safety record has been 
maintained in 2009 with no lost-time injuries 
being reported during the year, nor indeed 
since operations began in 2006. 
USA
Results for the year in the USA were very 
disappointing from a number of perspectives. 
The delay in repair of third party infrastructure 
has been significantly more protracted than 
anticipated following damage incurred by 
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. At  
the time of writing our working interest 
production is approximately 1,700 boepd, 
significantly below budget due to a number  
of facilities still not being fully operational. In 
addition, gas sales prices fell from an average 
of $9.4/mcf in 2008 to an average of $3.9/mcf 
in 2009. As a result of these and other 
difficulties, the US business made a loss for the 
year of $14.2 million before intra-group interest 
(2008 as restated: $0.3 million). However, we 
anticipate the US will make a positive 
contribution during 2010 assuming a 
reasonably trouble free hurricane season and 
oil and gas prices remaining at or above current 
levels. This will include some investment 
expenditure with possibly two exploration  
wells in addition to a number of work-overs.
The USA assets are now non-core to the 
Group and we intend to commence the 
process of divestment during 2010.
New business initiatives
The focus for the Group continues to be the 
active exploitation of potential in Block 26 in 
Syria. However, we are also looking to 
expand our footprint in Syria and are 
proactively seeking new opportunities. 
In Iraq, participation in the Maysan Gas 
Project remains an objective for the Group. 
During the year, a thorough technical and 
commercial audit and review of the project  
by third parties, was undertaken that has 
reinforced our desire to pursue the project 
and finalise negotiations as soon as possible. 
We are also looking for opportunities in Iraq 
that would allow direct participation in 
enhanced oil recovery projects that, if 
appropriately structured, have the potential to 
deliver a relatively attractive rate of return.
We have expanded our search for new 
business opportunities to the Middle East 
and North Africa region generally and 
recently announced a farm-in to two 
exploration permits in Tunisia, one onshore 
and one offshore, held by AUDAX Resources. 
This will involve us in the acquisition of 3D 
seismic and the drilling of two exploration 
wells during the course of 2010.
Objectives for 2010
We believe that a significant quantity of oil 
remains undiscovered in Block 26 and 
requires an active exploration programme to 
capture this potential, prior to the end of the 
exploration period in August 2012. We plan  
to drill four exploration wells in 2010 on newly 
defined prospects and to acquire another 
large 3D seismic survey in order to delineate 
future exploration targets. 
Production for 2010 is anticipated to average 
approximately 18,000 bopd delivered to the 
export pipeline via a newly built 22 km pipeline 
and storage facility at the EPF. We aim to bring 
Yousefieh into production by mid-year.
Development drilling will continue at the 
Khurbet East field with four development 
wells and at the Yousefieh Field with one well, 
in preparation to ramp up oil production 
through the CPF once this has been brought 
into operation. 
Outlook 
2010 and 2011 will continue to be capital 
intensive years in Block 26 as we continue 
to explore aggressively and construct and 
commission the CPF, but all costs are 
anticipated to be met from cash flow. At the 
date of this statement, we are in a strong 
financial position with a cash balance of over 
$70 million, no debt and a forecast surplus 
cash flow for 2010. Thereafter, surplus cash 
flows generated in Syria will be reinvested in 
new projects, both within Syria and 
elsewhere in the Middle East. 
We believe that a solid foundation for the 
Group has now been achieved in Syria that 
enables Gulfsands to look to the future with 
great excitement and optimism and to 
continue to build an ever stronger E&P 
company by focusing on our strengths and 
capitalising on the opportunities that lie 
before us.

undiscovered in Block 26 and 
requires an active exploration 
programme to capture this 
potential, prior to the end of the 
exploration period in August 2012.

Q&A with Mahdi Sajjad
Business Development  
in the Middle East
Mahdi Sajjad President
SYRIA
Q
How dependent is Syria on its oil  
and gas industry?
Oil revenues provide a significant portion of 
Syria’s foreign exchange earnings, and 
forecasting future oil revenues is a critical 
part of the country’s economic planning 
process. It has been estimated that by 2020 
Syria will require oil production levels of 
approximately 600,000 bopd to meet the 
country’s economic growth plans, so it is 
important that Syria achieves exploration 
success to arrest declining levels of current 
production and ensure the country has the oil 
it requires to meet its economic objectives. 
Q
What proportion of Syria’s oil  
production is produced by  
international oil companies?
It is estimated that international oil companies 
account for approximately 60% of the 
country’s current production of approximately 
380,000 bopd.
Q
How do you see Syria’s oil and gas 
industry developing over the next  
few years?
Syria is about to embark on a new round of 
oil field redevelopments and recently offered 
a number of blocks for exploration by 
international companies. Therefore I would 
expect oil and gas exploration expenditures 
to increase significantly in the coming years 
while the country also looks to bring a 
number of discovered gas resources into 
production to meet a substantial increase in 
local demand. 
Q
What role can Gulfsands expect to play 
in that development?
Gulfsands is keenly interested in exploring the 
oil potential of Block 26 in north east Syria 
where we have had a presence since 2003 
and we have a well funded and ambitious 
programme under way at the moment. At the 
same time, we are working as quickly as we 
can to increase the production from our two 
discoveries at Khurbet East and Yousefieh in 
Block 26. We are also evaluating 
opportunities to acquire additional exploration 
acreage and other field redevelopment 
opportunities.
Q
How clear cut is the legal framework  
in Syria in terms of title to oil and  
gas properties?
Syria has a well deserved reputation for 
honouring its production sharing contractual 
obligations and we are very confident that our 
own excellent experience in this regard will 
continue.
Q
How much more potential is there in 
Block 26?
That’s what we would like to know too!  
We expect to devote a lot of resources to 
exploration over the next two years and we 
are optimistic that we will find additional 
discoveries in Block 26 before our production 
sharing contract expires in August 2012.
Q
Is Gulfsands looking for new projects in 
Syria outside of Block 26?
It is widely known that we are looking for 
opportunities to expand our portfolio with oil 
and gas projects outside of Block 26. We are 
constantly evaluating farm-in and acquisition 
opportunities as well as participating in new 
blocks offered by the government but so far 
we have not found additional projects that 
meet our objectives.

Q
Do you see the US sanctions regime 
being lifted any time soon?
Recently there have been a number of 
positive developments in this regard with a 
number of previously imposed restrictions 
being removed already and the appointment 
of a new US ambassador to Syria. We are 
optimistic that, with the relationship between 
Syria and the US continuing to improve all  
the time, we will see the removal of further 
restrictions on trade between the two 
countries in the not distant future.
Q
Does Syria have a role to play in 
exporting oil and gas from Iraq when  
the latter’s production expands  
as promised?
Iraq’s plans for expanding its production of oil 
and gas will bring significant infrastructure 
challenges. Iraq recognises that Syria could 
have a significant role to play in transporting 
large volumes of both oil and gas to the 
Mediterranean while also offering Syria access 
to important additional supplies of oil and gas 
to supplement Syria’s own production. 
IRAQ
Q
How do you view the situation in Iraq 
following the recent elections?
The recent elections represent an important 
milestone in Iraq’s move to become the 
Middle East’s newest democracy. We are 
optimistic that once the new government is 
installed we will see an acceleration in the 
pace of progress to approve and develop 
energy projects in general and specifically 
those on which we have been working for 
some time. 
Q
Are you confident the Maysan project 
will get the go ahead?
I am confident that this project will eventually 
get the go ahead as there is a great deal of 
local and federal support for this critical 
development that will capture a huge amount 
of gas that is currently being flared, resulting 
in a great loss of wasted energy and 
environmental damage to a wide area in the 
south of the country. Now that the bid rounds 
for the development of super-giant oil fields in 
the south have been completed, we expect 
the government to turn its attention to the 
approval of this and a number of other 
important projects that were effectively 
stalled pending conclusion of those bid 
rounds.
Q
Why is a small E&P company like 
Gulfsands pursuing a large midstream 
project in Iraq?
This is a lucrative project on its own. However 
we see this project as providing us with the 
additional opportunity to be involved in the 
development of a number of oil fields in the 
Maysan province which would then produce 
additional volumes of gas that could be added 
to our gas gathering project while providing 
additional revenues from the production of oil. 
I would stress however that this is not a 
project we expect to undertake alone: we 
intend to bring in one or more larger partners 
at the appropriate time, which would provide 
the lion’s share of the funding, and indeed we 
have had discussions with potential 
candidates under way for some time.
Q
Iraq has become a “big oil” game: can 
Gulfsands really expect to prosper there 
given its size?
The initial “game” in Iraq has obviously 
attracted many large companies, and the 
technical challenges and the cost of 
developing the oil fields already awarded will 
be very significant. Gulfsands is therefore 
pursuing projects that it considers capable of 
executing either on its own or in partnership 
with larger companies. Obviously to the 
extent we can form strategic partnerships 
with large companies our capacity to become 
involved in larger projects will increase. Our 
focus, therefore, has been on forming 
suitable partnerships to pursue projects 
where we can be appropriately rewarded for 
the contribution we make in the form of our 
local experience and relationships gained 
from our lengthy presence in the country.
Q
Why are you not looking at opportunities 
in Kurdistan?
We have never “not looked” at Kurdistan 
because it is obviously a region of huge oil 
and gas potential. However, it is well known 
that a number of legal and commercial issues 
critical to the successful exploitation of oil 
and gas in Kurdistan remain to be resolved 
between the Federal government and the 
regional government of Kurdistan. In our view, 
until those issues have been reliably resolved, 
our efforts in Iraq will most profitably be 
directed towards opportunities in the south  
of the country, where there are a very 
substantial number of discovered but 
undeveloped fields, significant existing 
infrastructure, lower geological risk generally, 
and fewer uncertainties about how we will be 
compensated if our efforts are successful. 
Q
Are you interested in looking at projects 
outside of Syria and Iraq?
Our principal focus for new business has 
been, and remains, Syria and Iraq. However 
we believe that we have the capacity to take 
on additional projects given our financial 
strength, and so will continue to look for 
opportunities within the wider Middle East 
and North Africa region, seeking to leverage 
existing relationships as in Syria and Iraq.  
As part of this strategy, we announced  
the farm-in to two permits in Tunisia on  
22 March 2010.

Operations
Production
Gross oil production from the Khurbet East 
field increased by 70% during 2009: at the 
start of the year production was just over 
10,000 bopd from five wells and by the end 
of the year this had risen to approximately 
17,000 bopd from seven wells. Production  
in the first seven months of the year was 
constrained by the capacity of the EPF, but 
this was alleviated in August by the addition 
of another two phase separation unit,  
thereby increasing the throughput capacity  
to 18,000 bopd.
Production as at the end of March 2010 
stood at approximately 17,000 bopd from 
seven wells. Throughout the period under 
review the Khurbet East field has produced 
oil with minimal amounts of water (less than 
0.3% by volume) and with negligible pressure 
loss, implying the likely presence of a strong 
water drive from the flanks of the field. The 
central area of the field, where the currently 
producing wells are all located, exhibits 
exceptional reservoir quality with multi-Darcy 
permeability arising from the “vugular” nature 
of the carbonates.
To date all production has been trucked  
to the SPC processing facilities at the 
Souedieh-3 station, a distance of some 
30 km by road. Despite an upgrade to the 
road undertaken during the year, the volume 
of truck movements at current production 
levels is not sustainable in the medium term 
and therefore work is under way to build a 
22 km 8" pipeline to replace the trucking 
operation. It is anticipated that this will be 
completed in mid 2010.
Wells
During the year a total of nine production and 
appraisal wells were drilled using a single rig: 
seven on Khurbet East and two on Yousefieh. 
The two Yousefieh wells were both vertical 
appraisal wells, whereas the Khurbet East 
wells comprised three vertical appraisal wells 
to delineate the southern extremities of the 
field and four production wells, two vertical 
and two horizontal. Two of the Khurbet East 
wells were on production by the end of 2009 
and two were suspended as future 
producers. The depths of the wells on both 
fields ranged from 1,986 metres to 2,139 
metres true vertical measured depth. 
The production wells on Khurbet East drilled 
in 2009 cost an average of $2.7 million to drill 
(50% for Gulfsands’ interest) and took an 
average of 29 days from spud to rig release. 
The exploration and appraisal wells cost an 
average of $3.5 million to drill (50% for 
Gulfsands’ interest) and took an average  
of 35 days from spud to rig release (the 
additional time and cost being mainly due  
to logging and testing).
On Khurbet East, KHE-7, which was the final 
well drilled in 2008, was completed in 
January 2009. KHE-7 was a step-out 
appraisal well to the north intended to 
delineate the northern extent of the field. 
While oil shows were encountered the 
porosity was found to be much lower than in 
the central portion of the field. The well was 
suspended for further evaluation and well 
testing. KHE-8, a step-out appraisal well  
to the south, was drilled in March, and 
encountered a 23 metre gross (15 metre net) 
oil-bearing section with reasonable porosity. 
The well flowed 20-23° API oil to surface on 
test following acid stimulation and under 
nitrogen lift at a rate of 617 bopd, and was 
Gulfsands is the operator of the Block 26 PSC 
with a 50% working interest. The other 50% 
interest is held by Sinochem following its 
takeover of Emerald Energy in Q4 2009. 
Block 26 covers an area of approximately 
8,300 km². The PSC grants rights to explore, 
develop and produce from all stratigraphic 
levels outside the existing field areas and the 
deeper stratigraphic levels below the 
pre-existing discovered field areas. The 
current exploration period expires in August 
2010 but may be extended at the Contractor’s 
option for a further two years. The minimum 
work commitments for the current exploration 
period have already been satisfied. 
Gulfsands has discovered two commercial 
oil fields within the PSC area, Khurbet East 
and Yousefieh. The development and 
production period for the Khurbet East field 
expires in February 2033 (25 years after 
commercial approval) and that for the 
Yousefieh field in January 2035, but each 
may be extended for a further 10 years at the 
contractor’s option. The terms of the PSC 
comprise a 12.5% royalty, cost recovery 
allowance, and the sharing of the resultant 
profit oil between the contractor group and 
the Syrian Petroleum Company (“SPC”).
The Khurbet East field was discovered in 
June 2007 by the KHE-1 well and was 
appraised by two further wells in H2 2007. 
Commercial development approval was 
granted in February 2008. The development 
and operation of the field is being 
undertaken by Dijla Petroleum Company 
(“DPC”), a joint operating company formed 
with the SPC for this purpose. The KHE-1 
well was a multi-zone discovery, 
encountering hydrocarbons in the 
Cretaceous Massive formation at a depth of 
approximately 2,000 metres and in the 
deeper Triassic Butmah and Kurachine 
Dolomite formations. The reserves 
attributable to Khurbet East come from the 
Cretaceous Massive formation only and 
exclude hydrocarbons in the deeper Triassic 
formation. Oil production commenced from 
the Khurbet East field in July 2008 using an 
EPF, which had been constructed by SPC 
and leased to the Contractor group.
The Yousefieh field was discovered in 
November 2008 by the Y-1 well which was 
drilled to a depth of approximately 2,100 
metres and encountered oil in the 
Cretaceous aged formations. Y-1 is located 
approximately 3 km away from the EPF at 
Khurbet East. Two appraisal wells were 
drilled in 2009 and commercial development 
approval was granted in January 2010. The 
field is expected to be placed on production 
during H1 2010.
The crude oil from Khurbet East has an API 
gravity of approximately 25°, slightly lighter 
than that of Syrian Heavy crude oil. The oil is 
transported to the SPC operated facilities at 
the Souedieh-3 station, some 30 km away, 
where it is mixed with the Syrian Heavy 
crude oil, and exported to the Mediterranean 
port of Tartous using SPC’s oil handling 
infrastructure. Oil from Yousefieh tested 
variously at 23-24° API (Y-1 and Y-3) and 17° 
API (Y-2).

suspended as a potential future producer. The 
rig then commenced a three development well 
programme. KHE-9 was drilled in April as a 
vertical well in the central area of the field: it 
flowed 3,040 bopd through a 48/64" choke 
under an open hole drill stem test (“DST”) and 
was placed on production in early July. 
KHE-10 was drilled in May/June as a horizontal 
producer with a bottom hole location some 
700 metres north west of KHE-9: it penetrated 
a 260 metre horizontal section of the reservoir 
and was placed on production in early August. 
KHE-11, another horizontal producer, was then 
drilled in July and penetrated a 60 metre 
section of the uppermost portion of the 
reservoir. Under test the well produced oil at  
a rate of 1,660 bopd through a 48/64" choke, 
but with an associated water cut of some 
30%. The well was completed as a future 
producer but suspended pending further 
testing to identify the source of the water.  
The rig then moved on to drill KHE-12, a far 
step-out appraisal well some 3.2 km further 
south than KHE-8, aimed at delineating the 
southern boundary of the field and locating the 
field-wide oil water contact (“OWC”). Whilst the 
presence of residual oil was identified in a six 
metre section of core, the well flowed water 
under test leading to the interpretation  
that it lay beneath the field OWC. The KHE-13 
vertical development well was drilled in 
November at a location approximately 
equidistant between the KHE-1 discovery well 
and KHE-8. The well flowed 1,020 bopd under 
test through a 32/64" choke with negligible 
amounts of water, and was placed on 
production in January 2010. Finally, KHE-14 
was spudded in December at a location 4.9 
km south of the KHE-1 discovery well, 
between the KHE-8 and KHE-12 locations, as 
an appraisal well intended to intersect the field 
OWC. An oil column of 14 metres gross, (six 
metres net) was encountered, and the well 
flowed 27° API oil to surface under open-hole 
DST using nitrogen lift at a rate of 613 bopd 
through a 2" choke. Although a definitive OWC 
was not observed on wireline logs or drilling 
data it was established that oil was produced 
from a vertical depth of 1,580 metres 
sub-surface, nine metres lower than the 
previous deepest oil flow observed in the field. 
This well result has caused the estimate of the 
volume of oil-in-place in Khurbet East to be 
revised upwards.
On Yousefieh, the Y-2 appraisal well, located 
1.8 km to the east of the Y-1 discovery well 
(drilled in November 2008), was drilled in 
January/February and found a gross oil 
column of 36 metres (16 metres net). Under a 
DST conducted at that time the well flowed 
predominantly water, which was suspected 
to be from a non-reservoir interval. A 
workover was conducted in August and after 
acid treatment the well flowed oil to surface 
at a rate of 139 bopd through a 2" choke 
under nitrogen lift with a water cut of 49%. 
The Y-1 discovery well was re-entered in 
August to conduct remedial cementing 
operations on the production liner, which was

then perforated across a 14.5 metre interval 
and flowed 356 bopd of oil to surface through 
a 48/64" choke with a water cut of less than 
1%. Using nitrogen lift and a 2" choke the 
flow rate was improved to 823 bopd. The Y-3 
appraisal well, located 500 metres to the 
south east of Y-1, was drilled in September/
October and encountered a gross oil column 
of 60 metres (net 49 metres) and an OWC at 
1,590 metres subsurface. Under an open-
hole DST the well flowed 24-25° API oil to 
surface at a rate of 226 bopd through a 
32/64" choke with no water. It is believed that 
the lower flow rate compared with Y-1 is a 
result of formation damage sustained during 
drilling and coring operations. An application 
for commercial development of the Yousefieh 
field was submitted in December and 
approval received for this development in 
January 2010. First oil from the field is 
anticipated by mid-April 2010.
 
Health and safety
A rigorous health and safety framework has 
been implemented in 2009. A detailed health 
and safety manual has been developed, a copy 
of which is made available to all employees.  
The drilling department holds regular safety 
meetings, drills and inspections both on a 
regular scheduled basis and prior to undertaking 
certain tasks. No lost-time incidents have been 
recorded since drilling operations commenced 
in 2006. A full time HSE manager has been 
recruited and HSE training for all new recruits, as 
well as refresher sessions for existing staff, is 
being implemented.
Exploration programme
850 km² of 3D seismic data over an area 
surrounding the Khurbet East and Yousefieh 
fields was acquired during H1 2009 using the 
Chinese firm BGP as seismic contractor. This 
was then processed by PGS in Cairo and the 
processed data was delivered to Gulfsands in 
September and October. The analysis of this 
data resulted in the identification of at least 
four prospects for exploration drilling in 2010, 
together with numerous potential leads that 
may evolve into prospects after further 
analysis and study. In addition in H2 2009  
64 km² of 3D seismic was acquired on a 
sole-risk basis over an area known as 
Taramish located at the north east corner  
of the block, and the processed data was 
delivered to Gulfsands in March 2010.
The first exploration well, Zaman-1, located 
approximately 4.5 km south of the Khurbet East 
field and targeting the same Cretaceous 
Massive formation as is under production at 
Khurbet East, was completed in February 2010. 
The well encountered good quality reservoir, 
with an interpreted four metre oil column, but 
flowed water under test and so has been 
suspended as a potential future water disposal 
well. The second well, Hanoon-1, targeting a 
smaller Cretaceous target 10 km to the north of 
the Khurbet East field, was spudded at the end 
of February 2010, and the results are likely to be 
known in April.
Plans for 2010
In 2010 we intend to drill two further 
exploration wells on Block 26 after Hanoon-1, 
four development wells on Khurbet East and 
a development well on Yousefieh. In facilities 
terms, our key project is the construction of  
a permanent central production facility at 
Khurbet East to replace the early production 
facility. This will have a design capacity of 
50,000 barrels of fluid per day and be 
capable of handling a minimum of 35,000 
bopd of oil allowing for the eventuality of 
associated water production. We will also  
be tying in the Yousefieh field to the early 
production facility during H1 2010 via its own 
dedicated two phase separation unit, with a 
view to putting the field on production during 
April 2010.
We plan to acquire further 3D seismic data 
over at least a 500 km² area of Block 26 
adjacent to the west of the 2009 seismic 
area, with the aim of maximising the 
exploration prospectivity of the Block before 
the final relinquishment of the exploration 
licence in August 2012. We intend to exercise 
our option in August 2010 to extend the 
current exploration period for a further two 
years, and an area comprising 25% of the 
original licence area has been identified for 
relinquishment in accordance with the terms 
of this extension.

Operations
Operations in 2009 were dominated by the 
ongoing effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike 
in 2008 which caused damage both to our 
own facilities and to third-party infrastructure 
such as pipelines.
Production, which on a working interest basis 
had averaged 1,433 boepd and 2,575 boepd 
in 2008 and 2007 respectively, averaged only 
1,144 boepd in 2009 because a significant 
element of production remained shut-in 
during the year pending repairs to third party 
pipeline infrastructure. The composition of 
2009 WI production was 51% gas (3,526 
mcfd), 44% oil (503 bopd) and 5% NGLs 
(2,217 galls/d). After tax and royalties, net 
interest production in 2009 was 883 boepd.
Production started the year at just over 800 
boepd (working interest) having been below 
400 boepd in October 2008 in the immediate 
aftermath of the hurricanes, and increased to 
1,683 boepd in December as production 
from key properties, notably Eugene Island 
32 and Eugene Island 57 was progressively 
restored. However during the year certain 
other non hurricane-related problems with 
third party infrastructure were encountered, 
for example at the West Delta 59 property, 
which caused production from this field to  
be shut-in as of July 2009. This field returned 
to production during March 2010 once 
construction of a new oil pipeline was 
completed. Since year-end, production has 
continued to increase and at the end of 
March was running at approximately 1,700 
boepd (working interest), comprising 37%  
oil and 63% gas.
Total repair costs arising from the 2008 
hurricanes amounted to $5.8 million over 2008 
and 2009, of which it is estimated that at least 
$1.1 million is recoverable from insurance. 
Although damage, and subsequent repairs, to 
facilities occurred on numerous properties, 
approximately 75% of the repair and restoration 
expenditures were concentrated in two 
properties (Eugene Island 32 and Vermillion 
315/332). Repairs to these facilities were 
undertaken quickly, and production was 
restored during the first half of 2009.
Operational highlights include the successful 
installation of a caisson and compressor at 
West Cameron 310 leading to increased gas 
production, acid stimulation of several wells in 
the Vermillion 379 property that yielded 
increased oil production, and production 
finally re-commencing from the Eugene 
Island 57 field in November. During the year 
24 wells on six properties were plugged and 
abandoned and three structures were 
decommissioned.
Portfolio rationalisation continued during 
2009, with the outright sale of the Galveston 
Island 215/186 property and the South Pass 
49 Unit, and the sale with a retained over-
riding royalty of the South Marsh Island 
234/235 property. These transactions 
involving non-core assets also reduced the 
division’s future abandonment obligations 
(although in present value terms the balance 
sheet provision has, in fact, increased). 
Plans for 2010
With the hurricane recovery process nearly 
complete, we intend to undertake a selective 
reinvestment programme in 2010. Plans 
include participating in the drilling of four 
additional wells within the central area (Eugene 
Island, South Marsh Island, Vermillion) and an 
aggressive work-over and re-completion 
programme concentrating on the Eugene 
Island 32 field. We will also continue to look for 
opportunities to rationalise the portfolio where 
we can harvest value or reduce future 
abandonment liabilities.

Gulfsands owns a portfolio of non-operated 
oil and gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico, 
in the shallow “shelf” region offshore Texas 
and Louisiana. These comprise 37 leases 
containing 24 producing fields with over 
200 wells operated by 17 different 
operators. Working interests range from 2% 
to 53%. Gulfsands also has a small interest 
in one onshore oil and gas field in Texas. 
The assets are relatively mature, although 
some additional potential exists in the 
deeper sections. Proven and Probable 
reserves at year-end 2009 amounted to 
4.6 million boe on a working interest basis 
(3.6 million boe on a net interest basis), 
comprised 46% of oil and 54% of gas.
The Group considers the US business to 
be non-core and intends to dispose of it as 
and when market conditions 
are favourable.

Reserves report
Reserves and contingent 
resources
The Group’s reserves at 31 December 2009 
are based on estimates made by management 
and reviewed by independent petroleum 
engineers. For the Syrian assets the review was 
performed by Senergy (2008: RPS Energy),  
and for the USA by Netherlands Sewell & 
Associates (“NSA”) (2008: same).
Definitions for Proved and Probable reserves 
are contained in the Glossary.
Working interest reserves in Syria represent the 
proportion, attributable to the Group’s 50% 
participating interest, of forecast future crude oil 
production during the economic life of the 
Block 26 PSC, including the share of that 
production attributable to Syrian Petroleum 
Company (“SPC”). In assessing the economic 
life it has been assumed that the option to 
extend the life of the PSC for a further 10 years 
after its initial expiry date is exercised. Working 
interest reserves in the USA represent the 
proportion, attributable to the Group’s 
participating interests, of forecast future oil and 
gas production during the economic life of the 
properties in question, before deduction of 
state production taxes and overriding royalty 
interests. Working interest reserves have been 
derived from the net revenue interest reserves 
data contained in the NSA report, by grossing 
up for the percentage production tax and 
royalty “burden” applicable to each property. 
The reserves-weighted average burden at  
31 December 2009 was 23%.
Entitlement reserves in Syria represent the 
Group’s estimated share of working interest 
reserves after deducting the share of forecast 
future production attributable to SPC. This 
proportion is impacted by assumptions as to 
future development expenditure and future oil 
prices. For the calculation as at 31 December 
2009 the average price of Brent crude was 
assumed to be $70/bbl in 2010, rising to $80/
bbl in 2012 and constant thereafter. Entitlement 
reserves in the US represent the Group’s 
estimated net revenue interest reserves after 
deduction of the equivalent share of oil and gas 
production attributable to state production 
taxes and overriding royalty interests.

Financial review
Year of strong growth
The group recorded a maiden net profit in 2009  
of $27 .8 million (2008: loss of $5.4 million), driven  
by strong production growth in Syria.
Andrew Rose Chief Financial Officer
Market conditions
Following the dramatic falls in energy prices 
in the second half of 2008, in 2009 oil prices 
firmed steadily over the year, with Brent 
finishing the year at $78/bbl having started 
the year at $36/bbl. US natural gas prices 
however continued falling to a low of $1.8/mcf 
in August before climbing back to finish the 
year at $5.8/mcf.
Group
The financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2008 have been restated in 
order to correct the misclassification in that 
year and in prior years of certain items of 
expenditure in the US business, which were 
classified as capital expenditure when they 
should properly have been charged to the 
income statement as operating expenses. 
The net effect on the 2008 financial 
statements has been to increase Group profit 
by $4.3 million, and a fuller explanation is 
given below in the USA section of this review. 
The comparative 2008 figures referred to 
throughout this review are the restated 
numbers.
In addition to this restatement the Group has 
reclassified certain cash flows relating to 
inventory and capital expenditure from 
operating cash flows to investing cash flows. 
This reclassification has had no impact on the 
reported results or financial position of the 
Group for prior periods.
Income statement
The Group recorded a maiden net profit in 
2009 of $27.8 million (2008: loss of 
$5.4 million), driven by strong production 
growth in Syria. As in 2008, there was a 
marked difference between the performance 
of Syria (net profit $48.4 million) and that of 
the USA (net loss, excluding interest owed to 
Group, of $14.2 million). Commentary on the 
results of each unit is given below.
Group revenues grew 57% to $84.4 million 
(2008: $53.6 million), of which $70.5 million arose 
from Syria and $13.9 million from the USA. 
Average entitlement production net to Gulfsands’ 
interest was 4,250 boepd (3,367 bopd in Syria 
and 883 boepd in the USA), a 16% increase over 
the previous year (2008: 3,750 boepd, 
measuring Syrian daily production from the start 
of production in late July).
Cost of sales rose by 39% to $38.0 million 
(2008: $27.4 million), impacted inter alia by  
a rise in impairment charges in the USA to 
$6.4 million (2008: $1.7 million), and a higher 
depletion charge in Syria commensurate with 
the increase in production.
Administrative expenses fell significantly to 
$15.5 million from $30.3 million in 2008, but 
this reflected primarily the sharp drop in 
charges attributable to the Group’s share 
incentive schemes ($1.1 million in 2009 vs. 
$12.6 million in 2008). The principal reason 
for the high share-based payment charge in 
2008 was the options granted to incoming 
and existing management, a high proportion 
of which vested immediately and so had a 
disproportionate impact on the income 
statement. Excluding these charges and 
foreign exchange gains or losses the 
underlying Group administrative expenses 
increased by 15% to $14.9 million (2008: 
$13.0 million), primarily as a result of 
increased staff and office costs in London 
and Damascus.
After deduction of hurricane repair costs of  
$2.3 million (2008: $2.8 million) Group operating 
profit came to $28.6 million, compared with  
a loss of $6.9 million in 2008. After crediting 
interest income of $0.3 million (2008: $1.2 
million) and deducting a non-cash charge of 
$1.1 million (2008: $1.7 million) for the unwinding 
of the discount in the decommissioning 
provision, pre-tax profits amounted to $27 .8 
million (2008: loss of $7 .3 million). 
There was no material tax charge in 2009 and 
none is expected to arise in the next few years 
as all local tax obligations in Syria are settled on 
the Group’s behalf by the Syrian Petroleum 
Company.
Cash flow
Cash from operating activities increased by 
117% to $43.5 million (2008: $20.0 million). 
Capital expenditure totalled $25.9 million, of 
which $5.4 million was spent on exploration 
activity, $18.1 million on development activity, 
$1.8 million on increases in material inventory 
and the balance on non oil and gas assets. In 
addition $0.9 million (2008: $2.7 million) was 
spent on decommissioning assets in the US 
Gulf of Mexico, net of releases of cash held 
in escrow as collateral.

The Syrian production figures are quoted from the start up of production in 2008.
The exercise of options yielded cash of  
$3.6 million.
The Group has historically invested, and 
intends to continue to invest, significant sums 
in exploration and development capital 
expenditure. The Group has been debt free 
since 2006 and has financed exploration and 
development investment from both cash 
generated from operations and equity 
investments since that time. The Group’s 
current investment plans for 2010 and 2011 
may be financed by cash generated from 
operations under all reasonably foreseeable  
scenarios.
Balance Sheet
The balance sheet remains strong with no 
outstanding debt and unrestricted cash 
balances at year-end of $57.6 million, of 
which all but $14.1 million was held in US 
Dollars. There were additional restricted cash 
balances of $12.0 million (2008: $13.2 million), 
held as collateral for decommissioning 
liabilities aggregating $31.6 million (2008: 
$26.3 million), all of which related to the US 
assets. The increase in decommissioning 
liabilities arises from an increase in future 
cost estimates and the use of a lower 
discount rate than last year. Trade and other 
receivables increased to $21.9 million (2008: 
$15.5 million), owing to timing differences in 
the receipt of cost recovery payments in 
Syria.
No hedges against oil and gas price 
movements were in place at year-end or 
during the year.
Syria
Income statement
Working interest production averaged 6,249 
bopd in 2009 (2008: 4,494 bopd, measured 
from the start-up of Syrian production in July 
2008), all of which was oil. Entitlement 
production amounted to 3,367 bopd (2008: 
2,655 bopd). The average sales price was 
$57 .3/bbl, representing a $4.4/bbl discount 
over average Brent (2008: $61.1/bbl, 
representing a $10.9/bbl discount). Having 
been in excess of $12.0/bbl at the beginning of 
the year, the discount to Brent narrowed during 
2009 and during the second half averaged 
$3.3/bbl, or 4.7% in percentage terms.

Revenues increased by 177% to $70.5 million 
(2008: $25.5 million). Cost of sales increased 
to $15.1 million (2008 : $4.1 million), of which 
production costs were $2.3 million (2008:  
$0.5 million), transportation costs were  
$2.9 million (2008: $0.8 million), and depletion 
charges accounted for $9.9 million (2008: 
$2.8 million). Unit production costs per 
working interest barrel were $1.01/bbl, similar 
to 2008 ($0.71/bbl). Administrative expenses 
were up by 123% to $6.9 million (2008:  
$3.1 million), owing to higher staff and local 
office costs and the Group ceasing to 
capitalise a portion of overheads in Syria 
upon the declaration of commerciality of the 
Khurbet East field in 2008.
The Syrian operations recorded a net profit of 
$48.4 million, an increase of 164% over the 
$18.3 million recorded in 2008.
Cash flow
Cash from operations was $54.4 million, and 
included $5.6 million in sales proceeds 
retained from the previous year’s production 
pending the completion of certain assay tests 
on the Khurbet East oil. Capital expenditure 
was $22.1 million, including development and 
inventory expenditure of $16.5 million and 
exploration of $5.4 million. The net cash 
surplus for the Syrian operations was  
$32.5 million.
USA
Income statement
Production in 2009 averaged 1,144 boepd on 
a WI basis (883 boepd on an NRI basis), 
compared with 1,433 boepd (1,095 boepd 
NRI) in 2008, a drop of 20%, owing to the 
continued shut-in of production for most of 
the year as a consequence of damage to 
third party infrastructure caused by the 2008 
hurricanes. The composition of 2009 WI 
production was 51% gas (3,526 mcfd), 44% 
oil (503 bopd) and 5% NGLs (2,217 galls/d). 
Average sale prices were significantly down 
on 2008 levels: we received an average of 
$3.9/mcf for our gas (2008: $9.4/mcf) and 
$60.5/bbl for our oil (2008: $102.3/bbl). Gas 
sales prices were in line with the Henry Hub 
marker price but oil sales prices were $2.3/
bbl below WTI because of a pipeline charge 
connected with the Eugene Island properties 
that was deducted from revenues.
As a result revenues were down by half on 
the prior year at $13.9 million (2008: $28.1 
million). Cost of sales however reduced by 
only 2% to $22.8 million (2008: $23.3 million), 
which resulted in a gross loss, after hurricane 
expenses, of $11.2 million (2008: gross profit 
of $2.1 million). 
Within cost of sales, non-cash items 
amounted to $8.8 million (2008: $7.0 million), 
comprising depletion of $2.4 million (2008: 
$5.4 million) and an impairment charge of 
$6.4 million (2008: $1.7 million). Impairment 
charges have occurred as a result of a 
combination of lower forecast gas prices in 
future years and increased estimates of the 
present value of future decommissioning 
liabilities. Hurricane repair costs (net of 
expected insurance recoveries of $1.1 million) 
were $2.3 million (2008: $2.8 million), other 
repair and workover costs were $3.5 million, 
decommissioning costs expensed (in excess 
of existing provisions) were $0.7 million (2008: 
$3.0 million) and the balance was general 
lease operating expenses.
Administrative expenses were $2.7 million 
(2008: $3.2 million) and the non-cash charge 
to unwind the discount on the 
decommissioning provision was $1.1 million 
(2008: $1.7 million), resulting in a loss for the 
year before interest of $11.2 million (2008 as 
restated: loss of $0.3 million).
Cash flow 
Cash flow from operations was negative to 
the tune of $5.1 million. $2.1 million of 
decommissioning costs were paid (2008: 
$5.6 million), which was partially funded by a 
release of $1.2 million (2008: $2.9 million) of 
cash held in escrow. Capital expenditure was 
$3.4 million, largely comprising $1.5 million 
for a re-completion on the Eugene Island 32 
property and $0.9 million on drilling the B-8 
Side Track on the West Cameron 498 
property. The net cash deficit for the year for 
the US operations was $13.0 million, which 
was funded by an increase in the loan from 
the parent company.

Prior year restatement
Following the prior year restatements 
contained in the 2008 financial statements, a 
full internal assessment was undertaken in 
2009 of the accounting systems and 
processes of Gulfsands USA, involving 
external consultants. This has resulted in a 
number of changes to the accounting 
software and to internal processes and 
procedures, and certain staff changes within 
the accounts department. As part of this 
process it came to light that over a number of 
years up to 2008, certain items of 
expenditure had been erroneously classified 
as capital items when they should have been 
charged to the income statement as 
operating expenses. The aggregate amount 
so misclassified over the years was $9.7 
million, most of which related to financial 
years up to and including 2007. The 
restatement of prior years’ accounts has 
resulted in reductions to fixed assets (and 
thereby to depletion and impairment charges) 
and a corresponding increase in operating 
expenses. Because of certain timing 
differences, the reduction in impairment 
charges in 2008 more than offset the 
increase in operating expenses, resulting in a 
$4.3 million reduction in the 2008 loss before 
interest and tax to a loss of $1.1 million 
(previously reported a loss of $5.4 million). 
Financial risk management
The financial risks concerning the Group 
comprise pricing risk, currency risk, liquidity 
risk and access to capital.
Pricing risk arises because all of the Group’s 
oil and gas production is sold under 
short-term pricing arrangements and so the 
Group is exposed to movements in oil and 
gas prices. To date this exposure has not 
been hedged since the Board has taken the 
view that the Group’s cash flow is sufficient 
to bear any reasonably foreseeable 
downturn in prices without affecting our 
core business. However this policy is kept 
under frequent review.
Currency risk arises because the Group’s 
sales are denominated in US Dollars but a 
proportion of its expenses are in Euro  
(some procurement costs) and Sterling (head 
office costs). This risk is mitigated by  
retaining a proportion of our cash resources 
in these currencies.
Liquidity risk concerns the Group’s ability to 
access funds to meet its obligations as they fall 
due. Our policy is to maintain sufficient cash 
balances and readily realisable investments for 
this purpose, given that the Group has no bank 
lines of credit available to it. Sums in excess of 
Unit revenues and costs (per boe)

what is needed to meet near-term obligations 
are invested in a money market fund which 
holds a diverse portfolio of short-term 
financial instruments rated A1 or better, 
resulting in a greater spread of risk and an 
improved return compared with what we 
would otherwise be able to achieve. It is the 
Board’s intention to seek to put in place one 
or more bank credit lines as and when Syrian 
country risk becomes more readily 
acceptable in the international banking 
market. 
Access to capital depends on conditions 
prevailing in the equity market for 
independent E&P companies generally and 
the sentiment among the Group’s 
shareholders in particular. Considerable 
efforts have been devoted in 2009 to 
communicate with our shareholders, to 
cultivate new investors and to build 
relationships with research analysts and 
equity sales desks at brokerage houses, in 
order to widen the following of Gulfsands by 
the investment community generally.

Risk management
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board places a high priority on managing and mitigating risk in all its forms. A comprehensive 
assessment of risks facing the Group is undertaken annually using a matrix approach which 
assesses each risk in terms of its financial impact, probability of occurrence, shareholder tolerance 
and cost of mitigation, and reviewed by the Board. Subsequent reviews are carried out as often as 
necessary during the year.
The following summarises the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and the 
measures which have been taken to mitigate them.
Risk Mitigation
External
Political interference
The risk of authorities in the host country 
seeking to expropriate assets or change the 
terms of existing contracts.
This can only effectively be mitigated by developing close relationships at high level in the 
country in question. In the case of Syria we have successfully developed such relationships 
through Mahdi Sajjad as a result of our longstanding presence in the country and our active 
community programmes.
Act of war or terrorism
The risk of an act of war or terrorism in Syria, 
as a result of Middle East tensions generally, 
impacting the Group’s operations or strategy.
We maintain insurance providing for the medical treatment and evacuation of personnel in the 
event of an act of war or terrorism. Corporately we do not currently against such events in view 
of the costs of so doing, considering this as a risk that investors are prepared to take if they 
invest in the Company.
Price and currency movements
The risk of movements in oil and gas prices 
or currencies adversely impacting profits and 
cash flow.
The Group sells all its oil and gas production on the spot market: there are no long-term price 
contracts in place. The Board considers that investors in the Company wish to retain exposure 
to oil and gas price movements, so will only undertake price hedging if available funds would 
be insufficient to finance planned expenditure in the event of a material price downturn.
The Group maintains some cash balances in currencies other than US Dollars to cover 
expenditure commitments in these currencies.
Retention of key staff
The risk of defection of key staff as a result of 
higher financial inducement.
The Group aims to pay competitively and undertakes an annual benchmarking exercise to 
ensure that remuneration is in line with market rates. Remuneration includes a significant 
performance-based component and participation in share incentive schemes extends 
throughout the Group.
We also aim to provide a challenging but fulfilling working environment so that pay is not the 
only determinant of job satisfaction.
Operational
Oilfield accident
The risk of a blow-out or other control-of-well 
incident leading to damage to people, 
property or environment.
The Group has implemented comprehensive health and safety procedures in Syria and has 
recently hired a full-time HSE manager. To date no lost-time incidents have occurred. 
Insurance is maintained for repair to structures and for the control and redrill of wells, as well 
as for third party liabilities.
Natural disaster
The principal risk is that of hurricanes in the 
Gulf of Mexico impacting our US business as 
occurred in 2008.
Until 2009 the Group insured its Gulf of Mexico properties against damage from hurricanes, 
but in the wake of the 2008 hurricane season the cost of such insurance became prohibitively 
high and so the Group did not insure against windstorm risk in 2009.
In any event, the majority of the economic cost to the Group from the 2008 hurricanes arose 
because damage to third party infrastructure caused production to be shut-in for an extended 
period: a risk against which it is impossible to insure at an economic cost.

Reputational
Fraud and corruption
The risk that actions by an employee or 
business associate damage the Group’s 
reputation or result in a financial cost.
Risk Mitigation
Exploration failure
The risk that an exploration well is found not 
to contain commercial quantities of 
hydrocarbons.
Exploration is an inherently risky business, where the risk of failure on any one well is usually 
significantly greater than the chance of success. Risk is mitigated by careful geological and 
petrophysical analysis prior to drilling, often involving the acquisition of 3D seismic data. 
The cost of failure is mitigated in Syria by the fact that operations are land-based so the cost of 
a well is comparatively low, as well as by the fact that exploration costs within Block 26 are 
recoverable against existing production under the terms of the PSC, meaning that the net cost 
of a well to the Contractor group is only 35% of its gross cost.
Partner approval
The risk that the a joint venture partner does 
not approve the Group’s operational or 
budgetary plans.
In Syria the Group has a 50% interest in the Block 26 joint venture and acts as operator, with 
the other 50% being held by Sinochem. Because the Group does not hold outright majority 
voting powers it is possible in certain circumstances for a partner to block decisions. This is 
mitigated by intensive efforts to communicate our strategy and plans to our partner and to 
address their concerns, with the fall-back that we retain the option to carry out an operation 
on a sole-risk basis if approval is not forthcoming.
Equipment availability
The risk of necessary equipment such as rigs 
not being available when required.
The US sanctions regime against Syria has resulted in the Group not being able to source 
goods and services from US companies. However, to date this has not proved a constraint as 
we have always been able to procure from non-US sources. For key equipment such as drilling 
rigs the procurement process is begun well in advance of the need crystallising, in order to 
minimise any delays.
Financial
Cost control
The risk of costs exceeding budget through 
inadequate cost control.
A detailed expenditure control framework is in place involving clear limits on expenditure 
authority and frequent reporting of costs and commitments against budget. Particular 
emphasis is placed on controlling expenditure at the pre-commitment stage.
Liquidity and funding
The risk of insufficient short-term funds being 
available to meet commitments or long-term 
funds to finance capital projects.
The Group maintains significant balances in cash or short-term money market funds. At 
present there are no bank lines of credit available to the Group given that the appetite for 
Syrian country exposure among international banks remains limited, but it is our intention to 
put in place such lines of credit as and when the situation eases.
We place great importance on cultivating relations with the investor community and with 
research analysts in order to ensure that the market is receptive to our story should the need 
to raise further equity arise.
The Group has a detailed policy on Conduct of Business and Ethics which establishes clear 
guidelines for relationships with officials and suppliers, and which has been circulated 
internally. In addition a whistleblowing policy is in place allowing employees who become 
aware of an incident of fraud or corruption to report it safely to the appropriate person.

Committed to supporting  
the community
Corporate Social Responsibility is among 
the core values of the Group and 
protecting those values is a key business 
priority. 
Gulfsands has a policy of promoting high 
standards of corporate social responsibility 
(“CSR”) and the Group is well recognised for 
its efforts in supporting the communities in 
which we operate.
 
The Directors interact on a regular basis with 
the Company’s shareholders and we are 
pleased to acknowledge their backing for our 
initiatives to support the interests of our other 
stakeholders in the communities in which we 
operate. We believe that the combination of 
responsible corporate policies, the support of 
local social development programmes and 
the conduct of our operations in a manner 
that ensures a sustainable business and 
social environment, will help us create a 
thriving business. Through these activities we 
strive to earn the respect of the host 
governments and the people of the 
communities in which we operate, which can 
only assist us in lowering the Group’s risk 
profile generally and in achieving our overall 
business development objectives. 
Working within this framework, Gulfsands 
has achieved recognition for its business 
ethics and social responsibility and for 
providing a safe, reliable and enjoyable 
working environment for our employees. 
Health and safety
We continue to focus management and 
financial resources on extending our excellent 
health, safety and environment (“HSE”) 
record. During 2009, a very busy period in 
our history, we completed the expansion of 
the early production facility at the Khurbet 
East field and over 21,000 metres of drilling 
carried out over almost 300 days, all with 
zero lost-time incidents. This excellent record 
is a reflection of our commitment to 
preparation, training and inspection 
programmes designed to ensure our staff are 
able to work with the level of safety and 
efficiency that we and our stakeholders 
expect from our operations. 
Community and labour relations
Our interaction with the communities of the 
regions in which we operate has assisted us 
to quickly identify newly emerging local risks 
affecting our business. For example, at our 
operations on Block 26, Syria, this has been 
reflected in the construction of the new oil 
transport pipeline that will shortly replace our 
existing trucking operation, resulting in a 
safer and more efficient means of 
transportation. This is a good example of 
how we’ve been able to take an initiative that 
helps the local community and, with support 
from the Syrian Government, the General 
Petroleum Corporation and the Syrian 
Petroleum Company, deliver a good outcome 
for the local community which has the added 
benefit of improving the overall efficiency and 
profitability of our operations. 
Wherever sensibly possible to do so, we 
draw upon the skills available within the local 
communities in which we operate, and we 
have also been especially successful in 
attracting experienced and foreign trained 
expatriate Syrians to return to Syria to work 
with us and pass on their skills and 
experience. Consequently the vast majority of 
the people who work for our Group, whether 
in Syria or elsewhere, are nationals of the 
respective country in which we are operating. 
Employee training
Our employees are provided with access and 
encouragement to undertake technical 
training to the highest international standards 
and during the course of 2009 various 
members of our staff, particularly those 
working for us in Syria, have participated in 
advanced training programmes in many 
countries including the UK, the US, France, 
China, Croatia and Egypt. Gulfsands is well 
recognised locally for the efforts it has made 
to train local Syrians and is considered an 
employer of choice by for those graduating 
from Syria’s universities.
Gulfsands has achieved 
recognition for its business ethics 
and social responsibility and for 
providing a safe, reliable and 
enjoyable working environment for 
our employees.

We have recently begun to work with the 
General Petroleum Corporation, the Syrian 
Government’s organisation charged with the 
responsibility of regulating and administering 
the oil and gas sector, to engage and, where 
appropriate, train a number of Syrian 
graduate geologists and engineers who have 
commenced working with the Syrian 
Petroleum Company. This joint programme 
has already provided our Group with a 
number of skilled employees and as the pool 
of highly trained technical staff continues  
to expand through this initiative, we expect  
to be able to hire many more of these 
talented individuals. 
 
Support for charitable causes
During 2009 Gulfsands expanded its 
commitment to support financially a number 
of social and charitable organisations active 
in the national, regional and local 
communities where we operate. As the 
principal focus of our operations is in Syria, 
we have focused the majority of our effort in 
supporting programmes that are directed at 
improving the lives of children and 
disadvantaged members of Syrian society.
Syria is a relatively young nation with 
approximately 22% of the population 
between the ages of 15 and 24, either in the 
latter stages of their education or seeking 
employment for the first time. Following the 
President’s well regarded initiative to expand 
public sector investment in education through 
the establishment of private secondary and 
tertiary institutions, there has been significant 
growth in the number of children attending 
and going on to graduate from secondary 
schools and universities throughout the 
country. The government is therefore 
targeting initiatives in partnership with the 
private sector to help reduce unemployment 
levels among skilled young people. 
Education
Gulfsands is working with a number of private 
sector sponsored organisations whose 
principal objectives are the provision of 
education support for the young and 
disadvantaged members of Syria’s society 
and the development of business and life 
skills. These programmes will help young 
people stay in the education system longer 
so that they graduate with the kind of higher 
level skills required for better paid jobs or for 
starting their own businesses.
Many of these initiatives such as FIRDOS, 
BIDAYA, SHABAB and the Syrian Young 
Scholars Programme are directed at 
providing access to education and 
educational infrastructure. Examples include 
mobile libraries, computers and internet 
connectivity for rural communities, micro 
finance and technical and mentoring 
assistance for the development of self 
sustaining micro-businesses for young 
people and women in rural communities. 
These programmes have been shown to  
be effective in reducing poverty levels that 
currently average about 15%. 
Gulfsands encourages its staff to personally 
volunteer their assistance and financial 
support for these organisations, most of 
which have developed extensive networks of 
volunteers. This personal support provides 
additional leverage for the financial 
contributions provided by Gulfsands.
Handicapped children
Gulfsands and its management and staff also 
support other organisations working to 
improve the lives of sick and handicapped 
children, especially in the countryside areas 
outside Damascus.
We currently provide financial support for 
BANA, which educates and provides support 
for blind children, AAMAL, the Syrian 
association for the disabled, the Syrian 
Association for Autistic Children, which 
provides teaching and support facilities for 
children with learning difficulties, the Light 
and Flowers Centre for Cerebral Palsy, which 
provides education and teaching facilities for 
children, and the Syria Trust for Development 
which provides infrastructure and offers 
professional support to approximately 
80 NGOs working in Syria, as well as a 
number of other worthy organisations.
Child healthcare
Gulfsands is a significant supporter of 
BASMA, a voluntary organisation dedicated 
to providing support for children with cancer, 
Corporate social responsibility

During 2009, Gulfsands

particularly among the under-privileged. 
Gulfsands was the principal financial sponsor 
for the 16 bed BASMA paediatric oncology 
wing of the Al-Buruni University Hospital in 
Damascus, Syria’s first paediatric oncology 
unit, which was officially opened by BASMA’s 
patron and Syria’s First Lady, Mrs Asma 
Al-Asaad, in September 2009. The facility 
had been accepting patients since April 2009 
and is manned by 38 medical professionals. 
In 2009 it accepted 96 children as inpatients, 
handled almost 500 admissions and dealt 
with almost 1,000 outpatient visits, providing 
a level and quality of medical support and 
treatment for children that was previously 
unavailable in the country.
Gulfsands’ financial assistance coupled with 
the tireless efforts of a team of volunteers that 
includes a number of Gulfsands employees, 
has enabled BASMA to expand its support 
for children with cancer to the Haematology 
and Oncology Unit at the larger Children’s 
Hospital in Damascus. It also subsidises the 
oncology drugs that BASMA imports into 
Syria and makes available through its 
pharmacies now established at the Al-Buruni 
facility and at the Children’s Hospital. 
Through these initiatives approximately 430 
children received treatment during 2009, 
bringing the number to almost 1,700 who 
have received BASMA supported treatment, 
including 50 children treated outside of Syria, 
since the organisation was established three 
years ago. 
 
Summary
We are delighted that the financial 
contribution we have made to these 
organisations has enabled them to make 
significant progress with their ambitions to 
improve the lives of Syria’s people. Combined 
with the volunteering efforts and personal 
financial contributions of many of our staff, 
these initiatives have enhanced the reputation 
that the Group enjoys in Syria for corporate 
citizenship, responsiveness to issues 
affecting the communities in which we 
operate, and respect for the privileged 
position we enjoy as operators of Block 26 in 
north east Syria.
In expanding our business activities within 
Syria and beyond, we will look to build on our 
strong record of corporate social 
responsibility. Gulfsands’ Board of Directors 
is committed to building on our early 
initiatives in Syria and Iraq so as to create a 
legacy from our presence in Syria and 
eventually Iraq that includes the sustainable 
long-term economic development of the local 
communities where we operate.
Maintaining a strong record of achievement 
for corporate social responsibility will ensure 
we remain welcome operators in Syria while 
also providing an important reference of our 
record in this area of increasing importance 
to the governments we are dealing with in 
seeking new business opportunities in Iraq 
and other countries in the region.

the Company was listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s principal activity is that of oil and gas production, exploration and development. The Group has development and exploration 
projects in the Syrian Arab Republic and a non-operated portfolio of producing oil and gas properties in the USA (offshore Gulf of Mexico

Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group
The business of oil and gas exploration involves a high degree of risk which a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation 
may not be able to prevent. The Board has established a process for identifying and evaluating the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group and a summary of these risks and uncertainties, together with measures taken to mitigate them, is contained on pages 26 – 27. 
Suppliers’ payment policy
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Group 
and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. The Group’s average creditors’ payment period 
at 31 December 2009 was 34 days.
Risk management objectives and policies
Gulfsands’ approach to financial risk management is described in the Financial Review on pages 22 – 25 and in the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties section on pages 26 – 27. Further disclosure is made in note 26 to the Financial Statements including the Group’s exposure 
to price, credit, liquidity and currency risk. 
Political and charitable contributions
There were no political contributions made by the Group during the years ended 31 December 2009 and 2008. The Group has a policy of 
making social contributions in its areas of operations where it will impact directly in the local communities. Further details are included in 
the Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 31 and 35. Approximately $238,000 was provided to community programmes 
undertaken in Syria during 2009 (2008: $175,000).
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 27 May 2010 at 11am. The Notice of the Meeting, which sets out the resolutions 
to be proposed, accompanies this Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, financial performance, financial position and risks are set out in the Operations review and the Financial 
review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and resources are detailed in these reviews and further details 
are included in the financial statements. The Group has significant cash resources, no debt and forecasts surplus cash being generated 
in 2010 and the first half of 2011. After making appropriate enquiries and examining those areas which could give rise to financial 
exposure the Directors are satisfied that no material or significant exposures exist and that the Group and Company has adequate 
resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future despite the current uncertain economic environment. For this reason the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Information to shareholders
The Group has its own website (www.gulfsands.com) for the purposes of improving information flow to shareholders and potential 
investors.

Statement of responsibilities of those charged with governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable •	
information;
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand •	
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance; and 
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. •	
The Directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and the dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of disclosures to the auditors
So far as the Directors, at the time of approval of their report, are aware:
there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and •	
each Director has taken steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to •	
establish that the auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Auditors
During the year the Directors appointed Deloitte LLP as auditors of the Company to replace UHY Hacker Young. A resolution to reappoint 
Deloitte LLP as auditors and that the Directors be authorised to fix their remuneration will be put to shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting.

Directors’ corporate governance 
report
Gulfsands Petroleum plc is committed to meeting high standards 
of corporate governance and acting responsibly in all the 
Company’s business activities. The Company is committed to 
maintaining throughout the Group the highest standards of 
business conduct and ethics, as well as full compliance with all 
applicable government laws, rules and regulations, corporate 
reporting and disclosure, accounting practices, accounting 
controls, auditing practices and other matters relating to fraud 
against shareholders.
The Company has established appropriate subcommittees, 
adopted an Audit Committee Charter, a Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics, a Whistleblower Policy and has also 
established a formal Health, Safety & Environment (“HSE”) Policy.
Audit committee
The Audit Committee meets at least twice each year to discuss 
the review of the interim financial statements and the audit of the 
year-end Financial Statements. For the annual results the 
independent auditors are invited to discuss the conclusions arising 
from their audit and their assessment of the Group’s internal 
controls. The Audit Committee also reviews annually, in detail, the 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group prior to the submission of 
the annual risk report to the Board. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee is Andrew West and the other participating members 
of the committee are David Cowan and Kenneth Judge.
The activities of the Audit Committee are governed by an Audit 
Committee Charter which addresses the mandate of the 
Committee, its composition, independence and expertise of the 
members, frequency of meetings, roles and responsibilities which 
include oversight of the external audit function, internal controls, 
financial reporting, and the provision by the auditors of non-audit 
services. The Audit Committee has the power to engage such 
external advisers as it deems necessary to discharge its 
responsibilities.
Remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee meets at least once per year and is 
responsible for setting the remuneration of the Board of Directors, 
including any pension and share incentive plan awards, and for 
establishing guidelines for the remuneration of staff in general, with 
closer scrutiny of the remuneration of senior management. The 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is David Cowan and the 
other participating member is Andrew West.
Code of business conduct and ethics
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics which addresses the workplace environment (including 
non-discrimination, harassment, substance abuse, violence and 
employment of family members), HSE, relationships with third 
parties (including conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, 
competitive practices, supplier and contractor relationships, public 
relations and governmental relations), legal compliance, 
information and records, use and misuse of company assets and 
reporting of violations. 
 
Whistleblower policy
The Company has adopted a Whistleblower Policy. Pursuant to its 
charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that a 
confidential and anonymous process exists whereby persons can 
report any matter relating to the Company and its subsidiaries 
which, in the view of the complainant, is illegal, unethical, contrary 
to the policies of the Company or in some other manner not right 
or proper.
All Directors, officers, employees, consultants and contractors of 
the Company and its subsidiaries are made aware of the Policy 
and a copy of the Policy has been distributed to Directors, officers 
and employees. All Directors, officers and employees will be 
informed whenever significant changes are made and new 
Directors, officers and employees will be provided with a copy of 
this Policy and educated about its importance.
Health, Safety & Environment (“HSE”) policy 
A primary goal of the Group is the protection of Health, Safety and 
Environment (“HSE”). The Group is dedicated to continuous efforts 
to make its operations compatible with protecting people, property 
and the environment.
This policy, whose implementation is overseen by the Chief 
Executive Officer, governs the Group’s operations and is 
specifically designed to:
comply with and exceed relevant HSE legislation, regulations •	
and other requirements;
maintain and develop systems to identify, assess, monitor, •	
review and control HSE issues;
set HSE objectives and targets; •	
implement mechanisms to communicate with and to obtain •	
input from employees, contractors, partners and associates;
coordinate HSE policy, including the HSE management •	
systems of contractors, to provide a unified system to guide 
operations; and
institute a site-specific Emergency Response Procedure •	
(“ERP”) so that immediate actions are taken, without delay, to 
minimize danger to personnel, the environment and property. 
ERPs will be rehearsed prior to commencing operations to 
ensure that personnel make the appropriate responses in the 
event of emergency.
It is the policy of the Group to consider the health and welfare of 
employees by maintaining a safe place and system of work as 
required by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.
The Group closely monitors activities to ensure to the best of its 
knowledge there is not potential for any such breach. There have 
been no convictions in relation to breaches of these Acts recorded 
against the Group during the reporting year.
 
Regular board meetings
The Board of Directors holds scheduled Board Meetings 
approximately six times per year plus such other ad-hoc meetings 
as are deemed necessary to deal with urgent business matters.

Directors’ remuneration 
report
This report has been prepared having regard to Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006, which 
requires the Auditors to report to a company’s shareholders on the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report and to state 
whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections 
for audited and unaudited information. 
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders. 
Unaudited information
Remuneration Policy
Up to and including the end of the 2008 financial year no remuneration policy was in place for Directors or staff. No formal appraisals of 
staff performance were carried out, and no formal studies had been undertaken to ensure that the remuneration of key staff was 
competitive with their industry peer group.
Bonuses paid to Directors in 2009 represented contractually agreed amounts upon the completion of one year’s service. There are no 
further such bonuses payable.
During 2009 the Board engaged Hewitt New Bridge Street as remuneration consultants to review the Group’s remuneration structure 
generally, to undertake a benchmarking exercise for Directors and senior staff, and to make recommendations regarding bonus and 
share incentive plan structure and policy going forward.
A new Remuneration Policy was adopted during the year, which provided for, inter alia, formal annual reviews of individual staff 
performance and goal-setting, the establishment of bands of eligible bonus and share plan awards relative to salary for each separate 
grade of employee (with the actual award within these bands being determined on merit), and the benchmarking of remuneration against 
peer group comparables at least once every two years. 
A new Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) was established to complement the existing Share Option Plan (“SOP”): the intention being that 
future share incentive awards for all but the most senior staff should be in the form of restricted (deferred) shares and that share option 
awards be confined only to directors and the most senior staff. This will reduce the dilution to shareholders arising from future share 
incentive awards. Whereas the Company’s general practice in the past had been for all share incentive awards to vest immediately, under 
the Remuneration Policy future awards under the RSP or SOP will have a vesting period except in exceptional circumstances.

In addition to the above, in 2005 the Group entered into an agreement with Mr Dorrier and Mr DeCort to bear the interest payable to the 
Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America (“IRS”) on taxable gains arising as a result of the acquisition of Gulfsands 
Petroleum Limited by Gulfsands Petroleum Plc prior to the listing of the Company on the AIM market, but rolled over as permitted under 
the IRS rules. This interest became payable upon the disposal by Mr Dorrier and Mr DeCort of shares in Gulfsands Petroleum Plc, which 
occurred during 2009. This interest, and the tax thereon, equates to approximately $427,000 in respect of Mr Dorrier and $313,000 in 
respect of Mr DeCort and was paid in January 2010.
In addition to the remuneration shown above the Group incurred share based payment charges of $824,000 (2008: $10,725,000) in 
respect of the above named Directors.

to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of responsibilities of those 
charged with governance in the Directors report, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s (“APB’s”) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs
Gulfsands Petroleum Plc is a public limited company listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange 
and incorporated in the United Kingdom. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) is that of oil and gas 
production, exploration, and development.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 29 March 
2010 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Richard Malcolm and Andrew Rose.
The Company’s and Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in note 3 below.
2. Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and correction of errors in prior periods
The Company’s and Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 and for the comparative year ended  
31 December 2008 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group has restated the income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements as reported for prior periods. In prior periods 
the Group had erroneously classified certain repair costs as capital expenditure for its Gulf of Mexico assets for the periods ended 
31 December 2006 to 31 December 2008. As a consequence depletion, impairment costs and other costs of sales recorded in these 
periods have been misstated. Further details of these restatements are shown in note 30. In addition the Group has restated certain cash 
flows relating to capital investments from operating activities to investing activities within the Consolidated cash flow statement.
3. Significant accounting policies
3.1 Basis of preparation and accounting standards
The Group’s significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union and, except for share-based payments, under the historical cost convention. They have also been 
prepared on the ‘going concern’ basis of accounting for the reasons set out in the ‘Going concern’ section of the Directors’ report. 
These financial statements consolidate the accounts of Gulfsands Petroleum Plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to  
31 December each year. 
In the Group financial statements, merged subsidiary undertakings are treated as if they had always been a member of the Group. The 
results of such subsidiaries are included for the whole year in the year they join the Group. 
3.2 Basis of consolidation 
Intra-group sales, profits and balances are eliminated fully on consolidation.
The results of other subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date when control passed. Acquisitions 
are accounted for under the purchase method, under which purchase consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities on the basis 
of fair value at the date of acquisition.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiary undertakings when the Company has the power to exercise, or 
actually exercises, dominant influence or control over the undertaking. 
The Group is engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production through incorporated and unincorporated joint ventures 
(together “Jointly Controlled Entities”). The Group accounts for its share of the results and net assets of these Jointly Controlled Entities 
using the proportional consolidation method. 
No individual income statement is presented in respect of the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The 
Company’s loss for the year was $3,745,000 (2008: loss of $19,375,000). There are no items of comprehensive income of the Company 
not included in the loss noted above.
3.3 Reporting currency
These financial statements are presented in US Dollars. The Company’s operations and the majority of all costs associated with foreign 
operations are paid in US Dollars and not the local currency of the operations. Therefore the presentational and functional currency of the 
Company and of the Group, and the functional currency of all subsidiaries, is the US Dollar. Gains and losses from foreign currency 
transactions, if any, are recognised in the income statement for the year. The effective exchange rate to the Pound Sterling at 31 
December 2009 was £1: $1.66 (2008: £1: $1.45).

3.4 Oil and gas assets
The Group applies the requirements of IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources” and where additional guidance is 
needed IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” and IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” noting that several items in the latter two standards 
are exempted for assets at the exploration and evaluation stage due to the application of IFRS 6. Set out below is our interpretation of the 
principles set out in IFRS 6 and other IFRSs.
There are two categories of oil and gas assets, exploration and evaluation assets which are included in Intangible assets, and 
development and production assets which are included in Property, plant and equipment. 
Oil and gas assets: exploration and evaluation
Recognition and measurement
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) assets consist of costs of license acquisition, exploration, evaluation, appraisal and development 
activities and evaluating oil and gas properties. The cost of E&E assets includes capitalised overheads relevant to the exploration and 
evaluation up to the point of commercial discovery. Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area (pre-license 
costs) are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred and are not included in E&E assets. E&E costs are 
accumulated and capitalised into cost pools and added to Intangible assets pending determination of commercial reserves. 
E&E assets relating to each exploration license/prospect are not amortised but are carried forward until the existence or otherwise of 
commercial reserves has been determined. If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for 
impairment on a cash generating unit basis as set out below and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. The 
carrying value of the E&E assets, after any impairment loss, is then reclassified as development and production assets in property, plant 
and equipment. 
Impairment
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable 
amount. Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist.
Where the E&E assets concerned fall within the scope of a cash generating unit, the E&E assets are tested for impairment together with 
all development and production assets associated within the cash generating unit. The aggregate carrying value is compared against the 
expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived 
from production of commercial reserves. Where the E&E assets to be tested fall outside the scope of a cash generating unit, there will 
generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets concerned will generally be written off in full. 
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is separately disclosed. In the balance sheet it is recorded against the 
carrying value of the related E&E asset. 
Oil and gas assets: development and production
Tangible oil and gas assets are grouped into a cash generating unit or groups of units for purposes of impairment testing and for 
depreciating the development and production assets. A cash generating unit is the smallest unit that does not have inter-related revenues 
and may be a well, field, area, block, region, or other defined area as appropriate. Inter-relationships can be measured by oil and gas 
production agreements, geological analysis, or other documentation showing such relationships. The only limitation in the size of a cash 
generating unit is that it cannot be larger than an operating segment of the Group.
Recognition and measurement
Development and production assets are accumulated on a cash generating unit basis and represent the cost of developing the 
commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial 
reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable 
overheads, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depletion of producing assets
Expenditure within each cash generating unit is depleted by a unit of production method using the ratio of oil and gas production in the 
year compared to the estimated quantity of commercial reserves at the beginning of the year. Costs used in the unit of production 
calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs for proved and probable 
reserves. Changes in estimates of commercial reserves or future development costs are dealt with prospectively.
Impairment
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that 
the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The aggregate carrying value is compared 
against the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows 
expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.

3. Significant accounting policies continued
3.5 Decommissioning 
Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a field exists, a 
provision for decommissioning is recognised. The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future expenditure determined in 
accordance with local conditions and requirements. A fixed asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created (included in 
development and production assets) and depleted on a unit of production basis. Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively, with 
corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated fixed asset. 
3.6 Definition of reserves
The Group’s definition of reserves is in accordance and consistent with the 2007 Petroleum Resources Management System, as 
prepared by the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”) and reviewed and jointly sponsored by 
the World Petroleum Council (“WPC”), the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation 
Engineers. The estimation of Proved (“1P”), Proved plus Probable (“2P”) and Proved plus Probable plus Possible (“3P”) commercially 
recoverable reserves are performed utilising relevant geological, geophysical and engineering data and with reference to the use of the 
probabilistic methodology as approved by SPE / WPC. The reserves are verified by a certified independent expert.
Proved plus Probable (2P) entitlement reserves are utilised as the basis for the Group’s calculations of depletion and impairment as these 
represent the Group’s estimate of the most likely commercially recoverable reserves as per the approved probabilistic methodology.
3.7 Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for 
impairment. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their 
useful lives of between two and five years.
3.8 Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets 
Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. 
Amortisation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of 
between two and five years. Amortisation is included with depreciation and classified as cost of sales or administrative expenses as 
appropriate. No intangible assets other than oil and gas assets have indefinite lives.
3.9 Revenue recognition
Sales revenue represents amounts invoiced exclusive of sales related taxes and royalties for the Group’s share of oil and gas sales in the 
year. Oil and gas sales are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective rate applicable.
3.10 Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
3.11 Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
The liability method is used in accounting for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined 
based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted, or 
substantively enacted, tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The recoverability of deferred 
tax assets is evaluated annually and an impairment provision is provided if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not give 
rise to future benefits in the Group’s tax returns.
3.12 Derivative financial instruments
The Group has in the past used forward crude oil and gas sales contracts and swaps to reduce exposure to fluctuations in the price of 
crude oil and natural gas in order to reduce the volatility of the cash flows of the Group. Contracts are only entered into to hedge physical 
positions related to the Group’s crude oil and natural gas production and are accordingly accounted for as hedge transactions. The 
Group has not entered into any such contracts during any of the periods presented.
3.13 Share-based payments
The Company has made equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and directors by way of issues of share options. The fair 
value of these payments is calculated at grant date by the Company using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model excluding the effect of 
non market-based vesting conditions. The expense is recognised on a straight line basis over the period from the date of award to the date 
of vesting, based on the Company’s best estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the 
Company revises its estimates of the number of options expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. 
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payments reserve.

3.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost and comprise cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand by 
banks and other short term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Balances held in bank accounts subject to 
escrow agreements as collateral for performance bonds issued are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and are shown as long 
term financial assets.
3.15 Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions of individual companies within the Group are translated to the functional and reporting currency of  
US Dollars at the rates prevailing when the transactions occurred. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement.
3.16 Investments
The Parent Company’s investments in subsidiary companies are included in the Company balance sheet at cost, less provision for any 
impairment. 
3.17 Inventories
Inventories comprise materials and equipment, which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs 
incurred in bringing the materials and equipment to its present condition and location.
3.18 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amounts less any provision made for impairment of receivables. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the debt.
3.19 Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal values.
3.20 Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company being any instruments with a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all 
its liabilities, are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
4. New IFRS standards and interpretations
In preparing the financial statements of the Group for the current year, the Group has adopted the following pronouncements of the IASB 
for the first time. These pronouncements have not had a material impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” was issued in October 2006 and defines operating segments as components of an entity about which •	
separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate 
resources and in assessing performance. The new standard sets out the required disclosures for operating segments and is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The new standard has had no impact on the Group’s reported income or net assets.  
The required disclosures are set out in note 6.
In September 2007 the IASB issued Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” – A Revised Presentation, which •	
requires separate presentation of owner and non-owner changes in equity by introducing the statement of comprehensive income. 
Whenever there is a restatement or reclassification, an additional balance sheet, as at the beginning of the earliest period presented, 
will be required to be published. The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. There has 
been no effect on the Group’s reported income or net assets from the adoption of IAS 1 Revised.
The financial statements have been prepared after adopting the following pronouncements from the IASB which have no effect on either 
the reported results and financial position or the presentation or disclosure within the financial statements.
IAS 23 (revised 2007) Borrowing Costs   The principal change to the standard was to eliminate the option to 
expense all borrowing costs when incurred. This change has had no 
impact on these financial statements because the Group has no 
material borrowing costs.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation   The revisions to IAS 32 amend the criteria for debt/equity 
and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Puttable   classification. The Group has no such financial instruments.  
Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation 
Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition   The amendments provide clarification on two aspects of hedge 
and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items  accounting. The Group has no such hedged items.

4. New IFRS standards and interpretations continued
Embedded Derivatives (Amendments to IFRIC 9   The amendments clarify the accounting for embedded derivatives in 
Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives and IAS 39   light of IAS 39. The Group has no such embedded derivatives. 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement)
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation   The interpretation provides guidance on detailed requirements for net 
investment hedging. The Group has no such hedging.
The following pronouncements from the IASB will become effective for future financial reporting periods and have not yet been adopted 
by the Group.
In January 2008 the IASB issued a revised version of IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”. The revised standard still requires the purchase •	
method of accounting to be applied to business combinations but will introduce some changes to existing accounting treatment. For 
example, contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently remeasured to fair value with 
changes recognised in profit or loss. Goodwill may be calculated based on the parent’s share of net assets or it may include goodwill 
related to the minority interest. All transaction costs are expensed. The standard is applicable to business combinations occurring in 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and the Group plans to adopt it with effect from 1 January 2010. Assets and 
liabilities arising from business combinations occurring before the date of adoption by the Group will not be restated and thus there will 
be no effect on the Group’s reported income or net assets on adoption. 
Also in January 2008 the IASB issued an amended version of IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements”. This requires •	
the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. Such transactions 
will no longer result in goodwill or gains or losses. When control is lost, any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value 
and a gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and is 
to be applied retrospectively, with certain exceptions. The Group plans to adopt the amendment with effect from 1 January 2010 and 
does not expect there to be any effect on the Group’s reported income or net assets. 
There are no other standards and interpretations in issue but not yet adopted that the Directors anticipate will have a material effect on 
the reported income or net assets of the Group. 
5. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are set out in note 3, the Directors have made the following judgements 
and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The 
estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year are discussed below.
a) Intangible oil and gas exploration and evaluation costs
Costs capitalised as intangible assets are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying value may exceed its 
recoverable value. This assessment involves judgement as to the (i) likely commerciality of the assets, and (ii) future revenues and costs 
pertaining and the discount rate to be applied for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value.
b) Decommissioning
The Group has decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests in the Gulf of Mexico. The full extent to which the 
provision is required depends on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the costs and timing of any decommissioning 
works and the discount rate applied to such costs. The Group has received a report from external specialist decommissioning experts 
regarding the cost of future works. The timing of these works is inherently uncertain and depends upon the determination of the end of 
commercial production. The Group has utilised the expected useful lives in the year end reserves report to estimate the timing of 
decommissioning liabilities. A risk free interest rate of 4% (2008: 6%) has been used to discount the expected costs of decommissioning. 
c) Oil and gas development and production assets and reserves
Oil and gas development and production assets held in property, plant and equipment are depleted on a unit of production basis 
calculated by reference to Proved and Probable (“2P”) reserves. The Group’s 2P reserves take the estimated future cost of developing 
and extracting those reserves into account.
Future forecast capital expenditure associated with developing proved and probable reserves is included in the cost base for the 
purposes of calculating depletion charges. 2P reserves are determined using estimates of oil and gas in place, recovery factors and 
future oil and gas prices. The carrying amount of oil and gas assets therefore depends upon a number of estimates at year end.
The level of 2P reserves is also a key determinant in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Group’s oil and gas assets have 
been impaired.
6. Total revenue and segmental information
The total revenue of the Group, as defined by IAS 18, for 2009 was $84,741,000 (2008: $54,833,000) comprising sales of hydrocarbons 
and incidental income of $84,415,000 (2008: $53,600,000) and interest income of $326,000 (2008: $1,233,000).
As described in note 4, the Group adopted IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” during the year. The adoption of IFRS 8 did not result in any 
changes to the segments required to be disclosed.

Transactions between segments include management fees and are charged at estimated prevailing market prices.
7. Share-based payments
The charge for the period is based upon the requirements of IFRS 2 regarding share-based payments. For this purpose, the weighted 
average estimated fair value of the share options granted was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected 
average option life was assumed to be four years. No dividends were factored into the model.
The fair value of options issued in 2009 was $313,000 (2008: $12,587,000). Details of option grants made during the year and 
assumptions included in the calculation of the charge to the income statement are as follows:
      Stock price  Number of 
   Year   at date Exercise options Risk free  
Grant date   options vest   of grant price issued interest rate Volatility
9 February 2009   2009 and 2010  £1.58 £1.86 40,000  2.6% 57.8%
16 February 2009   2009–2011   £1.37 £1.86 250,000  2.2% 57.8%
27 April 2009   2009 and 2010  £1.99 £1.99 20,000  2.3% 62.5%
8 July 2009   2009 and 2010  £1.75 £1.88 75,000  2.7% 35.5%
The estimated fair value of options with a deferred vesting period is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options 
concerned. The estimated fair value of options exercisable immediately is expensed at the time of issuance of the options. Further details 
are provided in note 21.
8. Hurricane repairs
In 2008 Hurricanes Gustav and Ike caused damage to several of the Group’s oil and gas properties and supporting infrastructure in the Gulf 
of Mexico. A charge has been made in these accounts for the full amount of any damage notified by the operators less insurance claim 
refunds that the directors are satisfied are virtually certain to be recoverable. The income statement charge in 2009 reflects increased cost 
notifications from operators received during the year. The amount charged to the Income statement in the year ended 31 December 2009 
was $2,316,000 (2008: $2,750,000).

The depletion for the US oil and gas properties is stated after depletion reversals of $2,317,000 (2008: $415,000). These depletion 
reversals occur on properties that have been substantially depleted in prior years and where subsequent downward revisions to 
decommissioning estimates have been made in years before the actual decommissioning has commenced.
The impairment charges and reversals of impairment charges for 2009 and 2008 relate to provisions against the Group’s carrying values 
of its USA producing assets, following a review of reserves and prevailing oil and gas prices at the year ends. The changes in the market 
price of oil and gas, together with movements in the Proved and Probable reserves on certain fields, has led to a reappraisal of the 
economics of certain fields in the USA. 
Impairment has been assessed, based on a value in use calculation, and using a discount rate of 6% for assets (2008: 6%), a long-term 
oil price of $80/bbl (2008: $70/bbl) and a long-term gas price of $6.00/mcf (2008: $7.00/mcf). In determining the appropriate discount 
rate to be used consideration is given to the risk incorporated in the underlying cash flows.

Included in trade receivables at 31 December 2008 was an amount of $5,096,000 that represented a retention of 20% on the oil sales to 
the Oil Marketing Bureau of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. This retention was released during September 2009 upon 
completion of certain assay tests on the quality of the crude oil delivered from the Khurbet East field. 
No significant trade receivables are classified as past due or considered impaired.
Underlift at 31 December 2009 and 2008 represents the rights to gas revenue receivable as a result of the acquisition of oil and gas 
properties in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2004. Underlift represents a right to future economic benefits (through entitlement to receive 
equivalent future production), which constitutes an asset. During the year ended 31 December 2009 certain underlift balances were sold 
to external parties.  
Amounts due from oil and gas partnerships represents the excess of the Group’s loans and advances to jointly controlled entities over its 
share of the assets less liabilities of those entities.

$24 million (2008: $14 million) of the Group’s unutilised tax losses have expriy dates between 2024 and 2029. The remaining tax losses of 
the Group and the tax losses of the Company have no expiry date.
Deferred tax assets are not provided where the Group does not consider it probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be made to 
offset the deductions represented by those deferred tax assets. In performing this calculation the Group considers deferred tax balances 
relating to each tax authority separately.
20. Provision for decommissioning
The provision for decommissioning relates to the expected present value of costs of plugging and abandoning the oil and gas properties 
held by Gulfsands Petroleum USA, Inc. and Darcy Energy LLC. The provision for decommissioning is estimated after taking account of 
inflation, years to abandonment and an appropriate discount rate. At 31 December 2009, the oil and gas properties have estimated 
plugging and abandonment dates between 2009 and 2024. 
The portion of the provision for decommissioning expected to be settled in 2010, totalling approximately $3.7 million, is included in current 
liabilities and the remainder, totalling approximately $27.9 million, is included in non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at 
31 December 2009.
Actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the decommissioning work required, which will reflect 
market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to 
produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain. 
The actual amounts paid for decommissioning may ultimately vary significantly from the provision at 31 December 2009 requiring 
potentially material adjustments to the carrying value of the obligations.

23. Obligations under operating leases

In addition to the items mentioned above the Group had commitments to make payments under a non-cancellable lease for the provision 
of an oil rig. This lease expires in 2010. At 31 December 2009 the Group had a commitment to make further payments totalling 
approximately $2.7 million (2008: $7.5 million) for the provision of the rig and operating staff. The ultimate timing of these payments will 
depend upon the Group’s drilling programme. 
At the end of the year the Company had commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases in 
respect of land and buildings of $438,000 (2008: $381,000) within one year and $986,000 (2008: $1,238,000) between two and five 
years. This lease is due to expire in 2013. 
24. Commitments 
At 31 December 2009 all exploration expenditure and work programme commitments pertaining to the current exploration period (ending 
August 2010) in Block 26 in Syria had been satisfied in full.
There were no other material obligations or contracts outstanding in relation to ongoing projects not provided for at 31 December 2009 
or 2008.
25. Contingent liabilities
Due to the nature of the Group’s business, some contamination of the real estate property owned or leased by the Group is possible. 
Environmental site assessments of the property would be necessary to adequately determine remediation costs, if any. The Directors do 
not consider the amounts that would result from any environmental site assessments to be significant to the financial position or results of 
operations of the Group. Accordingly, except for the provision made against decommissioning costs (note 20), no further provision for 
potential remediation costs is required.
26. Financial instruments, derivatives and capital management of the Group
Risk assessment
The Group’s oil and gas activities are subject to a range of financial risks, as described below, which can significantly impact  
its performance.
Liquidity risk
At 31 December 2009 the Group had sufficient funds available to progress its exploration portfolio and projected requirements for the 
development of existing reserves. At the end of the year the Group had cash in hand of $57.6 million, and further bank balances of $12.0 
million held in escrow to cover expected decommissioning liabilities.
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced frequently. These are reviewed regularly by management 
and the Board to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least 12 months. At present the Group has no loan facilities in 
place and has no obvious need for such facilities based upon its current projects in hand and its available cash resources. However, this 
position will continually be reviewed in the light of developments with existing projects and new project opportunities as they arise. 
Currency risk
The Group has currency exposure arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the 
Company and all its subsidiaries, US Dollars. These transactions relate predominantly to certain costs of its Syrian operations which are 
denominated in Syrian Pounds and Euro, and its head office costs which are denominated in Pounds Sterling. 
Although sales of crude oil by the Group’s Syrian operations are invoiced in US Dollars, payment is made in Euro according to the exchange 
rate pertaining between US Dollars and Euro shortly before the payment is made. The Group manages any further risk through the use of 
short-term foreign currency forward contracts of not more than 10 days duration. Each contract is entered into with the aim of exactly 
covering any foreign currency risk on Euro receivables. There was no significant contract in place as at 31 December 2009 or 2008.

26. Financial instruments, derivatives and capital management of the Group continued
Costs incurred in Euro in the Syrian operations are recoverable under the terms of the Production Sharing Contract at the rate of 
exchange between US Dollars and Euro at the date of payment.
The Group maintains part of its cash balances in Pounds Sterling to defray head office costs.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to changes in the US Dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, on the 
Group’s profit before tax and the Group’s equity.

2009         (+ or –) 5% 505
2008         (+ or –) 5% 660 
Credit risk
In the USA the Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. The Group manages the exposures to credit risk by 
performing credit evaluations on all of their major customers requiring credit.
In Syria, the Group’s share of crude oil is sold to the Oil Marketing Bureau of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. Management 
believe that the counter-party risk is low and similar to the sovereign risk of Syria. 
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to 
reduce debt. 
The Group considers capital to be its equity reserves. At the current stage of the Group’s life cycle, the Group’s objective in managing its 
capital is to ensure funds raised meet the exploration expenditure commitments. 
The Group ensures it is meeting its objectives by reviewing its KPIs and other management information to ensure its activities are 
progressing in line with expectations, controlling costs and placing unused funds on deposit to conserve resources and increase returns 
on surplus cash held.
Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets consist of long-term financial assets, cash at bank and receivables. The interest rate profile at 31 December 
for these assets at US Dollar equivalents was as follows:

26. Financial instruments, derivatives and capital management of the Group continued
The UK Sterling, Euro and Syrian Pound assets principally comprise cash on hand, cash on instant access accounts and short-term 
money market deposits. The US Dollar assets represent cash on call accounts, money market accounts, and short-term receivables.  
The Group earned interest on its interest bearing financial assets at rates between 0.1% and 4.75%. All financial assets are considered 
immediately available to turn into cash on demand.
In the current economic climate with exceptionally low interest rates, the Group is not sensitive to fluctuations in the interest rate received 
on bank and money market deposits and accordingly no sensitivity analysis is published.
Included in US Dollar financial assets are amounts of $15,213,000 (2008: $8,266,000) of trade receivables. The Group considers that 
$13,217,000 (2008: $7,015,000) carries the risk of the sovereign debt of the Syrian Arab Republic. The remaining trade receivables consist 
of amounts receivable from various counter-parties where the Group considers the credit risk to be low. This risk is monitored by the 
Group. No significant assets included in trade receivables are past due or considered impaired. 
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities consist of short-term payables. None of these liabilities bear interest to external parties. 
At 31 December financial liabilities are classified as shown below:
          Financial  
          liabilities

          11,245
The Group’s short term liabilities are considered to be payable on demand. 
Derivatives
The Group has exposure to changes in oil and gas prices. In the past the Group utilised derivative financial instruments to reduce 
exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in oil and gas prices in order to reduce the volatility of the cash flows of the Group. 
The derivative contracts expired in May 2007 and no such contracts are currently outstanding. The future use of derivatives will be kept 
under review should the Group feel that the exposure to commodity price risk significantly impacts the liquidity risk of the Group. The 
Group incurred no expense in respect of oil and gas price derivatives in 2009 or 2008.
Fair values
At 31 December 2009 and 2008, the Directors considered the fair values and book values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to 
be materially the same.

27. Financial instruments, derivatives and capital management of the Company
The financial risks of the Company are principally in respect of balances held in bank accounts and on deposit, and balances owed to, or 
owed by, subsidiary undertakings. These balances are all denominated in US Dollars. Other risks are managed on a unified basis with the 
Group and a full disclosure of these risks is made in note 26.

29. Events after the balance sheet date
On 18 March 2010 the Company announced that it had received a preliminary approach that may, or may not, lead to an offer for the 
Company. On 19 March 2010 the Board of Directors of the Company announced that it had rejected the preliminary approach as it 
considered the proposal to be wholly inadequate and materially undervaluing the Company. The Board also considered the approach to 
be unsolicited, highly conditional, subject to due diligence and other pre-conditions. 
On 3March 2010 the Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire working interests in two exploration permits in 
Tunisia and one in Southern Italy. The terms of the acquisition of the interests in these permits will require the Group to pay for a 
percentage of certain 3D seismic work and exploration drilling. 
30. Restatement of previous period financial statements
The Group has identified corrections required to certain balances in the financial statements of prior periods. The Group has chosen to 
restate the Consolidated balance sheets, Consolidated income statements and Consolidated statements of cash flows as at, and for the 
periods ended, 31 December 2008, 2007 and 2006.
In prior periods certain expenditure of an operating nature incurred in the Gulf of Mexico had been erroneously classified as capital 
expenditure. The amounts misclassified were $979,000, $2,375,000 and $6,388,000 for 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. The 
corrections of the misclassifications have led to various adjustments to the calculated depletion and impairment charges for each period.
The Group has reclassified cash flows relating to inventory purchases and certain accounts payable as investing activities where these 
relate to development and exploration activities.
The effect of these restatements to the Consolidated balance sheets, Consolidated income statements and Consolidated statements of 
cash flows is set out below:

2D seismic  Seismic data, obtained using a sound source and receivers placed in a straight line on the surface of the earth, 
that is processed to provide a graphic representation of a vertical cross-section through the subsurface rock 
layers (“seismic line”). In a 2D seismic survey, several seismic lines are recorded and the cross-sections are 
interpolated to yield subsurface maps on which exploration prospects can be delineated 
2P Proved and probable reserves
3D seismic  In a 3D seismic survey, multiple closely spaced seismic lines are recorded and the high density of cross-sections 
are interpolated to yield detailed subsurface maps on which exploration prospects can be delineated

P+P Proved and probable reserves
Probable reserves  Probable reserves are those unproved reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are 
more likely than not to be recoverable. In this context, when probabilistic methods are used, there should be more 
than a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus 
probable reserves
Proved reserves  Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be 
estimated with reasonable certainty (normally over 90% if measured on a probabilistic basis) to be commercially 
recoverable, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions, operating 
methods, and government regulations

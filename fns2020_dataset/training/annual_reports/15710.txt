firms. The Office Productivity group is dedicated to

functionality.
Information Services
Tikit’s Information Services group is focused on
leveraging Microsoft’s SharePoint technology to
help law firms develop powerful internal and
external content solutions. Using SharePoint in
conjunction with complementary technologies such
as Handshake, iBox, Metastorm and Redwood, the
division creates integrated knowledge management,
workflow and business intelligence solutions.

During 2006 the Group achieved
record sales and profits
Introduction
I am pleased to be able to announce
excellent results for Tikit Group plc for
the year ended 31 December 2006. The
Group undertook a number of
acquisitions during late 2004 and 2005
and the focus for 2006 was to secure
good organic growth from the enlarged
Group and at the same time improve
operating margins across all of the
business areas.
We achieved overall revenue growth of
17% in 2006 compared with 2005 and
operating margins improved from 10.4%
to 12.3%. Profit before taxation, goodwill
amortisation and share option charges
increased by 38% to £2.9 million
compared with 2005 (£2.1 million).
Good progress has been made
throughout the business including major
project wins with our existing large legal
clients and significant success from our
recent move into the accountancy sector .
Our operations in France and Spain
performed ahead of plan.
Results
Turnover for the period increased by
17% to £23.5 million (2005: £20.2
million). Within this, consultancy and
managed services businesses increased
by 13% to £15.3 million (2005: £13.5
million) of which £8.0 million (2005:
£7 .2 million) related to managed
services turnover , representing
recurring revenues of 34% of our 2006
turnover . The improvement of operating
margins from 10.4% to 12.3% reflects
higher utilisation rates of our
chargeable staff and efficiencies gained
through the integration of managed
services operations and reducing some
lower margin business in non-strategic
areas such as hardware sales.
The Group improved profits by 38%,
achieving a profit before taxation,
goodwill amortisation and share option
charges for the period of £2.9 million
(2005: £2.1 million).
The figure for pre-tax profit after share
option charges and goodwill
amortisation increased by 233% to £2.1
million (2005: £0.6 million). Following a
review by the Board of the Group’s
goodwill amortisation accounting policy,
the goodwill charge for 2006 was made
on the basis of a ten-year amortisation
period (2005: five years). As a result
goodwill amortisation in the year was
£0.64 million (2005: £1.34 million).
Share option charges during the period,
as required by FRS 20, were £127 ,000
(2005: £126,000).
Earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and share option charges
increased by 38% to 18.0 pence (2005:
13.0 pence). Basic earnings per share
were 12.0 pence (2005: 1.7 pence).
Chairman’s Statement
>> Mike McGoun
13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:41  Page 6 13534 30/03/2007 Proof 7
Cash generated from operations was
£3.6 million (2005: £2.1 million). Our
balance sheet remains strong, with net
assets at 31 December 2006 at £6.2
million (2005: £5.2 million), including
cash balances of £4.2 million (2005:
£2.3 million).
During the year , we took the opportunity
to use £392,000 of our cash resources
to purchase 203,535 Tikit shares in the
market for cancellation, as we believed
this to be immediately earnings
enhancing.
In order to facilitate a proposed new
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), for key
personnel, the implementation of which
is subject to shareholder approval,
100,000 Tikit shares were purchased in
the market during 2006 at a cost of
£234,000 and these, together with a
further 100,000 purchased in January
2007 at a cost of £258,500, are
available to satisfy the award of shares
under the proposed LTIP.
Dividends
Given the ongoing strength of the
business and our excellent record of
cash generation from operations, the
Board has decided upon a more
progressive dividend policy. A final
dividend of 2.75 pence per share is
proposed. It is to be paid on 7 May 2007
to shareholders on the register on
30 March 2007 . This, when taken with
the interim dividend of 1.25 pence
(2005: 0.75 pence), brings total
dividends for the year to 4.0 pence
(2005: 2.5 pence), an increase of 60%
over the previous year .
Employees
I would like to take the opportunity to
thank the directors and employees of
the Group for their contribution in
delivering this excellent set of results.
Executive Long Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP)
Since its public listing in June 2001, Tikit
has been very successful in generating
not only profits, but also, more
importantly, cash from its operations.
This generation of cash has enabled us to
make acquisitions and fund our growth
without recourse to the capital markets.
Although an issue of new Tikit shares has
sometimes been used partially to fund
acquisitions, the rate of growth of the
issued share capital has been
significantly less than the rate of growth
of the company. As a result, the ability of
the company to grant share options
within the ABI guidelines (which restrict
the issue of options over a ten year
period to a maximum of 10% of the
issued share capital) is severely limited.
The proposed Long Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP) is performance related and
provides incentives to key executives and
staff to remain with the business and
share in the increase in shareholder
value over the next three years.
The proposed LTIP requires shareholder
approval at the company’s Annual
General Meeting to be held on 3 May
2007 . In the notice convening the
Group’s Annual General Meeting the
necessary resolution is set out together
with explanatory details of the proposed
scheme. It is proposed that share
options over 250,000 Tikit Group plc
shares are granted to the senior
management team with a nominal grant
price. There are currently 200,000

The overriding Group objective is to continue to
focus on the provision of IT systems and support
to large law firms.
shares held in treasury. An additional
50,000 shares will, if required, be
purchased in the market and held in
treasury. These options may vest at the
end of a three-year period and will be
subject to an earnings per share growth
target over three years. For the
maximum number of shares to vest
under this scheme, a compound growth
rate of 20% per annum in normalised
earnings per share has to be achieved.
For this purpose, normalised means the
fully diluted earnings per share of the
company taxed at the standard
corporation tax rate of the company and
before goodwill amortisation and share
option charges.
Most of the cost to the company will be
fixed at the outset as 80% of the
maximum number of shares to vest
under this scheme have already been
purchased and held in treasury. No
dilution of the existing issued share
capital through the issue of new shares
will occur .
As at 31 December 2006, there were
unexercised options granted over
638,778 shares under existing Group
share options schemes, representing
approximately 5.0 % of the existing
issued share capital of the company. If
the proposed LTIP is approved and
implemented, share options over an
additional 250,000 shares representing
approximately 1.9% of the company’s
existing issued share capital will be
granted.
Business review and prospects
The purpose of this section is to give
shareholders a summary of the
prospects of the business. The
performance in 2006 is a good indicator
of the skills that currently exist within
the Group and the financial results show
how effectively those skills are
employed.
The overriding Group objective is to
continue to focus on the provision of IT
systems and support to large law firms
and accountancy practices. Tikit has
established itself as a leading supplier to
this market in the UK and remains
focused on expanding its market share.
In addition, we seek to become the
Chairman’s Statement
13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:41  Page 8 13534 30/03/2007 Proof 7
leading supplier of these services and
products to the large firms in mainland
Europe.
The large UK law firms and accountancy
practices have announced significant
recent growth in their businesses and
are investing commensurately in their IT
systems. Tikit is ideally positioned to
provide consultancy, services and
products to help these firms derive
maximum benefit from their IT
investment. In 2006, we estimate that
the top one hundred law firms in the UK
spent approximately £500 million on IT
products and services. The top fifty
accountancy firms spent an estimated
£300 million. At this stage of our
development we do not believe that the
size of our chosen market is a limit to
our growth.
Tikit’s competitive advantage is that it is
a specialised business focused on the
large legal and accountancy markets.
This differentiates us from general IT
consultancy organisations. Our
relationship with clients is from a service
perspective in that we understand how
large law firms and accountancy
practices work, their language and
culture. We understand their business
issues and can help them identify
potential IT-based solutions to those
issues. We differentiate ourselves from
software vendors by our independence
and, whilst we have strong relationships
with our software partners, our strength
is that we endeavour to select the best
of breed software appropriate to our
clients’ needs and are not committed to
providing standard solutions. There may
be some short-term risk associated with
this strategy given that new software
developments may render existing
partnership arrangements
inappropriate. This may lead to short-
term direct competition from software
vendors.
Our focus remains on achieving strong
organic growth. At the same time we
continue to look for businesses, products
or services that can further expand our
current portfolio. We also believe that
Tikit is well positioned to participate in
the consolidation that is taking place in
both the legal and accountancy sectors.
The average size of the top one hundred
UK law firms continues to rise faster
than the overall market because of
merger activity. We believe that the large
UK law firms will lead consolidation
across Europe and that Tikit, with its
strong client base among those firms,
will benefit from this.
The Group’s pipeline of consultancy and
implementation projects should provide
the opportunity to schedule resources
more efficiently and improve utilisation.
The managed services group will
continue to streamline its services so
that clients can benefit from the full
range of support offerings, from
hardware and infrastructure support to
onsite support for complex applications.
In addition, the introduction of a number
of new software products during 2006 is
expected to result in additional sales in
2007 and beyond.
The key performance indicators (KPI’s)
used by your Board to measure the
success of the business remain those
that have underpinned our success to
date. The most important of these is

Tikit Group plc
Annual Report 2006

When your board considers risk issues
going forward, the prominent element
is dependence on our people.
customer retention, especially reflected
in support contract renewal rates.
Following our first year in business,
some 13 years ago, we have had annual
renewal rates in excess of 90%. With 92
of the top one hundred UK law firms as
clients and 18 of the top fifty
accountancy practices, it is essential
that we retain existing clients at the
same time as winning new ones.
The second KPI is the organic growth of
our revenues and this should be at least
as great as that of the top one hundred
firms. In addition, we seek to add
additional services so that our actual
revenue growth is higher . The third KPI
is the operating margin that we are able
to achieve. Since inception in 1994, Tikit
has had operating margins in excess of
10%, with the exception of the year
ended 31 December 2002 where
operating margin was 6.5%. We aim to
have operating margins of 12.5%. A final
KPI is our ability to generate cash from
our operating activities — in our view,
the true measure of profit. This is an
area where Tikit has excelled over the
years. We aim to achieve a conversion
ratio of profit before tax to cash of at
least 100%.
In commenting upon the capital
structure of the company, I draw
attention to the acquisitions made by us
that have largely been funded by the
cash generated by the business. We have
been able to act quickly without incurring
the time and costs associated with equity
or debt fundraisings. The company has
had no debt since its inception in 1994.
However , we continue to consider the
most appropriate capital structure given
the outlook for interest rates on long-
term debt. There is a determination not
to hold surplus cash and we will return
such cash to shareholders by a
combination of the progressive dividend
policy where it is our intention to provide
shareholders with a yield over 2%,
combined with the purchase of shares in
the market for cancellation.
Business review — risks
When your board considers risk issues
going forward, the prominent element is
the dependence on our people. We
recognise the value of their
Chairman’s Statement
13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:41  Page 10 13534 30/03/2007 Proof 7
commitment and are conscious that we
must keep the reward systems, both
financial and motivational, in place to
minimise this area of risk; our proposed
LTIP is an example of this. A second risk
issue, competition, arises in relation to
our strong position with the large law
firms. Given that there is no external
direct competition of any size in this
market, we must be careful not to abuse
our position. The main competition issue
in any project proposal is whether a law
firm’s internal IT department may wish
to undertake the assignment itself.
Accordingly, our services are designed
to complement and assist internal staff
rather than replace them. Finally, we are
aware of the supply risk of losing key
software partners. This would have a
short-term impact as we sought to
identify and then train our staff in a
suitable alternative product. We have an
excellent record of maintaining good
relationships with our software partners
and usually get notice of impending
changes in time to minimise the impact
on Tikit.
Environmental policies
The Group acknowledges the
importance of environmental matters
and where possible, utilises environment
friendly policies in its offices, such as
recycling and energy efficient practices.
Summary and prospects
In summary, 2006 was an excellent year
for the Group. We enter 2007 with a
good order book of projects to be
implemented, reflecting a blend of
consultancy, support and software
business sold in the last quarter . The
targets we have set ourselves for 2007
and 2008 are challenging and, if met,
will lead to further significant
improvements in the trading
performance of the Group and to
earnings per share. Tikit’s opportunities
are many and your Board continues to
be optimistic about the trading
prospects of the Group.

LexisNexis’ InterAction software. Our
CRM system is deployed across Grant
Thornton’s 32 UK offices, totalling some
1,600 users. In addition, Tikit undertook
extensions to the CRM systems installed
at Ernst & Young offices, both in the UK
and Australia. A significant number of
these projects also benefited from the
data auditing and cleansing expertise of
the Shamrock team.
Shamrock have also been adding value
to our accounting and legal clients by
providing outsourced marketing
campaign activities.
Our Practice Management Systems
(PMS) group are recognised experts in
the back-office systems upon which law
firms are reliant. They have undertaken
a number of assignments to help clients
implement PMS systems and, for HM
Government’s Treasury Solicitors, have
installed a new Time Recording system
for over 500 users, based upon the
Sage Carpe Diem system. They have had
early success with Redwood software,
sold exclusively by Tikit in the UK, for
financial planning and budgeting, with
installations under way at Clarke
Willmott, CMS Cameron McKenna and
SJ Berwin.
Tikit is continuing its strong alliance with
Microsoft. We are a Microsoft Gold
certified partner , as well as recently
being awarded our fifth competency, the
Information Worker Solutions
accreditation, in recognition of our
expertise with implementations of
platforms such as SharePoint and
Office. We are currently developing an
innovative portal solution in conjunction
with Eversheds and Microsoft using
Share point and Handshake software,
which we expect to be applicable across
a wide number of professional firms.
A web-based portfolio control and billing
workflow system (developed by Tikit)
has achieved wide adoption at
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer . This
project not only shows Tikit’s
understanding of law firm processes but
also its versatility in creating a new
process flow that integrates a range of
existing applications.
Managed services
Good progress is being made in the
provision of outsourced, infrastructure
support services to law firms through
our Network and Infrastructure Support
(NIS) division. Historically specialising in
the accountancy sector , NIS has, this
year , won large projects with Brabner
Chaffe Street and Dickinson Manser in
the legal sector as well as continuing its
business with the large accountancy
practices. The major work in 2006 has
been a number of complete server
refresh projects incorporating Microsoft
Exchange and full security and network
management implementations. Of
particular note is the exciting project at
Chantry Vellacott which will be
implemented in 2007 and which will
standardise IT systems across all six UK
offices.

The acquisitions we made in 2005 have
performed well.
Recent improvements to our document
editing and classification service in
Yorkshire, which provides clients with a
cost effective way of classifying their
key documents to enhance the value of
their knowledge management systems,
is delivering greater benefit to both Tikit
and its clients.
Software sales
2006 has been very encouraging with a
number of large projects awarded to
Tikit, many of which were tendered for
in 2005. Total revenues for the year
ended 31 December 2006 from all
software sales were £7 .4 million (2005:
£5.7 million), an increase of 30% on the
prior year .
We are Interwoven’s preferred partner
in the legal and accountancy market
sector , being awarded their Global
Partner of the Year award for the
second year running. The recent
announcement of Tikit signing its one-
hundredth Interwoven WorkSite client
illustrates our continued success in
this area.
Tikit has invested resources into several
other new technologies such as iBox, a
new indexing and search tool which
combines taxonomy management,
browsing and searching in a new way
especially suited to use by law firms, and
is undertaking a pilot implementation at
one of the UK’s largest law firms.
Another such initiative is with
Microsystems D3, which provides clients
with software and a service to ensure
that working documents are stripped of
unnecessary metadata and that styles
and formatting are consistent. Early
adopter projects are already underway
with a number of clients.
Product development
In conjunction with third-party software
products, Tikit has developed a number
of software application packages, which
typically provide additional functionality
in key application areas. One of these
products, the eMarketing Solution
(which includes E-Merge and ReAction
Server) is now installed in 152 clients
worldwide with sales secured not only in
the UK but also in the USA, Canada,
Ireland and Australia. We achieved sales
of £734,000 of our own IPR in the year
(2005: £660,000).

13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:41  Page 14 Following on from the success of the
eMarketing Solution we have recruited
extra people to provide more focus on
creating and developing more Tikit own
brand software products. These
products will provide further
functionality and management to key
application areas within law firms and
will initially be aimed at Interwoven
WorkSite and Microsoft Word.
Overseas
The French subsidiary, LecSoft, is
developing well, with a particularly
strong performance in the second half
of the year . Our Spanish operation
continues to focus on gaining market
share, presence and reputation and
made a small contribution to profits in
2006. Total overseas sales including our
operations in France and Spain
accounted for 22% of sales in the year
ended 31 December 2006.
Summary
Overall Tikit had a very good year
operationally and the acquisitions that
we made in 2005 have performed well.
Tikit operates in a market where people
and their relationships are absolutely
critical to the success of the business
and the quality of the newer people
coming into Tikit together with the
enthusiasm and support from Tikit’s
existing staff has enabled the business
to be significantly stronger than at the
same time last year . I would therefore
like to thank every employee of Tikit for
contributing to the success we enjoyed
in 2006.

The Group achieved another record year with
both turnover and profits growing strongly
The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the UK
and cover the results for the Group for
the year to 31 December 2006.
Trading
The Group achieved another record
year with both turnover and profits
growing strongly. Total turnover in the
year was £23.52 million (2005: £20.16
million) — an increase of 17%.
Group profit on ordinary trading
activities, before taxation, amortisation
of goodwill and share option charges
was £2.89 million (2005: £2.10 million) —
an increase of 38%.
A detailed review of the performance of
the business can be found in the
Chairman’s and the Chief Executive’s
Statements.
Taxation
Based on the Group profit before tax,
amortisation of goodwill and share
option charges, the current year tax
charge is an effective rate of 21.8%
(2005: 19.6%). In 2006 the charge
benefited from the utilisation of tax
losses acquired on the purchase of Tikit
NIS Limited on 17 December 2004 and
the exercise of share options. The
standard rate of corporation tax in the
UK is 30%.
Earnings and dividends
The Group measures its adjusted
earnings per share performance on
trading results after excluding goodwill
amortisation and share option charges
from the calculation. Adjusted basic
earnings per share, based on the actual
shares in issue, was 18.0p (2005: 13.0p),
an increase of 38%. Basic earnings per
share was 12.0p (2005: 1.7p). The average
number of shares in issue in the year was
12.54 million (2005: 12.53million).

future cash flows are taken into account.
This year the Board is recommending a
final dividend of 2.75p (2005: 1.75p)
which when combined with the interim
dividend of 1.25p gives a total dividend
for the year of 4.0p (2005: 2.5p) — an
increase of 60%. The dividend is
covered 4.4 times by post-tax earnings,
after adding back goodwill amortisation
and share option charges.
Cash flow
Cash inflow from operating activities of
£3.58 million (2005: £2.10 million)
reflects our usual strong conversion of
profit to cash. The year end bank
balances increased by £1.82 million to
£4.15 million.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments
comprise cash, liquid resources, trade
debtors and trade creditors. The main
risks arising from these financial
instruments are interest rate risk,
liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign
currency exchange rate risk. The
policies for managing each of these
risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group is cash positive and places its
balances on short-term deposits with
highly regarded financial institutions.
Changes in interest rates will affect the
return on cash balances. The Group
does not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments.
Liquidity risk
The Group is cash positive and has a
policy of ensuring sufficient funds are
always available for its operating
activities. While the need for borrowing
facilities are not required at present, the
Board continually monitors the Group’s
cash requirements.
Foreign currency exchange risk
Part of the cash at bank is held in euro
and US dollar accounts. There are also
trade balances and investments in these
currencies. The Group’s foreign
exchange risk is hedged by way of
forward exchange contracts where
appropriate and any resulting gains or
losses are recognised in the profit and
loss account.
Credit risk
The Group has a small exposure to
credit risk from credit sales. It is the
Group’s policy to assess the credit risk of
new customers before entering into
contracts.
Shareholder information
The Group’s website at www.tikit.com
contains a wide range of information
about our activities and visitors can

>> Corporate Governance Statement
Statement by the directors on
compliance with the Combined Code
The company is listed on the Alternative
Investment Market (AIM) and is
therefore not required to comply with
the provisions of the 2006 Financial
Reporting Council’s revised Combined
Code. Nevertheless the Board is
committed to ensuring that proper

operate throughout the Group and has
followed the principles of the Code so
far as is practicable and appropriate for
the nature and size of the Group.
A statement of the directors’
responsibilities in respect of the financial
statements is set out on page 26. Below
is a brief description of the role of the
Board and its Committees, followed by a
statement regarding the Group’s system
of internal controls.
The Board

directors and three executive directors
and is responsible to shareholders for
the proper management of the Group.
The non-executive directors are Richard
Price (the senior non-executive director)

consider both to be independent. The
Board meets regularly, reviewing trading
performance, setting and monitoring
strategy, and examining major capital
expenditure and acquisition
opportunities. All directors have access
to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary. Any director
appointed during the year is required,
under the company’s Articles of
Association, to retire and seek re-
election by shareholders at the next
Annual General Meeting. It is company
policy that each director retires and
seeks re-election every three years.

Managing Director and the Finance
Director .
The Audit Committee is responsible for
reviewing a wide range of financial
matters including ensuring that the
financial performance of the Group is
adequately measured and controlled,
correctly represented, reported to and
understood by the Board. The Audit
Committee advises the Board on the

non-audit work, and discusses the
nature and scope of their audit.

least once a year without any executive
directors present.

composition and balance.
Going Concern
Having reviewed the future plans and
projections for the business, the

its subsidiary undertakings have
adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial
statements.
Internal Controls

Group’s system of internal control and
for reviewing its effectiveness which, by
its nature, can only provide reasonable
and not absolute assurance against

control systems for the period 1 January
2006 to the date of approval of the
financial statements. The Board will
continue to review the effectiveness of
its control assessment system on a
regular basis.

organisational structure with clearly
defined levels of responsibility and
delegation of authority.
Control procedures include annual
budget approval and monitoring of
actual performance. Formal staff

programmes are in place. Capital

receive suitable training for their
position, which is considered as part of
the appraisal process.

businesses and for putting in place
procedures to mitigate and monitor
risks. Risks are formally assessed during

reported against budget and any
significant adverse variances examined
and remedial action taken where
necessary.

>> Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee is
constituted in accordance with the
Combined Code. The Committee is
composed entirely of non-executive
directors, who are believed by the
company to be independent, as set out
on page 20. The Chairman during the
year was Mr Nicholas Briant. The terms
of reference for the Committee are to
determine the Group’s policy on
executive remuneration and to consider
and approve the remuneration packages
for directors subject to ratification by
the Board. During the financial year the
Committee met a total of 3 times.
Policy on executive director
remuneration
The Group’s current and ongoing
remuneration policy aims to ensure that
executive directors are fairly rewarded
for their individual contributions to the
Group’s overall performance and is
designed to attract, retain and motivate
executives of the right calibre. The
Committee is responsible for
recommendations on all elements of
directors’ remuneration including, in
particular , basic salary, annual bonus,
share options and any other incentive
awards. In implementing the
remuneration policy the Committee has
regard to factors specific to the
company, such as salary and other
benefit arrangements within the Group
and the achievement of the Group’s
strategic objectives.
The Committee determines the Group’s
policy on executive directors’
remuneration with reference to
comparable companies of similar
market capitalisation, location and
business sector .
Basic salary
The basic salaries of executive directors
are reviewed annually having regard to
individual performance and position
within the company and are intended to
be competitive but fair using
information provided from both internal
and external sources. The performance
related annual bonus forms a significant
part of the level of remuneration
considered appropriate by the
Remuneration Committee. Details of
directors’ emoluments are set out on
page 23.
Performance related annual bonus
The percentage of basic salary on which
annual cash bonuses are based is set by
the Committee. The 2006 bonuses paid
to executive directors on achievement
of the target Group profits before tax
are shown in the remuneration table on
page 23. Target based bonuses payable
to the executive directors for the 2007
financial year will be on a similar basis
and capped at a maximum of 40% of
basic pay, including any pension
contributions. In determining whether a
bonus payment is made or not, the
Committee will consider any factors that
may alter the targets against which
performance is measured and adjust the
level of bonus accordingly. In addition to
the formal bonus scheme, the
Committee has the discretion to
recommend the payment of ad hoc
awards to reflect exceptional
performance.
Incentive plans
No new share options were issued to
directors or senior management in
the year . An outline of the proposed new
Long Term Incentive Plan is set out in
the Chairman’s Statement.
Pensions
Contributions are made to the executive
directors’ personal pension schemes up
to a maximum of 10% of basic salary.
Details of directors’ pension
contributions are set out on page 23.
Other benefits
The Committee aims to provide an
objective and independent assessment
of all benefits granted to directors.
Service contracts
The executive directors have rolling 12
month service contracts with notice
periods of 12 months. Directors are
entitled to a non-pensionable bonus
subject to achieving the targets set by
the Remuneration Committee for the
bonus scheme in place for the year in
question (as set out at the beginning of
this report). No director receives
additional remuneration or benefits in
relation to being a director or sitting on
the board of any Group company.
Policy on remuneration of non-
executive directors
The Board determines the Group’s policy
on non-executive directors’ fees and will
continue to set fees with reference to
the individual director’s role, the
company’s market capitalisation,
location and business sector .
Non-executive directors are not
permitted to participate in employee
share option schemes, neither are they
entitled to participate in the company’s
pension arrangements.

>> Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for
preparing the annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the
company and Group and of the profit or
loss of the Group for that period. In
preparing those financial statements,
the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable
accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements
on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that
the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the
company and Group and to enable them
to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group
and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
Financial statements are published on
the company’s website in accordance
with legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements,
which may vary from legislation in other
jurisdictions. The maintenance and
integrity of the company’s website is the
responsibility of the directors. The
directors’ responsibility also extends to
the ongoing integrity of the financial
statements contained therein.

losses and the related notes. These
financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of

accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the
statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you in our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give a
true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and whether the
information given in the Director’s
Report is consistent with those financial
statements. We also report to you if, in
our opinion, the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or
if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other
transaction is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in
the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Report
of the Directors, the Remuneration
Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the
Chief Executive Statement, the Financial
Review and the Corporate Governance
Statement. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant
to the requirements of the Companies
Act 1985 and for no other purpose. No
person is entitled to rely on this report

Save as above, we do not accept
responsibility for this report to any other
person or for any other purpose and we
hereby expressly disclaim any and all
such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation
of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so
as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the Group financial statements give
a true and fair view, in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of
the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 December 2006 and of its profit
for the year then ended;
 the parent company financial
statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of
the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2006;

properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical
cost convention. The Group has adopted FRS 20 “share based payments” and UITF 44 “Group and treasury share
transactions” in preparing the current year’s accounts (see note 2).
The principal accounting policies are:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Tikit Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together
referred to as the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Acquisition accounting
Where the acquisition method is used, the results of the subsidiary are included from the date of acquisition. The purchase
consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. In the company financial
statements of Tikit Group plc, advantage has been taken of the merger relief rules. Shares issued as consideration for
acquisitions are accounted for at nominal value.
Merger accounting
Where merger accounting is used, the investment is recorded in the company’s balance sheet at the nominal value of shares
issued together with the fair value of any additional consideration paid.
In the Group financial statements, merged subsidiary undertakings are treated as if they had always been a member of the
Group. The results of such a subsidiary are included for the whole period in the year it joins the Group. The corresponding
figures for the previous year include its results for that period, the assets and liabilities at the previous balance sheet date and
the shares issued by the company as consideration as if they had always been in issue. Any difference between the nominal
value of the shares acquired by the company and those issued by the company to acquire them is taken to reserves.
Share options
When shares and share options are granted to employees a charge is made to the profit and loss account and a reserve
created in capital and reserves to record the fair value of the awards at the date of grant in accordance with FRS 20 “share
based payments”. This charge is spread over the vesting period.
When shares and share options are granted to employees of subsidiary companies, the fair value of the awards is treated as a
capital contribution and spread over the period of performance relating to the grant. The corresponding entry is made in
reserves.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is the difference between the fair value of the consideration
paid and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. In calculating goodwill, the total consideration, both actual and
deferred, is taken into account. Where the deferred consideration is contingent and dependent upon future trading
performance, an estimate of the value of likely consideration payable is made. The contingent deferred consideration is
reassessed annually and a corresponding adjustment is made to the goodwill arising on acquisition.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over the directors’ estimate of its
useful economic life of 10 years. Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken:
 at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition;
 in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable.

>> Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies (continued)
During the period, the directors reviewed the useful economic life of goodwill. As a result it was revised and goodwill is now
amortised through the profit and loss account over 10 years (2005: 5 years). This has resulted in the amortisation charge for
the year to 31 December 2006 being reduced by £1,021,000 to £629,000 (2005: £1,341,000). There has been no restatement
of the comparatives.
Turnover and income recognition
Turnover represents the amounts receivable, net of value added tax, on the provision of the Group’s software, maintenance,
consultancy and other services such as training. When a sale of the Group’s software is made to a customer the price
normally includes the provision of third party maintenance and support provided by the Group. The support element is
deferred and recognised over the period that the support is provided. The licence element of the sale and third party
maintenance is recognised as income when the following conditions have been satisfied:
1) The software has been provided to the customer in a form that enables the customer to utilise it.
2) There is a contractual relationship between the customer and the Group.
3) The ongoing obligations of the Group to the customer , aside from the support, are minimal.
4) The amount payable by the customer is determinable and there is a reasonable expectation of payment.
Sales of hardware and consultancy are recognised at the point of delivery to the customer .
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their
expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following rates:
Leasehold improvements — over length of lease
Computer equipment — 33% per annum
Office equipment — 25% per annum
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
The need for any fixed asset impairment write-down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the
higher of its net realisable value and value in use.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for
resale means actual purchase price, including transport and handling, and is determined using the FIFO method. Net
realisable value means estimated net selling price less further costs to completion.
Leased assets
Payments made in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. The Group has no finance leases or hire purchase contracts.
Research and development
Expenditure on product development is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance
sheet date except that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the company anticipates to make
sufficient profit in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences. Deferred tax balances are not
discounted.

13534TIKITGRO:13534TIKITGRO  12/4/07  08:42  Page 34 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Pension costs
Contributions to the Group personal pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they
become payable. The Group does not operate any defined benefit pension plans.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions of individual companies are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any differences are
taken to the profit and loss account.
The results of overseas operations and the balance sheets are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange ruling
on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences which arise from translation of the opening net assets of foreign subsidiary
undertakings are taken to reserves.
Financial instruments
In relation to the disclosures made in note 21:
 short-term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial assets and liabilities; and
 the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Employee benefit trust
The balance sheets include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust. Amounts paid and received by the trust for
transactions in the company’s own shares are reported directly in shareholders’ funds. Shares held by the EBT are treated as
cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Treasury Shares
Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the company’s own shares for holding in treasury is taken directly
to shareholders’ funds. The difference between the consideration received on the sale of the treasury shares and the
weighted average cost of shares sold is taken to the share premium account.
All shares held in treasury are treated as cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings per share.
2 Changes to accounting policies
In preparing these financial statements the Group has adopted for the first time FRS 20 ‘Share-based payments’. which
requires the recognition of share-based payments at fair value at the date of grant. Prior to the adoption of FRS 20, the
Group recognised the financial effect of the share-based payment in the following way: when shares and share options were
awarded to employees a charge was made to the profit and loss account based on the difference between the market value
of the company’s shares at the date of grant and the option exercise price in accordance with UITF Abstract 17 (revised 2003)
‘Employee Share Schemes’. The credit entry for this charge was taken to the profit and loss reserve and reported in the
reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds.
In accordance with transitional provisions of FRS 20, the standard was applied retrospectively to all grants of equity
instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The change in accounting policy has resulted in a net increase in profit for the year ended 31 December 2005
of £4,000 (share-based payments expense net of deferred tax impact of £nil and net of reversal
of the 2005 charge under UITF 17).
In the company Financial Statements the fair value of the awards is treated as a
Capital Contribution. The change in accounting policy has resulted in an increase
of £207 ,000 in the cost of investment in Group undertakings and reserves.

10 Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the year .
The weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of earnings per share is as follows:
2006 2005
No’000 No’000
Weighted average ordinary shares in issue during the year 12,537 12,528
Potentially dilutive share options under the Group’s share option schemes 405 410
Deferred consideration to be satisfied in shares 340 277
Weighted average ordinary shares for diluted earnings per share 13,282 13,215
An adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated in addition to the basic earnings per share and is based on
earnings adjusted to eliminate the effects of goodwill amortisation and share option charges. It has been calculated to allow
shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.

20 Reconciliation of movement in share capital and reserves (continued)
EBT share reserve
The employee benefit trust (EBT) was established on 26 September 2002 in order to provide for the future obligations of
the company for shares awarded under its share option schemes. Under the scheme the trustees purchase the company’s
ordinary shares using funds supplied under a loan agreement with the company.
Shares held in Trust

Number £’000

At 31 December 2006 13,456 10
Market value at 31 December 2006 35
Market value at 31 December 2005 375
At 31 December 2006, £148,500 (2005: £148,000) had been loaned by the company to the EBT to finance the purchase of
ordinary shares. The balance of cash held by the Trust, £80,000 (2005: £65,000), is included in the balance sheet as cash
at bank and in hand. None of the above shares have vested unconditionally to employees.
21 Financial instruments
The only significant financial asset the Group has is cash at bank. Cash is held either on current or on short term deposits at
floating rates of interest determined by the relevant bank’s prevailing base rate. Part of the cash at bank is held in Euro and
US dollar accounts.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the
profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not
denominated in the operating (‘functional’) currency of the operating unit involved. As at 31 December 2006, these
exposures were as follows:
Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities)
2006 2005
£’000 £’000
US dollar (829) (851)
Euro 417 505
Australian dollars 25 37
All amounts have sterling as the functional currency. There are no currency exposures in any other functional currency. The
Group’s French and Spanish subsidiaries’ functional currency is euros and they have no significant exposure to other
currencies.
The Group’s financial liabilities consist of preference shares. The preference shares pay a fixed coupon of 5% per annum on
amounts paid up.
The fair value of the Group’s currency forwards as at 31 December 2006 was £(10,000) (2005: £nil) and the book value £nil
(2005: £nil). Market rates have been used to determine current values. The market value of the Group’s other financial
assets and liabilities does not differ materially from the carrying value.
The Group does not hold any derivative financial instruments.
The Group’s policy as regards liquidity is to ensure sufficient cash resources are maintained to meet short-term liabilities.
The Group’s treasury policy is discussed in the Financial Review on pages 16 and 17 .

That the directors be and they are hereby generally and unconditionally authorised in accordance with Section 80 of the
Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”) to exercise all the powers of the company to allot relevant securities (as defined in Section
80(2) of the Act) of the company to such persons, at such times and on and subject to such terms and conditions as the
directors may determine. The maximum aggregate nominal amount of relevant securities which may be allotted pursuant to
this authority shall be £421,190. This authority shall expire on the earlier of 3 August 2008 and the conclusion of the Annual

agreement which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry and the directors may allot

7 As a special resolution (subject to the passing of the previous resolution):
That the directors be and they are hereby empowered pursuant to Section 95(1) of the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”) to allot
equity securities (within the meaning of Section 94 of the Act) pursuant to the general authority conferred by resolution 6 as if
Section 89(1) of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided that this power shall be limited:
(a) to the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights issue or other issue in favour of holders of ordinary shares
where the equity securities respectively attributable to the interests of all holders of ordinary shares are proportionate (as
nearly as practicable) to the respective numbers of ordinary shares held or deemed to be held by them, subject only to
such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with fractional
entitlements, legal or practical problems arising in any overseas territory, or by virtue of shares being represented by
depositary receipts, the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange, or any other matter; and
(b) to the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above) of equity securities for cash up to an aggregate
nominal value of £63,817 .60
and this power shall, unless renewed, varied or revoked, expire on the earlier of 3 August 2008 or the conclusion of the

not expired.

163(3) of the Act) of its own ordinary shares on such terms, and in such manner as the

Forward-looking statements
This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A 
of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to certain of the Group’s
plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future financial condition and
performance. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they
do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes
use words such as ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’,
‘believe’, or other words of similar meaning. Examples of forward-looking statements
include, among others, statements regarding the Group’s future financial position,
income growth, impairment charges, business strategy, projected levels of growth in
the banking and financial markets, projected costs, estimates of capital expenditures,
and plans and objectives for future operations. By their nature, forward-looking
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and
circumstances, including, but not limited to, UK domestic and global economic and
business conditions, the effects of continued volatility in credit markets, market related
risks such as changes in interest rates and exchange rates, the policies and actions of
governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in legislation, the further
development of standards and interpretations under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) applicable to past, current and future periods, evolving practices with
regard to the interpretation and application of standards under IFRS, progress in the
integration of Absa into the Group’s business and the achievement of synergy targets
related to Absa, the outcome of pending and future litigation, the success of future
acquisitions and other strategic transactions and the impact of competition – a number
of which factors are beyond the Group’s control. As a result, the Group’s actual future
results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the
Group’s forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Barclays speak only as of the
date they are made. Barclays does not undertake to update forward-looking statements
to reflect any changes in Barclays expectations with regard thereto or any changes in
events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. The reader
should, however, consult any additional disclosures that Barclays has made or may
make in documents it has filed or may file with the SEC.

6 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 through time. Meanwhile, the investments made by China Development
Bank and T emasek are a signal of their belief in the strong future prospects
of our Group. We’re already seeing the benefits of the strategic partnership
with China Development Bank that we announced in July.  
Corporate Governance
David Booth joined the Board on 1st May 2007 as a non-Executive Director.
He brings to the Board extensive investment banking and US market
knowledge and experience. As previously reported, Chris Lucas joined 
the Group and the Board on 1st April 2007 as Group Finance Director.
We also announced in December the appointment of Sir Michael Rake
and Patience Wheatcroft to the Board with effect from 1st January 2008.
Sir Michael is a former Chairman of KPMG International and is Chairman
of BT Group plc. Patience is a former editor of the Sunday Telegraph and
was Business and City Editor of The Times between 1997 and 2006. 
Dr Danie Cronjé has advised us that he does not intend to seek re-election
at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. I would like to thank him for his
considerable contribution to the Board and wish him well for the future.
Responsible Banking
During the year we redefined our corporate responsibility strategy 
in support of corporate sustainability. The sustainability strategy we 
are developing encompasses several themes: customer centricity;
inclusiveness; respect for diversity; environmental sustainability and
responsible global citizenship.
Over the year we made significant progress in a number of important
areas. We have continued to lead the market in inclusive banking in the
UK and overseas. Our engagement with UK consumer groups has led to
improvements in Barclays basic bank account (which is designed to help
those who have been outside the banking system gain access via a
simple account) and we plan a significant deepening of banking services
in emerging markets. We are supporting over a quarter of a million
entrepreneurs in emerging markets with a range of financial options. 
In the area of the environment, we made our UK operations carbon
neutral and this will be extended to cover all our businesses around the
world by 2009. We launched Barclaycard Breathe, the UK’ s first credit card
aimed at helping retail customers to address their own carbon impact.
Barclays remains the largest trader of allowances in the EU Emissions
Trading Scheme. We have developed environmental risk guidance for
lending which we have issued via the United Nations Environment
Programme to 170 small international banks.
Management Team
2007 was my first year as Chairman and it has been a pleasure to get to
know the people of Barclays. We are fortunate to have a forward-looking,
ambitious management team which is energetic in its pursuit of new
products and services to help meet the changing needs of customers and
clients. Let me extend on behalf of our shareholders a vote of thanks to all
of our people around the world who have worked so hard for the Group’ s
customers in very difficult market and competitive conditions.

Business review
Group Chairman’ s statement
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 7
“2007 was an eventful year 
for Barclays and the financial
services industry”
Barclays performed well during 2007, despite the difficult market conditions.
Although profit before tax fell 1%, profit before business disposals rose
3%. The Investment Banking and Investment Management businesses
(Barclays Capital, Barclays Global Investors and Barclays Wealth) all
achieved profits ahead of 2006. In Global Retail and Commercial Banking,
there were good performances from the UK businesses and continued
investment in and development of the international business, where
income rose sharply.
2007 was an eventful year for Barclays and the financial services industry.
We announced in March that we were in merger discussions with ABN
AMRO, although we subsequently withdrew our primarily share-based
offer in light of a higher cash-based offer from a consortium of banks. 
We also announced, in July, that two new major investors had joined 
our share register, China Development Bank and Temasek Holdings 
of Singapore. The second half of the year saw extremely testing market
conditions as rising default rates on sub-prime mortgages in the US
severely affected confidence in the global credit and money markets.
The Group’ s diversified portfolio of businesses served shareholders well 
in 2007, enabling us to deliver another year of substantial profits. We have
declared a final dividend for the year of 22.5p per share, making a total
payment for the year of 34p, an increase of 10%. Share prices across 
the banking sector globally were badly affected during 2007 by market
concerns over the impact of conditions in the credit and money markets 
on economic growth prospects. We remain committed to delivering top
quartile returns to our shareholders over time. 
The potential merger with ABN AMRO represented a significant opportunity
for us to accelerate the implementation of our strategy. It was for that
reason that we pursued it vigorously. But we see no distinction between
strategy and economics: we apply stringent financial tests to all mergers
and acquisitions and we were clear throughout the period of the bid that
we were not prepared to overpay. Walking away from the opportunity, 
as we did for this reason, has not caused us to change strategy, and we
remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver value for shareholders Group Chief Executive’ s review
8 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Barclays delivered a resilient financial performance in 2007 in a year of
contrasting market conditions. The excellent results of the first half were
achieved in a relatively benign environment; in the second half we were
not immune from the impact of the credit market turbulence, but profit
before business disposals for the year still increased 3%. I am pleased to
report profits again above £7bn, which is well ahead of the average level 
of the previous three years.
At a time of significant market turbulence, it is important to be clear and
confident about strategy. The strategy of Barclays is to achieve superior
growth through time by diversifying our profit base. The precondition of
successful growth is relevance to customers. We seek to maximise the
alignment between the sources of growth in the financial services industry
(in particular anticipating what customers want and need) with what 
we have in Barclays (in terms of brand, capability and physical footprint).
We recommit to our strategy following our bid for ABN AMRO, and in the
light of the market volatility and because of our confidence that our
strategy offers the best route to strong growth in the years ahead. 
The structure of the Group, which comprises two business groupings,
Global Retail and Commercial Banking (‘GRCB’) and Investment Banking
and Investment Management (‘IBIM’), is designed both to enable us to be
well positioned for the significant growth which we anticipate in the global
financial services industry and to help us serve customers and clients well.
We continued to invest heavily across the Group in 2007, increasing the
number of employees who serve customers and clients and developing
our distribution networks. 
In IBIM I believe that we handled well the stress test of market turbulence
in the second half of 2007. Both Barclays Capital and Barclays Global
Investors ended 2007 with profits ahead of 2006, which was a year 
of rapid growth and record profitability for both. We have benefited
significantly from the business diversification that we have pursued 
in recent years: the development of capabilities by Barclays Capital in
commodities, foreign exchange and equity products enabled us to deliver
excellent income growth in those areas. The cost flexibility that we have
built into the business model here has also served shareholders well,
enabling us to reduce expenses year on year, and improve the cost:net
income and compensation ratios. In Barclays Global Investors, iShares’
assets under management grew over $100bn to $408bn, and this growth
illustrates the significant diversification of Barclays Global Investors
earnings base that we have engineered in recent years. Meanwhile
Barclays Wealth is making good progress towards the achievement of its
profit goal of £500m in the medium term, benefiting as it is from proximity
to the structuring and manufacturing capabilities of Barclays Capital and
Barclays Global Investors. 
“Barclays delivered a resilient
performance in 2007 , with profits
broadly in line with the record
prior year results. The strength of
our diversified businesses gives us
confidence for the period ahead” 1
Business review
We are building significant momentum in GRCB. In particular, we have
been growing distribution to create a much broader business base for the
years ahead. During 2007, we opened over 600 new branches and sales
centres outside the United Kingdom, increasing by over one third the
number of distribution points across these parts of our GRCB business.
This growth is feeding through powerfully into activity levels. Income
increased 28% in International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding
Absa in 2007. Absa performed well, including delivering on its synergy
target 18 months ahead of schedule. 
In UK Banking, we delivered a further two percentage points improvement
in our cost:income ratio, excluding the impact of the settlement on
overdraft fees, bringing the total to eight percentage points improvement
over three years compared with our target of six percentage points. The
turnaround of UK Retail Banking continued during 2007, with strong
income growth in core product areas, including mortgages. We have
announced our intention to reduce UK Retail Banking’ s cost:income ratio by
a further three percentage points over the next three years. In Barclaycard,
we have made excellent progress towards our goal of re-establishing 
a leadership position in the United Kingdom and in the aggressive
expansion of our International Cards business. Profits in Barclaycard grew
strongly in 2007 as we reduced the impairment charge in the UK, and
moved Barclaycard International, including Barclaycard US, into profit.
In reviewing our use of capital and assets, our principal focus has been on
the risk weighted balance sheet rather than the nominal balance sheet.
Whilst we monitor internally a range of different ratios, our publicly
expressed target has been to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk
weighted assets of 7.25%. At the end of 2007 we were comfortably ahead
of that target under both Basel I and Basel II measurement bases. Risk
weighted asset growth in 2007 was 19%, a brisker rate than in recent
years reflecting in part the syndication constraints of the second half of 
the year. We expect the rate of growth in risk weighted assets in 2008 to
be slower than that of 2007. 
We have increased the dividend by 10% to 34p (2006: 31p), which
includes a final dividend of 22.5p (2006: 20.5p). The maintenance of 
our policy of growing dividends broadly in line with the rate of underlying
earnings over time reflects the Board’ s confidence in the future. Our
dividend remains more than twice covered by earnings, which we believe
is consistent with the funding requirements of our organic growth plans.
We have announced new multi-year performance goals. These are
designed to stretch us, and we see them as reflective of the potential that
exists within our businesses and our people. As in 2003, when we last set
new goals, we aim to achieve significant growth in economic profit over
the next four years and thereby to deliver top quartile Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) relative to our competitor peer group. 
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 9
Over the last four years Barclays achieved a cumulative total of £8.3bn 
of economic profit, against a target range of £6.5bn to £7.0bn. Despite
exceeding our economic profit goal by some way, we ranked in the third
quartile of our peer group in terms of TSR which was a disappointing
outcome.
Our new goal is to generate a cumulative total of between £9.3bn and
£10.6bn of economic profit between 2008 and 2011. This represents an
annual growth rate in economic profit of 5% to 10%. We estimate that 
if we achieve the upper end of the range, we will also achieve our goal of
top quartile TSR relative to our peer group.
I am pleased to report that our strategic collaboration with China
Development Bank is off to a good start. This is an important part of 
our long term plans to develop a more significant presence in emerging
markets, particularly Asia where group profits more than doubled in 2007,
and I look forward to reporting to shareholders on the growing returns 
that we will generate from this relationship in the coming years.
This has been a challenging year for our staff, and we have them to thank
for delivering the results we have achieved despite multiple distractions in
difficult market circumstances. I am proud of their commitment to putting
our customers first and I am confident that we enter our new goal period
with a team as good as any in the banking industry.
What is the outlook for 2008? We see another year in which global
economic growth will be 4%, or something close to that. The emerging
economies account for about a third of global GDP , but they account for
two thirds of global GDP growth and they continue to perform strongly.
However, in many economies of the developed world, there will be a slow-
down, and in particular we expect economic growth in the UK and the US
to be below the trend of recent years. In an environment such as this we
will have to be disciplined in our risk management and rigorous in our
approach to lending. But our experience of 2007 gives us confidence, and
we enter 2008 with a strong capital base, a consistent strategic direction, 
a well diversified set of businesses and significant opportunities for growth
in the medium term.
John Varley
Group Chief Executive Key performance indicators
10 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Total Shareholder Return
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is defined as the value created 
for shareholders through share price appreciation, plus reinvested
dividend payments. 
At the end of 2003, Barclays established a set of four year performance
goals for the period 2004 to 2007 inclusive. The primary goal was to achieve
top quartile TSR relative to a peer group of financial services companies.
The TSR peer group is regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains aligned
to our business mix and the direction and scale of our ambition. The peer
group for 2007 was: Banco Santander, BBV A, BNP Paribas, Citigroup,
Deutsche Bank, HBOS, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank 
of Scotland and UBS. Banco Santander replaced ABN AMRO in this peer
group during 2007. Barclays delivered TSR of 20.4% for the goal period
and was positioned 8th within its peer group (third quartile) for the goal
period commencing 1 st January 2004.
Economic Profit
Economic profit (EP) is the measurement used to support the pursuit of
the top quartile TSR goal. EP is profit after tax and minorities less a capital
charge (average shareholder’ s equity and goodwill excluding minority
interests multiplied by the Group cost of capital). Barclays uses EP , a non-
IFRS measure, as a key indicator of performance because it believes that 
it provides important discipline in decision making.  Barclays believes 
that EP encourages both profitable growth and the efficient use of capital. 
At the time of setting the TSR goal, we estimated that achieving top
quartile TSR would require the achievement of compound annual 
growth in economic profit in the range of 10% to 13% per annum 
(£6.5bn to £7.0bn of cumulative economic profit) over the 2004 to 2007
goal period. Economic profit for 2007 was £2.3bn, which, added to the
£6.0bn generated in 2004, 2005 and 2006, delivered a cumulative total 
of £8.3bn for the goal period. Therefore Barclays has delivered 128% of 
the minimum range and 119% of the upper range of the cumulative 
economic profit goal in the goal period.
Barclays strategic priorities are to:
– Build the best bank in the UK
– Accelerate growth of global businesses
– Develop Retail and Commercial Banking 
activities in selected countries outside the UK
– Enhance operational excellence
A range of financial and non-financial key performance
indicators (KPIs) are monitored at both a Group and
business level to assess progress against these 
strategic goals. Group KPIs are detailed here, business
specific performance indicators are detailed within the
analysis of results by business. Further non-financial
performance indicators are detailed within the Corporate
sustainability section.

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 11
Dividends per share
We aim to grow our dividend broadly in line with the rate of growth in
underlying earnings over time.
The 2007 dividend of 34p per share represents an increase of 10% 
on 2006. Over the three years to 2007 we have increased our dividend 
by a compound annual rate of 13% per annum.
Return on average shareholder equity 
This ratio shows the return we are making on the money our shareholders’
have invested in us and is calculated as the profit after tax and minority
interests divided by the average shareholders’ funds. Investment decisions
are made within strict return criteria in the knowledge that investors have
a choice of where to invest.
In 2007 our return on average shareholders equity was 20.3% compared to
24.7% in 2006. Over the past three years the average return has been 22%.
Profit diversification
The diversification of profit both by geography and by business line are
strategic priorities for Barclays with the aim of increasing the proportion 
of our business conducted outside our UK Banking franchise. In 2007 two
thirds of profits were made outside UK Banking businesses which is a result
of the transformation of the Group over recent years. 
2008 to 2011 goal period
Barclays has established a new set of four year performance goals for the
period from 2008 to 2011 inclusive. The primary goal is to achieve compound
annual growth in economic profit in the range of 5% to 10% (£9.3bn to
£10.6bn of cumulative economic profit) over the 2008 to 2011 goal period.
We believe that if we achieve the upper end of the economic profit range,
we will also achieve our goal of top quartile TSR relative to our peer group
of financial services companies.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax is a key indicator of financial performance to the majority
of our stakeholders.
From 2005 to 2007 profit before tax grew at a compound rate of 16% per
annum. 2006 included £323m of profit relating to business disposals;
profit before disposals increased 3% in 2007.
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share (EPS) is a key indicator of performance for our
shareholders. EPS is measured as the profit attributable to shareholders

Cost:income Ratio 
Cost:income ratio is defined as operating expenses compared to total
income net of insurance claims and is a measure management use to
assess the productivity of the business operations. 
We target a top quartile cost:income ratio for each of our businesses
relative to their peers.
In 2005 we set a specific cost:income ratio target for UK Banking; to improve
the cost:income ratio by two percentage points in each of 2005, 2006 and
2007. We have exceeded this over the period with the cost:income ratio
improving by eight percentage points over the period to 48%, excluding the
impact of settlements on overdraft fees in relation to prior years.
Revenue Mix
The mix of income is an important indicator of financial health, being a
demonstration of the diversification of business lines and of the dependency
on the balance sheet to drive income growth. It is measured as the
proportion of non-net interest income within total income. Over time 
we aim to increase this proportion.
The percentage of non-net interest income within total income has
increased from 55% to 59% over the three years of review.

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 13
Tier 1 Capital Ratio
Capital requirements are part of the regulatory framework governing how
banks and depository institutions are managed. Capital ratios measure
the percentage of a bank’ s capital to its risk weighted assets. Tier 1 capital
is defined by the FSA and consists largely of shareholders’ funds.
Barclays operates a centralised capital management model, considering
both regulatory and economic capital. Decisions on the allocation of
capital resources, conducted as part of the strategic planning review, 
are based on a number of factors including returns on economic and
regulatory capital. 
The Group’ s capital management activities seek to maximise shareholder
value by optimising the level and mix of its capital resources. The Group’ s
capital management objectives are to:
– Support the Group’s AA credit rating.
– Maintain sufficient capital resources to support the Group’s risk
appetite and economic capital requirements.
– Maintain sufficient capital resources to meet the FSA ’s minimum
regulatory capital requirements and the US Federal Reserve Bank’s
requirements that a financial holding company be well capitalised. 
– Ensure locally regulated subsidiaries can meet their minimum capital
requirements.
The key measure the Group uses to assess its capital strength is the Tier 1
capital ratio which represents Tier 1 capital compared to risk weighted
assets. The Group targets a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.25%.
Employee engagement
Employee opinion surveys are used extensively across the Group to
provide leaders with valuable insight to employee views. This is important
because research has consistently shown that committed people are a
crucial factor in achieving great customer service and excellent business
performance.
The participation levels in the surveys conducted in 2007 were the 
highest we have achieved.

16 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Group Performance 
Barclays financial performance in 2007 demonstrated the benefits of 
the successful execution of our strategic priorities in recent years. We
delivered profit before tax of £7,076m, broadly in line with the record
results of 2006 and up 3% excluding gains from business disposals.
Earnings per share were 68.9p and we increased the full year dividend
payout to 34p, a rise of 10%.
Income grew 7% to £23,000m, well ahead of expense growth. Growth
was well spread by business, with strong contributions from International
Retail and Commercial Banking, Barclays Global Investors and Barclays
Wealth. Net income, after impairment charges, grew 4% and included 
net losses of £1,635m relating to credit market turbulence, net of £658m
of gains arising from the fair valuation of notes issued by Barclays Capital
and settlements on overdraft fees in relation to prior years of £116m in 
UK Retail Banking.
Impairment charges and other credit provisions rose 30% to £2,795m.
Impairment charges relating to US sub-prime mortgages and other credit
market exposures were £782m. Excluding these sub-prime related
charges, impairment charges improved 7% to £2,013m. In UK Retail
Banking and Barclaycard, impairment charges improved significantly, as a
consequence of reductions in flows into delinquency and arrears balances
in UK cards and unsecured loans. UK mortgage impairment charges
remained negligible, with low levels of defaults, and the wholesale and
corporate sector remained stable. The significant increase in impairment
charges in International Retail and Commercial Banking was driven by very
strong book growth.
Operating expenses increased 4% to £13,199m. We invested in growing
the branch network and distribution channels in International Retail and
Commercial Banking and in infrastructure development in Barclays Global
Investors. Costs were lower in UK Banking and broadly flat in Barclays
Capital. Gains from property disposals were £267m (2006: £432m). 
The Group cost:income ratio improved two percentage points to 57%.
Business Performance – Global Retail and 
Commercial Banking 
In UK Banking we improved the cost:income ratio a further two
percentage points to 48%, excluding settlements on overdraft fees 
in relation to prior years. On this basis we have delivered a cumulative 
eight percentage point improvement in the past three years, well 
ahead of our target of six percentage points.
UK Retail Banking profit before tax grew 9% to £1,282m. Income grew
2% excluding settlements on overdraft fees in relation to prior years,
reflecting a very strong performance in Personal Customer Retail Savings
and good performances in Current Accounts, Local Business and Home
Finance, partially offset by lower income from loan protection insurance.
Enhancements in product offering and continued improvements in
processing capacity enabled a strong performance in mortgage
origination, with a share of net new lending of 8%. Operating expenses
were well controlled and improved 3%. Impairment charges improved
12% reflecting lower charges in unsecured consumer lending and Local
Business. This was driven by improvements in the collection process
which led to reduced flows into delinquency, lower levels of arrears and
stable charge-offs. Mortgage impairment charges remained negligible.
“We delivered profits of over 
£7 billion in 2007 showing 
the benefits of our business
diversification in recent years” 1
Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 17
Barclays Commercial Bank delivered profit before tax of £1,371m. Profit
before business disposals improved 5%. Income improved 7% driven by
very strong growth in fees and commissions and steady growth in net
interest income. Non-interest income increased to 32% of total income
reflecting continuing focus on cross sales and efficient balance sheet
utilisation. Operating expenses rose 6%, reflecting increased investment
in product development and support, sales force capability and
operational efficiency. Impairment charges increased £38m as a result 
of asset growth and higher charges in Larger Business.
Barclaycard profit before tax increased to £540m, 18% ahead of the prior
year. Steady income relative to 2006 reflected strong growth in Barclaycard
International offset by a reduction in UK card extended credit balances 
as we re-positioned the UK business and reduced lower credit quality
exposures including the sale of the Monument card portfolio. As a result,
impairment charges improved 21%, reflecting more selective customer
recruitment, client management and improved collections. Operating
expenses increased 12%, driven by continued investment in Barclaycard
International and the non-recurrence of a property gain included in the
2006 results. Barclaycard US continued to make good progress, and 
for the first time made a profit for the year.
International Retail and Commercial Banking profits declined 23% to
£935m. Results in 2006 included a £247m profit on disposals and £41m
post tax profit share from FirstCaribbean International Bank. 2007 results
reflected a 12% decline in the average value of the Rand.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa
delivered a profit before tax of £246m. Income rose 28% as we
significantly increased the pace of organic growth across the business,
with especially strong growth in Emerging Markets and Spain. Operating
expenses grew 32% as we expanded the distribution footprint, opening
324 new branches and 157 new sales centres and also invested in rolling
out a common technology platform and processes across the business.
Impairment increased to £79m including very strong balance sheet
growth and lower releases.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa Sterling profit fell
£9m to £689m after absorbing the 12% decline in the average value of 
the Rand. Absa Group Limited profit before tax grew 23% in Rand terms,
reflecting very strong growth in retail banking, corporate banking and 
Absa Capital (reported in Barclays Capital). Retail loans and advances grew
22% and retail deposits grew 20%. We delivered synergies of R1,428m,
achieving our synergy target 18 months ahead of schedule.
Business Performance – Investment Banking and
Investment Management
Barclays Capital improved on the record performance of 2006 delivering a
5% increase in profit before tax to £2,335m. Net income was ahead of last
year, reflecting very strong performances in most asset classes including
interest rates, currencies, equity products and commodities. Results also
included net losses arising from credit market turbulence of £1,635m net
of gains from the fair valuation of issued notes of £658m. All geographies
outside the US enjoyed significant growth in income and profits. Strong
cost control led to operating expenses declining slightly year on year. 
The cost:net income ratio improved by 1% to 63%.
Barclays Global Investors (BGI) profit before tax increased 3% to £734m.
Income grew 16%, driven by very strong growth in management fees 
and in securities lending revenues. Profit and income growth were both
affected by the 8% depreciation in the average value of the US Dollar. 
BGI costs increased 25% as we continued to build our infrastructure
across multiple products and platforms to support future growth. 
The cost:income ratio rose to 62%. Assets under management grew
US$265bn to US$2.1 trillion, including net new assets of US$86bn.
Barclays Wealth profit before tax rose 25% to £307m. Income growth
of 11% was driven by increased client funds and greater transaction
volumes. Costs were well controlled as business volumes rose and 
the cost:income ratio improved three percentage points to 76%. We
continued to invest in client facing staff and infrastructure. Redress 
costs declined. Total client assets increased 14% to £133bn.
Head office functions and other operations
Head Office functions and other operations loss before tax increased
65% to £428m reflecting higher inter-segment adjustments and lower
gains from hedging activities.
Capital management
At 31st December 2007, our Basel I Tier 1 Capital ratio was 7.8% 
(2006: 7.7%). We started managing capital ratios under Basel II from 
1st January 2008. Our Basel II Tier 1 Capital ratio was 7.6%. Our Equity 
Tier 1 ratio was 5.0% under Basel I (2006: 5.3%) and 5.1% under Basel II.
We have increased the proposed dividend payable to shareholders in
respect of 2007 by 10%. We maintain our progressive approach to
dividends, expecting dividend growth broadly to match earnings growth
over time.

Performance
2007/06
UK Retail Banking profit before tax increased 9% (£101m) to £1,282m
(2006: £1,181m) due to reduced costs and a strong improvement in
impairment.
Income grew 2% (£67m) before the impact of settlements on overdraft
fees in relation to prior years (£116m). This was driven by very strong
growth in Personal Customer retail savings and good growth in Personal
Customer current accounts, Home Finance and Local Business. Including
the impact of settlements on overdraft fees, income decreased £49m to
£4,297m (2006: £4,346m). 
Net interest income increased 3% (£93m) to £2,858m (2006: £2,765m).
Growth was driven by a higher contribution from deposits, through a
combination of good balance sheet growth and an increased liability
margin. T otal average customer deposit balances increased 7% to £81.9bn
(2006: £76.5bn), supported by the launch of new products. 
Mortgage volumes increased significantly , driven by an improved mix of
longer term value products for customers, higher levels of retention and
continuing improvements in processing capability . Mortgage balances
were £69.8bn at the end of the period (2006: £61.7bn), an approximate
market share of 6% (2006: 6%). Gross advances were 25% higher at
£23.0bn (2006: £18.4bn). Net lending was £8.0bn (2006: £2.4bn),
representing market share of 8% (2006: 2%). The average loan to value
ratio of the residential mortgage book on a current valuation basis was 33%.
The average loan to value ratio of new residential mortgage lending in 
2007 was 54%. Consumer Lending balances decreased 4% to £7.9bn
(2006: £8.2bn), reflecting the impact of tighter lending criteria. 
Overall asset margins decreased as a result of the increased proportion 
of mortgages and contraction in unsecured loans.
Net fee and commission income reduced 4% (£49m) to £1,183m (2006:
£1,232m). There was strong Current Account income growth in Personal
Customers and good growth within Local Business. This was more than
offset by settlements on overdraft fees. 
Net premiums from insurance underwriting activities reduced 26%
(£90m) to £252m (2006: £342m), as there continued to be lower
customer take-up of loan protection insurance. Net claims and benefits 
on insurance contracts increased to £43m (2006: £35m). 
Impairment charges decreased 12% (£76m) to £559m (2006: £635m)
reflecting lower charges in unsecured Consumer Lending and Local
Business. This was driven by improvements in the collection process which
led to reduced flows into delinquency , lower levels of arrears and stable
charge-offs. Mortgage impairment charges remained negligible.
Operating expenses reduced 3% (£69m) to £2,463m (2006: £2,532m),
reflecting strong and active management of all expense lines, targeted
processing improvements and back office consolidation. Gains from 
the sale of property were £193m (2006: £253m). Increased investment
was focused on improving the overall customer experience through
converting and improving the branch network; revitalising the product
offering; increasing operational and process efficiency; and meeting
regulatory requirements.
The cost:income ratio improved one percentage point to 57%. Excluding
the impact of settlements on overdraft fees, the cost:income ratio improved
two percentage points to 56%.

2006/05
UK Retail Banking profit before tax increased 10% (£105m) to £1,181m
(2005: £1,076m), driven by good income growth and well controlled costs.
There has been substantial additional investment to transform the business.
Income increased 7% (£269m) to £4,346m (2005: £4,077m), continuing
the momentum reported at the half year. Income growth was broadly based.
There was strong income growth in Personal Customers retail savings,
Local Business and UK Premier and good growth in Personal Customers
current account income. Sales volumes increased, with a particularly
strong performance from direct channels. 
Net interest income increased 3% (£88m) to £2,765m (2005: £2,677m).
Growth was driven by a higher contribution from deposits, through a
combination of good balance sheet growth and a stable liability margin.
Total average customer deposit balances increased 8% to £76.5bn 
(2005: £71.0bn), supported by new products. Growth of personal savings
was above that of the market. 
Mortgage volumes improved significantly, driven by a focus on improving
capacity, customer service, value and promotion. UK residential mortgage
balances ended the year at £61.7bn (2005: £59.6bn). Gross advances
were 60% higher at £18.4bn (2005: £11.5bn), with a market share of 5%
(2005: 4%). Net lending was £2.4bn, with performance improving during
the year, leading to a market share of 4% in the second half of the year.
The mortgage margin was reduced by changed assumptions used in the
calculation of effective interest rates, a higher proportion of new mortgages
and base rate changes. The new business spread was in line with the
industry. The loan to value ratio within the residential mortgage book 
on a current valuation basis was 34% (2005: 35%). 
There was good balance growth in non-mortgage loans, where Local
Business average balances increased 9% and UK Premier average
balances increased 25%. 
Net fee and commission income increased 16% (£167m) to £1,232m
(2005: £1,065m). There was strong current account income growth 
in Personal Customers and Local Business. UK Premier delivered strong
growth reflecting higher income from banking services, mortgage sales
and investment advice. 
Net premiums from insurance underwriting activities decreased 8%
(£30m) to £342m (2005: £372m). There continued to be lower customer
take-up of loan protection insurance. Net claims and benefits on insurance
contracts improved to £35m (2005: £61m). 
Impairment charges increased 29% (£141m) to £635m (2005: £494m).
The increase principally reflected balance growth and some deterioration
in delinquency rates in the Local Business loan book. Losses from the
mortgage portfolio remained negligible, with arrears at low levels.
Operating expenses were steady at £2,532m (2005: £2,501m). Gains
from the sale and leaseback of property amounted to £253m (2005: nil).
Investment in the business to improve customer service and deliver
sustainable performance improvements was directed at upgrading
distribution capabilities, including restructuring and improving the branch
network. Further investment was focused on upgrading the contact centres,
transforming the performance of the mortgage business, revitalising the
retail product range to meet customers’ needs, improving core operations
and processes and rationalising the number of operating sites. The level 
of investment reflected in operating expenses in 2006 was approximately
double the level of 2005.
The cost:income ratio improved three percentage points to 58% 
(2005: 61%).

Earlier this year, we launched our new brand – Barclays
Commercial Bank – to replace UK Business Banking. 
This new identity is much more than just a name change.
Instead, it more accurately reflects our current capabilities
and future aspirations, and it is scalable across markets. 
To complement the new identity, we also launched a clear
customer proposition. It comprises three elements: 
– relationship 
– specialisation
– innovation
These encapsulate our capability to deliver distinctive
service and solutions that meet our customers’ needs.
What we do
Barclays Commercial Bank provides banking services to organisations 
with an annual turnover of more than £1m. Customers are served via 
a network of relationship and industry sector specialists, which provides
solutions constructed from a comprehensive suite of banking products,
support, expertise and services, including specialist asset financing and
leasing facilities. 
We are a key component of the Barclays universal banking model,
delivering income in partnership with all the constituent business 
units of the Barclays Group.

Performance
2007/06
Barclays Commercial Bank profit before tax increased £6m to £1,371m
(2006: £1,365m) due to continued good income growth partially offset 
by lower gains from business disposals. Profit before business disposals
increased 5% to £1,357m (2006: £1,289m).
Income increased 7% (£159m) to £2,554m (2006: £2,395m). Non-
interest income increased to 32% of total income (2006: £29%), reflecting
continuing focus on cross sales and efficient balance sheet utilisation.
There was very strong growth in net fee and commission income, which
increased 17% (£107m) to £749m (2006: £642m) due to very strong
performance in lending fees. There was also good growth in transaction
related income, foreign exchange and derivatives transactions undertaken
on behalf of clients.
Net interest income improved 2% (£36m) to £1,738m (2006: £1,702m).
Average customer lendings increased 3% to £53.6bn (2006: £52.0bn)
and 5%, excluding the impact of the vehicle leasing and European vendor
finance businesses sold in 2006. Average customer accounts grew 4% to
£46.4bn (2006: £44.8bn). The asset margin decreased by twelve basis
points to 1.80%, reflecting an increased focus on higher quality lending
and competitive market conditions. The liabilities margin remained
broadly stable at 1.49%.
Income from principal transactions primarily reflecting venture capital and
other equity realisations increased 87% (£26m) to £56m (2006: £30m).
Impairment charges increased 15% (£38m) to £290m (2006: £252m),
mainly due to a higher level of impairment losses in Larger Business as
impairment trended towards risk tendency. There was a reduction in
impairment levels in Medium Business due to a tightening of the lending
criteria.
Operating expenses increased 6% (£50m) to £907m (2006: £857m).
Operating expenses are net of gains of £39m (2006: £60m) on the sale 
of property. Growth in operating expenses was focused on continuing
investment in operations, infrastructure, and new initiatives in product
development and sales capability.

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 29
Income from principal transactions was £30m (2005: £17m), primarily
reflecting the profit realised on a number of equity investments. 
As expected, impairment rates trended upwards during the year towards 
a more normalised level. Impairment increased 42% (£75m) to £252m
(2005: £177m), with the increase mainly reflecting higher charges from
Medium Business and balance growth. Impairment charges in Larger
Business were stable.
Operating expenses increased 4% (£32m) to £857m (2005: £825m).
Cost growth reflected higher volumes, increased expenditure on front line
staff and the costs of Iveco Finance for a full year. Operating expenses
included a credit of £60m on the sale and leaseback of property. Increased
investment was focused on the acceleration of the rationalisation of
operating sites and technology infrastructure. 
The cost:income ratio improved two percentage points to 36% 
(2005: 38%).
Profit on disposals of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of £76m
(2005: £nil) arose from the sales of interests in vehicle leasing and
European vendor finance businesses.

Who we are
We are a multi-brand international credit card and
consumer lending business. Our credit card was the 
first to be launched in the UK in 1966 and is now one 
of the leading credit card businesses in Europe, with 
a fast growing business in the US.
What we do
UK
Our activities include all Barclaycard branded credit cards, the FirstPlus
secured lending business and the retail finance business Barclays Partner
Finance. In addition to these activities, Barclaycard also operates partnership
cards with leading brands including SkyCard and the Thomas Cook 
Credit Card. We continue to lead the UK market with the launch in 2007 
of Barclaycard OnePulse, the UK’ s first contactless card, and Barclaycard
Breathe, the first card to donate a percentage of its profits to carbon
reduction projects around the world.
International
Barclaycard’ s international presence is extensive. In 2007, 3 out of every 
4 cards issued by Barclaycard were in markets outside the UK and we have
8.8m international cards in issue. We currently operate across Europe and
the United States where we are the fastest growing credit card business. In
Scandinavia we operate through Entercard, a joint venture with Swedbank. 
Barclaycard Business

Performance
2007/06
Barclaycard profit before tax increased 18% (£82m) to £540m (2006:
£458m), driven by strong international growth coupled with a significant
improvement in UK impairment charges. Other income included a £27m
loss on disposal of part of the Monument card portfolio. 2006 results
reflected a property gain of £38m. 
Income decreased 1% (£28m) to £2,486m (2006: £2,514m) reflecting
strong growth in Barclaycard International, offset by a decline in UK Cards
revenue resulting from a more cautious approach to lending in the UK and
a £27m loss on disposal of part of the Monument card portfolio.
Net interest income increased 1% (£11m) to £1,394m (2006: £1,383m)
due to strong organic growth in international average extended credit 
card balances, up 32% to £3.3bn and average secured consumer lending
balances up 26% to £4.3bn, partially offset by lower UK average extended
credit card balances which fell 14% to £6.9bn. Margins fell to 6.59%
(2006: 7.13%) due to higher average base rates across core operating
markets and a change in the product mix with an increased weighting 
to secured lending.
Net fee and commission income fell 2% (£26m) to £1,080m (2006:
£1,106m) with growth in Barclaycard International offset by our actions 
in response to the Office of Fair Trading’ s findings on late and overlimit fees
in the UK which were implemented in August 2006.
Impairment charges improved 21% (£229m) to £838m (2006: £1,067m)
reflecting reduced flows into delinquency, lower levels of arrears and 
lower charge-offs in UK Cards. We made changes to our impairment
methodologies to standardise our approach and in anticipation of Basel II.
The net positive impact of these changes in methodology was offset by an
increase in impairment charges in Barclaycard International and secured
consumer lending.
Operating expenses increased 12% (£120m) to £1,101m (2006: £981m).
Excluding a property gain of £38m in 2006, operating expenses increased
8% (£82m) reflecting continued investment in expanding our businesses
in Europe and the US. Costs in the UK businesses were broadly flat, with
investment in new UK product innovations such as Barclaycard OnePulse
being funded out of operating efficiencies.
Barclaycard International continued to gain momentum, delivering a 
profit before tax of £77m against a loss before tax of £36m in 2006. 
We concluded seven new credit card partnership deals across Western
Europe. The Entercard joint venture continued to perform ahead of plan
and entered the Danish market, extending its reach across the Scandinavian
region. Barclaycard US was profitable, with very strong average balance
growth and a number of new card partnerships including Lufthansa
Airlines and Princess Cruise Lines.

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 31
2006/05
Barclaycard profit before tax decreased 28% (£181m) to £458m 
(2005: £639m) as good income growth was more than offset by 
higher impairment charges and increased costs from the continued
development of international businesses. 
Income increased 9% (£215m) to £2,514m (2005: £2,299m) reflecting
very strong momentum in Barclaycard US and strong performances in
Barclaycard Business, FirstPlus, SkyCard and continental European markets.
Net interest income increased 12% (£152m) to £1,383m (2005:
£1,231m) due to strong growth in International average extended credit
card balances up 39% to £2.5bn (2005: £1.8bn) and average secured
consumer lending balances up 55% to £3.4bn (2005: £2.2bn), partly
offset by UK average extended credit card balances down 7% to £8.0bn
(2005: £8.6bn), reflecting the impact of tighter lending criteria. 
Margins increased to 7.13% (2005: 7.11%), due to the impact of increased
card rates and a reduced proportion of promotional rate balances in the UK. 
Net fee and commission income increased 4% (£41m) to £1,106m 
(2005: £1,065m) as a result of increased contributions from Barclaycard
International, SkyCard, FirstPlus and Barclaycard Business. Barclaycard
reduced its late and overlimit fee charges in the UK on 1st August 2006 
in response to the Office of Fair Trading’ s findings. 
Investment income of £15m (2005: £nil) represents the gain arising 
from the sale of part of the stake in MasterCard Inc, following its flotation.
Impairment charges increased 42% (£314m) to £1,067m (2005: £753m).
The increase was driven by a rise in delinquent balances and increased
numbers of bankruptcies and Individual Voluntary Arrangements. 
As a result of management action in 2005 and 2006 to tighten lending
criteria and improve collection processes, the flows of new delinquencies
reduced, and levels of arrears balances declined in the second half of 
2006 in UK cards.
Operating expenses increased 8% (£73m) to £981m (2005: £908m). 
This included a £38m gain from the sale and leaseback of property.
Excluding this item, underlying operating expenses increased 12%
(£111m) to £1,019m. This was largely as a result of continued 
investment in Barclaycard International, particularly Barclaycard US, 
and the development of UK partnerships.
Barclaycard International continued its growth strategy in the continental
European business delivering solid results. The Entercard joint venture,
which is based in Scandinavia, performed ahead of plan. Barclaycard
International loss before tax reduced to £36m (2005: loss £44m), including
the loss before tax for Barclaycard US of £57m (2005: loss £60m).
Barclaycard US continued to perform ahead of expectations, delivering
very strong growth in balances and customer numbers and creating 
a number of new partnerships including US Airways, Barnes & Noble,
Travelocity and Jo-Ann Stores. 
Barclaycard UK customer numbers declined 1.4 million to 9.8 million
(2005: 11.2 million). This reflected the closure of 1.5 million accounts 
that had been inactive.

Performance
2007/06
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa profit before
tax decreased 53% (£272m) to £246m (2006: £518m). Profit before tax
in 2006 included a £247m gain on the sale of associate FirstCaribbean
International Bank and a £41m share of its post-tax results. Profit before
tax in 2007 included gains from the sale and leaseback of property in 2007
of £23m (2006: £55m). The performance reflected very strong income
growth driven by a rapid growth in distribution points to 1,348 (2006:
867) as well as the launch of new businesses in India and UAE and a full
retail and commercial banking offering in Italy.
Income increased 28% (£293m) to £1,339m (2006: £1,046) driven by
excellent performances in Western Europe and Emerging Markets. 
Net interest income increased 25% (£149m) to £753m (2006: £604m).
Total average customer loans increased 22% (£6.1bn) to £33.3bn (2006:
£27.2bn) with lending margins broadly stable. Mortgage balance growth
in Western Europe was very strong, with average Euro balances up 16%
(¤4.2bn) to ¤30.1bn (2006: ¤25.9bn). Average customer deposits
increased 20% (£2.1bn) to £12.5bn (2006: £10.4bn) driven by growth in
Western Europe and Emerging Markets.
Net fee and commission income grew 16% (£59m) to £425m (2006:
£366m), reflecting strong performances in Western Europe driven by the
expansion of the customer base.
Principal transactions increased £94m to £177m (2006: £83m) reflecting
gains on equity investments and higher foreign exchange income across
Emerging Markets. 
Impairment charges rose 93% (£38m) to £79m (2006: £41m). The increase
reflected very strong balance sheet growth in 2006 and 2007 and the
impact of lower releases in 2007. 
Operating expenses grew 32% (£249m) to £1,023m (2006: £774m)
driven by the rapid expansion of the distribution network across all regions
and investment in people and infrastructure to support future growth
across the franchise. Operating expenses included property sales in Spain
of £23m (2006: £55m).
Western Europe continued to perform strongly. Profit before tax increased
30% (£56m) to £245m (2006: £189m). Barclays Spain profit before tax
increased 53% (£72m) to £207m (2006: £135m) driven by increased
customer lending, higher service commissions and equity investment
realisations. France also performed well driven by good growth in the
balance sheet, higher fees and commissions and good cost control.
Income grew very strongly in Italy as a result of the opening of new
branches and the roll-out of a complete retail and commercial banking
offering but this was more than offset by higher investment costs. Profit
before tax decreased in Portugal, with very strong income growth offset 
by increased investment in the expansion of the business. 
Emerging Markets profit before tax increased 25% (£28m) to £142m
(2006: £114m) reflecting a very strong rise in income across a broad range
of markets, with particularly strong growth in Egypt, UAE, Kenya, Ghana,
Tanzania, Uganda and India. The income growth benefited from increased
investment in the business across all geographies, including branch
openings and the launch of retail banking services in India and the UAE.

2006/05
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa profit before
tax increased 76% (£223m) to £518m (2005: £295m), including a gain on
the disposal of the interest in FirstCaribbean International Bank of £247m.
This reflected good growth in continental Europe offset by a decline in
profits in Africa caused by higher impairment, and increased costs
reflecting a step change in the rate of organic investment in the business. 
Income increased 7% (£64m) to £1,046m (2005: £982m). 
Net interest income increased 8% (£47m) to £604m (2005: £557m),
reflecting strong balance sheet growth in continental Europe, Africa and
the Middle East, and the development of the corporate business in Spain.
Total average customer loans increased 20% to £27.2bn (2005: £22.7bn).
Mortgage balance growth in continental Europe was particularly strong,
with average Euro balances up 22%. There was a modest decline in lending
margins partly driven by a greater share of mortgage assets as a proportion
of the total book in continental Europe. Average customer deposits
increased 16% to £10.4bn (2005: £9.0bn), with deposit margins stable.
Net fee and commission income increased 16% (£50m) to £366m 
(2005: £316m). This reflected a strong performance from the Spanish
funds business, where average assets under management increased
11%, together with very strong growth in France, including the first full
year contribution of the ING Ferri business which was acquired on 
1st July 2005. Net fee and commission income showed solid growth in
Africa and the Middle East.
Principal transactions decreased £36m to £83m (2005: £119m). 
2005 included £23m from the redemption of preference shares in
FirstCaribbean International Bank.
Impairment charges increased £27m to £41m (2005: £14m). This
reflected the absence of one-off recoveries of £12m which arose in 2005 
in Africa and the Middle East, and strong balance sheet growth across 
the businesses.
Operating expenses increased 9% (£62m) to £774m (2005: £712m). 
This included gains from the sale and leaseback of property in Spain 
of £55m. Operating expenses also included incremental investment
expenditure of £25m to expand the distribution network and enhance 
IT and operational capabilities.
Barclays Spain continued to perform strongly. Profit before tax increased
21% (£30m) to £171m (2005: £141m), excluding net one-off gains on
asset sales of £32m (2005: £8m) and integration costs of £43m (2005:
£57m). This was driven by the continued realisation of benefits from
Banco Zaragozano, together with strong growth in assets under
management and solid growth in mortgages. 
Africa and the Middle East profit before tax decreased 9% (£12m) to
£126m (2005: £138m) driven by higher impairment charges reflecting
one-off recoveries of £12m that arose in 2005 and an increase in
investment expenditure.
Profit before tax increased strongly in Portugal reflecting good flows of
new customers and increased business volumes. France also performed
well as a result of good organic growth and the acquisition of ING Ferri. 
The profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures of
£247m (2005: £nil) comprised the gain on the sale of Barclays interest 
in FirstCaribbean International Bank. The share of post-tax results of
FirstCaribbean International Bank included in 2006 was £41m (2005: £37m).

Performance
2007/06
Absa Group Limited’ s operating profit before income tax increased 
23% (R2,650m) to R14,067m  (2006: R11,417m) reflecting very good
performances from Retail Banking, Absa Capital and Absa Corporate and
Business Bank. Absa Group Limited delivered a return on equity of 27.2%
(2006: 27.4%). Key factors impacting the results included: very strong
asset and income growth; the diversification of earnings in favour of
investment banking and commercial banking; an increased retail credit
impairment charge, and the achievement of the Absa – Barclays synergy
target 18 months ahead of schedule.
Net operating income grew 17% (R4,852m) to R33,185m 
(2006: R28,333m).
Net interest income grew 27% (R4,003m) to R18,890m (2006: R14,887m)
driven by growth in loans and advances and deposits at improved margins.
Loans and advances to customers increased 22% from 31st December
2006 driven by growth of 23% in mortgages and 23% in credit cards.
Non-interest income grew 11% (R1,709m) to R16,728m (2006: R15,019m)
driven by increased transaction volumes in retail banking and Absa
Corporate and Business Bank, as well as advisory fees from Absa Capital.
Impairment charges on loans and advances increased 55% (R860m) to
R2,433m (2006: R1,573m) from the cyclically low levels of recent years.
Arrears in retail portfolios increased driven by interest rate increases in
2006 and 2007. Impairment charges as a percentage of loans and
advances was 0.58%, ahead of the 0.45% charge in 2006 but within 
long-term industry averages.
Operating expenses increased 15% (R2,353m) to R18,442m, (2006:
R16,089m) resulting from increased investment in new distribution
outlets and staff in order to support continued growth in volumes and
customers. The cost:income ratio improved two percentage points from
54% to 52%.
Excellent progress was made with the realisation of synergy benefits of
R1,428m to date thus achieving the synergy target of R1.4bn, 18 months
ahead of schedule.
Impact on Barclays results
Absa Group Limited's profit before tax of R14,067m (2006: R11,417m) is
translated into Barclays results at an average exchange value of R14.11/£
(2006: R12.47/£), a 12% depreciation in the average value of the Rand
against Sterling. Consolidation adjustments reflected the amortisation of
intangible assets of £55m (2006: £75m) and internal funding and other
adjustments of £98m (2006: £72m). The resulting profit before tax of
£844m (2006: £769m) is represented within International Retail and
Commercial Banking – Absa £689m, (2006: £698m) and Barclays Capital,
£155m (2006: £71m).
Absa Group Limited’ s total assets were R640,909m (2006: R495,112m),
growth of 29%. This is translated into Barclays results at a period-end
exchange rate of R13.64/£ (2006: R13.71/£). The capital investment 
was hedged against currency movements in 2007.

2006/05
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa profit before tax
increased 134% to £698m (2005: £298m) reflecting the full year to 
31st December 2006 compared with the five months ended 31st
December 2005. Barclays acquired a controlling stake in Absa Group
Limited on 27th July 2005.
In the commentary below, the comparable period referred to, for
illustrative purposes only, is the proforma full year to 31st December 2005
and is based on performance in Rand.
Absa Group Limited’ s profit before tax increased 24% reflecting a very
good performance from banking operations, with retail, corporate and
business banking operations performing exceptionally well. Absa Group
Limited delivered a return on equity of 27.4% (2005: 25.6%). Key factors
impacting the results included very strong asset growth, strong revenue
growth, an increased credit impairment charge, the realisation of
synergies from leveraging Barclays expertise and economies of scale and
the sale of non-core operations. The South African economy continued to
expand at a solid pace with real growth expected to be about 4.9% for
2006 (2005: 5.1%).
Net interest income grew 27%. Loans and advances to customers
increased 26% underpinned by very strong growth in mortgages, credit
cards and commercial property finance.
Non-interest income increased 12% reflecting higher transaction volumes,
strong growth in insurance related earnings and gains on asset sales. 
As expected the impairment charge on loans and advances increased
from the very low levels of the prior year, particularly in Absa Home Loans,
Absa Card and Retail Banking Services. 
Operating expenses increased 14% resulting from increased investment
in the business in order to support continued growth in volumes and
customers.
Excellent progress was made with the realisation of synergy benefits. 
In 2006 synergies of R753m were delivered, in excess of the target
originally communicated for the year. Integration costs for the period 
were in line with expectations.
Impact on Barclays results
Absa Group Limited’ s profit before tax of R11,417m is translated into
Barclays results at an average exchange rate for 2006 of R12.47/£ 
(2005: R11.57/£). Consolidation adjustments reflected the amortisation 
of intangible assets of £75m and internal funding and other adjustments
of £72m. The resulting profit before tax of £769m (2005: £337m) is
represented with International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa
£698m, (2005: £298m) and Barclays Capital, £71m (2005: £39m).
Absa Group Limited’ s total assets at 31st December 2006 were
R495,112m (31st December 2005: R404,561m), growth of 22%. 
This is translated into Barclays results at a year-end exchange rate of
R13.71/£ (31st December 2005: R10.87/£). The consolidation of total
assets reflected the impact of the 21% depreciation in the Rand largely
offsetting the growth in the Rand balance sheet.

Performance
2007/06
Barclays Capital delivered profits ahead of the record results achieved in
2006 despite challenging trading conditions in the second half of the year.
Profit before tax increased 5% (£119m) to £2,335m (2006: £2,216m).
There was strong income growth across the Rates businesses and
excellent results in Continental Europe, Asia and Africa demonstrating the
breadth of the client franchise. Net income was slightly ahead at £6,273m
(2006: £6,225m) and costs were tightly managed, declining slightly year
on year. Absa Capital delivered very strong growth in profit before tax to
£155m (2006: £71m).
The US sub-prime driven market dislocation affected performance in the
second half of 2007. Exposures relating to US sub-prime were actively
managed and declined over the period. Barclays Capital’ s 2007 results
reflected net losses related to the credit market turbulence of £1,635m, 
of which £795m was included in income, net of £658m gains arising from
the fair valuation of notes issued by Barclays Capital. Impairment charges
included £840m against ABS CDO Super Senior exposures, other credit
market exposures and drawn leveraged finance underwriting positions.
Income increased 14% (£852m) to £7,119m (2006: £6,267m) as a result
of very strong growth in interest rate, currency, equity, commodity and
emerging market asset classes. There was excellent income growth in
continental Europe, Asia, and Africa. Average DVaR increased 13% to
£42m (2006: £37.1m) in line with income.
Secondary income, comprising principal transactions (net trading income
and net investment income), is mainly generated from providing client
financing and risk management solutions. Secondary income increased
11% (£578m) to £5,871m (2006: £5,293m).
Net trading income increased 5% (£177m) to £3,739m (2006: £3,562m)
with strong contributions from fixed income, commodities, equities,
foreign exchange and prime services businesses. These were largely offset
by net losses in the business affected by sub-prime mortgage related write
downs. The general widening of credit spreads that occurred over the
course of the second half of 2007 also reduced the carrying value of the
£57bn of issued notes held at fair value on the balance sheet, resulting in
gains of £658m. Net investment income increased 66% (£380m) to
£953m (2006: £573m) as a result of a number of private equity realisations,
investment disposals in Asia and structured capital markets transactions.
Net interest income increased 2% (£21m) to £1,179m (2006: £1,158m),
driven by higher contributions from money markets. The corporate
lending portfolio increased 29% to £52.3bn (2006: £40.6bn), largely due
to an increase in drawn leveraged finance positions and a rise in drawn
corporate loan balances.
Primary income, which comprises net fee and commission income 
from advisory and origination activities, grew 30% (£283m) to £1,235m
(2006: £952m), with good contributions from bonds and loans.
Impairment charges and other credit provisions of £846m included £722m
against ABS CDO Super Senior exposures, £60m from other credit market
exposures and £58m relating to drawn leveraged finance underwriting
positions. Other impairment charges on loans and advances amounted 
to a release of £7m (2006: £44m release) before impairment charges on
available for sale assets of £13m (2006: £86m).

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 39
Operating expenses decreased 1% (£36m) to £3,973m (2006: £4,009m).
The cost:net income ratio improved to 63% (2006: 64%) and the
compensation cost:net income ratio improved by two percentage points
to 47% (2006: 49%). Performance related pay, discretionary investment
spend and short term contractor resources represented 42% (2006: 50%)
of the cost base. Amortisation of intangible assets of £54m (2006: £13m)
principally related to mortgage service rights.
Total headcount increased 3,000 during 2007 to 16,200 (2006: 13,200)
including 800 from the acquisition of EquiFirst. The majority of organic
growth was in Asia Pacific.
2006/05
Profit before tax increased 55% (£785m) to £2,216m (2005: £1,431m).
This was the result of a very strong income performance, driven by 
higher business volumes, continued growth in client activity and
favourable market conditions. Net income increased 42% (£1,831m) 
to £6,225m (2005: £4,394m). Profit before tax for Absa Capital was 
£71m (2005: £39m). 
Income increased 39% (£1,762m) to £6,267m (2005: £4,505m) as a
result of very strong growth across the Rates, Credit and Private Equity
businesses. Income increased in all geographic regions. Average DVaR
increased 16% to £37.1m (2005: £32.0m) significantly below the rate 
of income growth.
Secondary income increased 43% (£1,584m) to £5,293m 
(2005: £3,709m).
Net trading income increased 60% (£1,331m) to £3,562m (2005:
£2,231m) with very strong contributions across the Rates and Credit
businesses, in particular, commodities, fixed income, equities, credit
derivatives and emerging markets. The performance was driven by 
higher volumes of client led activity and favourable market conditions. 
Net investment income increased 39% (£160m) to £573m (2005: £413m)
driven by investment realisations, primarily in Private Equity, offset by
reduced contributions from credit products. Net interest income increased
9% (£93m) to £1,158m (2005: £1,065m) driven by a full year contribution
from Absa Capital. 
Primary income grew 23% (£176m) to £952m (2005: £776m). This
reflected higher volumes and continued market share gains in a number of
key markets, with strong contributions from issuances in bonds, European
leveraged loans and convertibles. 
Impairment charges of £42m (2005: £111m), including impairment on
available for sale assets of £86m (2005: £nil), were 62% lower than prior
year reflecting recoveries and the continued benign wholesale credit
environment.
Operating expenses increased 35% (£1,046m) to £4,009m (2005:
£2,963m), reflecting higher performance related costs, increased levels 
of activity and continued investment across the business. The cost:net
income ratio improved to 64% (2005: 67%) and the compensation to 
net income ratio improved to 49% (2005: 51%). Performance related pay,
discretionary investment spend and short-term contractor resource costs
represented 50% of operating expenses (2005: 46%). Amortisation of
intangible assets principally relates to mortgage service rights obtained 
as part of the purchase of HomEq.
Total headcount increased 3,300 during 2006 to 13,200 (2005: 9,900)
and included 1,300 from the acquisition of HomEq. Organic growth was
broadly based across all regions and reflected further investments in the
front office, systems development and control functions to support
continued business expansion.

Performance
2007/06
Barclays Global Investors delivered solid growth in profit before tax, which
increased 3% (£20m) to £734m (2006: £714m). Very strong US Dollar
income and strong profit growth was partially offset by the 8%
depreciation in the average value of the US Dollar against Sterling. 
Income grew 16% (£261m) to £1,926m (2006: £1,665m).
Net fee and commission income grew 17% (£285m) to £1,936m (2006:
£1,651m). This was primarily attributable to increased management fees
and securities lending. Incentive fees increased 6% (£12m) to £198m
(2006: £186m). Higher asset values, driven by higher market levels and
good net new inflows, contributed to the growth in income. 
Operating expenses increased 25% (£241m) to £1,192m (2006: £951m)
as a result of significant investment in key product and channel growth
initiatives and in infrastructure as well as growth in the underlying
business. Operating expenses included charges of £80m (2006: £nil)
related to selective support of liquidity products managed in the US. 
The cost:income ratio rose five percentage points to 62% (2006: 57%). 
Headcount increased 700 to 3,400 (2006: 2,700). Headcount increased 
in all geographical regions and across product groups and the support
functions, reflecting continued investment to support further growth.
Total assets under management increased 13% (£117bn) to £1,044bn
(2006: £927bn) comprising £42bn of net new assets, £12bn attributable
to the acquisition of Indexchange Investment AG (Indexchange), £66bn 
of favourable market movements and £3bn of adverse exchange
movements. In US$ terms assets under management increased 15%
US$265bn to US$2,079bn (2006: US$1,814bn), comprising US$86bn 
of net new assets, US$23bn attributable to acquisition of Indexchange,
US$127bn of favourable market movements and US$29bn of positive
exchange rate movements.

2006/05
Barclays Global Investors delivered another year of outstanding results.
Profit before tax increased 32% (£174m) to £714m (2005: £540m),
reflecting very strong income growth and higher operating margins. 
The performance was broadly based across products, distribution
channels and geographies. 
Net fee and commission income increased 27% (£354m) to £1,651m
(2005: £1,297m). This growth was attributable to increased management
fees, particularly in the iShares and active businesses, and securities
lending, offset by lower incentive fees. Incentive fees decreased 9% (£18m)
to £186m (2005: £204m). Higher asset values, driven by higher market
levels and good net new inflows, contributed to the growth in income. 
Operating expenses increased 22% (£172m) to £951m (2005: £779m)
as a result of significant investment in key growth initiatives, ongoing 
investment in product development and infrastructure and higher
performance-based expenses. The cost:income ratio improved two
percentage points to 57% (2005: 59%). 
Total headcount rose 400 to 2,700 (2005: 2,300). Headcount increased 
in all regions, across product groups and the support functions, reflecting
continued investment to support strategic initiatives. 
Total assets under management increased 5% (£46bn) to £927bn 
(2005: £881bn) primarily due to net new inflows of £37bn. The positive
market move impact of £98bn was largely offset by £89bn of adverse
exchange rate movements. In US$ terms assets under management
increased by US$301bn to US$1,814bn (2005: US$1,513bn), comprising
US$68bn of net new assets, US$177bn of favourable market movements
and US$56bn of positive exchange rate movements.

We work closely with all other parts of the Group to leverage synergies
from client relationships and product capabilities, for example, offering

services from Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors.
Key facts 2007 2006 2005
Total client assets £132.5bn £116.1bn £97.5bn
Performance 
2007/06
Barclays Wealth profit before tax showed very strong growth of 25%
(£62m) to £307m (2006: £245m). Performance was driven by broadly
based income growth, reduced redress costs and tight cost control,
partially offset by additional volume related costs and increased
investment in people and infrastructure to support future growth.
Income increased 11% (£127m) to £1,287m (2006: £1,160m).
Net interest income increased 10% (£39m) to £431m (2006: £392m)
reflecting strong growth in both customer deposits and lending. Average
deposits grew 13% to £31.2bn (2006: £27.7bn). Average lending grew
35% to £7.4bn (2006: £5.5bn) driven by increased lending to high net
worth, affluent and intermediary clients. Assets margin increased 3 basis
points to 1.11% (2006: 1.08%) reflecting changes in the product mix. 
The liabilities margin reduced by 7 basis points to 1.03% (2006: 1.10%)
driven by competitive pricing of products.
Net fee and commission income grew 10% (£65m) to £739m (2006:
£674m). This reflected growth in client assets and higher transactional
income from increased sales of investment products and solutions.
Principal transactions decreased £101m to £55m (2006: £156m) as 
a result of lower growth in the value of unit linked insurance contracts. 
Net premiums from insurance contracts reduced £15m to £195m (2006:
£210m). These reductions were offset by a lower charge for net claims and
benefits incurred under insurance contracts of £152m (2006: £288m). 
Operating expenses increased 7% to £973m (2006: £913m) with greater
volume related costs and a significant increase in investment partially
offset by efficiency gains and lower customer redress costs of £19m
(2006: £67m). Ongoing investment programmes included increased
hiring of client facing staff and improvements to infrastructure with the
upgrade of technology and operations platforms. The cost:income ratio
improved three percentage points to 76% (2006: 79%).
Total client assets, comprising customer deposits and client investments,
increased 14% (£16.4bn) to £132.5bn (2006: £116.1bn) reflecting strong
net new asset inflows and the acquisition of Walbrook, an independent
fiduciary services company, which completed on 18th May 2007.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 43
2006/05
Barclays Wealth profit before tax showed very strong growth of 49%
(£81m) to £245m (2005: £164m). Performance was driven by broadly
based income growth and favourable market conditions. This was partially
offset by additional volume related costs and a significant increase in
investment in people and infrastructure to support future growth.
Income increased 12% (£126m) to £1,160m (2005: £1,034m).
Net interest income increased 13% (£46m) to £392m (2005: £346m)
reflecting growth in both customer deposits and customer lending.
Average deposits grew 6% (£1.6bn) to £27.7bn (2005: £26.1bn). Average
lending grew 17% to £5.5bn (2005: £4.7bn), driven by increased lending
to offshore and private banking clients. Asset and liability margins were
higher relative to 2005.
Net fee and commission income increased 14% (£81m) to £674m 
(2005: £593m). This reflected growth in client assets and higher
transactional income, including increased sales of investment products 
to high net worth and affluent clients, and higher stockbroking volumes.
Operating expenses increased 5% (£45m) to £913m (2005: £868m) 
with greater volume related and investment costs more than offsetting
efficiency gains. Investment costs included increased hiring of client-
facing staff and improvements to infrastructure with the upgrade of
technology and operations platforms. The cost:income ratio improved 
five percentage points to 79% (2005: 84%).
Total client assets, comprising customer deposits and client investments,
increased 19% (£18.6bn) to £116.1bn (2005: £97.5bn) reflecting good
net new asset inflows and favourable market conditions. Multi-Manager
assets increased 68% (£4.1bn) to £10.1bn (2005: £6.0bn); this growth
included transfers of existing client assets.

Analysis of results by business
44 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Head office functions and 
other operations
Who we are
Head office functions and other operations comprises:
– Head office and central support functions
– Businesses in transition
– Inter segment adjustments.
What we do
Head office and central support functions comprises the following areas:
Executive Management, Finance, Treasury, Corporate Affairs, Human
Resources, Strategy and Planning, Internal Audit, Legal, Corporate
Secretariat, Property, Tax, Compliance and Risk. Costs incurred wholly 
on behalf of the businesses are recharged to them.
Businesses in transition principally relate to certain lending portfolios 
that are centrally managed with the objective of maximising recovery 
from the assets.
Performance
2007/06
Head office functions and other operations loss before tax increased
£169m to £428m (2006: £259m). 
Group segmental reporting is performed in accordance with Group
accounting policies. This means that inter-segment transactions are
recorded in each segment as if undertaken on an arm's length basis.
Adjustments necessary to eliminate inter-segment transactions are
included in Head office functions and other operations.
The impact of such inter-segment adjustments increased £86m to 
£233m (2006: £147m). These adjustments included internal fees for
structured capital market activities of £169m (2006: £87m) and fees 
paid to Barclays Capital for debt and equity raising and risk management
advice of £65m (2006: £23m), both of which increased net fee and
commission expense in head office. The impact on the inter-segment
adjustments of the timing of the recognition of insurance commissions
included in Barclaycard was a reduction in head office income of £9m
(2006: £44m). This net reduction was reflected in a decrease in net fee
and commission income of £162m (2006: £184m) and an increase in 
net premium income of £153m (2006: £140m).
Principal transactions decreased to a loss of £83m (2006: £42m profit).
2006 included a £55m profit from a hedge of the expected Absa foreign
currency earnings. 2007 included a loss of £33m relating to fair valuation
of call options embedded within retail US$ preference shares arising from
widening of own credit spreads.
Operating expenses decreased £35m to £234m (2006: £269m). 
The primary driver of this decrease was the receipt of a break fee relating
to the ABN AMRO transaction which, net of transaction costs, reduced
expenses by £58m. This was partially offset by lower rental income and
lower proceeds on property sales. 1
Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 45
2006/05
Head office functions and other operations loss before tax decreased
£64m to £259m (2005: loss £323m). 
Net interest income decreased £80m to £80m (2005: £160m) reflecting 
a reduction in net interest income in Treasury following the acquisition 
of Absa Group Limited. Treasury’ s net interest income also included the
hedge ineffectiveness for the period, which together with other related
Treasury adjustments amounted to a gain of £11m (2005: £18m) and 
the cost of hedging the foreign exchange risk on the Group’ s equity
investment in Absa, which amounted to £71m (2005: £37m).
The impact of such inter-segment adjustments reduced £72m to £147m
(2005: £219m). These adjustments related to internal fees for structured
capital market activities of £87m (2005: £67m) and fees paid to Barclays
Capital for capital raising and risk management advice of £23m (2005:
£39m), both of which reduce net fees and commission income. 
In addition the impact of the timing of the recognition of insurance
commissions included in Barclaycard and UK Retail Banking reduced to
£44m (2005: £113m). This reduction was reflected in a decrease in net fee
and commission income of £184m (2005: £185m) and an increase in net
premium income of £140m (2005: £72m).
Principal transactions decreased £51m to £42m (2005: £93m). 2005
included hedging related gains in Treasury of £80m. 2006 included £55m
(2005: £nil) in respect of the economic hedge of the translation exposure
arising from Absa foreign currency earnings.
The impairment charge improved £12m to a release of £11m (2005: £1m
charge) as a number of workout situations were resolved.
Operating expenses decreased £78m to £269m (2005: £347m) primarily
due to the expenses of the 2005 Head office relocation to Canary Wharf
not recurring in 2006 (2005: £105m) and the gains of £26m (2005: £nil)
from the sale and leaseback of property offset by increased costs,
principally driven by major project expenditure including work related 
to implementing Basel II.

2007/06
Group net interest income increased 5% (£467m) to £9,610m (2006:
£9,143m) reflecting balance sheet growth across a number of businesses. 
Group net interest income reflects structural hedges which function to
reduce the impact of the volatility of short-term interest rate movements
on equity and customer balances that do not re-price with market rates.
The contribution of structural hedges relative to average base rates
decreased to £351m expense (2006: £26m income), largely due to the
smoothing effect of the structural hedge on changes in interest rates.
Other interest expense principally includes interest on repurchase
agreements and hedging activity.
2006/05
Group net interest income increased 13% (£1,068m) to £9,143m 
(2005: £8,075m). The inclusion of Absa contributed net interest income 
of £1,138m (2005
b
: £516m). Group net interest income excluding Absa
grew 6%. 
The contribution of the structural hedge decreased to £26m (2005:
£145m), largely due to the impact of relatively higher short-term interest
rates and lower medium-term rates.

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 47
Business net interest income is derived from the interest rate earned on
average assets or paid on average liabilities relative to the average Bank 
of England base rate, local equivalents for international businesses or the
rate managed by the bank using derivatives. The margin is expressed as
annualised business interest income over the relevant average balance.
Asset and liability margins cannot be added together as they are relative 
to the average Bank of England base rate, local equivalent for international
businesses or the rate managed by the bank using derivatives. The benefit
of capital attributed to these businesses is excluded from the calculation 
of business margins and business net interest income.
Average balances are calculated on daily averages for most UK banking
operations and monthly averages elsewhere.
Within the reconciliation of Group net interest income, there is an amount
captured as Other. This relates to the benefit of capital excluded from the
business margin calculation, Head office functions and other operations
and net funding on non-customer assets and liabilities. 
2007/06
UK Retail Banking assets margin decreased 12 basis points to 1.20%
(2006: 1.32%) principally due to the increased proportion of mortgages
and the contraction in unsecured loans. UK Retail Banking liabilities 
margin increased 10 basis points to 2.15% (2006: 2.05%) due to pricing
initiatives and changes in the product mix.
Barclays Commercial Bank assets margin decreased by 12 basis points 
to 1.80% (2006: 1.92%) due to changes in the product mix. Barclays
Commercial Bank liabilities margin remained broadly stable at 1.49%
(2006: 1.46%).
Barclaycard assets margin decreased 54 basis points to 6.59% 
(2006: 7.13%) due to higher average base rates across core markets 
and an increased weighting to secured lending. 
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa assets
margin of 1.32% (2006: 1.29%) was broadly stable. International Retail
and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa liabilities margin decreased 
15 basis points to 1.91% (2006: 2.06%) primarily driven by changes in 
the product and country mix.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa assets margin
decreased 9 basis points to 2.86% (2006: 2.95%) due to increased
competition, increases in interest rates and changes in the product mix.
The liabilities margin increased 35 basis points to 3.25% (2006: 2.90%
a
)
driven by a re-pricing of customer deposits and higher interest rates.
Barclays Wealth assets margin increased 3 basis points to 1.11% 
(2006: 1.08%) due to changes in the product mix. The liabilities 
margin decreased seven basis points to 1.03% (2006: 1.10%) due 
to competitive pricing.
The impact of the structural hedge on customer balances has been
included within business margins and has smoothed the impact of
changing interest rates before the impact of changes in product mix 
or product pricing.
2006/05
UK Retail Banking assets margin decreased 11 basis points to 1.32%
(2005: 1.43%). The mortgage margin has been impacted by changed
assumptions used in the calculation of effective interest rates, a higher
proportion of new mortgages and base rate changes. This was partially
offset by increased contributions from non-mortgage assets. UK Retail
Banking liabilities margin was stable at 2.05% (2005: 2.02%).
Barclays Commercial Bank assets margin improved to 1.92% 
(2005: 1.87%). Barclays Commercial Bank liabilities margin was stable 
at 1.46% (2005: 1.46%).
Barclaycard assets margin was stable at 7.13% (2005: 7.11%).
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa assets
margin decreased 7 basis points to 1.29% (2005: 1.36%) partly reflecting
a greater share of mortgage assets as a proportion of the total book in
continental Europe. International Retail and Commercial Banking –
excluding Absa liabilities margin was stable at 2.06% (2005: 2.03%).
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa assets margin
decreased 57 basis points to 2.95% (2005
b
: annualised 3.52%) reflecting
a higher proportion of mortgage assets and competitive pressures in
mortgages and asset finance. International Retail and Commercial
Banking – Absa liabilities margin increased 51 basis points to 2.90%
(2005
b
: annualised 2.39%).
Barclays Wealth assets margin increased 12 basis points to 1.08% 
(2005: 0.96%) largely reflecting higher margins on new lending business
and a small increase in mortgage margins. The liabilities margin increased
6 basis points to 1.10% (2005: 1.04%) principally due to a slight increase
in currency deposit spreads.

of £896m (2005

grew 18%, driven by a broadly based performance across the Group,
particularly within Barclays Global Investors.
Fee and commission expense increased 14% (£103m) to £828m (2005:

Net trading income increased 4% (£145m) to £3,759m (2006: £3,614m).
The majority of the Group’ s net trading income arises in Barclays Capital.
Growth in the Rates related business reflects very strong performances in
fixed income, commodities, foreign exchange, equity and prime services.
The Credit related business includes net losses from credit market
turbulence and the benefits of widening credit spreads on the fair 
value of issued notes. 
Net investment income increased 26% (£254m) to £1,216m (2006:
£962m). The cumulative gain from disposal of available for sale assets
increased 82% (£253m) to £560m (2006: £307m) largely as a result of 
a number of private equity realisations and divestments. Net income from
financial instruments designated at fair value decreased by 34% (£154m)
largely due to lower growth in the value of linked insurance assets within
Barclays Wealth.
Fair value movements on insurance assets included within net investment
income contributed £113m (2006: £205m).
2006/05
Net trading income increased 56% (£1,293m) to £3,614m (2005:
£2,321m) due to excellent performances in Barclays Capital Rates and
Credit businesses, in particular in commodities, fixed income, equities,
credit derivatives and emerging markets. This was driven by higher volumes
of client – led activity and favourable market conditions. The inclusion of
Absa contributed net trading income of £60m (2005
a

trading income excluding Absa grew 54%.
Net investment income increased 12% (£104m) to £962m (2005:
£858m). The inclusion of Absa contributed net investment income of
£144m (2005

increased 3%.
The cumulative gain from disposal of available for sale assets increased
156% (£187m) to £307m (2005: £120m) driven by investment
realisations, primarily in Private Equity.
Fair value movements on certain assets and liabilities have been reported
within net trading income or within net investment income depending on
the nature of the transaction. Fair value movements on insurance assets
included within net investment income contributed £205m (2005:
£317m).

Impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit provisions 
as a percentage of Group total loans and advances increased to 0.71%

total retail loans and advances increased 18% to £164,062m (2006:
£139,350m).
Barclaycard impairment charges improved 21% (£229m) to £838m
(2006: £1,067m) reflecting reduced flows into delinquency, lower levels 
of arrears and lower charge-offs in UK Cards. We made changes to our
impairment methodologies to standardise our approach and in anticipation
of Basel II. The net positive impact of these changes in methodology was
offset by the increase in impairment charges in Barclaycard International
and secured consumer lending.
Impairment charges in UK Retail Banking decreased by £76m (12%) to
£559m (2006: £635m), reflecting lower charges in unsecured Consumer
Lending and Local Business driven by improved collection processes,
reduced flows into delinquency, lower arrears trends and stable charge-
offs. In UK Home Finance, asset quality remained strong and mortgage
charges remained negligible. Mortgage delinquencies as a percentage 
of outstandings remained stable and amounts charged off were low. 
Impairment charges in International Retail and Commercial Banking –
excluding Absa rose by £38m (93%) to £79m (2006: £41m) reflecting
very strong balance sheet growth in 2006 and 2007 and the impact of
lower releases in 2007.
Arrears in some of International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa’ s
retail portfolios deteriorated in 2007, driven by interest rate increases in
2006 and 2007 resulting in pressure on collections. 
Wholesale and corporate
Wholesale and corporate impairment charges on loans and advances
increased £436m to £701m (2006: £265m). Wholesale and corporate
impairment charges as a percentage of period end total loans and
advances increased to 0.31% (2006: 0.15%); total loans and advances
grew 27% to £225,228m (2006: £177,211m).
Barclays Capital impairment charges and other credit provisions of £846m
included a charge of £782m against ABS CDO Super Senior and other
credit market exposures and £58m net of fees relating to drawn leveraged
finance positions.
The impairment charge in Barclays Commercial Bank increased £38m
(15%) to £290m (2006: £252m), primarily due to higher impairment
charges in Larger Business, partially offset by a lower charge in Medium
Business due to a tightening of the lending criteria.  Financial review

Impairment charges (continued)
2006/05
Total impairment charges increased 37% (£583m) to £2,154m 
(2005: £1,571m). 
Impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit provisions
increased 32% (£501m) to £2,068m (2005: £1,567m). Excluding Absa,
the increase was 26% (£395m) and largely reflected the continued
challenging credit environment in UK unsecured retail lending through
2006. The wholesale and corporate sectors remained stable with a low
level of defaults. 
The Group impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit
provisions as a percentage of year-end total loans and advances of
£316,561m (2005: £303,451m) increased to 0.65% (2005: 0.52%). 
Retail
Retail impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit
provisions increased to £1,809m (2005: £1,254m), including £99m
(2005
a
: £10m) in respect of Absa. Retail impairment charges on loans 
and advances amounted to 1.30% (2005
b
: 0.93%) as a percentage of
year-end total loans and advances of £139,350m (2005
b
: £134,420m),
including balances in Absa of £20,090m (2005: £20,836m).
In the UK retail businesses, household cash flows remained under
pressure leading to a deterioration in consumer credit quality. High debt
levels and changing social attitudes to bankruptcy and debt default
contributed to higher levels of insolvency and increased impairment
charges. In UK cards and unsecured consumer lending, the flows of new
delinquencies and the levels of arrears balances declined in the second
half of 2006, reflecting more selective customer recruitment, limit
management and improved collections. 
In UK Home Finance, delinquencies were flat and amounts charged-off
remained low. The weaker external environment led to increased credit
delinquency in Local Business, where there were both higher balances on
caution status and higher flows into delinquency, which both stabilised
towards the year end.
Wholesale and corporate
In the wholesale and corporate businesses, impairment charges on loans
and advances and other credit provisions decreased to £259m (2005:
£313m), including £27m (2005
a
: £10m) in respect of Absa. The fall was
due mainly to recoveries in Barclays Capital as a result of the benign
wholesale credit environment. This was partially offset by an increase in
Barclays Commercial Bank, reflecting higher charges in Medium Business
and growth in lending balances.
The wholesale and corporate impairment charge was 0.15% (2005
b
:
0.19%) as a percentage of year-end total loans and advances to banks 
and to customers of £177,211m (2005
b
: £169,031m), including balances
in Absa of £9,299m (2005: £9,731m).
In Absa, impairment charges increased to £126m (2005
b
: £20m)
reflecting a full year of business and normalisation of credit conditions 
in South Africa following a period of low interest rates.
Impairment on available for sale assets
The total impairment charges in Barclays Capital included losses of £83m
(2005: £nil) on an available for sale portfolio where an intention to sell
caused the losses to be viewed as other than temporary in nature. These
losses in 2006 were primarily due to interest rate movements, rather than
credit deterioration, with a corresponding gain arising on offsetting
derivatives recognised in net trading income.

2007/06
Operating expenses grew 4% (£525m) to £13,199m (2006: £12,674m).
The increase was driven by growth of 3% (£236m) in staff costs to
£8,405m (2006: £8,169m) and lower gains on property disposals.
Administrative expenses remained flat at £3,978m (2006: £3,980m)
reflecting good cost control across all businesses.
Operating lease rentals increased 20% (£69m) to £414m (2006: £345m),
primarily due to increased property held under operating leases. 
Operating expenses were reduced by gains from the sale of property of
£267m (2006: £432m) as the Group continued the sale and leaseback 
of some of its freehold portfolio, principally in UK Banking.
Amortisation of intangible assets increased 37% (£50m) to £186m 
(2006: £136m) primarily reflecting the amortisation of mortgage servicing
rights relating to the acquisition of HomEq in November 2006. 
The Group cost:income ratio improved two percentage points to 57%
(2006: 59%). 
2006/05
Operating expenses increased 20% (£2,147m) to £12,674m (2005:
£10,527m). The inclusion of Absa contributed operating expenses of
£1,496m (2005
a
: £664m). Group operating expenses excluding Absa
grew 13%, reflecting a higher level of business activity and an increase 
in performance related pay.
Administrative expenses increased 16% (£537m) to £3,980m (2005:
£3,443m). The inclusion of Absa contributed administrative expenses of
£579m (2005
a
: £257m). Group administrative expenses excluding Absa
grew 7% principally as a result of higher business activity in UK Banking
and Barclays Capital. 
Operating lease rentals increased 9% (£29m) to £345m (2005: £316m).
The inclusion of Absa contributed operating lease rentals of £73m 
(2005
a
: £27m), which more than offset the absence of double occupancy
costs incurred in 2005, associated with the Head office relocation to
Canary Wharf. 
Operating expenses were reduced by gains from the sale of property of
£432m (2005: £nil) as the Group took advantage of historically low yields
on property to realise gains on some of its freehold portfolio. 
Amortisation of intangible assets increased 72% (£57m) to £136m 
(2005: £79m) primarily reflecting the inclusion of Absa for the full year.
The Group cost:income ratio improved to 59% (2005: 61%). This reflected
improved productivity. The Group cost:net income ratio was 65% 
(2005: 67%).

of operations personnel from UK Retail Banking and additional investment
in front line staff to drive improved geographical coverage.
Barclaycard staff numbers decreased 700 to 7,800 (2006: 8,500), due to
efficiency initiatives implemented across the UK operation and the sale of
part of the Monument card portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the

2007/06
The tax charge for the period was based on a UK corporation tax rate of
30% (2006: 30%). The effective rate of tax for 2007, based on profit
before tax, was 28.0% (2006: 27.2%). The effective tax rate differed from
30% as it took account of the different tax rates applied to profits earned
outside the UK, non-taxable gains and income and adjustments to prior
year tax provisions. The forthcoming change in the UK rate of corporation
tax from 30% to 28% on 1st April 2008 led to an additional tax charge 
in 2007 as a result of its effect on the Group’ s net deferred tax asset. 
The effective tax rate for 2007 was higher than the 2006 rate, principally
because there was a higher level of profit on disposals of subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures offset by losses or exemptions in 2006.
2006/05
The charge for the period is based upon a UK corporation tax rate of 30%
for the calendar year 2006 (2005: 30%). The effective rate of tax for 2006,
based on profit before tax, was 27.2% (2005: 27.3%). The effective tax
rate differs from 30% as it takes account of the different tax rates which
are applied to the profits earned outside the UK, disallowable expenditure,
certain non-taxable gains and adjustments to prior year tax provisions.
The effective tax rate for 2006 is consistent with the prior period. The tax
charge for the year includes £1,234m (2005: £961m) arising in the UK
and £707m (2005: £478m) arising overseas.
The profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of
£323m was substantially offset by losses or exemptions. The effective tax
rate on profit before business disposals was 28.5%.
Economic profit
Economic profit comprises:
– Profit after tax and minority interests; less
– Capital charge (average shareholders’ equity and goodwill excluding
minority interests multiplied by the Group cost of capital).
The Group cost of capital has been applied at a uniform rate of 9.5%

. 
The costs of servicing preference shares are included in minority interests,

to customers that have been securitised increased £4.3bn to £28.7bn
(2006: £24.4bn). The increase in risk weighted assets since 2006 
reflected a rise of £31.6bn in the banking book and a rise of £24.0bn 
in the trading book. 
UK Retail Banking total assets increased 7% to £87.8bn (2006: £81.7bn).
This was mainly attributable to growth in mortgage balances. Risk weighted
assets increased by 7% to £46.0bn (2006: £43.0bn) with growth in
mortgages partially offset by an increase in securitised balances and 
other reductions.
Barclays Commercial Bank total assets grew 12% to £73.9bn (2006:
£65.9bn) driven by good growth across lending products. Risk weighted
assets increased 8% to £53.8bn (2006: £50.0bn), reflecting asset growth
partially offset by increased regulatory netting and an increase in
securitised balances.
Barclaycard total assets increased 10% to £22.2bn (2006: £20.1bn). 
Risk weighted assets increased 17% to £19.9bn (2006: £17.0bn),
primarily reflecting the increase in total assets, redemption of
securitisation transactions, partially offset by changes to the treatment of
regulatory associates and the sale of part of the Monument card portfolio.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa total assets
grew 37% to £52.2bn (2006: £38.2bn). This growth was mainly driven by
increases in retail mortgages and unsecured lending in Western Europe
and increases in unsecured lending in Emerging Markets. Risk weighted
assets increased 48% to £29.7bn (2006: £20.1bn), reflecting asset
growth and a change in product mix.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa total assets increased
23% to £37.3bn (2006: £30.4bn), primarily driven by increases in
mortgages, credit cards and commercial property finance. Risk weighted
assets increased 14% to £23.6bn (2006: £20.7bn), reflecting balance
sheet growth. 
Barclays Capital total assets rose 28% to £839.7bn (2006: £657.9bn).
Derivative assets increased £109.3bn primarily due to movements across
a range of market indices. This was accompanied by a corresponding
increase in derivative liabilities. The increase in non-derivative assets
reflects an expansion of the business across a number of asset classes,
combined with an increase in drawn leveraged loan positions and
mortgage-related assets. Risk weighted assets increased 23% to
£169.1bn (2006: £137.6bn) reflecting growth in fixed income, equities
and credit derivatives. 
Barclays Global Investors total assets increased 11% to £89.2bn (2006:
£80.5bn), mainly attributable to growth in certain asset management
products recognised as investment contracts. The majority of total assets
relates to asset management products with equal and offsetting balances
reflected within liabilities to customers. Risk weighted assets increased
43% to £2.0bn (2006: £1.4bn) mainly attributable to overall growth in the
balance sheet and the mix of securities lending activity.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 55
2006/05
Total assets increased 8% to £996.8bn (2005: £924.4bn). Risk weighted
assets increased 11% to £297.8bn (2005: £269.1bn). Loans and
advances to customers that have been securitised increased £5.8bn to
£24.4bn (2005: £18.6bn). The increase in risk weighted assets since 2005
reflects a rise of £18.1bn in the banking book and a rise of £10.9bn in the
trading book. 
UK Retail Banking total assets increased 5% to £81.7bn (2005: £78.1bn).
This was mainly attributable to growth in mortgage balances. Risk
weighted assets increased 5% to £43.0bn (2005: £40.8bn) also primarily
reflecting the growth in mortgage balances.
Barclays Commercial Bank total assets increased 10% to £65.9bn 
(2005: £59.9bn) reflecting good growth across short, medium and long
term lending products. Risk weighted assets increased 6% to £50.0bn
(2005: £47.1bn), reflecting asset growth and increased regulatory netting.
Barclaycard total assets increased 10% to £20.1bn (2005: £18.2bn) 
driven by growth in lending balances in the international businesses 
and FirstPlus. Risk weighted assets increased 25% to £17.0bn (2005:
£13.6bn), primarily reflecting the increase in total assets and lower
securitised balances.
International Retail and Commercial Banking-excluding Absa total assets
increased 12% to £38.2bn (2005: £34.0bn) mainly reflecting increases 
in mortgage and other lending. Risk weighted assets remained flat at
£20.1bn (2005: £20.2bn), with balance sheet growth offset by the sale 
of FirstCaribbean International Bank.
International Retail and Commercial Banking-Absa total assets increased
3% to £30.4bn (2005: £29.4bn). Risk weighted assets remained flat at
£20.7bn (2005: £20.8bn). This reflects very strong growth in Rand terms
offset by a 21% decline in the value of the Rand. In Rand terms assets
grew 31% to R417bn (2005: R319bn) and risk weighted assets grew 25%
to R284bn (2005: R227bn) due to strong growth in mortgage lending
along with growth in corporate lending.
Barclays Capital total assets increased 9% to £657.9bn (2005: £601.2bn).
This reflected continued expansion of the business with growth in reverse
repurchase agreements, debt securities and traded equity securities. 
Risk weighted assets increased 18% to £137.6bn (2005: £116.7bn) in line
with risk, driven by the growth in equity derivatives, credit derivatives and
fixed income.
Barclays Global Investors total assets remained flat at £80.5bn (2005:
£80.9bn). The majority of total assets relates to asset management
products with equal and offsetting balances reflected within liabilities to
customers. Risk weighted assets decreased 7% to £1.4bn (2005: £1.5bn).
Barclays Wealth total assets increased 12% to £15.0bn (2005: £13.4bn)
reflecting strong growth in lending to high net worth, affluent and
intermediary clients. Risk weighted assets increased 42% to £6.1bn
(2005: £4.3bn) above the rate of balance sheet growth driven by changes
in the mix of lending and growth in guarantees.
Head office functions and other operations total assets decreased 24% 
to £7.1bn (2005: £9.3bn). Risk weighted assets decreased 53% to £1.9bn
(2005: £4.0bn).  Financial review

Called up share capital comprises 6,600 million (2006: 6,535 million)
ordinary shares of 25p each and 1 million (2006: 1 million) staff shares 
of £1 each. Called up share capital increased by £17m representing the
nominal value of shares issued to Temasek Holdings, China Development
Bank (CDB) and employees under share option plans largely offset by a
reduction in nominal value arising from share buy-backs. Share premium
reduced by £5,762m; the reclassification of £7,223m to retained earnings
resulting from the High Court approved cancellation of share premium
was partly offset by additional premium arising on the issuance to CDB
and on employee options. The capital redemption reserve increased by
£75m representing the nominal value of the share buy-backs.
Retained earnings increased by £8,801m. Increases primarily arose 
from profit attributable to equity holders of the parent of £4,417m, 
the reclassification of share premium of £7,223m and the proceeds of 
the Temasek issuance in excess of nominal value of £941m. Reductions
primarily arose from external dividends paid of £2,079m and the total 
cost of share repurchases of £1,802m.
Movements in other reserves, except the capital redemption reserve,
reflect the relevant amounts recorded in the consolidated statement 
of recognised income and expense on page 178.
Minority interests increased £1,594m to £9,185m (2006: £7,591m). 
The increase was primarily driven by preference share issuances of
£1,322m and an increase in the minority interest in Absa of £225m.
The Group’ s authority to buy-back equity shares was renewed at the 
2007 AGM.
2006/05
Total shareholders’ equity increased £2,960m to £27,390m (2005:

£168m respectively representing the issue of shares to employees under
share option plans.
Retained earnings increased by £3,212m primarily reflecting profit
attributable to equity holders of the parent of £4,571m partly offset by
dividends paid of £1,771m.
Movements in other reserves reflect the relevant amounts recorded in

Minimum requirements under the FSA ’ s Basel rules are expressed as a ratio of capital resources to risk weighted assets (Risk Asset Ratio). Risk weighted
assets are a function of risk weights applied to the Group’ s assets using calculations developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
Basel I
At 31st December 2007, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.8% and the risk asset ratio was 12.1%. From 31st December 2006, total net capital resources rose
£7.9bn and risk weighted assets increased £55.6bn.
Tier 1 capital rose £4.4bn, including £2.3bn arising from profits attributable to equity holders of the parent net of dividends paid. Minority interests 
within Tier 1 capital increased £2.7bn primarily due to the issuance of reserve capital instruments and preference shares. The deduction for goodwill 
and intangible assets increased by £1.1bn. Tier 2 capital increased £3.1bn mainly as a result of an increase of £3.0bn of dated loan capital. 
Basel II
Under Basel II, effective from 1st January 2008, the Group has been granted approval by the FSA to adopt the advanced approaches to credit and
operational risk management. Pillar 1 risk weighted assets will be generated using the Group’ s risk models. Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements under
Basel II are Pillar 1 risk weighted assets multiplied by 8%, the internationally agreed minimum ratio.
Under Pillar 2 of Basel II, the Group is subject to an overall regulatory capital requirement (expressed in £ terms) based on individual capital guidance
(‘ICG’) received from the FSA. The ICG imposes additional capital requirements in excess of Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements. Barclays received its
ICG from the FSA in December 2007. 
Risk weighted assets calculated on a Basel II basis are broadly in line with risk weighted assets calculated on a Basel I basis. A reduction in credit and
counterparty risk weighted assets of £31.5bn more than offset the identification of capital equivalent risk weighted assets of £28.4bn attributable 
to operational risk. The reduced risk weighted assets attributable to credit risk were mainly driven by recognition of the low risk profile of first charge
residential mortgages in UK Retail Banking and Absa and the use of internal models to assess exposures to counterparty risk in the trading book. 
These were partially offset by higher counterparty risk weightings in emerging markets and greater recognition of undrawn commitments.
Compared to Basel I, deductions from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital under Basel II include additional amounts relating to expected loss and securitisations. For
advanced portfolios, any excess of expected loss over impairment allowances is deducted half from Tier 1 and half from Tier 2 capital. Deductions relating
to securitisation transactions, which are made from total capital under Basel I, are deducted half from Tier 1 and half from Tier 2 capital under Basel II.
For portfolios treated under the standardised approach, the inclusion of collectively assessed impairment allowances in Tier 2 capital remains the same
under Basel II. Collectively assessed impairment allowances against exposures treated under Basel II advanced approaches are not eligible for direct
inclusion in Tier 2 capital.

Critical accounting estimates
62 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
The Group’ s accounting policies are set out on pages 165 to 173. 
Certain of these policies, as well as estimates made by management, are
considered to be important to an understanding of the Group’ s financial
condition since they require management to make difficult, complex or
subjective judgements and estimates, some of which may relate to matters
that are inherently uncertain. The following accounting policies include
estimates which are particularly sensitive in terms of judgements and the
extent to which estimates are used. Other accounting policies involve
significant amounts of judgements and estimates, but the total amounts
involved are not significant to the financial statements. Management has
discussed the accounting policies and critical accounting estimates with
the Board Audit Committee. 
Fair value of financial instruments
Some of the Group’ s financial instruments are carried at fair value through
profit or loss such as those held for trading, designated by management
under the fair value option and non-cash flow hedging derivatives. 
Other non-derivative financial assets may be designated as available 
for sale. Available for sale financial investments are initially recognised at
fair value and are subsequently held at fair value. Gains and losses arising
from changes in fair value of such assets are included as a separate
component of equity. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Financial
instruments entered into as trading transactions, together with any
associated hedging, are measured at fair value and the resultant profits
and losses are included in net trading income, along with interest and
dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating
to trading activities. Assets and liabilities resulting from gains and losses
on financial instruments held for trading are reported gross in trading
portfolio assets and liabilities or derivative financial instruments, reduced
by the effects of netting agreements where there is an intention to settle
net with counterparties. 
Valuation methodology
The method of determining the fair value of financial instruments can 
be analysed into the following categories:
(a) Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets where the quoted price 
is readily available and the price represents actual and regularly
occurring market transactions on an arm’ s length basis.
(b) Valuation techniques using market observable inputs. Such techniques
may include:
– using recent arm’ s length market transactions;
– reference to the current fair value of similar instruments;
– discounted cash flow analysis, pricing models or other techniques
commonly used by market participants.
(c) Valuation techniques used above, but which include significant inputs
that are not observable. On initial recognition of financial instruments
measured using such techniques the transaction price is deemed to
provide the best evidence of fair value for accounting purposes. 
The valuation techniques in (b) and (c) use inputs such as interest rate
yield curves, equity prices, commodity and currency prices/yields,
volatilities of underlyings and correlations between inputs. The models used
in these valuation techniques are calibrated against industry standards,
economic models and to observed transaction prices where available.
The following tables set out the total financial instruments stated at fair
value as at 31st December 2007 and those fair values are calculated with
valuation techniques using unobservable inputs.

Derivative financial instruments 4,382 248,288
Total 10,596 480,818
Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these
may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include
for example, the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of
product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the market
place, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction
(bespoke or generic).
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not
observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more
subjective, dependant on the significance of the unobservable input to 
the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the
best information available, for example by reference to similar assets,
similar maturities, appropriate proxies, or other analytical techniques.
The effect of changing the assumptions for those financial instruments 
for which the fair values were measured using valuation techniques that
are determined in full or in part on assumptions that are not supported 
by observable inputs to a range of reasonably possible alternative
assumptions, would be to provide a range of £1.2bn (2006: £0.1bn) 
lower to £1.5bn (2006: £0.1bn) higher than the fair values recognised 
in the financial statements.
The size of this range will vary over time in response to market volatility,
market uncertainty and changes to benchmark proxy relationships of
similar assets and liabilities. The calculation of this range is performed 
on a consistent basis each period. 
Further information on the fair value of financial instruments is provided 
in Note 49 to the accounts.
The following summary sets out those instruments which use inputs
where it may be necessary to use valuation techniques as described above.
Corporate bonds
Corporate bonds are generally valued using observable quoted prices or
recently executed transactions. Where observable price quotations are 
not available, the fair value is determined based on cash flow models
where significant inputs may include yield curves, bond or single name
credit default swap spreads.  1
Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 63
Mortgage whole loans 
The fair value of mortgage whole loans are determined using observable
quoted prices or recently executed transactions for comparable assets.
Where observable price quotations or benchmark proxies are not available,
fair value is determined using cash flow models where significant inputs
include yield curves, collateral specific loss assumptions, asset specific
prepayment assumptions, yield spreads and expected default rates. 
Commercial mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities
Commercial mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities (ABS)
(residential mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, student loans and leases)
are generally valued using observable information. Wherever possible, 
the fair value is determined using quoted prices or recently executed
transactions. Where observable price quotations are not available, fair value
is determined based on cash flow models where the significant inputs
may include yield curves, credit spreads, prepayment rates. Securities that
are backed by the residual cash flows of an asset portfolio are generally
valued using similar cash flow models.
The fair value of home equity loan bonds are determined using models
which use scenario analysis with significant inputs including age, rating,
internal grade, and index prices.
Collateralised debt obligations
The valuation of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) notes is first based
on an assessment of the probability of an event of default occurring due 
to a credit deterioration. This is determined by reference to the probability 
of event of default occurring and the probability of exercise of contractual
rights related to event of default. The notes are then valued by determining
appropriate valuation multiples to be applied to the contractual cash flows.
These are based on inputs including the prospective cash flow performance
of the underlying securities, the structural features of the transaction and
the net asset value of the underlying portfolio.
Private equity
The fair value of private equity is determined using appropriate valuation
methodologies which, dependent on the nature of the investment, may
include discounted cash flow analysis, enterprise value comparisons with
similar companies, price:earnings comparisons and turnover multiples. 
For each investment the relevant methodology is applied consistently 
over time.
Own credit on financial liabilities
The carrying amount of financial liabilities held at fair value is adjusted to
reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads. As a result, the carrying
value of issued notes that have been designated at fair value through 
profit and loss is adjusted by reference to the movement in the appropriate
spreads. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Derivatives
Derivative contracts can be exchange traded or over the counter (OTC).
OTC derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts
related to interest rates, bonds, foreign currencies, credit standing of
reference entities, equity prices, fund levels, commodity prices or indices
on these assets.
The fair value of OTC derivative contracts are modelled using a series of
techniques, including closed form analytical formulae (such as the Black-
Scholes option pricing model) and simulation based models. The choice 
of model is dependant on factors such as; the complexity of the product,
inherent risks and hedging strategy: statistical behaviour of the underlying,
and ability of the model to price consistently with observed market
transactions. For many pricing models there is no material subjectivity
because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant
judgement and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted
markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps and option markets.
In the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models
used are widely accepted and used by the other market participants.
Significant inputs used in these models may include yield curves, credit
spreads, recovery rates, dividend rates, volatility of underlying interest
rates, equity prices or foreign exchange rates and, in some cases, correlation
between these inputs. These inputs are determined with reference to
quoted prices, recently executed trades, independent market quotes 
and consensus data.
New, long dated or complex derivative products may require a greater
degree of judgement in the implementation of appropriate valuation
techniques, due to the complexity of the valuation assumptions and the
reduced observability of inputs. The valuation of more complex products
may use more generic derivatives as a component to calculating the
overall value.
Derivatives where valuation involves a significant degree of 
judgement include:
– Fund derivatives
Fund derivatives are derivatives whose underlyings include mutual
funds, hedge funds, indices and multi asset portfolios. They are 
valued using underlying fund prices, yield curves and available market
information on the level of the hedging risk. Some fund derivatives 
are valued using unobservable information, generally where the level 
of the hedging risk is not observable in the market. These are valued
taking account of risk of the underlying fund or collection of funds,
diversification of the fund by asset, concentration by geographic sector,
strategy of the fund, size of the transaction and concentration of
specific fund managers.
– Commodity derivatives
Commodity derivatives are valued using models where the significant
inputs may include interest rate yield curves, commodity price curves,
volatility of the underlying commodities and, in some cases, correlation
between these inputs, which are generally observable. This approach 
is applied to base metal, precious metal, energy, power, gas, emissions,
soft commodities and freight positions. Due to the significant time
span in the various market closes, curves are constructed using
differentials to a benchmark curve to ensure that all curves are valued
using the dominant market base price. 
– Structured credit derivatives 
Collateralised synthetic obligations (CSOs)are structured credit
derivatives which reference the loss profile of a portfolio of loans, debts
or synthetic underlyings. The reference asset can be a corporate credit
or an asset backed credit. For CSOs that reference corporate credits 
an analytical model is used. For CSOs on asset backed underlyings, 
due to the path dependent nature of a CSO on an amortising portfolio 
a Monte Carlo simulation is used rather than analytic approximation.
The expected loss probability for each reference credit in the portfolio 
is derived from the single name credit default swap spread curve 
and in addition, for ABS references, a prepayment rate assumption. 
A simulation is then used to compute survival time which allows us 
to calculate the marginal loss over each payment period by reference 
to estimated recovery rates. Significant inputs include prepayment
rates, cumulative default rates, and recovery rates.
Allowances for loan impairment and other 
credit risk provisions 
Allowances for loan impairment represent management’ s estimate of 
the losses incurred in the loan portfolios as at the balance sheet date.
Changes to the allowances for loan impairment and changes to the
provisions for undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees
provided are reported in the consolidated income statement as part of the
impairment charge. Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments 
and similar facilities if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result
in recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced. Financial review
Critical accounting estimates
64 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large
numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics
where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques
are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis, based 
on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods. These
statistical analyses use as primary inputs the extent to which accounts in
the portfolio are in arrears and historical information on the eventual losses
encountered from such delinquent portfolios. There are many such
models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer
category. Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical
methods to use when the models are developed or revised. The impairment
allowance reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is
therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable. The impairment
charge reflected in the income statement for these portfolios is £1,605m
(2006: £1,809m) and amounts to 70% (2006: 87%) of the total
impairment charge on loans and advances in 2007. 
For larger accounts, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual
basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected
future cash flows are taken into account, for example, the business
prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Group’ s
position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information
and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process. The level of the
impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the
discounted expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan’ s original
effective interest rate), and its carrying amount. Subjective judgements 
are made in the calculation of future cash flows. Furthermore, judgements
change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out
strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment
allowance as individual decisions are taken. Changes in these estimates
would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on 
the impairment charge. The impairment charge reflected in the financial
statements in relation to larger accounts is £701m (2006: £265m) or 
30% (2006: 13%) of the total impairment charge on loans and advances 
in 2007. Further information on impairment allowances is set out on 
pages 100 to 101. 
Goodwill 
Management have to consider at least annually whether the current
carrying value of goodwill is impaired. The first step of the impairment
review process requires the identification of independent cash generating
units, by dividing the Group business into as many largely independent
income streams as is reasonably practicable. The goodwill is then allocated
to these independent units. The first element of this allocation is based on
the areas of the business expected to benefit from the synergies derived
from the acquisition. The second element reflects the allocation of the net
assets acquired and the difference between the consideration paid for
those net assets and their fair value. This allocation is reviewed following
business reorganisation. The carrying value of the unit, including the
allocated goodwill, is compared to its fair value to determine whether any
impairment exists. If the fair value of a unit is less than its carrying value,
goodwill will be impaired. Detailed calculations may need to be carried 
out taking into consideration changes in the market in which a business
operates (e.g. competitive activity, regulatory change). In the absence 
of readily available market price data this calculation is based upon
discounting expected pre-tax cash flows at a risk adjusted interest rate
appropriate to the operating unit, the determination of both of which
requires the exercise of judgement. The estimation of pre-tax cash flows 
is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and 
to assumptions regarding the long term sustainable cash flows. While
forecasts are compared with actual performance and external economic
data, expected cash flows naturally reflect management’ s view of future
performance. The most significant amounts of goodwill relate to the Absa
and Woolwich acquisitions. The goodwill impairment testing performed 
in 2007 indicated that none of the goodwill was impaired. Management
believes that reasonable changes in key assumptions used to determine
the recoverable amounts of Absa and Woolwich goodwill would not result 
in impairment.
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets that derive their value from contractual customer
relationships or that can be separated and sold and have a finite useful life
are amortised over their estimated useful life. Determining the estimated
useful life of these finite life intangible assets requires an analysis of
circumstances, and judgement by the Bank’ s management. At each
balance sheet date, or more frequently when events or changes in
circumstances dictate, intangible assets are assessed for indications of
impairment. If indications are present, these assets are subject to an
impairment review. The impairment review comprises a comparison of the
carrying amount of the asset with its recoverable amount: the higher of
the assets’ or the cash-generating unit’ s net selling price and its value in
use. Net selling price is calculated by reference to the amount at which the
asset could be disposed of in a binding sale agreement in an arms-length
transaction evidenced by an active market or recent transactions for
similar assets. Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected
future cash flows obtainable as a result of the asset’ s continued use,
including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based
discount rate on a pre-tax basis. The most significant amounts of
intangible assets relate to the Absa acquisition. 
Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group provides pension plans for employees in most parts of the
world. Arrangements for staff retirement benefits vary from country to
country and are made in accordance with local regulations and customs.
For defined contribution schemes, the pension cost recognised in the
profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the
scheme. For defined benefit schemes, actuarial valuation of each of the
scheme’ s obligations using the projected unit credit method and the fair
valuation of each of the scheme’ s assets are performed annually in
accordance with the requirements of IAS 19. 
The actuarial valuation is dependent upon a series of assumptions, the 
key ones being interest rates, mortality, investment returns and inflation.
Mortality estimates are based on standard industry and national mortality
tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect the Group’ s own experience.
The returns on fixed interest investments are set to market yields at the
valuation date (less an allowance for risk) to ensure consistency with the
asset valuation. The returns on UK and overseas equities are based on the
long-term outlook for global equities at the calculation date having regard
to current market yields and dividend growth expectations. The inflation
assumption reflects long-term expectations of both earnings and retail
price inflation. 
The difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, adjusted
for any historic unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service
cost, is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet. An asset arising, for
example, as a result of past over-funding or the performance of the plan
investments, is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the
present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of contributions.
To the extent that any unrecognised gains or losses at the start of the
measurement year in relation to any individual defined benefit scheme
exceed 10% of the greater of the fair value of the scheme assets and the
defined benefit obligation for that scheme, a proportion of the excess is
recognised in the income statement. 
The Group’ s IAS 19 pension surplus across all pension and post-retirement
schemes as at 31st December 2007 was a surplus of £393m (2006:
£817m deficit). This comprises net recognised liabilities of £1,501m
(2006: £1,719m) and unrecognised actuarial gains of £1,894m (2006:
£902m). The net recognised liabilities comprises retirement benefit
liabilities of £1,537m (2006: £1,807m) relating to schemes that are in
deficit, and assets of £36m (2006: £88m) relating to schemes that are in
surplus. The Group’ s IAS 19 pension surplus in respect of the main UK
scheme as at 31st December 2007 was £668m (2006: £495m deficit).
The estimated actuarial funding position of the main UK pension scheme
as at 31st December 2007, estimated from the triennial valuation in 2004,
was a surplus of £1,200m (2006: £1,300m). Cash contributions to the
main UK scheme were £355m (2006: £351m).
Further information on retirement benefit obligations, including
assumptions is set out in Note 30 to the accounts. 1

Off-balance sheet arrangements
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 65
In the ordinary course of business and primarily to facilitate client
transactions, the Group enters into transactions which may involve 
the use of off-balance sheet arrangements and special purpose entities
(SPEs). These arrangements include the provision of guarantees, loan
commitments, retained interests in assets which have been transferred to
an unconsolidated SPE or obligations arising from the Group’ s involvements
with such SPEs.
Guarantees
The Group issues guarantees on behalf of its customers. In the majority 
of cases, the Group will hold collateral against the exposure, have a right of
recourse to the customer or both. In addition, the Group issues guarantees
on its own behalf. The main types of guarantees provided are: financial
guarantees given to banks and financial institutions on behalf of customers
to secure loans: overdrafts; and other banking facilities, including stock
borrowing indemnities and standby letters of credit. Other guarantees
provided include performance guarantees, advance payment guarantees,
tender guarantees, guarantees to Her Majesty’ s Revenue and Customs
and retention guarantees. The nominal principal amount of contingent
liabilities with off-balance sheet risk is set out in Note 34 and in the table 
on page 60.
Loan commitments
The Group enters into commitments to lend to its customers subject to
certain conditions. Such loan commitments are made either for a fixed
period, or are cancellable by the Group subject to notice conditions.
Information on loan commitments and similar facilities is set out in 
Note 34 and in the table on page 60.
Special purpose entities
Transactions entered into by the Group may involve the use of SPEs. 
SPEs are entities that are created to accomplish a narrow and well defined
objective. There are often specific restrictions or limits around their
ongoing activities.
Transactions with SPEs take a number of forms, including:
– The provision of financing to fund asset purchases, or commitments 
to provide finance for future purchases.
– Derivative transactions to provide investors in the SPE with a specified
exposure.
– The provision of liquidity or backstop facilities which may be drawn upon
if the SPE experiences future funding difficulties.
– Direct investment in the notes issued by SPEs.
Depending on the nature of the Group’ s resulting exposure, it may
consolidate the SPE on to the Group’ s balance sheet. The consolidation 
of SPEs is considered at inception based on the arrangements in place 
and the assessed risk exposures at that time. In accordance with IFRS,
SPEs are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between
the Group and the entity indicates control. Potential indicators of control
include, amongst others, an assessment of the Group’ s exposure to the
risks and benefits of the SPE. The initial consolidation analysis is revisited
at a later date if:
(i) the Group acquires additional interests in the entity;
(ii) the contractual arrangements of the entity are amended such that 
the relative exposures to risks and rewards change; or if
(iii)the Group acquires control over the main operating and financial
decisions of the entity.
A number of the Group’ s transactions have recourse only to the assets 
of unconsolidated SPEs. Typically, the majority of the exposure to these
assets is borne by third parties and the Group’ s risk is mitigated through
over-collateralisation, unwind features and other protective measures. 
The Group’ s involvement with unconsolidated third party conduits,
collateralised debt obligations and structured investment vehicles is
described further below.
Collateralised Debt Obligations
The Group has structured and underwritten CDOs. At inception, the
Group’ s exposure principally takes the form of a liquidity facility provided
to support future funding difficulties or cash shortfalls in the vehicles. 
If required by the vehicle, the facility is drawn with the amount advanced
included within loans and advances in the balance sheet. Upon an event 
of default or other triggering event, the Group may acquire control of 
a CDO and, therefore, be required to fully consolidate the vehicle for
accounting purposes. The potential for transactions to hit default triggers
before the end of 2008 has been assessed and included in the determination
of impairment charges and other credit provisions (£782m in relation 
to ABS CDO Super Senior and other credit market exposures for the year
ended 31st December 2007).
The Group’ s exposure to ABS CDO Super Senior positions before hedging
was £6,018m as at 31st December 2007. This includes £1,149m of undrawn
facilities provided to mezzanine transactions (exposure stated net of
writedowns and charges). Undrawn facilities provided to unconsolidated
CDOs are included as part of commitments in Note 34 to the accounts.
The remaining £4,869m is the Group’ s exposure to High Grade CDOs,
stated net of writedowns and charges. £3,782m of drawn balances are
included within loans and advances on the balance sheet, with the
remaining £1,087m representing consolidated High Grade CDOs
accounted for on a fair value basis.
Collateral
The collateral underlying unconsolidated CDOs comprised 77% residential
mortgage backed securities, 6% non-residential asset backed securities
and 17% in other categories, including 10% ABS CDO exposure (a
proportion of which will be backed by residential mortgage collateral).
The remaining Weighted Average Life (WAL) of all collateral is 3.9 years.
The combined Net Asset Value (NAV) for all of the CDOs was £2.8bn
below the nominal amount, equivalent to an aggregate 40.2% decline 
in value on average for all investors.
Funding
The CDOs were funded with senior unrated notes and rated notes up to
AAA. The capital structure senior to the AAA notes on cash CDOs was
supported by a liquidity facility provided by the Group. On mezzanine
CDOs, this portion of the capital structure is unfunded, but a liquidity
facility is provided to support the level of synthetic instruments within
each transaction. The senior portion covered by liquidity facilities is on
average 79% of the capital structure.
The initial WAL of the notes in issue averaged 7.1 years. The full contractual
maturity is 37.8 years.  Interests in Third Party CDOs
The Group has purchased securities in and entered into derivative
instruments with third party CDOs. These interests are held as trading
assets or liabilities on the Group’ s balance sheet and measured at fair
value. The Group has not provided liquidity facilities or similar agreements
to third party CDOs. 
Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs)
The Group has not structured or managed SIVs. Group exposure to third
party SIVs comprised:
– £317m of senior liquidity facilities, of which £19m was drawn and
included in loans and advances as at 31 st December 2007. The Group 
is one of between two and eight independent liquidity providers on 
each transaction.
– Derivative exposures included on the balance sheet at their net fair value
of £264m.
– Bonds issued by the SIVs included within trading portfolio assets at their
fair value of £21m.
– £2.6bn repo funding facilities. £1.3bn has been utilised and included
within loans and advances to customers in the balance sheet.
Other than the repo facilities, which when drawn are more than 100%
collateralised by assets held by the Group with the collateral being valued
daily, the items above are included in the credit market positions discussed
on page 67.
SIV-Lites
The Group structured and helped to underwrite three SIV-Lite transactions.
The Group is not involved in their ongoing management.
The Group provided £0.55bn in liquidity facilities as partial support to the
£2.6bn of CP programmes on these transactions. These facilities have
now been fully drawn or are terminated, such that no further drawings are
possible. One of the three vehicles has been restructured into a cash 
CDO. As part of this restructuring, the Group acquired the £800m senior
note in the CDO which is held at fair value within trading portfolio assets.
The credit risk on this note has been transferred to a third party investment
bank. For the remaining facilities, the amount drawn totalled £152m and 
is included on the balance sheet within loans and advances to customers
and included in the credit market positions discussed on page 67. 
Commercial Paper and Medium-term Note Conduits
The Group provided £19bn in undrawn backstop liquidity facilities to its
own sponsored CP conduits. The Group fully consolidates these entities
such that the underlying assets are reflected on the Group balance sheet.
The Group provided backstop facilities to support the paper issued by six
third party conduits. These facilities totalled £1bn, with underlying collateral
comprising auto loans (81%), bank-guaranteed residential mortgages
(11%), bank-guaranteed commercial and project finance loans (5%) and
UK consumer finance receivables (3%). Drawings on these facilities were
£46m as at 31 st December 2007 and are included within loans and
advances to customers.
The Group provided backstop facilities to six third-party SPEs that fund
themselves with medium term notes. These notes are sold to investors 
as a series of 12 month securities and remarketed to investors annually. 
If investors decline to renew their holdings at a price below a pre-agreed
spread, the backstop facility requires the Group to purchase the outstanding
notes at scheduled maturity. The group has provided facilities of £2.9bn,
to SPEs holding prime UK and Australian owner-occupied Residential
Mortgage Back Securities (RMBS) assets. As at 31 st December 2007, 
the Group had acquired notes of £90m under these backstop facilities
(included as available for sale assets in the balance sheet) and further
acquisitions are expected through 2008 as other notes are remarketed.
The notes generally rank pari passu with the other term AAA+ rated notes
from the same issuer. The facilities have been designated at fair value and
are reflected in the balance sheet at their current fair value.
The Group’ s own CP conduits provided facilities of £1.3bn to third party
conduits containing prime UK buy-to-let RMBS. As at 31 st December 2007,
£290m of this facility had been drawn. The undrawn facilities are included
within the commitments disclosed in Note 34 to the accounts, while the
drawn elements are included within loans and advances to customers. 
Asset securitisations
The Group has assisted companies with the formation of asset
securitisations, some of which are effected through the use of SPEs. 
These entities have minimal equity and rely on funding in the form of
notes to purchase the assets for securitisation. As these SPEs are created
for other companies, the Group does not usually control these entities and
therefore does not consolidate them. The Group may provide financing 
in the form of senior notes or junior notes and may also provide derivatives
to the SPE. These transactions are included on the balance sheet.
The Group has used SPEs to securitise part of its originated and purchased
retail and commercial lending portfolios and credit card receivables. 
These SPEs are usually consolidated and derecognition only occurs when
the Group transfers its contractual right to receive cash flows from the
financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows,
but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another
party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk,
prepayment risk and interest rate risk. The carrying amount of securitised
assets together with the associated liabilities are set out in Note 29. 
Client intermediation
The Group has structured transactions as a financial intermediary to meet
investor and client needs. These transactions involve entities structured 
by either the Group or the client and they are used to modify cash flows 
of third party assets to create investments with specific risk or return
profiles or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks. 
Such transactions will typically result in a derivative being shown on the
balance sheet, representing the Group’ s exposure to the relevant asset.
The Group also invests in lessor entities specifically to acquire assets 
for leasing. Client intermediation also includes arrangements to fund 
the purchase or construction of specific assets (most common in the
property industry). 
Fund management
The Group provides asset management services to a large number of
investment entities on an arm’ s-length basis and at market terms and
prices. The majority of these entities are investment funds that are owned
by a large and diversified number of investors. These funds are not
consolidated because the Group does not own either a significant portion
of the equity, or the risks and rewards inherent in the assets.
During 2007, Group operating expenses included charges of £80m 
(2006: £nil) related to selective support of liquidity products managed by
Barclays Global Investors and not consolidated by the Group. The Group
has continued to provide further selective support to liquidity products
subsequent to 31 st December 2007.

Barclays Capital credit market positions
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 67
Barclays Capital credit market positions
Barclays Capital credit market exposures resulted in net losses of £1,635m
in 2007, due to dislocations in the credit markets. The net losses primarily
related to ABS CDO super senior exposures, with additional losses from
other credit market exposures partially offset by gains from the general
widening of credit spreads on issued notes held at fair value.
Credit market exposures in this note are stated relative to comparatives as
at 30th June 2007, being the reporting date immediately prior to the credit
market dislocations.

ABS CDO Super Senior exposure
ABS CDO Super Senior net exposure was £4,671m (30th June 2007:
£7,432m). Exposures are stated net of writedowns and charges of
£1,412m (30th June 2007: £56m) and hedges of £1,347m (30th June
2007: £348m).
The collateral for the ABS CDO Super Senior exposures primarily
comprised Residential Mortgage Backed Securities. 79% of the RMBS
sub-prime collateral comprised 2005 or earlier vintage mortgages. 
On ABS CDO super senior exposures, the combination of subordination,
hedging and writedowns provide protection against loss levels to 72% 
on US sub-prime collateral as at 31st December 2007. None of the above
hedges of ABS CDO Super Senior exposures as at 31st December 2007
were held with monoline insurer counterparties.
Other credit market exposures
Barclays Capital held other exposures impacted by the turbulence in credit
markets, including: whole loans and other direct and indirect exposures to
US sub-prime and Alt-A borrowers; exposures to monoline insurers; and
commercial mortgage backed securities. The net losses in 2007 from
these exposures were £823m.
Other US sub-prime whole loan and net trading book exposure was
£5,037m (30th June 2007: £6,046m). Whole loans included £2,843m
(30th June 2007: £1,886m) acquired since the acquisition of EquiFirst 
in March 2007, all of which were subject to Barclays underwriting criteria.
As at 31st December 2007 the average loan to value of these EquiFirst
loans was 80% with less than 3% at above 95% loan to value. 99% of the
EquiFirst inventory was first lien.
Net exposure to the Alt-A market was £4,916m (30th June 2007:
£3,760m), through a combination of securities held on the balance 
sheet including those held in consolidated conduits and residuals. Alt-A
exposure is generally to borrowers of a higher credit quality than sub-
prime borrowers. As at 31st December 2007, 99% of the Alt-A whole loan
exposure was performing, and the average loan to value ratio was 81%.
96% of the Alt-A securities held were rated AAA or AA. 
Barclays Capital held assets with insurance protection or other credit
enhancement from monoline insurers. The value of exposure to monoline
insurers under these contracts was £1,335m (30th June 2007: £140m).
There were no claims due under these contracts as none of the underlying
assets were in default.
Exposures in our commercial mortgage backed securities business
comprised commercial real estate loans of £11,103m (30th June 2007:
£7,653m) and commercial mortgage backed securities of £1,296m 
(30th June 2007: £629m). The loan exposures were 54% US and 43%
European. The US exposures had an average loan to value of 65% and the
European exposures had an average loan to value of 71%. 87% of the
commercial mortgage backed securities held as at 31st December 2007
were AAA or AA rated.
Loans and advances to customers included £152m (30th June 2007:
£692m) of drawn liquidity facilities in respect of SIV-lites. Total exposure 
to other structured investment vehicles, including derivatives, undrawn
commercial paper backstop facilities and bonds held in trading portfolio
assets was £590m (30th June 2007: £925m).
Leveraged Finance
At 31st December 2007, drawn leveraged finance positions were
£7,368m (30th June 2007: £7,317m). The positions were stated net of
fees of £130m and impairment of £58m driven by widening of corporate
credit spreads.
Own Credit
At 31st December 2007, Barclays Capital had issued notes held at fair
value of £57,162m (30th June 2007: £44,622m). The general widening 
of credit spreads affected the carrying value of these notes and as a result
revaluation gains of £658m were recognised in trading income. Financial review

Changes in net interest income – volume and rate analysis
The following tables allocate changes in net interest income between changes in volume and changes in interest rates for the last two years. Volume and
rate variances have been calculated on the movement in the average balances and the change in the interest rates on average interest earning assets 
and average interest bearing liabilities. Where variances have arisen from changes in both volumes and interest rates, these have been allocated
proportionately between the two.

72 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Corporate sustainability
For Barclays, there are two separate but mutually dependent aspects to
sustainability. One is our duty as a bank to provide sound and enduring
returns for our shareholders, and the best possible services for our
customers. The other is our responsibility to conduct our global business
ethically, and with full regard to wider social and environmental
considerations. Our ambition is to develop both of these complementary
strands as we move forward.
Barclays as a sustainable bank
Banks are central to every society; they provide the funding that facilitates
business and entrepreneurship, support a sound financial system, and
help to create jobs and wealth. As one of the world’ s leading banks, with
nearly 135,000 employees and operations in over 50 countries across 
the world, Barclays plays a significant role, whether it is working with
governments on major infrastructure projects or bringing mainstream
banking to customers in emerging markets. 
In all of this, the customer is absolutely central. If we are to make
sustainable banking successful, and successful banking sustainable, we
must put our customers at the heart of everything we do, and build our
services around them. We must earn – and keep – their trust by ensuring
that the products we sell are understandable and appropriate. 
This may seem like a statement of the obvious, but the banking sector in
general has not always had a reputation for doing this. We want to change
that. This aspiration covers every aspect of our business and every stage in
a customer’ s relationship with us, from the purchase of a Barclays product
for the first time, to the way we assess applications for loans, to the more
general aspects of customer service such as complaints-handling,
confidentiality, and security.
Focusing more on the customer is also an integral part of what we call
‘inclusive banking’. This is partly about appealing to the broadest possible
range of people as part of our strategic move into mass-market services in
our emerging markets businesses, and partly about understanding the
exact nature of our local customer base, and adapting our business model
and product range accordingly. 
A good example is our approach to basic banking accounts. In the UK 
we now have over 660,000 customers who have our basic Cash Card
Account, and we have been working closely with consumer groups and
third parties such as housing associations to ensure that these accounts
are easily accessible and the product features and communications are
tailored to meet their needs. In Africa the potential for growth in this area 
is enormous: over 100 million of the continent’ s people have yet to be
brought into mainstream banking, and could in time buy a whole range 
of other financial services. Absa has been a pioneer of basic banking in
South Africa, and has attracted over 4 million customers to these accounts.
The same thinking is now being applied in other African markets and India,
with new basic banking products being developed. We are also distributing
these products through new and innovative formats such as express
branches and direct sales agents, alongside our traditional branches. 
This is another lesson we have learnt from our South African operations. 
In Ghana our microbanking programme is now working with over 500 Susu
collectors and reaching over 280,000 market traders across the country.
The programme is being extended to other intermediaries such as credit
unions, trade associations, microfinance institutions and church groups.
Responsible lending
We have reported on this issue in our recent Corporate Responsibility
reviews, setting out our approach to what remains a high-profile and
intractable issue, especially in the UK. In the last year we have continued 
to enforce strict criteria on new credit card applications, using a scoring
system that takes over 400 variables into account when assessing an
applicant’ s likely ability to manage their credit. Around 50% of applications
for credit cards are declined as a result. We have also extended our 
data-sharing collaboration with the UK credit reference agencies: pooling
information about cash advances and minimum payments is proving to 
be an effective way of flagging up those customers who are in danger of
incurring serious debt problems. We have a new unit that can step in at this
stage and offer support and guidance to get their finances back on track.
We are also testing a new product, Barclaycard Freedom, which combines
a credit card and the features of a structured loan, making it easier for
people to manage their borrowing and keep their interest payments down.
Customer service
We have a strategic priority to be the best bank in the UK. In the last twelve
months we have started to roll all our various customer initiatives into
what we are calling ‘Real Retail’. We are sharing best practice more actively,
and both managers and employees are getting new powers to make
decisions, and tailor their product range, based on local customer needs. 
Real Retail also includes a new programme to telephone customers to 
ask about the quality of our service and products they have purchased. 
Over 20,000 calls have been made so far, and the feedback is being
channelled back to our product development teams. 
Risk management
The incorporation of environmental and social risks into mainstream
commercial credit assessments is an area where Barclays has demonstrated
genuine leadership. 
We have been a member of the Equator Principles since their inception,
and currently chair the Steering Committee for the group of Equator banks.
We continue to assess our environmental and social impact beyond the
project finance remit of these principles (see table on page 73) and are
working to include climate change and human rights risks. We now have
ten briefing notes for all lending covering a wide range of social and
environmental risks. These notes set out an overview of the risks facing
different sectors, and the ways they can be mitigated, as well as the
legislative and regulatory environment applicable to that industry. 
A good example of this process in practice in 2007 is Absa’ s involvement
with the Bujagali Hydropower project in Uganda. A rigorous social and
environmental assessment was carried out, and the results were
incorporated into the final plans. 1
Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 73
Barclays as a responsible global citizen
Twenty years ago the idea of ‘corporate citizenship’ described a company’ s
community activities, which rarely extended beyond philanthropic
donations. Public understanding of the responsibilities of business has
evolved considerably since then. For us, being a responsible global citizen
does not just cover our award-winning community investment programme,
but also includes how we behave as an employer, and how we manage
Barclays wider social and environmental impacts. 
Climate change has become the single biggest challenge the world faces
at the beginning of the 21st century, and in response we are focusing
increasingly on our work on the environment, which includes both our
direct and indirect impacts.  
The environment
As a major financial services organisation we want to take a lead in helping
our clients thrive in a lower-carbon future, and use our position to press 
for appropriate policies and regulatory frameworks to deal with climate
change. We will be 100% carbon neutral globally by next year. We remain
committed to increasing our energy efficiency, and reducing our carbon
footprint on an ongoing basis, as well as helping our supply chain reduce
its emissions. 
We also believe we can make a positive impact though the products and
services we offer, and the lending decisions we make. In 2007, we invested
further in our emissions trading capability, and moved into the consumer
market with new lower-carbon products and services.
An example is Barclaycard Breathe, a new card that gives consumers
incentives when they buy green products, and donates half its profits to
environmental projects. In the wholesale market we have Barclays Capital’ s
commitment to the EU emissions trading market, where it brings its full
range of commodity trading and risk management expertise to bear to
help clients manage their carbon risk. Since 2005 we have traded over 600
million tonnes of carbon credits, with a notional value of over $14 billion. 
Our supply chain
Since 2006 we have required all new and high-risk suppliers to provide 
us detailed information about their social, environmental and ethical
performance. In the last year Absa adapted it for the special conditions 
of the South African market. 
Measuring the emissions generated from a company’ s supply chain is also
becoming increasingly important, and we are engaging more with our
own suppliers on this. This included a special forum for nine key suppliers,
which has been followed up with one-to-one discussions to ascertain the
proportion of each firm’ s emissions that are attributable to us. We have
identified a number of ways to help suppliers address their emissions, and
now have a working group in place to take these ideas forward in 2008. 
Human rights
We have represented the banking sector on the Business Leaders’
Initiative on Human Rights since its launch in 2003 and, since October
2006, have co-chaired the United Nations Environment Programme
Finance Initiative (UNEPFI) human rights work stream. During 2007 we
worked as part of a team of 12 financial institutions to develop an online
tool for UNEPFI that provides guidance on human rights issues associated
with corporate lending. It is designed to help identify potential risks and
how they may be reduced or managed. The guidance covers specific
issues relevant to different sectors, ranging from employment terms and
conditions, to health and safety, to child labour, to relocation of
communities, among many others.

Barclays as an employer
One of our guiding principles is to develop the best people, and in such an
intensely competitive industry we want to find, develop and retain the best
talent. We are committed to diversity as a way of helping to ensure we are able
to attract the best people. W e have a wide range of development and leadership
programmes for employees, and a policy that ensures that they are all treated
with respect, regardless of age, race, sexuality , gender or disability .
We use our employee opinion surveys to understand and engage our
employees. We continue to score well but we are working to improve 
our scores further.
As we grow internationally our workforce becomes ever more diverse,
reflecting the worldwide markets in which we operate. The percentage 
of UK ethnic minority employees has increased significantly from 7.2% in
2001, to 12.3% in 2007. As we grow we are determined to build the local
talent base in the markets in which we operate, we see this as a crucial
success factor for us in emerging markets. In the UK we also continued to
invest in the disability mentoring and ‘reasonable adjustments’ schemes
in 2007, and have again been ranked in the top 20 of Stonewall’ s list of the
best employers for lesbian, gay and bisexual people.
These are clear successes; but we have much more work to do on our
gender balance, especially at senior level: 20.6% of our senior managers
are women. The drive to improve this comes from the very top of the bank. 
Barclays in the community
Barclays has always been a proud and committed investor in its communities.
In 2007 we invested £52.4 million in communities around the world 
and 44,000 Barclays employees in 26 countries were involved in our
fundraising and volunteering initiatives. Our flagship programme, Banking
on Brighter Futures, enabled us to use our skills and expertise, as well as
our money, to maximum effect helping people improve their economic
prospects, especially those in poverty, disadvantage, and debt. Projects
ranged from supporting elderly people in the UK who are in financial
difficulty through to helping Ugandan women affected by HIV / AIDS to set
up their own businesses. This is not just about good works: the more we
help individuals and communities improve their economic circumstances
and financial literacy, the better the environment in which we operate. 
We are investing $150 million over the next five years in the Banking on
Brighter Futures programme. 1,500 projects will be supported around the
world, and employees will be encouraged to volunteer 150,000 hours of
their time on projects focusing on financial education, entrepreneurship,
employment and financial inclusion.
Governance
Corporate responsibility is firmly established as one of the Barclays
Principal Risks, which means that it is managed within a robust framework
of internal control, governance, and risk management processes.
Responsibility for Barclays Corporate Sustainability Strategy rests with the
Group Executive Committee, with oversight by the Board. The Group Chief
Executive has primary responsibility for embedding corporate sustainability
throughout Barclays, supported by the Group Executive Committee. 
This includes ensuring there are effective processes for identifying and
monitoring all the business risks or commercial opportunities that have 
a significant social, environmental or ethical dimension.
The Brand and Reputation Committee is a sub-committee of Group
Executive Committee, and is chaired by Sir Nigel Rudd, Deputy Chairman
and a Non-Executive Director on the Board. This Committee’ s role is 
to identify and manage issues that could have a significant impact on
Barclays reputation. It met six times during the year and dealt with issues
ranging from Barclays presence in Zimbabwe to new areas of commodities
business and the fee structure for Barclaycard. 
The Community Partnerships Committee, chaired by Gary Hoffman, sets
the policy and provides governance for our global community investment
programmes, and the Environmental Steering Group gives direction 
and governance to our environmental and climate change strategies. 
The Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) Forum, chaired by our Consumer
champion, Catharine French, monitors compliance across all retail and
wholesale business units, UK and non-UK, to embed TCF principles in our
relationships with customers. Taking this wider approach to TCF goes
significantly beyond our regulatory requirements.

Risk factors disclosure
78 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Risk factors
The following information sets forth certain risk factors 
that the Group believes could cause its actual future results
to differ materially from expected results. For further
information related to such matters, please refer to page 67
(Barclays Capital credit market positions), pages 80-81
(2007 risk developments), pages 96 to 104 (credit risk
management and market risk management), pages
1 07-1 1 1 (liquidity risk management and operational risk
management), page 21 7 (Note 35 – legal proceedings) and
page 21 8 (Note 36 – competition and regulatory matters).
However, other factors could also adversely affect the
Group results and so the factors discussed in this report
should not be considered to be a complete set of all
potential risks and uncertainties.
Business conditions and general economy
The profitability of Barclays businesses could be adversely affected by a
worsening of general economic conditions in the United Kingdom, globally
or in certain individual markets such as the US or South Africa. Factors
such as interest rates, inflation, investor sentiment, the availability and 
cost of credit, the liquidity of the global financial markets and the level 
and volatility of equity prices could significantly affect the activity level 
of customers. For example:
– An economic downturn or significantly higher interest rates could
adversely affect the credit quality of Barclays on-balance sheet and 
off-balance sheet assets by increasing the risk that a greater number 
of Barclays customers would be unable to meet their obligations.
– A market downturn or worsening of the economy could cause the
Group to incur mark to market losses in its trading portfolios.
– A market downturn could reduce the fees Barclays earns for managing
assets. For example, a higher level of domestic or foreign interest rates
or a downturn in trading markets could affect the flows of assets under
management.
– A market downturn would be likely to lead to a decline in the volume of
customer transactions that Barclays executes and, therefore, a decline
in the income it receives from fees and commissions and interest.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’ s
customers, clients or market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual
obligations to the Group. Credit risk may also arise where the downgrading
of an entity’ s credit rating causes the fair value of the Group’ s investment
in that entity’ s financial instruments to fall. The credit risk that the Group
faces arises mainly from commercial and consumer loans and advances,
including credit card lending.
Credit risk may also be manifested as country risk where difficulties may
arise in the country in which the exposure is domiciled, thus impeding 
or reducing the value of the asset, or where the counterparty may be the
country itself. Another form of credit risk is settlement risk, which is the
possibility that the Group may pay a counterparty – for example, a bank in
a foreign exchange transaction – but fail to receive the corresponding
settlement in return.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the Group’ s earnings or capital, or its ability to
meet business objectives, will be adversely affected by changes in the level
or volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, credit spreads,
commodity prices, equity prices and foreign exchange rates. The main
market risk arises from trading activities. The Group is also exposed to
interest rate risk in the banking book and market risk in the pension fund.
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect losses resulting from human
factors, external events, and inadequate or failed internal processes and
systems. Operational risks are inherent in Barclays operations and are
typical of any large enterprise. Major sources of operational risk include
operational process reliability, IT security, outsourcing of operations,
dependence on key suppliers, implementation of strategic change,
integration of acquisitions, fraud, human error, customer service quality,
regulatory compliance, recruitment, training and retention of staff, and
social and environmental impacts.  1
Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 79
Capital risk
Capital risk is the risk that the Group has insufficient capital resources to:
– Meet minimum regulatory capital requirements in the UK and in 
other jurisdictions such as the US and South Africa where regulated
activities are undertaken. The Group’s authority to operate as a bank 
is dependent upon the maintenance of adequate capital resources. 
– Support its strong credit rating. In addition to capital resources, the
Group’s rating is supported by a diverse portfolio of activities, an
increasingly international presence, consistent profit performance,
prudent risk management and a focus on value creation. A weaker
credit rating would increase the Group’s cost of funds.
– Support its growth and strategic options.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its obligations
when they fall due and to replace funds when they are withdrawn, with
consequent failure to repay depositors and fulfil commitments to lend.
The risk that it will be unable to do so is inherent in all banking operations
and can be impacted by a range of institution-specific and market-wide
events including, but not limited to, credit events, merger and acquisition
activity, systemic shocks and natural disasters.
Business risk 
Business risk is the risk of adverse outcomes resulting from a weak
competitive position or from poor choice of strategy, markets, products,
activities or structures. Major potential sources of business risk include
revenue volatility due to factors such as macroeconomic conditions,
inflexible cost structures, uncompetitive products or pricing and 
structural inefficiencies. 
Insurance risk
Insurance risk is the risk that the Group will have to make higher than
anticipated payments to settle claims arising from its long-term and 
short-term insurance businesses.
Legal risk
The Group is subject to a comprehensive range of legal obligations in all
countries in which it operates. As a result, the Group is exposed to many
forms of legal risk, which may arise in a number of ways. Primarily:
– the Group’s business may not be conducted in accordance with
applicable laws around the world;
– contractual obligations may either not be enforceable as intended 
or may be enforced against the Group in an adverse way;
– the intellectual property of the Group (such as its trade names) may
not be adequately protected; and
– the Group may be liable for damages to third parties harmed by the
conduct of its business.
The Group faces risk where legal proceedings are brought against it.
Regardless of whether such claims have merit, the outcome of legal
proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in financial loss.
Defending legal proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming and
there is no guarantee that all costs incurred will be recovered even if the
Group is successful. Although the Group has processes and controls to
manage legal risks, failure to manage these risks could impact the Group
adversely, both financially and by reputation.
T ax risk
The Group is subject to the tax laws in all countries in which it operates. 
A number of double taxation agreements entered between countries 
also impact on the taxation of the Group. The Group is also subject to
European Union tax law. T ax risk is the risk associated with changes in tax
law or in the interpretation of tax law. It also includes the risk of changes 
in tax rates and the risk of failure to comply with procedures required by
tax authorities. Failure to manage tax risks could lead to an additional tax
charge. It could also lead to a financial penalty for failure to comply with
required tax procedures or other aspects of tax law. If, as a result of a
particular tax risk materialising, the tax costs associated with particular
transactions are greater than anticipated, it could affect the profitability 
of those transactions. 
The Group takes a responsible and transparent approach to the
management and control of its tax affairs and related tax risk:
– tax risks are assessed as part of the Group’s formal governance
processes and are reviewed by the Executive Committee, Group
Finance Director and the Board Risk Committee;
– the tax charge is also reviewed by the Board Audit Committee;
– the tax risks of proposed transactions or new areas of business are fully
considered before proceeding;
– the Group takes appropriate advice from reputable professional firms;
– the Group employs high-quality tax professionals and provides
ongoing technical training;
– the tax professionals understand and work closely with the different
areas of the business;
– the Group uses effective, well-documented and controlled processes 
to ensure compliance with tax disclosure and filing obligations;
– where disputes arise with tax authorities with regard to the
interpretation and application of tax law, the Group is committed to
addressing the matter promptly and resolving the matter with the tax
authority in an open and constructive manner.
Effect of governmental policy and regulation
The Group’ s businesses and earnings can be affected by the fiscal or 
other policies and other actions of various governmental and regulatory
authorities in the UK, the European Union, the US, South Africa 
and elsewhere. 
Areas where changes could have an impact include:
– the monetary, interest rate and other policies of central banks and
regulatory authorities;
– general changes in government or regulatory policy that may
significantly influence investor decisions in particular markets 
in which the Group operates;
– general changes in the regulatory requirements, for example, prudential
rules relating to the capital adequacy framework (page 85) and rules
designed to promote financial stability and increase depositor protection;
– changes and rules in competition and pricing environments;
– further developments in the financial reporting environment;
– expropriation, nationalisation, confiscation of assets and changes 
in legislation relating to foreign ownership; and
– other unfavourable political, military or diplomatic developments
producing social instability or legal uncertainty which in turn may 
affect demand for the Group’s products and services. 
Regulatory compliance risk
Regulatory compliance risk arises from a failure or inability to comply fully
with the laws, regulations or codes applicable specifically to the financial
services industry. Non compliance could lead to fines, public reprimands,
damage to reputation, enforced suspension of operations or, in extreme
cases, withdrawal of authorisations to operate.
Impact of strategic decisions taken by the Group
The Group devotes substantial management and planning resources to
the development of strategic plans for organic growth and identification 
of possible acquisitions, supported by substantial expenditure to generate
growth in customer business. If these strategic plans do not deliver as
anticipated, the Group’ s earnings could grow more slowly or decline.
Competition
The global financial services markets in which the Group operates are
highly competitive. Innovative competition for corporate, institutional 
and retail clients and customers comes both from incumbent players 
and a steady stream of new market entrants. The landscape is expected 
to remain highly competitive in all areas, which could adversely affect 
the Group’ s profitability if the Group fails to retain and attract clients 
and customers. 80 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007

Introduction
80 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
This risk section outlines Barclays approach to risk
management, explaining our objectives as well as the 
high level policies, processes, measurement techniques
and controls that are used. This also presents our
summary information and disclosure on our portfolios
and positions. Consequent to the adoption of IFRS 7 , 
some of our risk disclosure is moved from this section 
to the financial statements section of this report, as
described in our list of tables on page 77 .
2007 Developments
Wholesale credit risk
The results of severe disruption in the US sub-prime mortgage market
were felt across many wholesale credit markets in the second half of 2007,
and were reflected in wider credit spreads, higher volatility, tight liquidity in
interbank and commercial paper markets, more constrained debt issuance
and lower investor risk appetite. Although impairment and other credit
provisions in Barclays Capital rose as a consequence of these difficult 
sub-prime market conditions, our risks in these portfolios were identified
in the first half and management actions were taken to reduce limits and
positions. Further reductions and increased hedging through the rest of
the year continued to bring net positions down and limited the financial
effect of the significant decline in market conditions. Our ABS CDO 
Super Senior positions were reduced during the year and our remaining
exposure reflected netting against writedowns, hedges, and subordination.
At the end of the year, market conditions remained difficult with reduced
liquidity in cash and securitised products, and reflected stress at some
counterparties such as the monoline insurers.
The international markets for Leveraged Finance were also disrupted 
in 2007. The level of underwritten positions was steady during the 
second half, with some small turnover in the portfolio. The vast majority 
of positions held were senior tranches. Liquidity conditions at year 
end remained constrained.
The Group’ s wholesale credit risk profile in 2007 benefited from the
diversification available from the UK and international portfolios, which
grew by 14% and 41% respectively. The corporate credit risk profile
remained steady, with corporate credit ratings and watch list balances
broadly stable. 
At Barclays Commercial Bank there was good growth in loans and
advances. The risk profile of the Larger Business portfolio remained stable
as early warning list balances, default rates and loan loss rates were steady.
There was no increase to exposure levels to leveraged finance during 2007
and limits were reduced.
Wholesale credit portfolio performance was steady in South Africa,
particularly for Absa’ s most significant wholesale portfolios – agriculture,
property and sovereign lending – which were relatively unaffected during
2007 by interest rate rises compared with consumer-facing sectors and
retail portfolios. Relatively good performance in these sectors in 2007 was
reflected in a reduction in Absa’ s wholesale impairment charge. After many
years of positive economic conditions in South Africa, the wholsesale
portfolios will be under more stress in current market conditions.
Loan loss rates across the Western Europe and Emerging Markets
wholesale businesses were stable in 2007. The Group continued to invest
in risk management infrastructure to support these businesses’ growth
initiatives in Dubai, India, Egypt and Italy. 
Going into 2008, the credit environment reflects concern about weakening
economic conditions in our major markets. Credit spreads and other
indicators signal that the credit cycle has changed after a long period 
of stability. We expect some deterioration in credit metrics as default
probabilities move toward their medium-term averages. This environment 
has led to a more cautious approach to credit assessment, pricing and
ongoing control in the financial industry, which we believe will continue
through the year. 1

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 81 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 81
Liquidity risk
Bank funding markets and general liquidity in credit markets came under
pressure in 2007. In the second half, some money market participants
faced difficulties in obtaining funding beyond one week, and term LIBOR
premiums rose despite the helpful provision of liquidity by central banks.
The cost of longer-term bank funding and capital also increased, and
funding channels such as securitisation and covered bond issuance
became significantly constrained. Despite these developments, the Group’ s
liquidity position remained strong due to its deep retail funding base, its
diversity of institutional funding sources across tenors, counterparties and
geographies and its limited reliance on securitisation as a funding source. 
Operational risk
In 2007, Barclays embedded the advanced measurement approach
(AMA) to operational risk across the Group, having received AMA 
approval from the FSA and the SARB. Barclays now allocates operational
risk economic capital by business, providing operational insight and
greater tangible incentives to the Group’ s businesses to further improve
the management of their operational risk profiles. As a percentage 
of revenues, operational risk events fell in 2007.
Financial crime
The Group introduced two-factor authentication for online transactions
through its PINsentry device and continued to offer all UK personal
customers anti-phishing software to combat internet fraud. Combined
with improvements in transaction profiling, these changes enabled 
us to reduce net reported fraud losses. The threat from financial crime
constantly evolves, however, and Barclays will continue to build the
capacity to respond rapidly to emerging issues as well as to invest 
in strategic improvements in transaction channel security.
Basel II and capital management
New capital adequacy rules came into force in the UK from 1st January
2008, following the implementation of the Basel II banking accord.
Barclays regulatory capital requirement will now more closely reflect 
the risk profile as measured by its own risk measurement systems (an
approach termed the Advanced Internal Ratings Based approach or AIRB).
Permission from the FSA to apply the AIRB approach to capital calculations
was the culmination of a lengthy and detailed programme of work across
all business areas and covering all risk types. As part of the application
process, Barclays assessed over 200 models to ensure that they were
consistent with regulators’ standards and that they met the ‘use’ test, which
assesses a model’ s fitness as an input to capital calculations by the extent
to which management make use of its output in business decisions.
Our focus over the coming years will be to further enhance risk models,
processes and systems infrastructure, in line with our ambition to remain
at the leading edge of risk management. With the most significant
portfolios already consistent with the AIRB approach, the focus of our
Basel II work will now be to progress the roll-out of the advanced approach
for the remaining minority of our portfolios. In line with the schedule
agreed with regulators, we will complete this process by 2011. 
Retail credit risk
A continued improvement in credit quality in the UK unsecured portfolios
was a principal feature of the Group’ s retail credit risk profile during 2007.
Barclaycard continued the underwriting revisions begun in 2006 in UK
credit cards, and successfully reduced impairment in the main Barclays
branded cards portfolio. Flows into delinquency and arrears balances fell,
as did general charge-offs, which were helped by a fall in charge-offs due
to bankruptcy. New customer quality increased again in 2007, reflected in
a sustained improvement in average approval scores and a fall in early
cycle delinquency rates. 
The UK unsecured loans portfolio, which is now managed within UK Retail
Banking, saw reduced early and late cycle delinquency resulting from
revised underwriting criteria. Improved collections processes helped 
to reduce impairment in Local Business, while in UK Home Finance,
delinquency and possession rates remained at the lows recorded since
2004, and impairment charges were negligible. Barclays delinquency and
possession rates remain below industry averages, reflecting the high credit
quality of the portfolio.
Lending criteria in Absa’ s retail portfolios were tightened in response to 
a more difficult credit environment, signalled by a rise in arrears rates. 
The change in conditions was primarily driven by a prolonged series of
interest rate rises and the implementation of new consumer lending
legislation in June 2007.
We increased our investment in credit risk infrastructure in India and Italy
to support the launch or expansion of retail banking operations in those
countries during 2007. Barclays has also established a credit risk
modelling centre in Madrid to support our strategic growth objectives 
in the Western Europe business.
The US card business continued to grow, and the underwriting and
account management criteria were adjusted as the US retail environment
weakened during the year. 
Looking ahead this year, we expect the retail credit environment to be
more challenging in Absa and to some degree in the US portfolio. The UK
portfolios’ performance, which has improved in the past two years, will be
subject to the evolving economic climate anticipated in 2008.
Risk tendency
Risk tendency at 2007 year-end reflected an increase in portfolio size as
well as some weakening in credit grades, evidenced by wider spreads in
wholesale credit and potentially more difficult conditions in some of the
international retail portfolios in 2008.
Country risk
The portfolio is reasonably well diversified, assisted by increases in
business levels in a range of European, African and Asian countries.
Market risk
Dislocation in the credit markets had an impact on all major interest rate,
equity and foreign exchange markets, which also experienced higher
volatility, particularly in the second half. Barclays Capital’s market risk
exposure, as measured by average total Daily Value at Risk (DVaR), increased
13% to an average of £42m in 2007. Over the same period, average daily
market risk revenue increased 19% to £26m, satisfying our objective that
trading revenues should grow at or above the rate of increase in risk levels.
The average DVaR on interest rate and credit spread exposures was broadly
unchanged, with increasing volatility in credit spreads offset by reduced
positions held in the credit markets. This reduction in exposure resulted 
in a lower level of credit stress loss, which is another important market risk
control for Barclays Capital. Average commodity DVaR and equity DVaR
increased as those businesses grew. Diversification across risk types
remaining significant, reflecting the broad product mix. Higher market
volatilities in the fourth quarter led to an increase in DVaR at year end, 
and will contribute to higher average DVaRs in 2008.  Risk management 
Barclays approach to risk management
82 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Barclays approach to risk management
Barclays approach to risk management involves a number 
of fundamental elements that drive our processes across 
the Group:
The Group’ s Risk appetite sets out the level of risk that the
Bank is willing to take in pursuit of its business objectives. 
This is expressed as the Group’ s appetite for earnings volatility
across all businesses from credit, market, and operational risk.
It is calibrated against our broad financial targets, including
income and impairment targets, dividend coverage and
capital levels. It is prepared each year as part of the Group’ s
Medium T erm Planning process, and combines a top-down
view of the Bank’ s risk capacity with a bottom-up view of the
risk profile requested and recommended by each business.
This entails making business plan adjustments as necessary
to ensure that our Medium T erm Plan creates a risk profile
that meets our Risk Appetite (page 86).
The Principal risk policy covers the Group’ s main risk types,
assigning responsibility for the management of specific risks,
and setting out the requirements for control frameworks for
all of the risk types. The individual control frameworks are
reinforced by a robust system of review and challenge, and 
a governance process of aggregation and broad review 
by businesses and risk across the Group (page 83). 
Barclays Risk methodologies include systems that enable 
the Group to measure, aggregate and report risk for internal
and regulatory purposes. As an example, our credit grading
models produce Internal Ratings through internally derived
estimates of default probabilities. These measurements 
are used by management in an extensive range of decisions,
from credit grading, pricing and approval to portfolio
management, economic capital allocation and capital
adequacy processes (page 85).
Risk management is a fundamental part of Barclays business activity and
an essential component of its planning process. To keep risk management
at the centre of the executive agenda, it is embedded in the everyday
management of the business.
Barclays ensures that it has the functional capacity to manage the risk 
in new and existing businesses. At a strategic level, our risk management
objectives are:
– To identify the Group’ s material risks and ensure that business profile
and plans are consistent with risk appetite.
– To optimise risk/return decisions by taking them as closely as possible
to the business, while establishing strong and independent review and
challenge structures.
– To ensure that business growth plans are properly supported by
effective risk infrastructure.
– To manage risk profile to ensure that specific financial deliverables
remain possible under a range of adverse business conditions.
– To help executives improve the control and coordination of risk taking
across the business.
In pursuit of these objectives, Group Risk breaks down risk management
into five discrete processes: direct, assess, control, report, and
manage/challenge (see panel below). 
– Understand the principal risks to achieving
 Group strategy.
– Establish Risk Appetite.
– Establish and communicate the risk 
 management framework including 
 responsibilities, authorities and key controls.
Strategy Process
Direct
– Establish the process for identifying and 
 analysing business-level risks.
– Agree and implement measurement and 
 reporting standards and methodologies.
Assess
– Establish key control processes and practices, 
 including limit structures, impairment 
 allowance criteria and reporting requirements.
– Monitor the operation of the controls and 
 adherence to risk direction and limits.
– Provide early warning of control or appetite 
 breaches.
– Ensure that risk management practices and 
 conditions are appropriate for the business 
 environment.
Control
– Interpret and report on risk exposures, 
 concentrations and risk-taking outcomes.
– Interpret and report on sensitivities and 
 Key Risk Indicators.
– Communicate with external parties.
Report
– Review and challenge all aspects of the 
 Group’s risk profile.
– Assess new risk-return opportunities.
– Advise on optimising the Group’s risk profile.
– Review and challenge risk management 
 practices.

Business Risk Directors
Risk-Type Heads exist at Group-level for the main risk types, and report 
to the Risk Director. Along with their teams, they are responsible for
establishing a risk control framework and risk oversight.
Each business has an embedded risk management team reporting to 
a Business Risk Director or Chief Credit Officer who reports to the Risk
Director. The risk management teams assist Group Risk in the formulation
of Group Risk policy and its implementation across the businesses.
Business risk teams, each under the management of a Business Risk
Director, are responsible for assisting Business Heads in the identification
and management of their business risk profiles and for implementing
appropriate controls. The functional coverage of risk responsibilities is
illustrated in the diagram below.
Internal Audit is responsible for the independent review of risk
management and the control environment.
To support expanded risk taking, Barclays has continued to strengthen the
independent and specialised risk teams in each of its businesses, supported
by matching teams at Group level, acting in both a consultancy and
oversight capacity. As a prerequisite to business growth plans, it has made
the recruitment, development and retention of risk professionals a priority.
Organisation and structure
Responsibility for risk management resides at all levels within the 
Group, from the Executive down through the organisation to each
business manager and risk specialist. Barclays distributes these
responsibilities so that risk/return decisions are taken at the most
appropriate level; as close as possible to the business, and subject to
robust and effective review and challenge.
Every business manager is accountable for managing risk in his or her
business area; they must understand and control the key risks inherent in
the business undertaken. Each business area also employs risk specialists
to provide an independent control function and to support the development
of a strong risk management environment. This functional approach to risk
management is built on formal control processes that rely on individual
responsibility and independent oversight, as well as challenge through
peer reviews.
The Board approves Risk Appetite and the Board Risk Committee monitors
the Group’ s risk profile against this agreed appetite.
Business Heads are responsible for the identification and management of
risk in their businesses.
The Risk Director, under delegated authority from the Group Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director, has responsibility for ensuring
effective risk management and control. Risk management

The Committees shown below receive regular and comprehensive reports.
The Board Risk Committee receives a quarterly report covering all of our
principal risks. The Board Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on
control issues of significance and half-yearly impairment allowances and
regulatory reports. Both Committees also receive reports dealing in more
depth with specific issues relevant at the time. The proceedings of both
Committees are reported to the full Board, which also receives a concise
quarterly risk report. Internal Audit supports both Committees by
attendance and/or the provision of quarterly reports resulting from 
its work on governance, risk and control issues of significance. 
The Board Audit Committee reviews and approves Internal Audit’ s 
plans and resources, and evaluates the effectiveness of Internal Audit. 
An assessment by external advisers is also carried out periodically.
In addition to the Committees shown in the chart, there is a Brand and
Reputation Committee reviewing emerging issues with potentially
significant reputational impact.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 85
Material risks and control framework
As well as overall responsibility for the Group's risk exposure versus
appetite, the Board is also responsible for the Group Internal Control and
Assurance Framework (‘GICAF’). As part of the GICAF , it approves the
Principal Risks Policy, which sets out responsibilities for the management
of the Group’ s most significant risk exposures. The Board oversees the
operating effectiveness of the Principal Risks Policy through the regular
review of reports on the Group’ s material risk exposures and controls. 
The Group’ s risk categorisation comprises 17 risk categories (‘Level 1’),
thirteen of which are known as Principal Risks. Each Principal Risk is owned
by a senior individual at the Group level, who liaises with Principal Risk
owners within Business and Central Support Units. The 17 risk categories
are shown in the panel below.
Each Group Principal Risk Owner (‘GPRO’) is responsible for setting
minimum control requirements for their risk and for overseeing the risk
and control performance across the Group. Group control requirements
(e.g. Group Policies/Processes/Committee oversight) for each of these
risks are defined, in consultation with Business Units, and communicated
and maintained by the GPRO. 
Implementation of the control requirements for each Principal Risk
provides each Business or Central Support Unit with the foundation of its
system of internal control for that particular risk. This will usually be built
upon in more detail, according to the circumstances of each Business Unit,
to provide a complete and appropriate system of internal control. 
The specific controls for individual Principal Risks are supplemented 
by generic risk management requirements. These requirements are
articulated as the Group’ s Operational Risk Management Framework 
(see page 109) and include policies on:
– Internal Risk Event Identification and Reporting
– Detailed Risk and Control Assessment
– Key Indicators
– Key Risk Scenarios
Business Unit and Central Support Unit Heads are responsible for
maintaining ongoing assurance that the controls they have put in place 
to manage the risks to their business objectives are operating effectively.
They are required to undertake a formal six-monthly review of assurance
information. These reviews support the regulatory requirement for the
Group to make a statement about its system of internal control (the
‘Turnbull’ statement), in the annual report and accounts.
Capital adequacy
In order to maximise shareholder value through optimising both the 
level and mix of capital resources, Barclays operates a centralised capital
management model, considering both regulatory and economic capital.
Decisions on the allocation of capital resources, conducted as part of the
strategic planning review, are based on a number of factors including
returns on economic and regulatory capital. 
The Group’ s capital management objectives are to:
– Support the Group’s AA credit rating.
– Maintain sufficient capital resources to support the Group’s risk
appetite and economic capital requirements.
– Maintain sufficient capital resources to meet the FSA ’s minimum
regulatory capital requirements and the US Federal Reserve Bank’s
requirements that a financial holding company be well capitalised. 
– Ensure locally regulated subsidiaries can meet their minimum 
capital requirements.
Treasury Committee manages compliance with the Group’ s capital
management objectives. The Committee reviews actual and forecast
capital demand and resources on a monthly basis.
The processes in place for delivering the Group’ s capital management
objectives include:
– Establishment of internal targets for capital demand and ratios
– Ensuring local entity regulatory capital adequacy
– Annual Risk Appetite setting
– Review of the Group’ strategic medium-term plan
– Economic capital management
– Stress testing
– Managing capital ratio sensitivity to foreign exchange rate movements
Internal targets
To support its capital management objectives, the Group sets internal
targets for its key capital ratios. The internal targets exceed minimum
capital requirements to take into account:
– Possible volatility in the anticipated demand for capital caused by
accessing new business opportunities, including mergers and
acquisitions, by unanticipated drawdown of committed facilities 
or by deterioration in the credit quality of the Group’s assets
– Possible volatility of reported profits and other capital resources
compared with forecast
– Capital ratio sensitivity to foreign exchange rate movements
– A need for flexibility in debt capital issuance and securitisation plans

Local entity regulatory capital adequacy
The Group manages its capital resources to ensure that those 
Group entities that are subject to local capital adequacy regulation in
individual jurisdictions meet their minimum capital requirements. Local
management manages compliance with subsidiary entity minimum
regulatory capital requirements with reporting to local Asset and Liability
Committees and to Treasury Committee, as required.
Injections of capital resources into Group subsidiary entities are controlled
under authorities delegated from the Group Executive Committee. The
Group’ s policy is for profits generated in subsidiary entities to be
repatriated to Barclays Bank PLC in the form of dividends.
Annual risk appetite setting
Risk Appetite is the level of risk Barclays chooses to take in pursuit of its
strategic objectives, recognising a range of possible outcomes as business
plans are implemented. Barclays framework, approved by the Board Risk
Committee, combines a top-down view of its capacity to take risk with a
bottom-up view of the business risk profile requested and recommended
by each business area. 
T o determine this acceptable level of risk, management estimates the
potential earnings volatility from different businesses under various scenarios.
This annual setting of Risk Appetite considers the bank’ s ability to support
business growth, desired dividend payout levels and capital ratio targets. 
If the projections entail too high a level of risk, management will challenge
each area to find new ways to rebalance the business mix to incur less risk
on a diversified basis. Performance against Risk Appetite is measured and
reported to the Executive and Board regularly throughout the year.
Barclays believes that this framework enables it to:
– Improve risk and return characteristics across the business
– Help meet growth targets within an overall risk appetite and protect 
the Group’s performance
– Improve management confidence and debate regarding our risk profile
– Improve executive management control and co-ordination of risk-
taking across businesses
– Enable unused risk capacity to be identified and thus profitable
opportunities to be highlighted.
The Risk Appetite framework considers credit, market and operational risk
and is applied using two perspectives: ‘financial volatility’ and ‘mandate
and scale’. 
Financial Volatility is the level of potential deviation from expected financial
performance that Barclays is prepared to sustain at relevant points on the
risk profile. It is established with reference to the strategic objectives and
to the business plans of the Group, including the achievement of annual
financial targets, payment of dividends, funding of capital growth and
maintenance of acceptable capital ratios and our credit rating. 
The portfolio is analysed in this way at four representative levels: 
– Expected performance (including the average credit losses based 
on measurements over many years)
– A level of loss that corresponds to moderate increases in market, 
credit or operational risk from expected levels
– A more severe level of loss which is much less likely
– An extreme but highly improbable level of loss which is used to
determine the Group’s economic capital
These potentially larger but increasingly less likely levels of loss are
illustrated in the Risk Appetite concepts chart below. 
The Mandate and Scale framework is a formal review and control of our
business activities to ensure that they are within our mandate (i.e. aligned
to the expectations of external stakeholders) and are of an appropriate
scale (relative to the risk and reward of the underlying activities).
Appropriate assurance is achieved by using limits and triggers to avoid
concentrations and operational risks which could lead to unexpected
losses of a scale that would result in a disproportionate fall in Barclays
market capitalisation. 
Taken as a whole, the Risk Appetite framework provides a basis for the
allocation of risk capacity to each business. Since the level of loss at any
given probability is dependent on the portfolio of exposures in each business,
the statistical measurement for each key risk category gives the Group
clearer sight and better control of risk-taking throughout the enterprise.
Review of the Group’s strategic medium-term plan
Capital adequacy forms a critical part of the Group’ s annual strategic
medium-term planning process. During the planning process, the Group
sets limits for business capital demand to ensure the capital management
objectives including meeting internal targets will continue to be met over
the medium-term period. Treasury Committee reviews the limits on a
monthly basis.

Stress testing
As part of the annual stress testing process, Barclays estimates the impact
of a severe economic downturn on the projected demand and supply of
capital. This process enables the Group to assess whether it could meet its
minimum regulatory capital requirements throughout a severe recession.
The Risk Appetite numbers are validated by estimating the Group
sensitivity to adverse changes in the business environment and to include
operational events that impact the Group as a whole using stress testing
and scenario analysis. For instance, changes in certain macroeconomic
variables represent environmental stresses which may reveal systemic
credit and market risk sensitivities in our retail and wholesale portfolios.
The recession scenarios considered incorporate changes in
macroeconomic variables, including:
– Weaker GDP , employment or property prices 
– Higher interest rates 
– Lower equity prices 
– Interest rate curve shifts
Such Group-wide stress tests allow senior management to gain a better
understanding of how portfolios are likely to react to changing economic
and geopolitical conditions and how the Group can best prepare for and
react to them. The stress test simulates the balance sheet and profit and
loss effects of stresses across the Group, investigating the impact on profits
and the ability to maintain appropriate capital ratios. Insights gained are
fully integrated into the senior management process and the Risk Appetite
framework. This process of analysis and senior management oversight
also provides the basis for fulfilling the stress testing requirements of 
Basel II.
Group-wide stress testing is only one of a number of stress test analyses
that are performed as part of the wider risk management process. 
Specific stress test analysis is used across all risk types to gain a better
understanding of the risk profile and the potential effects of changes in
external factors. These stress tests are performed at a range of different
levels, from analysis covering specific stresses on individual sub-portfolios
(e.g. high value mortgages in the South East of England), to portfolio level
stresses (e.g. the overall commodities portfolio).
Managing capital ratio sensitivity to foreign exchange 
rate movements
The Group’ s regulatory capital ratios are sensitive to foreign exchange
movements in reserves, goodwill, minority interests and other non Sterling
debt capital as well as non Sterling risk weighted assets. For material
currencies, the Group seeks to hold capital in currencies to match the risk
weighted assets transacted in those currencies, in the same proportion 
as the Group capital ratio targets, also taking into account the impact of
hedging net investments.
Achieving the planned performance in each business is dependent upon
the ability of the business to direct, assess, control, report, and manage
and challenge the risks in the business accurately. Group Risk supports the
planning process by providing robust review and challenge of the business
plans to ensure that:
– The figures relating to risk are internally consistent and accurate
– The plans are achievable given the risk management capabilities 
of the businesses
– The plans efficiently utilise, but do not exceed, the Group’ s risk appetite.
This review and challenge is achieved through Risk Executive Dialogues
involving among others, the Group Risk Director and the business 
risk directors.
Economic capital management
Economic capital is an internal measure of the minimum equity and
preference capital required for the Group to maintain its credit rating
based upon its risk profile.
Barclays assesses economic capital requirements by measuring the 
Group risk profile using both internally and externally developed models.
The Group assigns economic capital primarily within the following risks:
Credit Risk, Market Risk, Business Risk, Operational Risk, Insurance Risk,
Fixed Assets and Private Equity. Group Risk owns the methodology and
policy for economic capital while the businesses are primarily responsible
for the calculation.
The Group regularly enhances its economic capital methodology and
benchmarks outputs to external reference points. The framework reflects
default probabilities during average credit conditions, rather than those
prevailing at the balance sheet date, thus removing cyclicality from the
economic capital calculation. Economic capital for wholesale credit risk
includes counterparty credit risk arising as a result of credit risk on traded
market exposures. The framework also adjusts economic capital to reflect
time horizon, correlation of risks and risk concentrations.
Economic capital is allocated on a consistent basis across all of Barclays
businesses and risk activities. A single cost of equity is applied to calculate
the cost of risk. Economic capital allocations reflect varying levels of risk. 
The total average economic capital required by the Group, as determined
by risk assessment models and after considering the Group’ s estimated
portfolio effects, is compared with the average supply of capital resources
to evaluate economic capital utilisation. 
The Group’ s economic capital calculations form the basis of its Internal
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (‘ICAAP’) submission to the FSA
under Pillar 2 of Basel II. Capital resources
In 2007, UK Retail Banking economic capital allocation increased £100m to
£3,400m (2006: £3,300m), reflecting lending growth in UK mortgages offset
by a reduction in consumer lending following methodology enhancements.
Barclays Commercial Bank economic capital allocation increased £500m
to £3,200m (2006: £2,700m) as a consequence of lending growth and
implementation of updated Credit and Operational Risk models.
Barclaycard economic capital allocation increased £150m to £2,100m
(2006: £1,950m), as a consequence of asset growth, predominantly 
in secured lending and in Barclaycard international, offset by a reduction 
in UK Cards following the sale of Monument card portfolio.
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa economic
capital allocation increased £400m to £1,600m (2006: £1,200m). This was
driven by lending growth across Western Europe and Emerging Markets
and some credit deterioration in Africa. International Retail and Commercial
Banking – Absa economic capital allocation (excluding the risk borne by the
minority interest) increased £200m to £950m (2006: £750m), reflecting
lending growth in the business bank portfolio.
Barclays Capital economic capital increased £1,450m to £5,200m 
(2006: £3,750m). This was driven by growth in the investment portfolio,
exposure to drawn leveraged finance underwriting positions and
deterioration in credit quality in the US.

Model governance
Barclays has a large number of models in place across the Group, covering
all risk types. To minimise the risk of loss through model failure, a Group
Policy for the Control of Model Risk has been developed.
The Policy helps reduce the potential for model failure by setting 
minimum standards around the end-to-end model development and
implementation process. The Policy also sets the Group governance
processes for all models, which allows model risk to be monitored across
the Group, and seeks to identify and escalate any potential problems at an
early stage. 
To help ensure that sufficient management time is spent on the more
material models, each model is provided with a materiality rating. 
Group Model Risk Policy defines the materiality ranges for all model types.
The materiality ranges are based on an assessment of the impact to the
Group in the event of a model error. The materiality affects the approval
and reporting level for each model, with the most material models being
approved by Group Executive Committee (ExCo).
The standards of model build, implementation, monitoring and
maintenance do not change with the materiality level.
Documentation must be sufficiently detailed to allow an expert to recreate
the model from the original data sources. It must include a description of
the data used for model development, the methodology used (and the
rationale for choosing such a methodology), a description of any
assumptions used in the model, and details of where the model 
works well and areas that are known model weaknesses. 
All models are subject to a validation and independent review process
before the model can be signed-off for implementation. The model
validation exercise must demonstrate that the model is fit for purpose 
and provides accurate estimates. The independent review process will 
also ensure that all aspects of the model development process have 
been performed in a suitable manner. 
The sign-off process ensures that the model is technically fit for purpose
as well as ensuring that the model satisfies the business requirements and
all the relevant regulatory requirements. The rules for model sign-off are
based on materiality, with all of a business unit’ s models at least initially
being approved in business-led committees, and Group involvement
increasing as the models become more material. The most material models
receive their ultimate sign-off for implementation from Group ExCo. 
All models within the Group are subject to an annual review, to ensure 
that the models are performing as expected, and that assumptions used
in model development are still appropriate. In additional to annual review,
many models are subject to more frequent performance monitoring.
Model performance monitoring ensures that deficiencies in models 
are identified early, and that remedial action can be taken before the
deficiency becomes serious and affects the decision-making process. 
Externally developed models are subject to the same standards as internal
models, and must be initially approved for use following a validation and
independent review process. External models are also subject to the same
standards for ongoing monitoring and annual validation requirements. Risk management
Credit risk management
90 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss should any 
of the Group’ s customers, clients or market counterparties
fail to fulfil their contractual obligations to the Group. 
Credit risk may also arise where the downgrading of an
entity’ s credit rating causes the fair value of the Group’ s
investment in that entity’ s financial instruments to fall. 
The credit risk that the Group faces arises mainly from
commercial and consumer loans and advances, including
credit card lending. 
The granting of credit is one of the Group’ s major sources of income and 
as its most significant risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources 
to controlling it. The importance of credit risk is illustrated by noting that
two-thirds of risk-based economic capital is allocated to credit risk. Credit
exposures arise principally in loans and advances.
In managing credit risk, the Group applies the five-step risk management
process and internal control framework described previously (page 82).
Specific credit risk management objectives are:
– To gain a clear and accurate understanding and assessment of credit
risk across the business, from the level of individual facilities up to the
total portfolio.
– To control and plan the taking of credit risk, ensuring it is coherently
priced across the business and avoiding undesirable concentrations.
– To support strategic growth and decision-making based on sound
credit risk management principles and a pro-active approach to
identifying and measuring new risks.
– To ensure a robust framework for the creation, use and ongoing
monitoring of the Group’s credit risk measurement models. 
– To ensure that our balance sheet correctly reflects the value of our
assets in accordance with accounting principles.
Organisation and structure
Barclays has structured the responsibilities of credit risk management 
so that decisions are taken as close as possible to the business, whilst
ensuring robust review and challenge of performance, risk infrastructure
and strategic plans.
The credit risk management teams in each business are accountable to
the Business Risk Directors in those businesses who, in turn, report to the
heads of their businesses and also to the Risk Director. 
These credit risk management teams assist Group Risk in the formulation
of Group Risk policy and its implementation across the businesses.
Examples include: 
– maximum exposure guidelines to limit the exposures to an individual
customer or counterparty
– country risk policies to specify risk appetite by country and avoid
excessive concentration of credit risk in individual countries 
– policies to limit lending to certain industrial sectors
– underwriting criteria for personal loans and maximum loan-to-value
ratios for home loans
Within Group Risk, the Credit Risk function provides Group-wide direction
of credit risk-taking. This functional team manages the resolution of all
significant credit policy issues and runs the Credit Committee, which
approves major credit decisions. 
The principal Committees that review credit risk management, formulate
overall Group credit policy and resolve all significant credit policy issues 
are the Group Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee, the Group
Retail Credit Risk Management Committee, the Risk Oversight Committee
and the Board Risk Committee (see page 84 for more details of this
Committee). The Board Audit Committee also reviews the impairment
allowance as part of financial reporting.  1

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 91
Measurement, reporting and internal ratings
The principal objective of credit risk measurement is to produce the 
most accurate possible quantitative assessment of the credit risk to 
which the Group is exposed, from the level of individual facilities up 
to the total portfolio.
The key building blocks in this quantitative assessment are:
– Probability of default (PD)
– Exposure in the event of default (EAD)
– Severity of loss given default (LGD)
Barclays first began to use internal estimates of PD (internal ratings) in all
its main businesses in the 1990s. Internally derived estimates for PD, EAD
and LGD have been used since then in all our major risk decision making
processes, enabling the application of coherent risk measurement across
all credit exposures, retail and wholesale. 
With the advent of the Basel II accord on banking, Barclays has been 
given permission to use internal rating models as an input in its regulatory
capital calculations. In preparation, Barclays has spent considerable time
developing and upgrading a number of such models across the Group,
moving towards compliance with the Basel II advanced internal ratings
based approach. As part of this process, all Basel credit risk models are
assessed against the Basel II minimum requirements prior to model 
sign-off to ensure that they are fit to be used for regulatory purposes. 
Applications of internal ratings
The three components described above – the probability of default,
exposure at default and loss given default – are building blocks used in a
variety of applications that measure credit risk across the entire portfolio.
Two examples are Risk Tendency (RT) and Expected Loss (EL) which 
are statistical estimates of the average loss for the loan portfolio for 
a 12-month period, taking into account the portfolio’ s size and risk
characteristics under either current credit conditions (RT) or average
credit conditions (EL). As such, RT uses a point-in-time PD while EL uses 
a through-the-cycle PD but the basic calculation is the same for both:
PD x EAD x LGD 
Since through-the-cycle PDs provide a measure of risk that is independent
of the current credit conditions for a particular customer type, they are
more stable than point-in-time ratings. RT and EL provide insight into the
credit quality of the portfolio and assist management in tracking risk
changes as the Group’ s stock of credit exposures evolves in size or risk
profile in the course of business.
As our understanding and experience have developed, we have extended
the use and sophistication of internal ratings. The other main business
processes that use internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD, are as follows:
– Credit Grading – originally introduced in the early 1990s to provide a
common measure of risk across the Group using an eight point rating
scale; wholesale credit grading now employs a 21 point scale (Barclays
Masterscale). 
– Credit Approval – a rating scale is used to set differentiated credit
sanctioning levels based upon a PD, so that credit risks are reviewed at
appropriate levels.
– Risk Appetite – measures of expected loss and the potential volatility 
of loss are used in the Group’s Risk Appetite framework (see page 86).
– Pricing – within the corporate mass market portfolios we first
developed and used risk adjusted pricing models in the early 1990s 
to differentiate risk reward decisions.
– IAS Impairment calculations – many of our collective impairment
estimates incorporate the use of our PD and LGD models.
– Economic capital (EC) allocation – most EC calculations use the same
through-the-cycle PD and EAD inputs as the regulatory capital (RC)
process. The process also uses the same underlying LGD model
outputs as the RC calculation, but does not incorporate the economic
downturn adjustment used in RC calculations.
– Risk management information – Group and the main business units
have for several years received either Key Information Packs or other
risk reports focused on EL and EC information to inform senior
management on issues such as the business performance, Risk
Appetite and consumption of EC. 
Calculation of internal ratings
To calculate probability of default (PD), Barclays assesses the credit 
quality of borrowers and other counterparties and assigns them an
internal risk rating. 
Multiple rating methodologies may be used to inform the rating decision
on individual large credits, such as internal and external models, rating
agency ratings, and for wholesale assets market information such as credit
spreads. For smaller credits, a single source may suffice such as the result
from an internal rating model. 
Barclays recognises the need for two different expressions of PD
depending on the purpose for which it is used. For the purposes of
calculating regulatory and economic capital, long-run average through-
the-cycle PDs are required. However, for the purposes of pricing and risk
tendency, PDs should represent the best estimate of probability of default,
typically in the next 12 months, dependent on the current position in the
credit cycle. Hence, point-in-time PDs are also required.
When each PD model is constructed, its output is specified as one of
point-in-time (PIT) or through-the-cycle (TTC) or a hybrid, e.g. a 50:50
blend. Using this distinction between PIT and TTC, the PDs are bucketed
into both PIT Default Grades (DGs) and TTC bands, adopting techniques
that are relevant to the model’ s initial output calibration, the industry and
location of the counterparty and an understanding of the current and
long-term credit conditions. Two grades are therefore recorded for each
client, the DG and the TTC band. A customer may therefore be rated DG 6
reflecting sectoral performance and TTC band 8 reflecting long-term
credit conditions.
This same PIT /TTC distinction is applied to agency ratings. Within
Barclays, an agency alphabet rating is also expressed in terms of PIT DG
and TTC band. It is therefore no longer possible to produce a static
mapping of agency letter ratings to either DGs or TTC bands because they
are considered a hybrid of both PIT and TTC. As such, any mappings would
change over time with movements in the credit cycle.
Barclays internal rating system also differentiates between corporate and 
retail customers. 
For corporate portfolios (primarily Barclays Capital, BCB and the
commercial areas of IRCB), the rating system is constructed to ensure 
that each client receives the same rating independent of the part of the
business with which they are dealing. To achieve this, a model hierarchy is
adopted which requires users to adopt a specific approach to rating each
counterparty depending upon the nature of the business and its location.
A range of methods is approved for estimating counterparty PDs. These
include bespoke grading models developed within the Barclays Group
(Internal Models), vendor models such as MKMV Credit Edge and RiskCalc,
and a conversion of external alphabet ratings from either S&P , Moody’ s 
or Fitch.  Risk management
Credit risk management
92 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
A key element of the Barclays framework is the Masterscale. This has 
been developed to record differences in the probability of default risk 
at meaningful levels throughout the risk range (see table below).
In contrast to corporate businesses, retail areas do not bucket exposures
into generic grades or bands for account management purposes
(although they may be used for reporting purposes). Instead, accounts are
managed based on internal, product specific segmentations of accounts,
for instance, deriving from the cut-offs of the associated models. The 
cut-offs may be in the form of a score, a probability of default, a measure 
of forecast loss or a more sophisticated risk/reward based measure.
Exposure at default (EAD) represents the expected level of usage of the
credit facility when default occurs. At default the customer may not have
drawn the loan fully or may already have repaid some of the principal, so
that exposure is typically less than the approved loan limit. When the
Group evaluates loans, it takes exposure at default into consideration,
using its extensive historical experience. It recognises that customers may
make heavier than average usage of their facilities as they approach default.
For derivative instruments, exposure in the event of default is the
estimated cost of replacing contracts with a positive value should
counterparties fail to perform their obligations. 
When a customer defaults, some part of the amount outstanding on their
loans is usually recovered. The part that is not recovered, the actual loss,
together with the economic costs associated with the recovery process
combine to a figure called the loss given default (LGD), which is expressed
as a percentage of EAD. 
Using historical information, the Group can estimate how much is likely to
be lost, on average, for various types of loans. To illustrate, LGD is lower for
residential mortgages than for unsecured loans because of the property
pledged as collateral. 
The level of LGD depends on: the type of collateral (if any); the seniority 
or subordination of the exposure; the industry in which the customer
operates (if a business); and the jurisdiction applicable and work-out
expenses. The outcome is also dependent on economic conditions that
may determine, for example, the prices that can be realised for assets,
whether a businesses can readily be refinanced or the availability of a
repayment source for personal customers.

The ratings process 
The term ‘internal ratings’ usually refers to internally calculated estimates
of PD. These ratings are combined with EAD and LGD in the range of
applications described previously. The ‘ratings process’ refers to the use 
of PD, EAD and LGD across the Group. In Barclays, the rating process is
defined by each business. For central government and banks, institutions
and corporate customers many of the models used in the rating process
are shared across businesses as the models are customer specific. For
retail exposures, the ratings models are usually unique to the business 
and product type e.g. mortgages, credit cards, and consumer loans.
A bespoke model has been built for PD and LGD for Sovereign ratings. 
For Sovereigns where there is no externally available rating we use an
internally developed PD scorecard. The scorecard has been developed
using historic data on Sovereigns from an external data provider covering 
a wide range of qualitative and quantitative information. Our LGD model 
is based on resolved recoveries in the public domain, with a significant
element of conservatism added to compensate for the small sample size.
To construct ratings for institutions, corporates, specialised lending and
purchased corporate receivables and equity exposures, we use external
models, rating agencies and internally constructed models. External
models employed include Moody’ s Credit Edge, rating agency ratings 
and Moody’ s RiskCalc. The applicability of each of these approaches to 
our customers has been validated by us to internal rating standards. 
The data used in validating these primary indicators are representative 
of the population of the bank’ s actual obligors and exposures and its 
long-term experience. 
Internally built PD models are also widely used. We employ a range of
methods in the construction of these models. The basic types of PD
modelling approaches used are:
– Structural models
– Expert lender
– Statistical 
Structural models incorporate in their specification the elements of the
industry accepted Merton framework to identify the distance to default 
for a counterparty. This relies upon the modeller having access to specific
time series data or data proxies for the portfolio. Data samples used to
build and validate these models are typically constructed by adding
together data sets from internal default observations with externally
obtained data sets from commercial providers such as rating agencies 
and industry gathering consortia. 1
Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 93
Expert lender models are used for parts of the portfolio where the 
risk drivers are specific to a particular counterparty , but where there 
is insufficient data to support the construction of a statistical model. 
These models utilise the knowledge of credit experts that have in depth
experience of the specific customer type being modelled. Where possible,
the characteristics identified by the expert lenders for use in these models
are linked during the modelling process to the Merton framework. This
linkage ensures that the model is intuitive and that there is some economic
rationale for the default process that is being captured by the model.
For any of the portfolios where we have a low number of default
observations we adopt specific rules to ensure that the calibration of 
the model meets the Basel II and FSA criteria for conservatism. We have
developed our own internal policy which describes specific criteria for 
the use of parametric (e.g. Pluto Tasche) and non-parametric low default
portfolio calibration techniques.
Statistical models such as behavioural and application scorecards are 
used for our high volume portfolios such as SME. The model builds
typically incorporate the use of large amounts of internal data, combined
with supplemental data from external data suppliers. Where external data
is sourced to validate or enhance internally-held data as part of the risk
assessment process or to support model development and BAU operation,
a similar approach is adopted towards ensuring data quality to that
applied to the management of internal data. This entails adherence to the
Group’ s procurement and supplier management process, including the
agreement of specifications and service level agreements. 
Typically, modellers do not manipulate external data before using it as
input to the model estimation or validation procedure. Changes required
in the estimation and validation process are documented in the model
build papers.
For all the above asset classes we use the Basel II definition of default,
utilising the 90 day past due criteria as the final trigger of default. 
Our retail banking operations have long and extensive experience of using
credit models in assessing and managing risk in their businesses and as a
result models play an integral role in retail approval and customer
management (e.g. limit setting, cross-sell etc.) processes. 
Models used include application and behavioural scorecards and/or
PD/LGD and EAD models. These may be used in isolation, in combination
to produce measures of forecast loss or as part of a suite of models that
underpin risk/reward based decisions. The score cut-offs will be set at the
appropriate level depending on the specific objective, such as ensuring all
the accepted accounts meet the minimum required return on EC. It is
Barclays philosophy to embed the Basel models as extensively as possible
in the portfolio management process. This is an ongoing initiative and we
expect greater convergence over time. 
In line with Basel II requirements, Barclays will use all available relevant
data, including data relating to other Barclays accounts and external
agency data. Barclays does not use pooled data.
Most retail models within Barclays are built in-house, although
occasionally external consultants will be contracted to build models on
behalf of the businesses. Whilst most models are statistically derived,
some expert lender models are used, particularly where data limitations
preclude a more sophisticated approach. For mortgage originations
Barclays use a third party scorecard (Omniscore), supported by a series 
of policy rules, to arrive at a lending decision. 
All new models, including third party models, are measured against the
required Group minimum standards as detailed in the Barclays Model 
Risk Policy.
For retail asset classes, Basel II specifies that the definition of default must
include a trigger based on days past due, with the number of days being
between 90 and 180. All Barclays advanced internal ratings-based models
are compliant with this, with the majority using 180 days as the trigger. In
all cases LGD models are specified so that they have a definition of default
aligned to that used in the corresponding PD model.
The control mechanisms for the rating system 
Each of the business risk teams is responsible for the design, oversight and
performance of the individual credit rating models – PD, LGD and EAD –
that comprise the credit rating system for a particular customer within each
asset class. Group-wide standards in each of these areas are set by Group
Risk and are governed through a series of committees with responsibility
for oversight, modelling and credit measurement methodologies.
Through their day-to-day activities, key senior management in Group
Credit Risk, the businesses and the business risk teams have a good
understanding of the operation and design of the rating systems used. 
For example:
– The respective Business Risk Heads or equivalents are responsible for
supplying a robust rating system. 
– The Group Risk Director, Credit Risk Director and Wholesale and Retail
Credit Risk Directors are required to understand the operation and
design of the rating system used to assess and manage credit risk 
in order to carry out their responsibilities effectively. This extends 
to the Business CEOs, Business Risk Directors and the Commercial/
Managing Directors or equivalent.
In addition, Group Model Risk Policy requires that all models be validated
as part of the model build (see page 89). This is an iterative process that is
carried out by the model owner. Additionally, a formal independent review
is carried out after each model is built to check that it is robust, meets all
internal and external standards and is documented appropriately. These
reviews must be documented and conducted by personnel who are
independent of those involved in the model-building process. The results
of the review are required to be signed off by an appropriate authority.
In addition to the independent review, post implementation and annual
reviews take place for each model. These reviews are designed to ensure
compliance with policy requirements such as:
– integration of models into the business process
– compliance with the model risk policy
– continuation of a robust governance process around model data inputs
and use of outputs
Model performance is monitored regularly; frequency of monitoring is
monthly for those models that are applicable to higher volume or volatile
portfolios, and quarterly for lower volume or less volatile portfolios. Model
monitoring can include coverage of the following characteristics: utility,
stability, efficiency, accuracy, portfolio and data.
Model owners set performance ranges and define appropriate actions 
for their models. As part of the regular monitoring, the performance of 
the models is compared with these operational ranges. If breaches occur
the model owner reports these to the approval body appropriate for the
materiality of the model. The model approver is responsible for ensuring
completion of the defined action, which may ultimately be a complete
rebuild of the model. Risk management

Risk tendency
In 2007, Risk T endency increased 4% (£95m) to £2,355m (2006: £2,260m),
significantly less than the 23% growth in the Group’ s loans and advances
balances. This relatively small rise in Risk Tendency reflected, in particular,
the improving risk profile of the UK unsecured loan book. Other factors
influencing Risk Tendency included: methodology changes in Barclaycard,
UK Retail Banking and International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa;
the sale of the Monument portfolio; and a maturing credit risk profile in
the international card portfolios.
UK Retail Banking Risk T endency decreased £30m to £470m (2006: £500m).
This reflected an improvement in the credit risk profile in the UK unsecured
consumer lending portfolios, partially offset by the impact of methodology
changes and asset growth.
Risk Tendency in Barclays Commercial Bank increased £15m to £305m
(2006: £290m). This reflected some growth in loan balances offset by
improvements in the credit risk profile.
Barclaycard Risk Tendency decreased £190m to £945m (2006: £1,135m).
This reflected improvement in the credit risk profile of UK cards, the sale 
of part of the Monument portfolio and methodology changes in UK cards,
partially offset by asset growth in the international portfolios.
Risk Tendency at International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding
Absa increased £145m to £220m (2006: £75m), reflecting an increase 
to the risk profile and balance sheet growth in Emerging Markets and
Western Europe.
In International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa, the increase of
£110m in Risk Tendency to £255m (2006: £145m) included a change to
the methodology following the introduction of Basel compliant, PD, EAD
and LGD models. Excluding this change, Risk Tendency increased £90m,
reflecting a weakening of retail credit conditions in South Africa after a
series of interest rate rises in 2006 and 2007 and balance sheet growth. 
Risk T endency in Barclays Capital increased £45m to £140m (2006: £95m)
primarily due to drawn leveraged loan positions. The drawn liquidity
facilities on ABS CDO Super Senior positions are classified as credit risk
loans and therefore no Risk Tendency is calculated on them.
Since Risk Tendency and impairment allowances are calculated for
different parts of the portfolio, for different purposes and on different
bases, Risk Tendency does not predict loan impairment.
Credit risk mitigation 
The Group uses a wide variety of techniques to reduce credit risk on its
lending. The most basic of these is performing an assessment of the
ability of a borrower to service the proposed level of borrowing without
distress. In addition, the Group commonly obtains security for the funds
advanced, such as in the case of a retail or commercial mortgage, a reverse
repurchase agreement, or a commercial loan with a floating charge over
book debts and inventories. The Group ensures that the collateral held is
sufficiently liquid, legally effective, enforceable and regularly valued.
Various forms of collateral are held and commonly include cash in major
currencies; fixed income products including government bonds; Letters 
of Credit; property, including residential and commercial; and other 
fixed assets. For further discussion concerning credit risk mitigation, 
see credit risk Note 47.
The Group actively manages its credit exposures and when weaknesses 
in exposures are detected – either in individual exposures or in groups of
exposures – action is taken to mitigate the risks. These include steps to
reduce the amounts outstanding (in discussion with the customers,
clients or counterparties if appropriate), the use of credit derivatives and,
sometimes, the sale of the loan assets. (Credit derivatives may also be
traded for profit; details of these activities may be found on page 105 and
Note 14 to the accounts).
The Group also uses various forms of specialised legal agreements to
reduce risk, including netting agreements which permit it to offset 
positive and negative balances with customers in certain circumstances 
to minimise the exposure at default, financial guarantees, and the use 
of covenants in commercial lending agreements. 
Barclays manages the diversification of its portfolio to avoid unwanted
credit risk concentrations. A concentration of credit risk exists when a
number of counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have 
similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic 
or other conditions. 
Credit risk mitigation to address concentrations takes several dimensions.
Maximum exposure guidelines are in place relating to the exposures to
any individual counterparty. These permit higher exposures to highly rated
borrowers than to lower rated borrowers. They also distinguish between
types of counterparty, for example, between sovereign governments,
banks and corporations. Excesses are considered individually at the time 
of credit sanctioning, are reviewed regularly, and are reported to the Risk
Oversight Committee and the Board Risk Committee.

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 95
The Risk Oversight Committee has delegated and apportioned
responsibility for risk management to the Retail and Wholesale Credit Risk
Management Committees.
The Retail Credit Risk Management Committee (RCRMC) oversees
exposures, which comprise unsecured personal lending (including small
businesses), mortgages and credit cards. The RCRMC monitors the risk
profile and performance of the retail portfolios by receipt of key risk
measures and indicators at an individual portfolio level, ensuring mitigating
actions taken to address performance are appropriate and timely. Metrics
reviewed will consider portfolio composition at both an overall stock and
new flow level.
The Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee (WCRMC) oversees
wholesale exposures, comprising lending to businesses, banks and other
financial institutions. The WCRMC monitors exposure by country, industry
sector, individual large exposures and exposures to sub-investment 
grade countries. 
Country concentrations are addressed through the country risk policy,
which specifies Risk Appetite by country and avoids excessive
concentrations of credits in individual countries. Country risk grades are
assigned to all countries where the Group has, or is likely to have, exposure
and are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain appropriate. 
Country grades, which are derived from long-term sovereign foreign
currency ratings, range from 1 (lowest probability of default) to 21
(highest probability of default). A ceiling is applied where a country is
graded 12 or worse so that the counterparty cannot receive a higher risk
grading than the country, unless some form of protection is available 
in the event of a cross-border event, such as a significant portion of a
counterparty’ s assets or income being held or generated in hard currency. 
To manage exposure to country risk, the Group uses two country limits:
the Prudential Guideline and the Country Guideline. The Prudential
Guideline is identified through the strict mapping of a country grade to
derive a model-driven acceptable level of loss given default. The Country
Guideline for all graded countries is set by the Group Credit Committee
(GCC) based on the Prudential Guideline and the internal appetite for
country risk. The Country Guideline may therefore be above or below 
the Prudential Guideline. 
Country risk is managed through the application of Country Loss Given
Default (CLGD). All cross-border or domestic foreign currency transactions
incur CLGD from the Country Guideline agreed at GCC. The level of CLGD
incurred by a counterparty transaction will largely depend on three main
factors: the country severity, the product severity and counterparty grade. 
CLGD is incurred in the country of direct risk, defined as where the
majority of operating assets are held. This may differ from the country 
of incorporation. However, where transactions are secured with collateral,
the country risk can be transferred from the country of the borrower to 
the country of the collateral provider. This is only permitted where the
collateral covers the borrowing and is not expected to decrease over time. 
Country Managers are in place for all countries where the Group has
exposure and they, under the direction of GCC, have responsibility for
allocating country risk to individual transactions. The total allocation of
country limits is monitored on a daily basis by Group Credit Risk, as headed
by the Group Credit Risk Director. Discretions exist to increase the Country
Guideline above the level agreed by GCC where the Country Guideline is
below the Prudential Guideline. All requests to increase the Country
Guideline in line with individual discretions must be submitted to and
applied centrally through Group Credit Risk. 
A further mitigant against undesirable concentration of risk is the
mandate and scale framework described on page 86. Mandate and scale
limits, which can also be set at Group level to reflect overall Risk Appetite,
can relate either to the stock of current exposures in the relevant portfolio
or to the flow of new exposures into that portfolio. Typical limits include
the caps on UK commercial investment property lending, the proportion 
of lending with maturity in excess of seven years and the proportion of
new mortgage business that is buy-to-let. 
Concentrations of credit exposure described in this credit risk management
section and the following statistical section are not proportionally related
to credit loss. Some segments of the Group’ s portfolio have and are expected
to have proportionally higher credit charges in relation to the exposure
than others. Moreover, the volatility of credit loss is different in different
parts of the portfolio. Thus, comparatively large credit impairment charges
could arise in parts of the portfolio not mentioned here.
Securitisations
In the course of its business, Barclays undertakes securitisations of its 
own originated assets as well as the securitisation of third party assets 
via sponsored conduit vehicles and shelf programmes.
Barclays securitises its own originated assets in order to remove risk from
the Group’ s credit position, to obtain regulatory capital relief, and to obtain
term liquidity for the Group balance sheet.
For these transactions Barclays adopts the following roles in the
securitisation process:
– Originator of securitised assets
– Executor of securitisation trades including bond marketing and
syndication 
– Provider of securitisation trade servicing, including data management,
investor payments and reporting
Barclays also acts as an administrator and manager of multi-seller conduits
through which interests in third-party-originated assets are securitised
and funded via the issuance of asset backed commercial paper. 
In relation to such conduit activity, Barclays may also provide all or a
portion of the backstop liquidity to the commercial paper, programme-
wide credit enhancement and, as appropriate, interest rate and foreign
currency hedging facilities.
RWAs reported for securitised assets as at December 2007 are calculated
in line with rules set out in IPRU (BANK) as well as any individual guidance
received from the FSA as at the end of this period.
As of 1st January 2008, Barclays calculates securitisation RWAs using 
the ratings based approach and/or the supervisory formula method as 
per the FSA ’ s revised rules, which implement the Basel Accord and Capital
Requirements Directive. 
Further information about securitisation activities and accounting
treatment is in Note 29. The Group’ s accounting policies, including 
those relevant to securitisation activities (policies 4 and 10), are on 
pages 165 and 168.
Barclays employs External Credit Assessment Institutions to provide
ratings for its asset backed securities. Their use is dependant on the
transaction or asset class involved. For existing transactions, we employ
Standard & Poor’ s, Moody’ s and Fitch for securitisations of corporate,
residential mortgage and other retail exposures and Standard & Poor’ s 
and Moody’ s only for securitisations of small and medium-sized entity 
and revolving retail exposures. Risk management

Monitoring of loans and advances
As the granting of credit is one of the Group’ s major sources of income 
and its most significant risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources
to gaining a clear and accurate understanding of credit risk across the
business and ensuring that its balance sheet correctly reflects the value 
of the assets in accordance with accounting principles. This process can
be broken down into the following stages:
– Measuring exposures and concentrations
– Monitoring weakness in exposures
– Identifying potential problem loans and credit risk loans 
(collectively known as potential credit risk loans or PCRLs)
– Raising allowances for impaired loans
– Writing off assets when the whole or part of a debt is considered
irrecoverable
Measuring exposures and concentrations
Loans and advances to customers provide the principal source of credit
risk to the Group although Barclays can also be exposed to other forms of
credit risk through loans to banks, loan commitments, contingent liabilities
and debt securities; see page 60). The value of outstanding loans and
advances balances, their risk profile, and potential concentrations within
them can therefore have a considerable influence on the level of credit risk
in the Group. 
As at 31st December 2007, outstanding loans and advances to customers
and banks were valued at £389bn (2006: £317bn), of which £349bn
(2006: £286bn) was granted to personal or corporate customers (see
figure 1). Loans and advances were well distributed across the retail and
wholesale portfolios.
Loans and advances were well spread across industry classifications
(figure 2). Excluding Financial Services, Barclays largest sectoral exposures
are to home loans, other personal and business and other services. 
These categories are generally comprised of small loans, have low volatility
of credit risk outcomes, and are intrinsically highly diversified. 
Balances are also diversified across a number of geographical regions
(figure 3, based on location of customers). The majority of Barclays
exposure is to the UK, which includes secured home loans exposure,
followed by the United States, Africa and the rest of the European Union.

Barclays risk is therefore spread across a large number of industries and
customers and in the case of home loans, for example, well secured.
These classifications have been prepared at the level of the borrowing
entity. This means that a loan to the subsidiary of a major corporation is
classified by the industry in which the subsidiary operates, even through
the parent’ s predominant sphere of activity may be in a different industry.
UK exposure to home loans accounts for just over 60 per cent of the
Group’ s total home loans exposure. The loan-to-value ratios (LTV) on 
the Group’ s UK home loan portfolio are shown in figure 4. The valuations 
in the chart are those which applied at the last credit decision on each
loan, i.e. when the customer last requested an increase in the limit or, 
if there has been no increase, at inception of the loan. Business flows 
(new business versus loans redeemed) have not materially changed 
the risk profile of the portfolio. 
The impact of house price inflation will result in a reduction in LTV ratios
within the mortgage book on a current valuation basis. On this basis, LTV
on the residential mortgage book averaged 33% at the end of 2007
(2006: 34%). This ratio is a point-in-time analysis of the stock with LTV
updated to current house prices by reference to an external price index
and as a result may be influenced by external market conditions as well 
as changes in the stock of loans.
Barclays also actively monitors the risk profile of its loans and advances 
to customers, with a view to the early detection of any concentrations in
higher risk segments. Figure 5 depicts Barclays wholesale loan profile by
existing risk grade (see page 82 for a description of the rating system). 
The majority of Barclays exposure is to the higher quality names with 
just under 70% of exposure to customers with a DG of 10 or better. It is
important to note that Barclays prices loans to risk. Thus, higher risk loans
will usually have higher interest rates or fees or both. The profitability of a
higher risk portfolio may, therefore, equal or exceed that of a lower-risk
portfolio.
Barclays also actively monitors exposure and concentrations to sub-
investment grade countries (see country risk policy, page 81). Details 
of the 15 largest sub-investment grade countries, by limit, are shown 
in figure 6.
Contractual maturity represents a further area of potential concentration.
The analysis shown in figure 7 indicates that just over 40% of loans to
customers have a maturity of more than five years; the majority of this
segment comprises secured home loans.

Monitoring weaknesses in exposures
Barclays actively manages its credit exposures. Corporate accounts that
are deemed to contain heightened levels of risk are recorded on graded
early warning or watch lists comprising three categories of increasing
concern. These are updated monthly and circulated to the relevant risk
control points. Once listing has taken place, exposure is very carefully
monitored and, where appropriate, exposure reductions are effected.
Should an account become impaired, it will normally, but not necessarily,
have passed through all three categories, which reflect the need for ever-
increasing caution and control.
Where an obligor’ s financial health gives grounds for concern, it is
immediately placed into the appropriate category. All obligors, regardless
of financial health, are subject to a full review of all facilities on, at least, 
an annual basis. More frequent interim reviews may be undertaken 
should circumstances dictate. 
Within Local Business, accounts that are deemed to have a heightened
level of risk, or that exhibit some unsatisfactory features which could affect
viability in the short/medium term, are transferred to a separate ‘Caution’
stream. Accounts on the Caution stream are reviewed on at least a
quarterly basis at which time consideration is given to continuing with 
the agreed strategy, returning the customer to a lower risk refer stream, 
or instigating recovery/exit action.
Within the personal portfolios, which tend to comprise homogeneous
assets, statistical techniques more readily allow potential weaknesses 
to be monitored on a portfolio basis. This applies in parts of UK Retail
Banking, Barclays Wealth, International Retail and Commercial Banking
and Barclaycard. The approach is consistent with the Group’ s policy of
raising a collective impairment allowance as soon as objective evidence 
of impairment is identified. 
Potential credit risk loans
If the credit quality of a loan on an early warning or watch list deteriorates
to the highest category, consideration is given to including it within the
Potential Problem Loan (PPL) list. PPLs are loans where payment of
principal and interest is up to date but where serious doubt exists as to the
ability of the borrowers to continue to comply with repayment terms in the
near future.
Should further evidence of deterioration be observed, a loan may move to
the Credit Risk Loan (CRL) category. Events that would trigger the transfer
of a loan from the PPL to the CRL category could include a missed
payment or a breach of covenant. CRLs comprise three classes of loans:
– ‘Impaired loans’ comprise loans where individual impairment allowance
has been raised and also include loans which are fully collateralised or
where indebtedness has already been written down to the expected
realisable value. The impaired loan category may include loans, which,
while impaired, are still performing.

c From 1st January 2005, the application of IAS 39 required interest to be recognised on
the remaining balance of an impaired financial asset (or group of financial assets) at the
effective interest rate for that asset. As a result, interest is credited to the income
statement in relation to impaired loans, therefore these loans technically are not
classified as ‘non-accrual’. In 2005, the Group replaced the ‘non-accrual’ category with
one termed ‘impaired loans’. The SEC requires loans to be classified, where applicable,
as non-accrual, accruing past due 90 days or more, ‘troubled debt restructurings’ and
potential problem loans.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 99
– The category ‘accruing past due 90 days or more’ comprises loans 
that are 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest where there
is no expectation of ultimate write-off (whether in part or full) of the
principal owed. Impairment allowance will be raised against these loans
if the expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate is
less than the carrying value.
– The category ‘impaired and restructured loans’ comprises loans not
included above where, for economic or legal reasons related to the
debtor’s financial difficulties, a concession has been granted to the
debtor that it would not otherwise be considered. Where the concession
results in the expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest
rate being less than the loan’s carrying value, an impairment allowance
will be raised.
The term Credit Risk Loans has replaced the term Non-Performing Loans
(NPLs) as the collective term for the total of these three classes since it
recognises the fact that the impaired loan category may include loans,
which, while impaired, are still performing. This category includes drawn
ABS CDO Super Senior positions.
Potential Credit Risk Loans (PCRLs) comprise potential problem loans
(PPLs) and credit risk loans (CRLs). Figures 8 and 9 show CRL and PPL
balances by geography. The amounts are shown before deduction of 
value of security held, impairment allowances (from 2005 onwards) 
and provisions or interest suspense (2004 and earlier), all of which might
reduce the impact of an eventual loss, should it occur. The significant
increase to non-UK CRL and PPL balances is principally due to the
inclusion of US-located ABS CDO Super Senior positions and other 
credit market exposures. 
Figures 12 and 13 show impairment allowances as a percentage of 
CRLs and PCRLs. Including the drawn ABS CDO Super Senior positions,
allowance coverage of CRLs and PCRLs decreased to 39.1% (31st December
2006: 65.6%) and 33.0% (31st December 2006: 57.0%), respectively. 
These movements reflect the fact that allowance coverage of ABS CDO
Super Senior credit risk loans was low relative to allowance coverage of
other credit risk loans since substantial protection against loss is also
provided by subordination and hedges. On ABS CDO Super Senior
exposures, the combination of subordination, hedges and write-downs
provided protection against loss levels to 72% on US sub-prime collateral
as at 31st December 2007.
Figures 14 and 15 show allowance coverage of CRLs and PCRLs 
excluding the drawn ABS CDO Super Senior positions decreased to 55.6%
(31st December 2006: 65.6%) and 49.0% (31st December 2006: 57.0%),
respectively. The decrease in these ratios reflected a change in the mix of
CRLs and PCRLs. Unsecured retail exposures, where the recovery outlook
is low, decreased as a proportion of the total as the collections and
underwriting processes were improved. Secured retail and wholesale 
and corporate exposures, where the recovery outlook is relatively high,
increased as a proportion of PCRLs.

Allowances for impairment and other credit provisions
Barclays establishes, through charges against profit, impairment allowances
and other credit provisions for the incurred loss inherent in the lending book. 
Under IFRS, impairment allowances are recognised where there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more loss events
that have occurred after initial recognition, and where these events have
had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset 
or portfolio of financial assets. Impairment of loans and receivables is
measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the present
value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’ s
original effective interest rate. If the carrying amount is less than the
discounted cash flows, then no further allowance is necessary. 
Impairment is measured individually for assets that are individually
significant, and collectively where a portfolio comprises homogenous
assets and where appropriate statistical techniques are available. 
In terms of individual assessment, the trigger point for impairment is
formal classification of an account as exhibiting serious financial problems
and where any further deterioration is likely to lead to failure. Two key
inputs to the cash flow calculation are the valuation of all security and
collateral and the timing of all asset realisations, after allowing for all
attendant costs. This method applies in the corporate portfolios – Barclays
Commercial Bank, Barclays Capital and certain areas within International
Retail and Commercial Banking and Barclaycard. 
For collective assessment, the trigger point for impairment is the missing
of a contractual payment. The impairment calculation is based on a roll-
rate approach, where the percentage of assets that move from the initial
delinquency to default are derived from statistical probabilities based on
experience. Recovery amounts and contractual interest rates are
calculated using a weighted average for the relevant portfolio. This
method applies to parts of International Retail and Commercial Banking,
Barclaycard and UK Banking and is consistent with Barclays policy of
raising an allowance as soon as impairment is identified.
Unidentified impairment allowances, albeit significantly lower in 
amount than those reported above, are also raised to cover losses which
are judged to be incurred but not yet specifically identified in customer
exposures at the balance sheet date, and which, therefore, have not been
specifically reported. 
The incurred but not yet reported calculation is based on the asset’ s
probability of moving from the performing portfolio to being specifically
identified as impaired within the given emergence period and then on to
default within a specified period. This is calculated on the present value 
of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’ s original
effective interest rate. 
The emergence periods vary across businesses and are based on actual
experience and are reviewed on an annual basis. This methodology ensures
that the Group only captures the loss incurred at the balance sheet date. 
These impairment allowances are reviewed and adjusted at least quarterly
by an appropriate charge or release of the stock of impairment allowances
based on statistical analysis and management judgement. 
Where appropriate, the accuracy of this analysis is periodically assessed
against actual losses.
As one of the controls of ensuring that adequate impairment allowances
are held, movements in impairment allowances to individual names above
£10m are presented to the Group Credit Committee for agreement.
The Group Credit Risk Impairment Committee (GCRIC), on a semi-annual
basis, obtains assurance on behalf of the Group that all businesses are
recognising impairment in their portfolios accurately and promptly in their
recommendations and in accordance with policy, accounting standards
and established governance.
GCRIC exercises the authority of the Barclays Risk Director, as delegated 
by the Chief Executive, and is chaired by Barclays Credit Risk Director.
GCRIC reviews the movements to impairment in the businesses, including
those already agreed at Group Credit Committee, Potential Credit Risk
Loans and Risk Tendency.
These committees are supported by a number of Group Policies including:
Group Retail Impairment and Provisioning Policy; Group Wholesale
Impairment and Provisioning Policy; and, Group Model Policy.
GCRIC makes twice-yearly recommendations to the Board Audit
Committee on the adequacy of Group impairment allowances.
Impairment allowances are reviewed relative to the risk in the portfolio,
business and economic trends, current policies and methodologies and
our position against peer banks.

Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 101
GCRIC has delegated the detailed review of loan impairment in the
businesses to the Retail and Wholesale Credit Risk Management
Committees.
In 2007, total impairment charges on loans and advances and other 
credit provisions increased 30% (£641m) to £2,795m (2006: £2,154m)
reflecting charges of £782m against ABS CDO Super Senior and other
credit market positions.
Impairment charges on loans and advances and other credit provisions 
as a percentage of Group total loans and advances rose to 0.71% 
(2006: 0.65%); total loans and advances grew by 23% to £389,290m
(2006: £316,561m). 
Retail impairment charges on loans and advances fell 11% (£204m) to
£1,605m (2006: £1,809m). Retail impairment charges as a percentage of
period-end total loans and advances reduced to 0.98% (2006: 1.30%); total
retail loans and advances rose by 18% to £164,062m (2006: £139,350m).
Barclaycard impairment charges improved £229m (21%) to £838 (2006:
£1,067m) reflecting reduce flows into delinquency, lower levels of arrears
and lower charge-offs in UK Cards. We made changes to our impairment
methodologies to standardise our approach and in anticipation of Basel II. 
The net positive impact of these changes in methodology was offset by
the increase in impairment charges in Barclaycard International and
secured consumer lending. 
Impairment charges in UK Retail Bank decreased by £76m (12%) to
£559m (2006: £635m), reflecting lower charges in unsecured Consumer
Lending and Local Business driven by improved collection processes,
reduced flows into delinquency, lower trends of arrears and stable charge-
offs. In UK Home Finance, asset quality remained strong and mortgage
charges remained negligible. Mortgage delinquencies as a percentage 
of outstandings remained stable and amounts charged-off were low. 
Impairment charges in International Retail and Commercial Banking –
excluding Absa rose by £38m (93%) to £79m (2006: £41m) reflecting
very strong balance sheet growth in 2006 and 2007 and the impact of
lower releases in 2007. 
Arrears in some of International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa’ s
key retail portfolios deteriorated in 2007, driven by interest rate increases 
in 2006 and 2007 resulting in pressure on collections. 
Wholesale and corporate impairment charges on loans and advances
increased £436m to £701m (2006: £265m). Wholesale and corporate
impairment charges as a percentage of period-end total loans and
advances increased to 0.31% (2006: 0.15%); total loans and advances
grew by 27% to £225,228m (2006: £177,211m). 
Barclays Capital impairment charges and other credit provisions of £846m
included a charge of £782m against ABS CDO Super Senior and other credit
market exposure and £58m relating to drawn leveraged finance positions. 
The impairment charge in Barclays Commercial Bank increased by 
£38m (15%) to £290m (2006: £252m), primarily due to higher gross
impairment charges in Larger Business, partially offset by a lower charge 
in Medium Business due to a tightening of the lending criteria. 
Writing-off of assets 
After an advance has been identified as impaired and is subject to an
impairment allowance, the stage may be reached whereby it is concluded
that there is no realistic prospect of further recovery. Write-off will occur,
when, and to the extent that, the whole or part of a debt is considered
irrecoverable. 
The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of
subjective judgement. Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted by
a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other
formal recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that some or
the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery. In any event,
the position of impaired loans is reviewed at least quarterly to ensure that
irrecoverable advances are being written off in a prompt and orderly
manner and in compliance with any local regulations. 
Such assets are only written off once all the necessary procedures have
been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are written back
and hence decrease the amount of the reported loan impairment charge
in the income statement. 
T otal write-offs of impaired financial assets decreased by £211m to £1,963m
(2006: £2,174m).

Market risk management
102 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Market risk management
Market risk is the risk that Barclays earnings or capital, 
or its ability to meet business objectives, will be adversely
affected by changes in the level or volatility of market rates
or prices such as interest rates, credit spreads, commodity
prices, equity prices and foreign exchange rates. The main
market risk arises from trading activities. Barclays is also
exposed to interest rate risk in the banking book and the
pension fund.
Barclays market risk objectives are to:
– Understand and control market risk by robust
measurement and the setting of position limits.
– Facilitate business growth within a controlled 
and transparent risk management framework.
– Ensure traded market risk resides primarily 
in Barclays Capital.
– Minimise non-traded market risk.
Organisation and structure
The Board approves market risk appetite for trading and non-trading
activities. The Market Risk Director is responsible for the market risk
control framework and, under delegated authority from the Risk Director,
sets a limit framework within the context of the approved market risk
appetite. A daily market risk report summarises Barclays market risk
exposures against agreed limits. This daily report is sent to the Risk
Director, the Market Risk Director, the Finance Director and the 
appropriate Business Risk Directors.
The Head of each business, assisted by the business risk management
team, is accountable for all market risks associated with its activities. Each
business is responsible for the identification, measurement, management,
control and reporting of market risk as outlined in the Barclays Market Risk
Control Framework. Oversight and support is provided to the business by
the Market Risk Director, assisted by the central market risk team. The
Market Risk Committee reviews, approves, and makes recommendations
concerning the market risk profile across Barclays including risk appetite,
limits and utilisation. The Committee is held monthly and is chaired by 
the Market Risk Director. Attendees include the Risk Director, respective
business risk managers and senior managers from the central market 
risk team. 
In Barclays Capital, the Head of Market Risk is responsible for
implementing the market risk control framework. Day to day responsibility
for market risk lies with the senior management of Barclays Capital,
supported by the Market Risk Management team that operates
independently of the trading areas. Daily market risk reports are produced
for the main Barclays Capital business areas covering the different risk
categories including interest rate, credit spread, commodity, equity and
foreign exchange. A more detailed trading market risk presentation is
produced fortnightly and discussed at the Barclays Capital Traded
Products Risk Review meeting. The attendees at this meeting include
senior managers from Barclays Capital and the central market risk team.
Outside Barclays Capital, Global Retail and Commercial Banking is
responsible for the non-structural interest rate risk in the banking book
and Group Treasury is responsible for structural risk (interest rate and FX).
The chart below right gives an overview of the business control structure. 1
Business review
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 103
Traded market risk 
Barclays policy is to concentrate trading activities in Barclays Capital. This
includes transactions where Barclays Capital acts as principal with clients
or with the market. For maximum efficiency, Barclays manages client and
market activities together. In Barclays Capital, trading risk occurs in both
the trading book and the banking book as defined for regulatory purposes. 
In anticipation of future customer demand, Barclays maintains access to
market liquidity by quoting bid and offer prices with other market makers
and carries an inventory of capital market and treasury instruments,
including a broad range of cash, securities and derivatives. Derivatives
entered into for trading purposes include swaps, forward rate agreements,
futures, credit derivatives, options and combinations of these instruments.
For a description of the nature of derivative instruments, see page 105. 
Traded market risk measurement
The measurement techniques used to measure and control traded market
risk include Daily Value at Risk and Stress Testing. 
Daily Value at Risk (DVaR) is an estimate of the potential loss which might
arise from unfavourable market movements, if the current positions were
to be held unchanged for one business day, measured to a confidence
level of 98%. Daily losses exceeding the DVaR figure are likely to occur, 
on average, twice in every 100 business days.
DVaR uses the historical simulation method with a historic sample of two
years. The credit spread calculation takes into account specific risks
associated with different business names.
There are a number of considerations that should be taken into account
when reviewing DVaR numbers. These are:
– historical simulation assumes that the past is a good representation of
the future which may not always be the case.
– the assumed one day time horizon will not fully capture the market risk
of positions that cannot be closed out or hedged within one day.
– DVaR does not indicate the potential loss beyond the 98th percentile.
To complement DVaR, stress testing is performed and there is a large set
of non-DVaR limits including foreign exchange concentration limits and
interest rate delta limits. 
DVaR is an important market risk measurement and control tool and
consequently the model is regularly assessed. The main approach employed
is the technique known as back-testing which counts the number of days
when trading losses exceed the corresponding DVaR estimate. 
On the basis of DVaR estimated to a 98% confidence level, on average
there would be five days each year when trading losses would be expected
to exceed DVaR and would therefore be reflected as back-testing exceptions.
For Barclays Capital’ s trading book, there were seven instances of a daily
trading loss exceeding the corresponding 98% back-testing DVaR. 
These back-testing exceptions in 2007 reflected the increased volatility
across a number of markets in which Barclays Capital operates. There 
were no instances of back-testing exceptions on a similar basis in 2006.
Stress testing provides an indication of the potential size of losses that
could arise in extreme conditions. The three main types of stress test are:
– risk factor: historical stress moves are applied to each of the risk
categories which include interest rate, credit spread, commodity, 
equity and foreign exchange rate
– emerging market contagion: historical stress moves combined with
contagion factors are applied to the emerging markets portfolio
– scenario: stress scenarios are applied to the trading book
Stress results are produced at least fortnightly and are included in the
Traded Products Risk Review meeting information pack. If a potential
stress loss exceeds the corresponding trigger limit, the positions captured
by the stress test are reviewed and discussed by Barclays Capital market
risk and the respective Barclays Capital Business Head(s). The minutes of
the discussion, including the merits of the position and the appropriate
course of action, are then sent to the Market Risk Director for review.

104 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Analysis of traded market risk exposures
The analysis of traded market risk exposures is given in Note 46.
Analysis of trading revenue
The histograms show the distribution of daily trading revenue for Barclays
Capital in 2007 and 2006. Revenue includes net trading income, net
interest income and net fees and commissions relating to primary trading.
The average daily revenue in 2007 was £26.2m (2006: £22.0m) and 
there were 224 positive revenue days out of 253 (2006: 243 out of 252). 
The number of negative revenue days increased in 2007 largely as a result 
of volatile markets in the second half of the year. The number of large
positive revenue days also increased but these were spread across the year.
Interest rate risk in the banking book
Interest rate risk arises from the provision of retail and wholesale 
(non-traded) banking products and services, as well as structural 
exposures within Barclays balance sheet. 
The management approach of Barclays with respect to interest rate risk 
is to transfer the risk from the businesses either into local treasuries or to
Group Treasury using an internal transfer price or interest rate swap. The
methodology used to transfer this risk depends on whether the product
contains yield curve risk, basis risk or customer optionality. Limits exist to
ensure no material risk is retained within any business or product area. 
Once each business’ s risk has been transferred, the treasuries manage
any residual yield curve and basis risks subject to modest risk limits and
other controls. Market risk is also taken in overseas treasuries, within 
these limits, to support and facilitate customer activity.
Risk measurement
The techniques used to measure and control interest rate risk in the
banking book include Annual Earnings at Risk, Daily Value at Risk and
Stress Testing.
Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR) measures the sensitivity of net interest
income (NII) over the next 12 months. It is calculated as the difference
between the estimated income using the current yield curve and the
lowest estimated income following a 50 basis points increase or decrease
in interest rates.
Outside Barclays Capital, Barclays uses a simplified approach to calculate
DVaR. It is used as a complementary tool to AEaR. Both AEaR and DVaR are
supplemented by stress testing and a range of non-DVaR limits.
Stress testing is carried out by the business centres and is reviewed by senior
management and business-level asset and liability committees. The stress
testing is tailored to the business and typically incorporates scenario
analysis and historical stress movements applied to respective portfolios.
Analysis of interest rate risk in the banking book exposures
The analysis of interest rate risk in the banking book is given in Note 46. 
Other market risks
Barclays maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes for 
past and current employees. The ability of the Pension Fund to meet the
projected pension payments is maintained through investments and
regular Bank contributions. Pension risk arises because: the estimated
market value of the pension fund assets might decline; or their investment
returns might reduce; or the estimated value of the pension liabilities
might increase. In these circumstances, Barclays could be required or
might choose to make extra contributions to the pension fund. Financial
details of the pension fund are in Note 30.
Investment risk is the risk of financial volatility arising from changes in the
market value of investments, principally occurring in Barclays insurance
companies. These investments may comprise various liquid instruments,
such as cash, bonds and listed equities, to cover future insurance liability
flows, and may therefore give rise to a mismatch between the revaluation
of assets and liabilities. It is Barclays policy to hedge such exposures in line
with a defined risk appetite.
Barclays policy is for foreign exchange trading risk to be concentrated 
and managed in Barclays Capital. Some transaction foreign exchange 
risk exposure arises within the local treasury operations in Global Retail 
and Commercial Banking to support and facilitate client activity. This is
minimised in accordance with modest risk limits and was not material 
as at end 2007. Other non-Barclays Capital foreign exchange exposure 
is covered in Note 46.
Asset management structural market risk arises where the fee and
commission income earned by asset management products and
businesses is affected by a change in market levels, primarily through 
the link between income and the value of assets under management.
Where support agreements exist, the Group is exposed to the
performance of the underlying asset. This exposure arises mainly within
Barclays Global Investors, but also in Global Retail and Commercial
Banking, and Barclays Wealth. It is Barclays policy that businesses monitor
and report this risk against a defined risk appetite and regularly assess
potential hedging strategies.

Derivatives
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 105
Derivatives
The use of derivatives and their sale to customers as risk management
products are an integral part of the Group’ s trading activities. These
instruments are also used to manage the Group’ s own exposure to
fluctuations in interest, exchange rates and commodity and equity 
prices as part of its asset and liability management activities. 
Barclays Capital manages the trading derivatives book as part of the
market risk book. This includes foreign exchange, interest rate, equity,
commodity and credit derivatives. The policies regarding market risk
management are outlined in the market risk management section on
pages 102 to 104.
The policies for derivatives that are used to manage the Group’ s own
exposure to interest and exchange rate fluctuations are outlined in the
asset and liability market risk section on page 239.
Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or
more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract.
They include swaps, forward rate agreements, futures, options and
combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Group’ s net
interest income, net trading income, net fee and commission income and
derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the contracts are not
recorded on the balance sheet.
The Group participates both in exchange traded and over the counter
derivatives markets.
Exchange traded derivatives
The Group buys and sells financial instruments that are traded or cleared
on an exchange, including interest rate swaps, futures and options on
futures. Holders of exchange traded instruments provide margin daily
with cash or other security at the exchange, to which the holders look 
for ultimate settlement.
Over the counter traded derivatives
The Group also buys and sells financial instruments that are traded over
the counter, rather than on a recognised exchange. 
These instruments range from commoditised transactions in 
derivative markets, to trades where the specific terms are tailored to 
the requirements of the Group’ s customers. In many cases, industry
standard documentation is used, most commonly in the form of a master
agreement, with individual transaction confirmations. The existence 
of a signed master agreement is intended to give the Group protection 
in situations where a counterparty is in default.
Foreign exchange derivatives
The Group’ s principal exchange rate related contracts are forward foreign
exchange contracts, currency swaps and currency options. Forward
foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specified
quantity of foreign currency, usually on a specified future date at an 
agreed rate. A currency swap generally involves the exchange, or notional
exchange, of equivalent amounts of two currencies and a commitment 
to exchange interest periodically until the principal amounts are 
re-exchanged on a future date.
Currency options provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation,
either to purchase or sell a fixed amount of a currency at a specified
exchange rate on or before a future date. As compensation for assuming
the option risk, the option writer generally receives a premium at the start
of the option period.
Interest rate derivatives
The Group’ s principal interest rate related contracts are interest rate 
swaps, forward rate agreements, basis swaps, caps, floors and swaptions.
Included in this product category are transactions that include
combinations of these features.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange
fixed rate and floating rate interest by means of periodic payments based
upon a notional principal amount and the interest rates defined in the
contract. Certain agreements combine interest rate and foreign currency
swap transactions, which may or may not include the exchange of
principal amounts. A basis swap is a form of interest rate swap, in which
both parties exchange interest payments based on floating rates, where
the floating rates are based upon different underlying reference indices. 
In a forward rate agreement, two parties agree a future settlement of the
difference between an agreed rate and a future interest rate, applied to a
notional principal amount. The settlement, which generally occurs at the
start of the contract period, is the discounted present value of the
payment that would otherwise be made at the end of that period.
Credit derivatives
The Group’ s principal credit derivative-related contracts include 
credit default swaps and total return swaps. A credit derivative is an
arrangement whereby the credit risk of an asset (the reference asset) 
is transferred from the buyer to the seller of protection. 
A credit default swap is a contract where the protection seller receives
premium or interest-related payments in return for contracting to make
payments to the protection buyer upon a defined credit event. Credit
events normally include bankruptcy, payment default on a reference 
asset or assets, or downgrades by a rating agency.
A total return swap is an instrument whereby the seller of protection
receives the full return of the asset, including both the income and change
in the capital value of the asset. The buyer in return receives a
predetermined amount.
Equity derivatives
The Group’ s principal equity-related contracts are equity and stock index
swaps and options (including warrants, which are equity options listed 
on an exchange). An equity swap is an agreement between two parties 
to exchange periodic payments, based upon a notional principal amount,
with one side paying fixed or floating interest and the other side paying
based on the actual return of the stock or stock index. An equity option
provides the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, either to
purchase or sell a specified stock, basket of stocks or stock index 
at a specified price or level on or before a specified date.
Commodity derivatives
The Group’ s principal commodity-related derivative contracts are swaps,
options, forwards and futures. The main commodities transacted are base
metals, precious metals, oil and oil-related products, power and natural gas. Risk management

The Group provides a fully integrated service to clients for base metals,
precious metals, oil, power, natural gas, coal, freight, emission credits,
structured products and other related commodities. This service offering
continues to expand, as market conditions allow, through the addition of
new products and markets.
The Group offers both over the counter (OTC) and exchange traded
derivatives, including swaps, options, forwards and futures and enters 
into physically settled contracts in base metals, power and natural gas,
with 2007 seeing the addition of oil and related products to this portfolio.
Physical commodity positions are held at fair value and reported under 
the Trading Portfolio in Note 12.
Fair value measurement
The fair values of physical and derivative positions are primarily determined
through a combination of recognised market observable prices, exchange
prices, and established inter-commodity relationships. Further information
on fair value measurement of financial instruments can be found in Note 49.

Risk management
Liquidity management
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 107
Liquidity management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet 
its obligations when they fall due and to replace funds
when they are withdrawn, with consequent failure to repay
depositors and fulfil commitments to lend. The risk that it
will be unable to do so is inherent in all banking operations
and can be impacted by a range of institution specific and
market-wide events including, but not limited to, credit
events, merger and acquisition activity, systemic shocks
and natural disasters.
Liquidity risk management and measurement
Liquidity management within the Group has several components.
Intraday liquidity
The need to monitor, manage and control intraday liquidity in real time is
recognised by the Group as a mission critical process: any failure to meet
specific intraday commitments would have significant consequences.
The Group policy is that each operation must ensure that it has access to
sufficient intraday liquidity to meet any obligations it may have to clearing
and settlement systems. Major currency payment flows and payment
system collateral are monitored and managed in real time to ensure that 
at all times there is sufficient collateral to make payments. The Group
actively engages in payment system development to help ensure that 
new payment systems are robust.
Day to day funding
Day to day funding, managed by short term mismatch limits for the next
day, week and month which control expected cash flows to ensure that
requirements can be met. These requirements include replenishment of
funds as they mature or are borrowed by customers. The Group maintains
an active presence in global money markets and monitors and manages
the wholesale money market capacity for the Group’ s name to enable that
to happen. 
In addition to cash flow management, Treasury also monitors unmatched
medium-term assets and the level and type of undrawn lending
commitments, the usage of overdraft facilities and the impact of contingent
liabilities such as standby letters of credit and guarantees.
Liquid assets
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable assets including 
UK, US and Euro-area government bonds that can be sold or funded on 
a secured basis as protection against any unforeseen interruption to cash
flow. The Group accesses secured funding markets in these assets on 
a regular basis to ensure market access. The Group does not rely on
committed funding lines for protection against unforeseen interruption 
to cash flow. 
Diversification of liquidity sources
Sources of liquidity are regularly reviewed to maintain a wide diversification
by currency, geography, provider, product and term. In addition, to avoid
reliance on a particular group of customers or market sectors, the
distribution of sources and the maturity profile of deposits are also
carefully managed. Important factors in assuring liquidity are competitive
rates and the maintenance of depositors’ confidence. Such confidence 
is based on a number of factors including the Group’ s reputation and
relationship with those clients, the strength of earnings and the Group’ s
financial position.  Risk management
Liquidity management
108 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Structural liquidity
An important source of structural liquidity is provided by our core retail
deposits in the UK, Europe and Africa, mainly current accounts and
savings accounts. Although current accounts are repayable on demand
and savings accounts at short notice, the Group’ s broad base of customers
– numerically and by depositor type – helps to protect against unexpected
fluctuations. Such accounts form a stable funding base for the Group’ s
operations and liquidity needs.
The Group policy is to fund the balance sheet of the retail and commercial
bank on a global basis with customer deposits without recourse to the
wholesale markets. This provides protection from the liquidity risk of
wholesale market funding. The exception to this policy is Absa, which has
a large portion of wholesale funding due to the structural nature of the
South African financial sector.
Stress tests 
Stress testing is undertaken to assess and plan for the impact of various
scenarios which may put the Group’ s liquidity at risk.
Treasury develops and monitors a range of stress tests on the Group’ s
projected cash flows. These stress scenarios include Barclays-specific
scenarios such an unexpected rating downgrade and operational problems,
and external scenarios such as Emerging Market crises, payment system
disruption and macro-economic shocks. The output informs both the
liquidity mismatch limits and the Group’ s contingency funding plan. 
This is maintained by Treasury and is aligned with the Group and country
business resumption plans to encompass decision-making authorities,
internal and external communication and, in the event of a systems failure,
the restoration of liquidity management and payment systems.
The ability to raise funds is in part dependent on maintaining the Bank’ s
credit rating. The funding impact of a credit downgrade is regularly
estimated. Whilst the impact of a single downgrade may affect the price 
at which funding is available, the effect on liquidity is not considered
material in Group terms.
For further details see contractual obligations and commercial commitments
of the Group on page 60.
Recent market events
The second half of last year saw a sustained period of severe stress in
international financial markets characterised by increased volatility and
impaired liquidity. Issuance of debt, particularly structured credit and
mortgage related, fell sharply. The asset-backed commercial paper market
was severely disrupted, resulting in the drawn down of committed liquidity
lines from banks, while primary issuance of mortgage-backed securities
and covered bonds stopped for a time. The repo markets including tri-party
were also disrupted with the repo market for corporate debt closing for a
time. Term money market funding became difficult to obtain and spreads
over official rates widened. 
The Group maintained its strong liquidity profile throughout and saw
some benefit from a flight to quality in financial markets. Nevertheless,
Barclays, like its peers, was affected by the increased volatility and impaired
liquidity in financial markets. During this period the Group’ s balance sheet
expanded due to: 
– The disruption of the Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) market
led to liquidity facilities for third party conduits being drawn down. 
– Liquidity facilities were provided to three client SIV-lites which were
restructured during the period. 
– A number of loan syndications were delayed and remained on our
balance sheet. 
– The demand for ABCP issued by Barclays-sponsored conduits
weakened temporarily with the result that a small portion of their
funding was provided by Barclays. 
These liquidity demands were all successfully managed within overall
funding requirements despite occasional disruption of access to some
funding markets. Although term funding in interbank markets substantially
disappeared, liquidity remained good for Barclays.
Barclays diversified portfolio of highly marketable securities enabled the
Group to continue accessing the repo market. Securitisation accounts 
for a modest proportion of the Group’ s funding so the disruption to 
the securitisation market has not significantly impacted the Group’ s
liquidity position. 
Assessment of liquidity
Barclays liquidity position remains very strong both for its own paper 
and paper issued by its sponsored conduits. We have benefited from
significant inflows of deposits, increased credit lines from counterparties,
increased client flows and continued full funding of our conduits. 
The markets in 2008 have substantially improved with the passing of 
the year end, and a degree of normality has returned to the term interbank
markets. However we expect there to continue to be dislocations 
through 2008, and we remain vigilant to ensure that our liquidity profile
remains strong.
The FSA published a discussion paper in December 2007 setting out 
draft proposals for a new quantitative framework for regulating liquidity 
of banks in the UK in the light of the experiences of 2007. We welcome 
the FSA intention to update the liquidity regime.  Risk management
Operational risk management
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 109
Operational risk management
Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect losses
resulting from human factors, external events, and
inadequate or failed internal processes and systems.
Operational risks are inherent in Barclays operations and are
typical of any large enterprise. Major sources of operational
risk include: operational process reliability, IT security,
outsourcing of operations, dependence on key suppliers,
implementation of strategic change, integration of
acquisitions, fraud, human error, customer service quality,
regulatory compliance, recruitment, training and retention
of staff, and social and environmental impacts. 
Barclays is committed to the advanced management 
of operational risks. In particular, it has implemented
improved management and measurement approaches for
operational risk to strengthen control, improve customer
service and minimise operating losses. Barclays was
granted a Waiver to operate an Advanced Measurement
Approach (AMA) under Basel II, which commenced in
January 2008.
The Group’ s operational risk management framework 
aims to:
– Understand and report the operational risks being taken
by the Group.
– Capture and report operational errors made.
– Understand and minimise the frequency and impact, 
on a cost benefit basis, of operational risk events.
Barclays works closely with peer banks to benchmark our internal
Operational Risk practices and to drive the development of advanced
Operational Risk techniques across the industry. It is not cost effective to
attempt to eliminate all operational risks and in any event it would not be
possible to do so. Events of small significance are expected to occur and
are accepted as inevitable; events of material significance are rare and the
Group seeks to reduce the risk from these in a framework consistent with
its agreed Risk Appetite. 
Organisation and structure
Barclays has a Group Operational Risk Framework, which is consistent
with and part of the Group Internal Control and Assurance Framework.
Minimum control requirements have been established for all key areas
of identified risk by ‘Principal Risk’ owners (see page 85). The risk
categories relevant to operational risks are Financial Crime, Financial
Reporting, Taxation, Legal, Operations, People, Regulatory, Technology
and Change. In addition the following risk categories are used for business
risk: Brand Management, Corporate Responsibility and Strategic. 
Responsibility for implementing and overseeing these policies is
positioned throughout the organisation. The prime responsibility for 
the management of operational risk and the compliance with control
requirements rests with the business and functional units where the risk
arises. Frontline risk managers are widely distributed throughout the
Group in business units. They service and support these areas, assisting
line managers in managing these risks.
Business Risk Directors in each business are responsible for overseeing 
the implementation of and compliance with Group policies. Governance
and Control Committees in each business monitor control effectiveness.
The Group Governance and Control Committee receives reports from the
committees in the businesses and considers Group-wide control issues
and their remediation. 
In the corporate centre, each Principal Risk is owned by a senior individual
who liaises with Principal Risk owners within the businesses. In addition,
the Operational Risk Director oversees the range of operational risks across
the Group in accordance with the Group Operational Risk Framework. 
Business units are required to report on both a regular and an event-driven
basis. The reports include a profile of the key risks to their business
objectives, control issues of Group-level significance, and operational risk
events. Specific reports are prepared on a regular basis for the Group Risk
Oversight Committee, the Board Risk Committee and the Board Audit
Committee. In particular, the Group Operational Risk Profile and Group
Operating Committee Report is provided quarterly to the Group Risk
Oversight Committee. The Internal Audit function provides further
assurance for operational risk control across the organisation and 
reports to the Board and senior management. 
Operational risk measurement and capital modelling
Barclays applies a consistent approach to the identification and assessment
of key risks and controls across all business units. Managers in the businesses
use self-assessment techniques to identify risks, evaluate control
effectiveness and monitor capability. Business management determines
whether particular risks are effectively managed within business risk
appetite and otherwise takes remedial action. The risk assessment
process is consistent with the principles in the integrated framework
published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). 
A standard process is used Group-wide for the recognition, capture,
assessment, analysis and reporting of risk events. This process is used 
to help identify where process and control requirements are needed to
reduce the recurrence of risk events. Risk events are loaded onto a central
database and reported monthly to the Operational Risk Executive Committee. 
Barclays also uses a database of external public risk events and is a
member of the Operational Risk Data Exchange (ORX), an association of
international banks that share anonymised loss data information to assist
in risk identification, assessment and modelling. 
By combining internal data, including internal loss experience, risk and
control assessments, key indicators and audit findings, with external loss
data and expert management judgement, Barclays is able to generate Key
Risk Scenarios (KRSs), which identify the most significant operational risks Risk management
Operational risk management
110 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
across the Group. The KRSs are validated at business unit and at Group
level to ensure that they appropriately reflect the level of operational risk. 
It is these that are the main input to our capital model. 
Operational risk capital is allocated, on a risk sensitive basis, to business
units in the form of economic capital charges, providing an incentive to
manage these risks within appetite levels.
Operational Risk Events
A high proportion of Barclays operational risk events have a low financial
cost associated with them and a very small proportion of operational risk
events have a material impact. Figure 1 shows that in 2007, 79% of
reported operational loss events had a value of £50,000 or less. Figure 2
shows that this 79% of risk events by count only amounted to 15% of risk
events by value. In contrast, 2% of the operational risk events had a value
of £1m or greater but accounted for 50% of the overall loss. This was
consistent with 2006 risk events and, from our analysis of external data, 
is in line with industry experience.
Analysis of Barclays operational risk events in 2007 by Basel II category, as
shown in figure 3, highlights that the highest frequency of events occurred
in External Fraud (54%) and Execution, Delivery and Process Management
(37%). These two areas also accounted for the majority of losses by value
(figure 4), with Execution, Delivery and Process Management accounting
for 52% of total operational risk losses and External Fraud accounting for
24%. This again was consistent with 2006 internal risk events and, from
our analysis of external data, is in line with industry experience.
Barclays has been granted a waiver by the UK FSA to apply an Advanced
Measurement Approach (AMA) for Group-wide consolidated and solus
regulatory capital reporting. Barclays has applied the AMA Group-wide.
The two areas where roll-out of AMA is still continuing are Banco Austral
(Mozambique) and National Bank of Commerce Limited (Tanzania),
where the Standardised Approach is currently applied. In certain joint
ventures and associates, Barclays may not be able to apply the Advanced
Operational Risk Framework. Barclays does not currently use insurance 
or expected losses to offset its regulatory capital requirement.

Financial crime risk management
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 111
Financial crime risk management
Barclays adopts an integrated approach to financial 
crime risk management. In line with the five-step risk
management model, Group Financial Crime Management
(GFCM) has the responsibility to direct, assess, control,
report and manage/challenge financial crime risks, which
are structured into three strands: anti-money laundering
(AML) and sanctions; fraud; and security. 
Each business unit within Barclays develops its own
capability to tackle financial crime, providing regular
reporting on performance, incidents and the latest trends
impacting business. This integrated model allows us to: 
– Develop a clear profile of financial crime risk across 
the Group.
– Share intelligence, adopt common standards and
respond promptly to emerging issues.
– Drive forward law enforcement and other Government
initiatives.
– Benchmark ourselves against other financial institutions
facing similar challenges. 
Anti-money laundering and sanctions risk
The Group assesses the implications of all emerging legal and regulatory
requirements that impact it and establishes policies and procedures in
respect of AML, terrorist financing and sanctions, updating these regularly.
It operates an AML assurance programme to ensure a system of effective
controls to comply with the overarching policies, providing technical
guidance and support to each business unit.
GFCM collates and oversees the preparation of Group-wide management
information on AML and sanctions. This information includes risk
indicators, such as volumes of suspicious activity reports (SARs) and is
supplemented by trend analysis, which highlights high-risk or emerging
issues so that prompt action can be taken to address them. 
Three committees (the Sanctions Cross Cluster Operational Review 
Board, the AML Steering Committee and the Policy Review Forum) review
business performance, share intelligence, develop and agree controls, and
discuss emerging themes and the implementation status of policies and
procedures.
All businesses contribute towards the Group Money Laundering 
Reporting Officers Annual Report, which is provided to Group Senior
Executive Management and is available to the FSA. Together with regular
management information and conformance testing, this report updates
senior management with evidence that the Group’ s money laundering
and terrorist financing risks are being appropriately, proportionally and
effectively managed.
During 2007, the Group augmented its AML capability, implementing
third EU money laundering directive, with its guiding principle of a risk-
based approach. For AML, this must be proportionate to the perceived
risks and threats, including terrorist financing. 
A new Group AML Policy, launched in December 2007 and encapsulating
the risk-based approach, has further improved the Group’ s customer 
due diligence procedures and standards, transaction monitoring and staff
training and awareness. 
The Group also implemented EU Regulation 1781/2006, which aims to
ensure thorough and robust audit trails concerning electronic transfers.
This assists the Group in monitoring its AML and terrorist financing and
improves the information available to law enforcement authorities.
Barclays continues to upgrade its sanctions screening capabilities, in line
with best international practice and changing regulatory requirements.
The Group has invested substantial resources to further enhance its
monitoring capabilities in this area and will continue to do so.
In 2008, the Group will review procedures to ensure compliance with
forthcoming legislation concerning the Single European Payments Area
(SEP A). Should the US enact current draft legislation outlawing the use of
the international payments and clearing systems for perceived illegal US
internet gaming transactions, further enhancements to payments activity
monitoring will follow. Risk management
Financial crime risk management
112 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Fraud risk
The Group establishes and operates a fraud risk control framework which
measures overall fraud risk exposure and controls. Together with Group-
wide policies, this directs how fraud is managed.
The Group Financial Crime Management team (GFCM) is responsible for
delivering the overall fraud strategy and providing oversight to Group and
Business Units in order to manage fraud risk. The strategy is designed to: 
– Identify emerging threats in order that effective controls are embedded
across the Group and build up capability to manage risk.
– Identify and manage fraud incidents, ensuring regulatory and legal
conformance, appropriate escalation and control issues are addressed
to prevent further loss.
– Work proactively to highlight areas of concern in order that remediation
can take place.
GFCM assesses the fraud risk of existing and emerging products, services,
processes and jurisdictions to drive down fraud losses as turnover/growth
increases. It also represents Barclays at trade, industry and Government
bodies providing a conduit to maximise the flow of information and
intelligence. GFCM also provides technical expertise to business areas
whether to drive through Group solutions or provide assistance with
specific incidents and investigations.
Business Units, together with product holders and channels identify their
appetite for fraud loss which informs and determines the overall fraud
plan. Objectives are then set around these plans.
At a business level, fraud risk/loss committees track fraud (and in some
cases operational) loss. The Barclays Group Fraud Risk profile is exercised
regularly through the review and challenge of the net losses and key risk
metrics; these are then viewed against the overall Fraud Risk Profile (Fraud
Oversight Committee).
Fraud is reported monthly to senior management both within the Business
Units and to Group who provide a global oversight of fraud loss. Fraud is
measured against plan for both net and gross losses and in line with the
Principal Risk Policy; Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are embedded in order that
overall exposure can be established.
As a result of this process, fraud performance both at Business Unit and
Group level can be measured and appropriate action taken to minimise or
track significant issues.
Externally there are ‘in country’ industry-wide forums to which Barclays
contributes and in some cases can benchmark performance, controls and
current and emerging issues.
Barclays overall reported fraud losses fell in 2007, with most of the
reduction coming from significant falls in internet banking fraud. 
As part of its efforts to enhance security, Barclays offers all its personal
customers complimentary internet security software to reduce phishing
attacks. The Group has also rolled out two-factor authentication
technology using the new PINsentry device to make online transactions
more secure. Enhanced transaction profiling has further improved our
ability to identify where customer accounts have been targeted by
fraudsters and take preventative action to protect funds.
Following the loss of personal data, including bank details, by both
Government agencies and other third parties, data protection and security
was a prominent theme in 2007. Barclays treats any incident of this nature
with the utmost importance and has worked closely with industry and the
Government to take steps to:
– Reassure customers and provide points of contact for help and guidance.
– Protect any customer accounts, whose details may have been
compromised.
– Develop a standard approach for dealing with accounts that may be
impacted by data security breaches.
Security risk
Group Financial Crime Management (GFCM) also manages security risk.
Its fundamental objective is to allow Barclays to operate in a safe and
secure manner in all existing and potential future markets. 
In pursuit of this objective, the Security Risk team gathers and shares
current threat assessments across business areas, using intelligence from
Security and Government Agencies and ‘in country’ teams. It ensures that
suitable policies and control systems are in place to protect Group
business and that plans to protect high-risk personnel are fit for purpose
and in line with accepted best practice.
Barclays has developed and continues to improve a robust people
screening process to protect the bank from those people who want to
harm the organisation, by either joining as staff members or becoming
involved with its operations. 
Security Risk is regularly reported by the businesses and reviewed via 
the Security Risk Management Committee, whose objectives are to: 
– Consider the latest management information and security threat
assessments.
– Drive forward mitigating action to protect the Group from potential
threats.
– Provide guidance to the design and effectiveness of the overall Barclays
Security Risk framework.
– Ensure all Security Risk workstreams have been effectively integrated
and implemented.
– Monitor corporate security profiles against the agreed plan, tracking
issues in order that remedial action can be taken. 1

Allowance coverage of credit risk loans and potential credit risk loans excluding the drawn ABS CDO Super Senior exposure decreased to 55.6% 
(31st December 2006: 65.6%) and 49.0% (31st December 2006: 57.0%), respectively. The decrease in these ratios reflected a change in the mix of
credit risk loans and potential credit risk loans: unsecured retail exposures, where the recovery outlook is relatively low, decreased as a proportion of the
total as the collections and underwriting processes were improved. Secured retail and wholesale and corporate exposures, where the recovery outlook 
is relatively high, increased as a proportion of credit risk loans and potential credit risk loans.
Allowance coverage of ABS CDO Super Senior credit risk loans was low relative to allowance coverage of other credit risk loans since substantial 
protection against loss is also provided by subordination and hedges. On ABS CDO Super Senior exposures, the combination of subordination, 
hedging and writedowns provide protection against loss levels to 72% on US sub-prime collateral as at 31st December 2007.
Note
a Does not reflect the application of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 which became effective
from 1st January 2005.  Supervision and regulation
The Group’ s operations, including its overseas offices, subsidiaries and
associates, are subject to rules and regulations, including reserve and
reporting requirements and conduct of business requirements, imposed
by the relevant central banks and regulatory authorities.
In the UK, the FSA is the independent body responsible for the regulation 
of deposit taking, life insurance, home mortgages, general insurance 
and investment business. The FSA was established by the Government
and it exercises statutory powers under the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000.
Barclays Bank PLC is authorised by the FSA to carry on a range of regulated
activities within the UK and is subject to consolidated supervision. In its
role as supervisor, the FSA seeks to ensure the safety and soundness of
financial institutions with the aim of strengthening, but not guaranteeing,
the protection of customers. The FSA ’ s continuing supervision of financial
institutions authorised by it is conducted through a variety of regulatory
tools, including the collection of information from statistical and prudential
returns, reports obtained from skilled persons, visits to firms and regular
meetings with management to discuss issues such as performance, risk
management and strategy.
The FSA adopts a risk-based approach to supervision. The starting point
for supervision of all financial institutions is a systematic analysis of the risk
profile for each authorised firm. The FSA has adopted a homogeneous
risk, processes and resourcing model in its approach to its supervisory
responsibilities (known as the ARROW model) and the results of the risk
assessment are used by the FSA to develop a risk mitigation programme
for a firm. The FSA also promulgates requirements that banks and other
financial institutions are required to meet on matters such as capital
adequacy, limits on large exposures to individual entities and groups of
closely connected entities, liquidity and rules of business conduct. Certain
of these requirements derive from EU directives as described below.
Banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions in the UK are
subject to a single financial services compensation scheme (the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme) where an authorised firm is unable or is
likely to be unable to meet claims made against it because of its financial
circumstances. Different levels of compensation are available to eligible
claimants depending upon whether the protected claim is in relation to a
deposit, a contract of insurance or protected investment business and
certain types of claims are subject to maximum levels of compensation.
Most deposits made with branches of Barclays Bank PLC within the
European Economic Area (EEA) which are denominated in Sterling or other
EEA currencies (including the euro) are covered by the Scheme. Most
claims made in respect of designated investment business will also be
protected claims if the business was carried on from the UK or from a
branch of the bank or investment firm in another EEA member state. The
arrangements for compensating depositors and for dealing with failed
banks are currently subject to consultation by the UK Tripartite Authorities
– HM Treasury, the FSA and the Bank of England. The Government has
committed to presenting proposals for legislation to Parliament on these
matters in the course of 2008.
Outside the UK, the Group has operations (and main regulators) located in
continental Europe, in particular France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland,
Portugal and Italy (local central banks and other regulatory authorities);
Asia Pacific (various regulatory authorities including the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority, the Financial Services Agency of Japan, the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission , the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the Reserve
Bank of India); Africa and the Middle East (various regulatory authorities
including the South African Reserve Bank and the Financial Services Board
and the regulatory authorities of the United Arab Emirates) and the United
States of America (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(FRB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the
Securities and Exchange Commission). 
In Europe, the UK regulatory agenda is considerably shaped and
influenced by the directives emanating from the EU. A number of EU
directives have recently been implemented, for example the Capital
Requirements Directive and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
(‘MiFID’). These form part of the European Single Market programme, an
important feature of which is the framework for the regulation of
authorised firms. This framework, which continues to evolve, is designed
to enable a credit institution or investment firm authorised in one EU
member state to conduct banking or investment business through the
establishment of branches or by the provision of services on a cross-
border basis in other member states without the need for local
authorisation. Barclays operations in Europe are authorised and regulated
by a combination of both home (the FSA) and host regulators.
Barclays operations in South Africa, including Absa Group Limited, are
supervised and regulated by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and
the Financial Services Board (FSB). SARB oversees the banking industry
and follows a risk-based approach to supervision whilst the FSB oversees
the non-banking financial services industry and focuses on enhancing
consumer protection and regulating market conduct.
In the United States, Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and certain US
subsidiaries and branches of the Bank are subject to a comprehensive
regulatory structure, involving numerous statutes, rules and regulations,
including the International Banking Act of 1978, the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended, the Foreign Bank Supervision
Enhancement Act of 1991 and the USA P A TRIOT Act of 2001. Such laws
and regulations impose limitations on the types of businesses, and the
ways in which they may be conducted, in the United States and on the
location and expansion of banking business there. The Bank’ s branch
operations are subject to extensive federal and state supervision and
regulation by the FRB, the New Y ork State Banking Department and the
OCC (in the case of Barclays Global Investors, NA); and the Delaware State
Banking Commissioner and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (in
the case of Barclays Bank Delaware). The investment banking and asset
management operations are subject to ongoing supervision and
regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as a
comprehensive scheme of regulation under the US federal securities laws,
as enforced by, for example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) and the OCC.

Directors’ report
Business Review
The Company is required to set out in this report a fair
review of the business of the Group during the financial
year ended 31st December 2007 and of the position of 
the Group at the end of the financial year and a description
of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group
(known as a ‘Business Review’).
The information that fulfils the requirements of the
Business Review can be found in the following sections 
of the Annual Report:
Profit Attributable
The profit attributable to equity shareholders of Barclays PLC for the year
amounted to £4,417m, compared with £4,571m in 2006.
Dividends
The final dividends for the year ended 31st December 2007 of 22.5p per
ordinary share of 25p each and 10p per staff share of £1 each have been
agreed by the Directors. The final dividends will be paid on 25th April 2008
in respect of the ordinary shares registered at the close of business 
on 7th March 2008 and in respect of the staff shares so registered on
31st December 2007. With the interim dividends of 11.5p per ordinary
share and of 10p per staff share that were paid on 1st October 2007, the
total distribution for 2007 is 34.0p (2006: 31.0p) per ordinary share and
20p (2006: 20p) per staff share. The dividends for the year absorb a total
of £2,253m (2006: £1,973m).
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Ordinary shareholders may have their dividends reinvested in Barclays PLC
ordinary shares by participating in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. 
The plan is available to all ordinary shareholders provided that they do not
live in, and are not subject to the jurisdiction of, any country where their
participation in the plan would require Barclays or The Plan Administrator
to take action to comply with local government or regulatory procedures
or any similar formalities. Any shareholder wishing to obtain details of the
plan and a mandate form should contact The Plan Administrator to Barclays
at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing BN99 6DA. Those wishing to
participate for the first time in the plan should send their completed
mandate form to The Plan Administrator so as to be received by 4th April
2008 for it to be applicable to the payment of the final dividend on
25th April 2008. Existing participants should take no action unless they
wish to alter their current mandate instructions, in which case they should
contact The Plan Administrator.
Share Capital
During the year Barclays PLC purchased in the market for cancellation
299,547,510 of its ordinary shares of 25p each, at a total cost of
£1,802,173,355, in order to minimise the dilutive effect on existing
shareholders of the issuance of a total of 336,805,556 Barclays ordinary
shares to Temasek Holdings and China Development Bank. These
transactions represent 4.5% of the issued share capital at 31st December
2007. As at 27th February 2008 (the latest practicable date for inclusion 
in this report), the Company had an unexpired authority to repurchase
shares up to a maximum of 645.1 million ordinary shares.

The issued ordinary share capital was increased by 65.5m ordinary shares
during the year as a result of the exercise of options under the Sharesave
and Executive Share Option Schemes. At 31st December 2007 the issued
ordinary share capital totalled 6,600,181,801 shares. Ordinary shares
represent 99.99% of the total issued share capital and Staff shares
represent the remaining 0.01% as at 31st December 2007.
The Barclays PLC Memorandum and Articles of Association, a summary 
of which can be found in the Shareholder Information section on pages

obligations attaching to each class of shares.
– Restrictions on the transfer of securities in the Company, including
limitations on the holding of securities and requirements to obtain
approvals for a transfer of securities.

– Rules that the Company has about the appointment and removal 
of Directors or amendments to the Company’ s Articles of Association.
Employee Benefit Trusts (‘EBTs’) operate in connection with certain of the
Group’ s Employee Share Plans (‘Plans’). The Trustees of the EBTs may
exercise all rights attached to the shares in accordance with their fiduciary
duties other than as specifically restricted in the relevant Plan governing
documents. Further information on the EBTs’ voting policy can be found 
on page 148.

As at 27th February 2008, the Company had been notified under Rule 5 
of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FSA of the following
holdings of voting rights in its shares:
China Development Bank 
(via its subsidiary Upper Chance Group Ltd) 3.02%
Legal & General Group plc 4.02%
Lloyds TSB Group Plc 5.01%
Substantial shareholders do not have different voting rights from those 
of other shareholders. As at 27th February 2008, the Company had been
notified that Lloyds TSB Group Plc held voting rights over 329,648,746 
of its ordinary shares, amounting to 5.01% of the Company’ s total voting

Board Membership
The membership of the Boards of Directors of Barclays PLC and Barclays
Bank PLC is identical and biographical details of the Board members 
are set out on pages 128 and 129.
Chris Lucas joined the Board as Group Finance Director on 1st April 2007
and Naguib Kheraj left the Board on 31st March 2007.
David Booth joined the Board as a non-executive Director on 1st May 2007
and Patience Wheatcroft and Sir Michael Rake were appointed as non-

Retirement and Re-election of Directors
In accordance with its Articles of Association, one-third (rounded down) 
of the Directors of Barclays PLC are required to retire by rotation at each
Annual General Meeting (AGM), together with Directors appointed by the
Board since the last AGM. The retiring Directors are eligible to stand for 
re-election. In addition, the UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance
(the Code), recommends that every Director should seek re-election by
shareholders at least every three years.  2
Governance
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 131
The Directors retiring by rotation at the 2008 AGM and offering themselves
for re-election are Fulvio Conti, Gary Hoffman and Sir John Sunderland. 
Sir Nigel Rudd retires annually as recommended by the Code and is
offering himself for re-election. In addition, David Booth, Sir Michael Rake
and Patience Wheatcroft, who were appointed as Directors since the last
AGM, will be offering themselves for re-election at the 2008 AGM. Danie
Cronjé is retiring at the AGM and is not offering himself for re-election.
Directors’ Interests
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Group on 31st December 2007 
are shown on page 158. 
Directors’ Emoluments
Information on emoluments of Directors of Barclays PLC, in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom
Listing Authority, is given in the Remuneration report on pages 144 to 158
and in Note 42 to the accounts.
Directors’ Indemnities
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Group to attract and
retain the services of the most able and experienced Directors by offering
competitive terms of engagement, including the granting of indemnities
on terms consistent with the applicable statutory provisions. Qualifying
third party indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 of the
Companies Act 2006) were accordingly in force during the course of 
the financial year ended 31st December 2007 for the benefit of the then
Directors and, at the date of this report, are in force for the benefit of the
Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur
(or have incurred) in connection with their duties, powers or office.
Activities
Barclays PLC Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in
retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking, wealth
management and investment management services. The Group operates
through branches, offices and subsidiaries in the UK and overseas.
Community Involvement
Barclays has an extensive community programme covering many
countries around the world. The Group provides funding and support 
to over 7,140 charities and voluntary organisations, ranging from small,
local charities, like Passage (UK), to international organisations like the 
Red Cross. We also have a very successful employee programme which 
in 2007 saw more than 43,700 employees and pensioners worldwide
taking part in Barclays-supported volunteering, giving and fundraising
activities. Further information on our community involvement is given 
on pages 72 and 74.
The total commitment for 2007 was £52.4m (2006: £46.5m). The Group
committed £38.9m in support of the community in the UK (2006: £39.6m)
and £13.5m was committed in international support (2006: £6.9m). The
UK commitment includes £30.4m of charitable donations (2006: £35.2m).
Political Donations
The Group did not give any money for political purposes in the UK nor 
did it make any donations to EU political organisations or incur any EU
political expenditure during the year. Absa Group Limited, in which the
Group acquired a majority stake in 2005, made donations totalling
£170,142 in 2007 (2006: £212,729) in accordance with its policy of
making political donations to the major South African political parties to
support the development of democracy in South Africa. The Group made
no other political donations in 2007.
At the AGM in 2007, shareholders gave a limited authority for Barclays Bank
PLC to make political donations and incur political expenditure, within an
agreed limit, as a precautionary measure in light of the wide definitions in
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. This was similar
to an authority given by shareholders in 2006. This authority, which has
not been used, expires at the conclusion of the AGM held this year, or, if
earlier, 26th July 2008. The Companies Act 2006 largely restates the
provisions of The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
The risk of inadvertently breaching the Companies Act 2006 remains 
and the Directors consider it prudent to seek a similar authority from
shareholders. A resolution to authorise Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries 
to make EU political donations and incur EU political expenditure up to a
maximum aggregate sum of £125,000 is therefore being proposed at the
Barclays PLC 2008 AGM.
Employee Involvement
Barclays is committed to ensuring that employees share in the success of
the Group. Staff are encouraged to participate in share option and share
purchase schemes and have a substantial sum invested in Barclays shares.
Employees are kept informed of matters of concern to them in a variety 
of ways, including the corporate news magazines, intranets, briefings 
and mobile phone SMS messaging. These communications help achieve 
a common awareness among employees of the financial and economic
factors affecting the performance of Barclays.
Barclays is also committed to providing employees with opportunities 
to share their views and provide feedback on issues that are important 
to them. An annual Employee Opinion Survey is undertaken with results
being reported to the Board HR and Remuneration Committee, all
employees and to Unite (Amicus section), our recognised union in 
the UK. Roadshows and employee forums also take place. 
In addition, Barclays undertakes regular and formal Group, business unit
and project specific consultations with Unite (Amicus section).
Diversity and Inclusion
The diversity agenda at Barclays seeks to include customers, colleagues
and suppliers. Our objective is to recruit and retain the best people,
regardless of (but not limited to) race, religion, age, gender, sexual
orientation or disability. We strive to ensure our workforce reflects the
communities in which we operate and the international nature of the
organisation. We recognise that diversity is a key part of responsible
business strategy in support of our increasingly global business.
Barclays is committed to providing additional support to employees with
disabilities and making it easier for them to inform us of their specific
requirements, including the introduction of a dedicated intranet site and
disability helpline. Through our Reasonable Adjustments Scheme,
appropriate assistance can be given, including both physical workplace
adjustments, and relevant training and access to trained mentors is also
provided for disabled employees. A wide range of recruitment initiatives
have been taken to increase the number of people with disabilities
working in Barclays.
Health and Safety
Barclays is committed to ensuring the health, safety and welfare of our
employees and to providing and maintaining safe working conditions.
Barclays regards legislative compliance as a minimum and, where
appropriate, we seek to implement higher standards. Barclays also
recognises its responsibilities towards all persons on its premises, such 
as contractors, visitors and members of the public, and ensures, so far 
as is reasonably practicable, that they are not exposed to significant risks
to their health and safety.
Barclays regularly reviews its Statement of Health and Safety Commitment,
issued with the authority of the Board and which applies to all business
areas in which Barclays has operational control. In this statement Barclays
commits to:
– demonstrate personal leadership that is consistent with this
commitment;
– provide the appropriate resources to fulfil this commitment;
– carry out risk assessments and take appropriate actions to mitigate 
the risks identified;
– consult with our employees on matters affecting their health and safety;
– ensure that appropriate information, instruction, training and
supervision are provided;
– appoint competent persons to provide specialist advice; and
– review Barclays Health and Safety Group Process and the Statement 
of Commitment, at regular intervals. Directors’ report
132 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Barclays monitors its health and safety performance using a variety of
measurements on a monthly basis and the Board HR and Remuneration
Committee receives annual reports on health and safety performance
from the Human Resource Director. As part of its Partnership Agreement
with Unite (Amicus section), Barclays currently funds full time Health 
and Safety Representatives.
Creditors’ Payment Policy
Barclays values its suppliers and acknowledges the importance of paying
invoices, especially those of small businesses, in a timely manner. It is the
Group’ s practice to agree terms with suppliers when entering into contracts.
We negotiate with suppliers on an individual basis and meet our obligations
accordingly. The Group does not follow any specific published code or
standard on payment practice.
Paragraph 12(3) of Schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1985 requires
disclosure of trade creditor payment days. Disclosure is required by the
Company, rather than the Group. The Group’ s principal trading subsidiary
in the UK is Barclays Bank PLC, the accounts for which are prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. The
components for the trade creditor calculation are not easily identified.
However, by identifying as closely as possible the components that would
be required if Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985 applied, the trade
creditor payment days for Barclays Bank PLC for 2007 were 27 days 
(2006: 28 days). This is an arithmetical calculation and does not necessarily
reflect our practice, which is described above, nor the experience of any 
individual creditor.
Financial Instruments
The Group’ s financial risk management objectives and policies, including
the policy for hedging each major type of forecasted transaction for which
hedge accounting is used, and the exposure to market risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk are set out in pages 75 to 108 under the headings, ‘Barclays
approach to risk management’, ‘Credit Risk Management’, ‘Market risk
management’, ‘Liquidity Management’ and ‘Derivatives’ and in Note 14
and Notes 45 to 48 to the accounts.
Events after the Balance Sheet Date
On 3rd March 2008, Barclays entered into an agreement with Petropavlovsk
Finance (Limited Liability Society) to acquire 100% of the Russian bank,
Expobank, for a consideration of approximately $745m (£373m). The
transaction is expected to close in summer 2008 after the receipt of
appropriate regulatory approvals. Expobank focuses principally on Western
Russia, with a substantial presence in Moscow and St Petersburg. Founded
in 1994, it has grown rapidly and comprises a blend of retail and commercial
banking, operating 32 branches and dealing with a range of corporate 
and wholesale clients. As at 31st December 2007, Expobank had net
assets of $186m (£93m).
The Auditors
The Board Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the external
auditors, as well as their relationship with the Group, including monitoring
the Group’ s use of the auditors for non-audit services and the balance 
of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditors. More details on this can
be found on pages 138 and 139 and Note 9 to the accounts. Having
reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external auditors,
the Committee has recommended to the Board that the existing auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , be reappointed. PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP have signified their willingness to continue in office and ordinary
resolutions reappointing them as auditors and authorising the Directors 
to set their remuneration will be proposed at the 2008 AGM. 
So far as each of the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’ s auditors are unaware. Each of the
Directors has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a
Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’ s auditors are aware of 
that information. For these purposes, ‘relevant audit information’ means
information needed by the Company’ s auditors in connection with
preparing their report.
The Annual General Meeting and 
Class Meeting of Ordinary Shareholders
The Barclays PLC AGM will be held at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference
Centre on Thursday 24th April 2008. The Notice of AGM is included 
in a separate document sent to shareholders with this report. A summary
of the resolutions being proposed at the 2008 AGM is set out below: 
Ordinary Resolutions 
– To receive the Directors’ and Auditors’ Reports and the audited accounts
for the year ended 31st December 2007.

Group Chairman’s Introduction
I am pleased to report to you on the activities of the Board
and its Committees over the past 12 months, my first year
as Group Chairman. It has been an eventful and busy 
year but we have continued to apply the high standards 
of corporate governance that we set both for ourselves as 
a Board and for our Company.
Since I last reported to you, there have been a number of
changes to the Board. Chris Lucas succeeded Naguib Kheraj
as Group Finance Director in April 2007 and we have
significantly strengthened the independent non-executive
presence on the Board with the appointments of David
Booth, Sir Michael Rake and Patience Wheatcroft.
We report below on how we have complied in 2007 with
the UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the
Code). We are committed to promoting good corporate
governance. We seek to be at the forefront of global best
practice and to respond, in a timely fashion, to corporate
governance developments. T o gain a greater understanding
of the corporate governance framework within Barclays 
I encourage you to read ‘Corporate Governance in Barclays’,
which is available from our website.

Statements of Compliance
UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance
As Barclays is listed on the London Stock Exchange we comply with the 
UK Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code). The Code was
revised in June 2006 and the revised Code applied to Barclays with effect
from 1st January 2007. For the year ended 31st December 2007, we have
complied with the relevant provisions set out in section 1 of the Code and
applied the principles of the Code as described in this report. 
NYSE Corporate Governance Rules 
Barclays has American Depositary Receipts listed on the New Y ork 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) and is therefore subject to the NYSE’ s Corporate
Governance rules (NYSE Rules). As a non-US company listed on the NYSE,
we are exempt from most of the NYSE Rules, which domestic US companies
must follow. We are required to provide an Annual Written Affirmation to
the NYSE of our compliance with the applicable NYSE Rules and also to
disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices
differ from those followed by domestic US companies listed on the NYSE.
As our main listing is on the London Stock Exchange, we follow the UK’ s
Combined Code. Key differences between the NYSE Rules and the Code
are set out later in this report.  Corporate governance
Corporate governance report
134 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
The overall governance framework within which the Group operates is set
out above. Details of the Group’ s risk management framework can be found
on pages 80 to 112. 
The Board manages the Company on behalf of the shareholders. In order
to run the business effectively, the Board delegates responsibility for the
day-to-day management of the Company to the Group Chief Executive, who
is supported by the Executive Committee, which he chairs. The Executive
Committee is supported by various management committees, including
the Disclosure Committee. Details of the Disclosure Committee are set out
on page 141. The rest of this report describes the way in which the Board
and its Committees operate within the governance framework.
The terms of reference for each of the principal Board Committees are
available from the Corporate Governance section at:
http://www.aboutbarclays.com
There are eight scheduled Board meetings each year. One of these meetings
is a day and a half off-site meeting for the purposes of considering and
approving the Group’ s strategy. The Group Chairman meets privately with
the non-executive Directors before each scheduled Board meeting in order
to brief them on the business of the meeting and identify any shared areas
of concern. In addition to the scheduled Board meetings in 2007, there
were a further 13 Board meetings held in relation to the proposed merger
with ABN AMRO and ten meetings of a specially appointed Committee of
the Board (the ‘Transaction Committee’), comprising the Group Chairman,
Group Chief Executive, Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director,
which was established for the purpose of overseeing the proposed merger
with ABN AMRO and considering various aspects of the proposed
transaction. Attendance at the additional Board meetings, which were
often called at short notice, was 88.1%. Attendance at the Transaction
Committee was 100%. 
Scheduled Board and Committee meetings are arranged well in advance
to ensure, as far as possible, that Directors can manage their time
commitments. All Directors are provided with supporting papers and
relevant information for each meeting and are expected to attend, unless
there are exceptional circumstances that prevent them from doing so.
Attendance at the scheduled Board meetings is set out on page 137. 
Reasons for non-attendance are generally prior business or personal
commitments. In the event that a Director is unable to attend a meeting,
they will still receive the papers for the meeting and will normally discuss
any matters they wish to raise with the Chairman of the meeting to ensure
their views are taken into account. In addition, all Directors are able to
discuss any issues with the Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
at any time. In the case of Leigh Clifford, who was unable to attend two
meetings of the Board HR and Remuneration Committee in 2007 because
of other commitments, including his relocation to Australia following his
retirement as Chief Executive of Rio Tinto, he received the papers for the
meetings he was unable to attend and provided comments to the Committee
Chairman ahead of both meetings. In 2007, all Directors contributed the
time necessary to discharge their responsibilities to the Board. 
The Group Chairman works closely with the Company Secretary to ensure
that accurate, timely and clear information flows to the Board. Supporting
papers for scheduled meetings are distributed the week before each
meeting. Directors may also access electronic copies of meeting papers
and other key documents quickly and securely via a dedicated Directors’
Intranet. Examples include past and current Board and Committee papers,
reports, minutes, press coverage, analyst reports and material from training
sessions. All Directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary
and his team, and can take independent professional advice on request, 
at the Company’ s expense.

The Board
Role of the Board 
Under UK company law, Directors must act in a way they consider, in 
good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of Barclays for the
benefit of the shareholders as a whole. In doing so, the Directors must
have regard (amongst other matters) to:
– the likely consequences of any decision in the long-term;
– the interests of Barclays employees;
– the need to foster Barclays business relationships with suppliers,
customers and others;
– the impact of Barclays operations on the community and the
environment;
– the desirability of Barclays maintaining a reputation for high standards
of business conduct; and 
– the need to act fairly as between shareholders of Barclays. 
The role and responsibilities of the Barclays Board, which encompass the
duties of Directors described above, are set out in Corporate Governance
in Barclays. The Board is responsible to shareholders for creating and
delivering sustainable shareholder value through the management of the
Group’ s businesses. It therefore determines the goals and policies of the
Group to deliver such long-term value, providing overall strategic direction
within a framework of rewards, incentives and controls. The Board aims to
ensure that management strikes an appropriate balance between
promoting long-term growth and delivering short-term objectives. 
The Board is also responsible for ensuring that management maintains a
system of internal control that provides assurance of effective and efficient
operations, internal financial controls and compliance with law and
regulation. In carrying out this responsibility, the Board has regard to what
is appropriate for the Group’ s business and reputation, the materiality of
the financial and other risks inherent in the business and the relative costs
and benefits of implementing specific controls. 
The Board is also the decision-making body for all other matters of such
importance as to be of significance to the Group as a whole because of
their strategic, financial or reputational implications or consequences.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board’ s decision,
which is summarised in the panel above right. 
The chart below left illustrates how the Board allocated its time at its eight
scheduled meetings during 2007. If the additional meetings relating to 
the proposed merger with ABN AMRO are taken into account, 49% of the
Board’ s time in 2007 was spent on M&A. A typical Board meeting receives
reports from the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director and
will also be presented with an update on the execution of strategy in one
or two of the main businesses and functions. It will also receive reports
from each of the principal Board Committees and may also receive a report
from the Company Secretary on any relevant corporate governance matters.
Board structure and composition 
The roles of the Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive are separate.
The Group Chairman’ s main responsibility is to lead and manage the 
work of the Board to ensure that it operates effectively and fully discharges
its legal and regulatory responsibilities. The Board has delegated the
responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group to the Group
Chief Executive, who is responsible for recommending strategy to the
Board, leading the executive Directors and for making and implementing
operational decisions. 
The Board of Directors has collective responsibility for the success of the
Group. However, executive Directors have direct responsibility for business
operations, whereas non-executive Directors are responsible for bringing
independent judgement and scrutiny to decisions taken by the Board,
providing objective challenge to management. The Board can draw on 
the wide range of skills, knowledge and experience they have built up 
as Directors of other companies, as business leaders, in government or 
in academia. It is the intention to have a broad spread of geographical
experience represented on the Board. The chart below right illustrates 
the geographical experience of the current non-executive Directors. 
Barclays has adopted a Charter of Expectations, which sets out, in detail,
the roles of each of the main positions on the Board including that of the
Group Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Senior Independent Director and
both non-executive and executive Directors. Sir Richard Broadbent
continued in the role of Senior Independent Director in 2007. The Senior
Independent Director is an additional contact point for shareholders and
also monitors the performance of the Group Chairman on behalf of the
Board. Sir Nigel Rudd continued in the role of Deputy Chairman during 2007. 
The Charter of Expectations, including role profiles for key Board 
positions, is available from: http://www.aboutbarclays.com
Summary of matters reserved for the Board
– Approval of interim and final financial statements, dividends and
any significant change in accounting policies or practices. 
– Approval of strategy.
– Major acquisitions, mergers or disposals. 
– Major capital investments and projects.
– Board appointments and removals. 
– Role profiles of key positions on the Board. 
– Terms of reference and membership of Board Committees. 
– Remuneration of auditors and recommendations for appointment
or removal of auditors.
– Changes relating to capital structure or status as a PLC. 
– Approval of all circulars, prospectuses and significant press releases.

136 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
There is a strong independent element on the Board and, in line with the
recommendations of the Code, at least half the Board are independent
non-executive Directors. At the date of this report, the Board is comprised
of the Group Chairman, five executive Directors and 12 non-executive
Directors. The balance of the Board is illustrated by the chart below left. 
The Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee is
responsible for reviewing the composition and balance of the Board 
and its principal Committees and for recommending to the Board the
appointment of new Directors. These regular reviews aim to ensure that
there is an appropriate mix of skills and experience on the Board, taking
into account the need to progressively refresh the Board. Details of the
experience and skills of each of the current Directors are set out in their
biographies on pages 128 to 129. The length of tenure of the current non-
executive Directors is illustrated by the chart below right. 
All Directors are required to seek re-election every three years and any
Directors appointed during the year seek re-election at the next annual
general meeting (AGM). Sir Nigel Rudd, who has served on the Board
since 1996, seeks re-election annually. These periods are in line with 
the recommendations of the Code. Details of Directors proposed for 
re-election are given in the Notice of Shareholder Meetings, which is
enclosed separately with this Report. 
Executive Directors are allowed to serve on one other listed company
board, in addition to their role at Barclays. 
Independence of non-executive Directors
The Code sets out circumstances which the Board may find relevant 
when determining the independence of a non-executive Director. 
The Board considers that the following behaviours, as set out in our
Charter of Expectations, are essential for the Board to conclude an
individual is independent:
– provides objective challenge to management;
– is prepared to challenge others’ assumptions, beliefs or viewpoints 
as necessary for the good of the organisation;
– questions intelligently, debates constructively, challenges rigorously
and decides dispassionately;
– is willing to stand up and defend their own beliefs and viewpoints 
in order to support the ultimate good of the organisation; and
– has a good understanding of the organisation’s business and affairs 
to enable them properly to evaluate the information and responses
provided by management.
The Board considers non-executive Director independence on an annual
basis, as part of each Director’ s performance review. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and
subsequently the Board reviewed the independence of non-executive
Directors in early 2008 and concluded that each of them continues to
demonstrate these essential behaviours. In determining that each of the
non-executive Directors remains independent, the Board considered in
particular the following: 
– Sir Nigel Rudd has served as a non-executive Director since 1996. 
The Code suggests that length of tenure is a factor to consider when
determining independence. As recommended by the Code, it is our
policy that any Director who serves for more than nine years should
seek annual re-election by shareholders and that all Directors subject 
to re-election should undergo a rigorous performance evaluation. 
– At the time of his appointment to the Board, Dr Danie Cronjé 
was Chairman of Absa. The Code suggests that such a 
business relationship is a factor to be considered by the Board when
determining independence. The Code further suggests that cross-
directorships may affect independence. Sir Nigel Rudd and Dr Cronjé
are both non-executive Directors of Sappi Limited. Dr Cronjé retired as
Chairman of Absa and left the Absa Board in 2007 and will not submit
himself for re-election as a Director of Barclays when he retires at the
2008 AGM.
As a result of the annual performance review, the Board concluded that 
Sir Nigel Rudd and Dr Cronjé both continue to demonstrate the essential
characteristics of independence expected by the Board. Sir Nigel’ s length
of service, and his resulting experience and knowledge of Barclays, is
viewed by the Board as being especially valuable, particularly as only one
other non-executive Director has served for more than six years and the
Board continues to be regularly refreshed.
All Directors must report any changes in their circumstances to the Board
and the Board reserves the right to terminate the appointment of a non-
executive Director if there are any material changes in their circumstances
that may conflict with their commitments as a Barclays Director or that
may impact on their independence.

Board Committees
In order for the Board to carry out its functions, and to ensure independent
oversight of internal control and risk management, certain aspects of its
role are delegated to Board Committees, whose members are non-executive
Directors. The specific matters for which delegated authority has been
given are set out in each Board Committee’ s terms of reference, which are
reviewed annually. 
The Board has delegated authority to four principal Board Committees: 
– Board Audit Committee
– Board Risk Committee
– Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee
– Board HR and Remuneration Committee 
The Board appoints Committee members on the recommendation of 
the Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee, which
regularly reviews Committee composition and balance and the need 
for refreshment. The number of scheduled meetings held and attendance
at the Committee meetings is set out above in ‘Board and Committee
Membership and Attendance’. The Board Committees report on their
activities on the following pages. Corporate governance

There are a number of regular attendees at each meeting, including the
Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Barclays Internal Audit
Director, Barclays Risk Director, Barclays General Counsel and the lead
external audit partner. The Board Audit Committee members meet with
the external auditors and the Barclays Internal Audit Director, without
management present, as part of most Committee meetings. Sir Andrew
Likierman continued in his role as ‘financial expert’ as defined by the 
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and has ‘recent and relevant financial
experience’ as recommended by the Code, as a result of his accountancy
background and his career with HM T reasury . Since the year end, Sir Michael
Rake, a former Chairman of KPMG International, has been appointed a
member of the Committee. 
Activities in 2007
The chart below illustrates how the Committee spent its time in 2007.
During 2007, the Committee:
– considered control issues of Group level significance for different areas
of the business;
– received reports on the control environment in each of the following
areas: Barclaycard, BGI, Barclays Commercial Bank, Western Europe,
Emerging Markets, GRCB IT, UK Retail Banking and Barclays Capital;
– reviewed the effectiveness and independence of the Group 
statutory auditor;
– monitored the performance of the Internal Audit function;
– reviewed internal control and risk management systems;
– considered the provision of non-audit services by the Group statutory
auditor – more details can be found in the panel opposite;
– approved the re-appointment, remuneration and engagement letter 
of the Group statutory auditor; 
– reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts and Preliminary and Interim
Results;
– considered the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting;
– received reports from the external and internal auditors;
– reviewed the Global Internal Audit Plan;
– received regular reports on concerns raised by employees
(whistleblowing – more details can be found on page 139); and 
– considered the Fraud Risk Control Framework.
The Committee also received regular updates during 2007 on:
– Basel II;
– MiFID;
– Sarbanes-Oxley compliance; and
– Sanctions compliance.
In February 2008, the Committee reviewed its activities in 2007 
against its terms of reference and concluded that it had discharged 
the responsibilities delegated to it under those terms of reference.

Non-audit services policy
The Committee takes seriously its responsibility to put in place
safeguards to auditor objectivity and independence. It has therefore
established a policy on the provision of services by the Group’ s
statutory auditor. The Policy describes the circumstances in which the
Auditor may be permitted to undertake non-audit work for the Group.
The Committee oversees compliance with the Policy and considers
and approves requests to use the Auditor for non-audit work.
Allowable non-audit services require pre-approval before they can be
carried out. For allowable services, the Committee has pre-approved 
all assignments where the expected fee does not exceed £100,000, 
or £10,000 in the case of certain taxation services. Any assignment
where the expected fee is above the relevant threshold requires
specific approval from the Committee or a member of the Committee.
The Company Secretary and his team deal with day-to-day
administration of the Policy, facilitating requests for approval by the
Committee. The Committee receives a report at each meeting on the
non-audit services provided by the Auditor and the Policy is reviewed
by the Committee annually. Details of the services that are prohibited
and allowed are set out below.
Services that are prohibited include:
– bookkeeping
– design and implementation of financial information systems
– appraisal or valuation services
– actuarial services
– internal audit outsourcing 
– management and Human Resource functions
– broker or dealer, investment advisor or investment banking services
– legal, expert and tax services involving advocacy
Allowable services that may be approved include:
– statutory and regulatory audit services and regulatory 
non-audit services
– other attest and assurance services
– accountancy advice and training
– risk management and controls advice
– transaction support 
– taxation services
– business support and recoveries 
– translation services 2
Governance

The membership of the Disclosure Committee and its role is set out on
page 141. The Legal and Technical Review Committee is an accounting,
legal and regulatory compliance committee, which is responsible for
reviewing the Group’ s financial reports and disclosures and for ensuring
they have been subject to adequate verification. Meetings are attended by
the Group’ s external US lawyers and auditors. This governance process
ensures that there is sufficient opportunity for both management and the
Board to review and challenge the Group’ s financial statements and other
significant disclosures before publication. It also provides assurance for
the certifications made by the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director as required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and recommended
by the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control. Further details of the Group’ s
system of internal control and an assessment of its effectiveness may be
found on page 159. 
Whistleblowing 
Barclays takes any concerns of employees about the integrity 
and honesty of other employees very seriously and will investigate
where appropriate. Information leaflets are distributed encouraging
employees to report any behaviours or actions that they reasonably
believe might be against accounting or regulatory requirements, as
well as our internal policies. Dedicated whistleblowing hotlines and
email addresses are in place so employees can talk about what has
happened, or is happening, directly and in confidence. The Board 
Audit Committee receives reports of instances of whistleblowing and
any resulting investigations. 
Board Audit Committee Chairman’s Statement
We had eight scheduled meetings in 2007 and the report set out
above describes in some detail how we used our meetings. Our
reviews of the control environment in each of our businesses in 2007
had a particular focus on those areas where the Group’ s business is
expanding or which are deemed to be higher risk. We also continued 
to review the controls around our key regulatory programmes, in
particular, Sarbanes-Oxley and Basel II. The second half of the year saw
significant disruption to the credit markets and we held two additional
meetings to review and consider the statements made by the Group 
on its exposures to the sub-prime market. The Committee discussed
the timing and content of the statements and the process that had
been followed to prepare the statements, including the internal reviews
conducted. We also reviewed Barclays Capital’ s control environment and
how effectively it had operated during the difficult market conditions. 
In light of market events in 2007, in February 2008 we held a separate
session for Committee members on accounting for and valuation of
derivatives and complex investment banking instruments and
subsequently considered a report reviewing the loan impairment and
mark-to-market valuations ahead of the Group’ s 2007 preliminary results.

Risk is a key parameter of Barclays business. Accordingly, the Board has
established a Board Risk Committee to provide Board level monitoring 
and oversight of all Barclays risk activities. 
The Board Risk Committee’ s terms of reference are available from 
the Corporate Governance section at: http://www.aboutbarclays.com. 
In addition to its members, all meetings are attended by the Group
Finance Director and the Barclays Risk Director. Attendees at meetings
may also include Barclays Internal Audit Director, Barclays General Counsel
and the Barclays external auditor, as well as other senior executives, who
join for specific topics. 
Approach
The Committee approaches its task primarily by:
– receiving from the Barclays Risk Director and discussing a detailed risk
report at every meeting;
– reviewing in depth specific topics or areas of risk that the Committee
identifies as meriting detailed analysis;
– reviewing stress scenarios;
– reviewing historic risk tendencies and experiences;
– monitoring risk appetite and the Group’s risk profile. The Committee
recommends to the Board each year an appropriate level and
composition of risk for the coming year.
In addition, the Committee:
– reviews the internal control framework;
– examines the risk control framework, and approves Group policies
including the trading book policy, liquidity policy, credit impairment
policy and principal risks policy; and
– receives updates on risk measurement methodologies.
Activities in 2007
The Committee requested at the end of 2006 that the US mortgage
business be reviewed early in the year as one of the key risk issues. This was
presented in March 2007 and included an analysis of stress loss scenarios
under adverse market conditions. Management took decisions during the
first half of 2007 to reduce limits in this business and, given the volatility in
the credit markets during 2007, the Committee subsequently received
regular reports on market conditions.
During 2007, the Committee also reviewed, in depth, leveraged credit 
and asset backed securities markets, including the Group’ s counterparty
exposures. It considered whether there were any signs of material
contagion in other markets in which the Group operates. The Committee
examined how the Group’ s risk controls and stress limits had operated 
in the prevailing market conditions and was satisfied that risk controls 
had operated as anticipated. The Committee reviewed the impact on
impairment and mark-to-market positions and the impact on the
Group’ s balance sheet of the market conditions. The Committee also
monitored progress in meeting the new capital regime introduced under
Basel II and continued to review the retail credit experience.
The chart below left shows how the Committee allocated its time at its
meetings in 2007. 
In March 2008, the Committee will review its activities in 2007 against
its terms of reference.
More information on risk management and the internal control framework
can be found in the Risk management report on pages 80 to 89.

The Committee received updates on:
– the status of the Companies Act 2006 and, in particular, the new
statutory statement of Directors’ Duties; and
– the FRC’s review of the Combined Code. 
During 2007, the Committee reviewed the composition of the Board 
and its principal Committees at each of its meetings. Following those
deliberations the Committee recommended to the Board the
appointments of David Booth (May 2007), Sir Michael Rake and Patience
Wheatcroft (January 2008) as non-executive Directors. In the case of
David Booth, the Committee had concluded that a non-executive Director
with US banking experience would bring the skills and experience to the
Board that had been lost on the retirement of Robert Steel as a non-
executive Director in late 2006. In the case of Sir Michael Rake, the
Committee sought a non-executive Director with a financial and auditing
background. Patience Wheatcroft has extensive experience of the highest
levels of business and politics, which will bring additional valuable skills
and a wider perspective to the Board. When considering appointments,
the Committee typically engages external search consultants, who are
provided with a specification of the skills and experience required, to assist
with identifying potential candidates, although candidates may be
recommended to the Committee from other sources. Each of David Booth,
Sir Michael Rake and Patience Wheatcroft met with members of the
Committee prior to the Committee considering their appointments and
recommendations being made to the Board. 
In January 2008, the Committee reviewed its activities in 2007 
against its terms of reference and concluded that it had discharged the
responsibilities delegated to it under those terms of reference.

The chart below shows how the Committee allocated its time at its
meetings in 2007. During 2007, the Committee:
– held discussions with external advisers to the Committee;
– reviewed executive compensation;
– considered resourcing, compensation and incentives for staff; 
– considered pensions, mobility and relocation matters; and 
– reviewed the compensation frameworks and overall level of bonus
pools for each of the Group’s principal businesses.
The Committee received updates on:
– revised ABI Guidelines on Executive Remuneration;
– talent;
– health and safety; and
– equality and diversity.
In February 2008, the Committee reviewed its activities in 2007 against its
terms of reference and concluded that it had discharged the responsibilities
delegated to it under those terms of reference.
Detailed information on the role and activities of the Committee can be
found in the Remuneration Report on pages 144 to 158.
Management
Executive Committee
The executive Directors bear the responsibility (under the leadership of the
Group Chief Executive) for making and implementing operational decisions
and running the Group’ s business. The Executive Committee supports 
the Group Chief Executive. It meets fortnightly to develop strategies and
policies to recommend to the Board and to implement approved strategy.
The Executive Committee is supported by other Committees, including
the Disclosure Committee. 
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee is chaired by Chris Lucas, the Group Finance
Director. Members include the Company Secretary, Barclays General
Counsel, Head of Investor Relations, Barclays Risk Director, Head of
Corporate Affairs, Financial Controller and Treasurer. The Committee:
– considers and reviews the preliminary and interim results, Annual
Report/ Annual Report on Form 20F and the Annual Review;
– considers Interim Management Statements released to the Stock
Exchange; and
– considers the content, accuracy and tone of any other announcement
that is proposed to be made in accordance with the FSA ’s Disclosure
and Transparency Rules.

Board Effectiveness
Performance Review
An annual evaluation of Board and Committee effectiveness is conducted,
as recommended by the Code. The evaluation in 2006 was independently
facilitated by Egon Zehnder International and comprised a questionnaire,
supplemented by individual interviews and peer reviews. The following
actions were set for 2007:
– provision of additional training on risk issues for non-executive Directors,
including specific awareness of risk management and measurement
methodologies for Board Risk Committee members; and
– continued work on Board meeting agenda management to ensure
there is time for rigorous debate and exchange of ideas.
Training on risk issues was provided in April 2007 and feedback sought
from the participants. The time allocated to Board meetings has been
increased to allow for extended debate and discussion. The Board
Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee monitored the
progress of the action plan during 2007 and are satisfied with the steps
taken to tackle the issues highlighted by the evaluation. 
The 2007 evaluation was again independently facilitated by Egon Zehnder
International. The evaluation took the form of detailed questionnaires
completed by each Director, individual interviews and peer evaluation of
fellow Directors. The results of the evaluation were presented to the Board
in February 2008 and continued to demonstrate the improving trend 
since the current process of evaluation was adopted in 2004. The Board
concluded that the Board and the principal Board Committees continue 
to operate effectively. Minor enhancements were recommended around:
– the form and content of Board papers and presentations; and
– refinement to the Board calendar of business, particularly in respect of
the timing and content of presentations on stakeholder management.
The Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee will
recommend an action plan to the Board to deliver these improvements 
in 2008.
The Group Chairman will hold private meetings with each Director to
discuss the results and to agree areas for development relating to their own
individual performance. Feedback on the Group Chairman’ s performance
was provided to the Senior Independent Director, who discussed the
results privately with the other non-executive Directors and the Group
Chief Executive before meeting with the Group Chairman. 
Training and Business Awareness
A three part training programme is in place for Directors. This comprises: 
– induction training, when they join the Board;
– training and awareness of the business of Barclays; and
– training and awareness of external technical matters.
Induction 
All new Directors receive an information pack that explains those disclosures
they are obliged to make to the Company to comply with various laws 
and regulations. A presentation is given to all new Directors, which outlines
their responsibilities as a Director of a global, listed company and provides
an overview of the Group and its businesses. Each new Director then has 
a tailored induction programme to further familiarise themselves with 
the Group and its businesses. This takes the form of sessions with each 
of the executive Directors and the heads of the main Group functions 
and includes opportunities to visit operational sites to meet with senior
management and employees. Once they have completed the first part 
of their induction, and have a good overview of the Group, they then 
have further sessions with the executive Directors and senior managers
from each of the principal business units to gain a detailed and in depth
understanding of their business, which includes the challenges,
opportunities and risks that are faced by each. Marcus Agius and David
Booth undertook their induction training in 2007. A report on the Group
Chairman’ s induction programme is set out in the panel above.

During 2007, two off-site Board meetings were held. In March, the Board
met at the New Y ork offices of Barclays Capital, where Directors were given
a tour of the site, including the trading floor, and had the opportunity to
meet with staff, senior management and major clients. In September, the
Board met at the London office of Barclays Wealth. 
National Branch Week was held in September, where over 300 senior
executives from the Group went back to the floor to find out what
successes and challenges employees in the branches are facing at the
sharp end of the business. A number of Directors participated and worked
alongside cashiers, personal bankers and co-ordinators for the day. To
keep them informed of issues relevant to front line employees and up to
date with news around the Group, Directors receive copies of The Globe,
the magazine for employees.
External matters 
Directors are regularly briefed on market opinion and receive copies 
of analyst research and press commentary. Attendance at results
presentations, analyst rehearsals and corporate governance receptions
enables Directors to meet with analysts and investors to enhance their
awareness of market sentiment and the views of major shareholders. 
External speakers were invited to brief the Board in 2007 on the global
economic outlook. All Directors were made aware in 2007 of their
responsibilities under the FSA ’ s Prospectus Rules in connection with the
proposed merger with ABN AMRO. A number of briefings were given to
the Board on the changes being introduced by the Companies Act 2006
and, in particular, the new statutory statement of Directors’ Duties, to
ensure that Directors are aware of their responsibilities. Guidance was
provided to management and to the Board on the desired content of
supporting Board and Committee papers, to ensure that Directors are
provided with sufficient information to allow them to have regard to
(amongst others) the stakeholders of the Group and the long term
consequences of any decisions they make. 
Group Chairman’ s Induction 
Since joining the Barclays Board in September 2006 and becoming
Group Chairman in January 2007, I have been involved in a wide-
ranging programme of meetings and familiarisation visits to help 
me get to know Barclays, our colleagues and customers.
The programme began in 2006, when I met with each member of the
Executive Committee and senior management across each of the
business areas and head office functions of Barclays. To broaden my
understanding of the Barclays businesses, I have this year visited Retail
Banking branches in the UK and Africa, Barclays Commercial Bank
services in Stratford and Gadbrook Park, Barclaycard in Northampton,
Barclays Capital in New Y ork, Barclays Global Investors in San Francisco,
Barclays France, Barclays Spain and the Barclays operations in Tokyo
and Singapore. 
As well as the induction meetings with senior management, I have met
with shareholders and analysts and other stakeholders to gauge their
views of Barclays and assess market opinion. 
I am also Chairman of the Board Corporate Governance and Nominations
Committee, a member of the Board HR and Remuneration Committee
and I have attended meetings of both the Board Audit and Board Risk
Committees during the year to observe at first hand how these
Committees operate and the key issues they examine.

Governance
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 143
Statement on US Corporate Governance Standards
The statement required by NYSE is set out below.
Director independence
Under the NYSE Rules the majority of the Board should be independent.
Under the Code, at least half of the Board (excluding the Chairman) is
required to be independent. The NYSE Rules contain detailed tests for
determining Director independence, whereas the Code requires the Board
to determine whether each Director is independent in character and
judgement and sets out criteria that may be relevant to that determination.
We follow the Code’ s recommendations as well as developing best
practices among other UK public companies. Our Board annually reviews
the independence of our non-executive Directors, taking into account the
guidance in the Code and the criteria we have established for determining
independence, which are described on page 136.
Board Committees
We have a Board Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and
a Board HR and Remuneration (rather than Compensation) Committee,
both of which are broadly comparable in purpose and constitution to
those required by the NYSE Rules and whose terms of reference comply
with the Code’ s requirements. Beyond the fact that the Board Corporate
Governance and Nominations Committee is chaired by the Chairman 
of the Board and that the Chairman is a member of the Board HR and
Remuneration Committee, both of which are permitted by the Code, 
both Committees are composed solely of non-executive Directors whom
the Board has determined to be independent. We follow the Code
recommendation that a majority of the Nominations Committee should
be independent non-executive Directors, whereas the NYSE Rules state
that the Committee must be composed entirely of independent Directors.
We comply with the NYSE Rules regarding the obligation to have a Board
Audit Committee that meets the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the 
US Securities Exchange Act, including the requirements relating to the
independence of Committee members. In April 2007, we made an Annual
Written Affirmation of our compliance with these requirements to the NYSE.
The Code also requires us to have a Board Audit Committee comprised
solely of independent non-executive Directors. We follow the Code
recommendations, rather than the NYSE Rules, however, regarding the
responsibilities of the Board Audit Committee, although both are broadly
comparable. We also have a Board Risk Committee, comprised of
independent non-executive Directors, which considers and discusses
policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The NYSE Rules require domestic US companies to adopt and disclose
corporate governance guidelines. There is no equivalent recommendation
in the Code. The Board Corporate Governance and Nominations
Committee has, however, developed corporate governance guidelines,
entitled Corporate Governance in Barclays, which have been approved 
and adopted by the Board.
Code of Ethics
The NYSE Rules require that domestic US companies adopt and disclose a
code of business conduct and ethics for Directors, officers and employees.
Rather than a single consolidated code as envisaged in the NYSE Rules, 
we have a number of ‘values based’ business conduct and ethics policies,
which apply to all employees. In addition, we have adopted a Code of Ethics
for the Group Chief Executive and senior financial officers as required by
the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Shareholder approval of equity-compensation plans
The NYSE listing standards require that shareholders must be given the
opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions
to those plans. We comply with UK requirements, which are similar to 
the NYSE standards. The Board, however, does not explicitly take into
consideration the NYSE’ s detailed definition of what are considered
‘material revisions’.
Relations with Shareholders
Institutional investors
The Board’ s priorities include communicating with shareholders, to keep
them well informed about the Company’ s prospects and strategy, and
staying abreast of the views of major shareholders. To achieve this,
executive Directors and senior executives hold group and one to one
meetings with major investors. Analyst research notes are distributed to
Directors and our corporate brokers provide annual feedback to the Board.
The Investor Relations team organise roadshows, seminars, conferences,
presentations and other activities that enable the Directors to interact with
investors. Prior to each AGM, the Group Chairman, Senior Independent
Director and Company Secretary have a series of meetings with the
corporate governance representatives of our major institutional shareholders. 
Private shareholders
A change in the law now allows us to communicate electronically with 
our shareholders, unless they advise us that they prefer to receive paper.
We have given shareholders a choice of how to receive shareholder
communications going forward and those that receive documents
electronically will have access to shareholder documents as soon as they
are published. These new arrangements will enable us to use less paper,
which benefits the environment and lowers distribution costs for the
Group. This year we will continue to post the Annual Review, Notice of
Shareholder Meetings and proxy forms to all shareholders.
We encourage shareholders to hold their shares in Barclays Sharestore,
where shares are held electronically in a cost-effective environment. 
Our e-view service enables shareholders to receive their shareholder
documents electronically. It also gives shareholders immediate access to
information relating to their personal shareholding and dividend history.
Participants can also change their details and dividend mandates online
and receive dividend tax vouchers electronically.
Shareholder Meetings 
The 2007 AGM was held on 26th April 2007 at the Queen Elizabeth II
Conference Centre in London. In accordance with best practice, all
resolutions were considered on a poll and the results were made available
on our website the same day. 54 percent of the shares in issue were voted
and all resolutions were approved. All Directors are encouraged to attend
the AGM and are available to answer shareholder questions. All Directors
attended the 2007 AGM, with the exception of Leigh Clifford, who, as
Chief Executive of Rio Tinto, was attending that company’ s AGM and
Board meeting in Australia on that day. 
An extraordinary general meeting (EGM) was held on 14th September 2007,
at our head office in London, where shareholders were asked to approve
resolutions in connection with the proposed merger with ABN AMRO. 
58 percent of the shares in issue were voted on a poll and all resolutions
were approved. The Group Chairman, Senior Independent Director 
and a majority of the executive Directors attended the EGM. The EGM 
was followed by a Class Meeting of ordinary shareholders, at which 
57 percent of the ordinary shares in issue were voted on a poll and the
resolution was approved. 
The 2008 AGM will be held on 24th April 2008 at the Queen Elizabeth II
Conference Centre in London. The AGM will be followed by a Class Meeting
of ordinary shareholders. The Notice of Shareholder Meetings is enclosed
with this Annual Report as a separate document. The resolutions will be
considered on a poll and the results will be available on our website on 
24th April 2008.

Remuneration report
144 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Statement from the Chairman of the Board HR and
Remuneration Committee (the Committee)
The Committee provides governance and strategic oversight of
remuneration, Barclays Human Resource activities and senior
management development. The Committee’ s terms of reference are
available in the Corporate Governance section of the Barclays Investor
Relations website (www.aboutbarclays.com).
The Committee meets a minimum of four times a year. Marcus Agius
became a member of the Committee on 1st January 2007. Marcus Agius
was considered independent (for the purposes of the Combined Code) 
on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. All other Committee
members are independent non-executive Directors.
The Committee’ s objective in relation to remuneration is to ensure that it
incentivises excellence in business and personal performance and enables
the Group to attract and retain employees of ability and experience.
The Committee aims to achieve this by:
– ensuring clear and quantified individual and Group performance goals
are in place supported by rigorous performance appraisal systems; 
– creating externally benchmarked remuneration frameworks for each
major business that provide an evidence based approach to decisions; 
– reviewing past remuneration decisions against objectives; and
– approving the specific remuneration packages of executive Directors
and other senior executives.
The Committee’ s work is supported by independent professional advice
from Kepler Associates, who were re-appointed in 2007, and Towers Perrin
MGMC who were appointed in 2007.
In relation to HR and senior management development, the Committee’ s
objective is to ensure that the Group’ s people resources are managed to
maximise business performance, support the long-term success and
growth of the business and protect the welfare of all employees.
The Committee aims to achieve this by:
– ensuring there are appropriate succession and talent management
plans in place;
– providing oversight of Group level policy on HR matters including those
related to the mobility of employees within the Group; and 
– monitoring health and safety and equality and diversity issues across
the Group.
Barclays employee remuneration is performance based. Important context
to this report and the disclosures that follow is provided below:
– Group profit before tax was £7.1bn, broadly in line with the prior year;
– Group profit before business disposals increased by 3%; and
– careful management of performance related remuneration has resulted
in a reduction in key remuneration ratios relative to 2006, including the
absorption of 2007 headcount investment.
The Committee takes seriously its commitment to clear and comprehensive
disclosure. This report details the remuneration of the individual Directors
who served Barclays in 2007. Barclays Remuneration Policy remains
unchanged, including the commitment to transparency and to policies
and programmes that serve well the interests of shareholders.
The Committee unanimously recommends that you vote to approve the
report at the 2008 AGM.

Governance
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 145
Board HR and Remuneration Committee Members
During 2007, the Committee comprised both independent non-executive
Directors and the Chairman of the Board. Membership of the Committee
was as follows:
Sir Richard Broadbent (Chairman)
Marcus Agius
Leigh Clifford 
Sir John Sunderland
The non-executive Directors who were Committee members were
considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from
any business or other relationship that could materially affect the exercise
of their independent judgement. The constitution and operation of the
Committee complies with the Provisions on the Design of Performance
Related Remuneration in the Combined Code adopted by the Financial
Reporting Council.
Marcus Agius was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect
from 1st January 2007.
The Chairman of the Committee presents a report of each meeting to the
full Board.
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee has access to independent consultants to ensure that it
receives independent advice. Advisers are appointed by the Committee for
specific work, as necessary, and are required to disclose to the Committee
any potential conflict of interest. 
In 2007, Kepler Associates
a
were re-appointed by the Committee to provide
independent advice to Committee members on remuneration matters.
Towers Perrin MGMC
a
were appointed to provide advice to the
Committee in 2007, primarily in relation to the provision of remuneration
for employees below Board level and in the global financial services
industry.
The Group Chief Executive, the Human Resources Director and, as
necessary, members of the Executive Committee, also advise the
Committee, supported by their teams. They are not permitted to
participate in discussions or decisions relating to their own remuneration.
The Human Resources Director is responsible for providing professional
support to line management in HR policy and operations and for
monitoring compliance with prescribed policy and programmes across
Barclays. The Human Resources Director is not a Board Director and is 
not appointed by the Committee.
Remuneration Policy
Barclays policy is to use remuneration to drive a high-performance culture.
Executive Directors can expect outstanding remuneration if performance
is outstanding and below median remuneration for below median
performance. This philosophy applies to remuneration policies and
practices for all employees in the Group. The Committee considers
remuneration levels across the Group when determining remuneration 
for executive Directors.
The aims of the Barclays Remuneration Policy are to:
– incentivise excellence in and balance between both short-term 
(one year) and longer-term (three years plus) performance such that
Group financial goals and the goal of achieving top quartile total
shareholder return (TSR) are met and sustained;
– enable the Group to attract and retain people of proven ability,
experience and skills in the pools in which it competes for talent;
– encourage behaviour consistent with Barclays Guiding Principles
b
which leads to excellence and the appropriate balance in financial
performance, governance, controls, risk management, customer
service, people management, brand and reputation management;
– promote attention to maximising personal contribution, contribution to
the business in which the individual works and contribution to the
Group overall; and
– ensure, both internally and externally, that remuneration policies and
programmes are transparent, well communicated, easily understood
and aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The graph below shows the value, at 31st December 2007, of £100
invested in Barclays on 31st December 2002 compared with the value 
of £100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index. The other points plotted are the
values at intervening financial year ends. The FTSE 100 Index is the index
of the 100 largest UK quoted companies by market capitalisation. It is a
widely recognised performance comparison for large UK companies such
as Barclays and this is why it has been chosen as a comparator to illustrate
Barclays TSR. The graph shows that, at the end of 2007, a hypothetical
£100 invested in Barclays on 31st December 2002 would have generated
a total return of £63, compared with a gain of £95 if invested in the FTSE
100 Index.
Remuneration for executive Directors
Remuneration for the executive Directors comprises:
– base salary;
– annual bonus including mandatory deferral into Barclays shares
through the Executive Share Award Scheme (ESAS);
– long-term incentives through the Performance Share Plan (PSP); and
– pension and other benefits.

Corporate governance
Remuneration report
The Committee reviews the elements of remuneration relative to the policies stated in this report and to the practice of other comparable organisations.
Remuneration is benchmarked against the markets in which we compete for talent. This includes benchmarking against other leading international banks
and financial services organisations, and other companies of similar size to Barclays in the FTSE 100 Index.
The component parts for each executive Director are detailed in the tables accompanying this report.
The Committee guideline that executive Directors should hold, as a minimum, the equivalent of one times their base salary in Barclays shares, including
shares held under award through ESAS, was met by all executive Directors. 
Each element of remuneration is important and has a specific role in achieving the aims of the remuneration policy. The combined potential remuneration
from bonus and PSP outweighs the other elements, and is subject to personal and Group performance, thereby placing the majority of total remuneration
at risk. 
Of the key elements of remuneration (salary, annual performance bonus, ESAS and PSP), salary made up a maximum of 30% of the 2007 remuneration
for executive Directors and 1.4% in respect of Robert E Diamond Jr’ s arrangements, which reflects general practice in the investment banking and
investment management industry. The remaining proportion of the key compensation elements for executive Directors is at risk. The relative weighting
summarised in this paragraph does not include pension and benefits.
The purpose of each element of remuneration for executive Directors is summarised in the table below and discussed in greater detail in the sections 
that follow.

Governance
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 147
Annual Bonus and ESAS 
The maximum bonus opportunity for executive Directors is tailored to the
relevant market; this is typically 250% of base salary. The annual bonus is
based on a qualitative and quantitative assessment of performance
(including EP and PBT results) with the quantitative assessment
comprising the majority. EP and PBT are considered to be good measures
of value creation for shareholders.
ESAS is a deferred share award plan which operates in conjunction with
the annual Barclays Group cash bonus plans (and various other cash 
long-term incentive plans operated by Barclays Group companies).
Currently, for executive Directors, typically 75% of the annual bonus is
delivered as cash. A recommendation may be made to the ESAS 
trustee that the remaining 25% is delivered as an award under ESAS
(‘Mandatory ESAS award’).
In addition, executive Directors may request that any cash bonus, to which
they may have otherwise become entitled, be granted as an additional
award under ESAS (‘Voluntary ESAS award’). 
Both Mandatory and Voluntary ESAS awards will normally include
additional shares called bonus shares with a value of up to 30% of the
bonus amount awarded in shares. The ESAS trustee may apply dividends
it receives on shares held in trust in purchasing additional Barclays shares
which may also be released to participants. 
A Mandatory ESAS award is a provisional allocation of Barclays shares
which does not give rise to any right or interest in those shares. Normally,
under a Mandatory ESAS award, the ESAS trustee grants participants the
right to call for the shares plus two-thirds of any bonus shares, in the form
of a nil-cost option following the third anniversary of the award date. If this
right is not exercised, the ESAS trustee may, following the fifth anniversary,
release all the Barclays shares including all bonus shares and dividend
shares to the participant.
Awards under Voluntary ESAS are granted in the form of a nil-cost option
which is a right to acquire Barclays shares which will become fully
exercisable after five years. 
Neither the exercise of nil-cost options granted under Mandatory or
Voluntary ESAS nor the release of Barclays shares under award is subject
to performance conditions. As ESAS is a deferred share award plan, it
would not be appropriate to attach a performance condition to options 
or awards.
If an executive ceases to be employed he may forfeit his award depending
on why he leaves.
PSP
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM and replaced the
ISOP as the main performance linked share incentive plan. PSP awards to
date have been granted in the form of provisional allocations of Barclays
shares which do not give a participant any right to acquire, or an interest in,
shares until such time as the PSP trustee decides to release the shares to
the participant (i.e. when the PSP awards vest). Participants do not pay 
to receive an award or to receive a release of shares. Performance share
awards are communicated to participants as an initial allocation. Normally ,
the maximum expected value of an award at the date of grant will be the
higher of 150% of base salary or 75% of base salary and target bonus.
‘Expected value’ is a single value for the award at grant which takes account
of the various possible performance and vesting outcomes, although it is
Barclays performance over a three-year period which determines the final
number of shares that may be released to participants. Dividend shares
may also be released in respect of the vested shares.
Awards normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, if and 
to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied. Note that:
– relative TSR and EP are both considered to be good measures of value
creation to shareholders;
– before any shares are released, Barclays cumulative EP over the
performance period must normally be greater than the total for the
previous three-year period; 
– for PSP awards made in 2005, the award depended on Barclays TSR
relative to a peer group of 11 other international banks. These awards are
due to lapse in 2008 as the TSR performance condition was not satisfied;
– the performance conditions for PSP awards made in 2006 and 2007
will be measured over the three-year performance period (2006 to
2008 and 2007 to 2009 respectively);
– for PSP awards made in 2006 and 2007, 50% of the award depends on
Barclays EP and 50% of the award depends on Barclays TSR relative to a
peer group of 11 other international banks; 
– for awards made in 2005, 2006 and 2007 in relation to the TSR
element of the award, there is no vesting unless Barclays is ranked
above median on relative TSR. 
The peer group for the TSR element of the 2007 award, as for the 2006
award, is

:

The performance scales for the TSR and EP elements of the 2007 award
are as shown in the two charts below: 
Notes
a The reserve companies for the 2006 and 2007 awards are UniCredit, Morgan Stanley ,
Bank of America and Wachovia.
b The Committee has approved the substitution of Banco Santander for ABN AMRO in
the TSR peer group for awards granted under the PSP in 2005, 2006 and 2007, in 
accordance with the Committee’s agreed peer group adjustment principles. 
This adjustment was made in anticipation of the takeover of ABN AMRO. 
Following a review of the peer group reserve banks, it was decided that Banco
Santander was the most suitable substitute based on both competitive position relative
to Barclays and similarity to ABN AMRO.

EP comprises profit after tax and minority interests less a capital charge.
Independent confirmation is provided to the Committee as to whether 
a performance condition has been met.
Each year a review of the Group’ s share-based long-term incentives
(currently the PSP) is undertaken to check that the structure and
performance conditions remain appropriate in respect of the Group’ s
business objectives and best market practice. The 2007 review included
consideration of eligibility criteria. The outcome of the review 
was that participation in the PSP should be restricted to executive
Directors, members of the Executive Committee, Executive Committee
direct reports and other key senior positions. Developing a link to Barclays
share price is important and therefore, as individuals below these levels
become more highly remunerated, some of their remuneration may be
delivered as an award of Barclays shares (to be known as Incentive
Shares). Participants would not be eligible for a release of shares until the
third anniversary and the release of Incentive Shares would not be subject
to performance conditions. It is intended that a new employee share plan
will be established under which Incentive Shares will be granted. No Board
Directors will be eligible to participate in this plan and awards will be settled
using only existing Barclays shares. 
ISOP
ISOP (Incentive Share Option Plan) has not been used for awards to
executive Directors since 2004. Details of ISOP awards held by executive
Directors can be found on page 157. Awards in 2003 and 2004 under ISOP
include financial metrics or thresholds which were adjusted where
necessary to neutralise the effect of the introduction of IFRS.
The main performance condition was TSR relative to a peer group of 11
other major international banks, combined with an EP threshold. Awards
have now vested, as set out in the table on page 157. 
Retained Incentive Opportunity 
Robert E Diamond Jr received an award in February 2008 under the
Retained Incentive Opportunity. This award was subject to performance
criteria based on the delivery of EP at Barclays Capital over the period 2005
to 2007. The performance measure applied was cumulative EP
performance of Barclays Capital during the period 1st January 2005 to
31st December 2007. In order to achieve the maximum value award
under the Retained Incentive Opportunity, Barclays Capital had to
successfully generate a cumulative EP of £2bn over the performance
period. EP was chosen as this is an appropriate measure to align the
interests of the participant with those of shareholders and is a good
measure of value creation for shareholders. 
Details of the award which was made to Robert E Diamond Jr are on 
page 155.
Sharesave
All eligible employees including executive Directors may participate in
Sharesave. Sharesave is an HMRC (Her Majesty’ s Revenue and Customs)
approved all-employee share option plan. HMRC does not permit
performance conditions to be attached to the exercise of Sharesave
options. Under Sharesave, participants are granted options over Barclays
shares. Each participant may save up to £250 per month to purchase
Barclays shares at a discount. For the 2007 grant, the discount was 20% of
the market value of a share at the time the option was granted. Sharesave
is also offered to employees in Spain and Ireland. Following the 2007
invitation, a total of 40,621 employees in the UK, Spain and Ireland were
participants in Sharesave with 72.4 million shares under option. Details of
options held by executive Directors are on page 156.
Sharepurchase
Sharepurchase was introduced in January 2002. It is an HMRC approved
all-employee share plan. Sharepurchase is open to all eligible employees
including executive Directors. Under Sharepurchase, participants are able
to purchase up to £1,500 worth of Barclays shares each year, which, if 
kept in trust for five years, can be withdrawn from Sharepurchase tax-free.
Any shares in Sharepurchase will earn dividends in the form of additional
shares, which must normally be held by the trustee on behalf of the
participant for no less than three years.
To encourage employee ownership of Barclays shares, Barclays matches,
share for share, up to the first £600 each participant invests in
Sharepurchase in each tax year. Matching shares must normally be held
by the trustee on behalf of the participant for no less than three years.
At 31st December 2007, 23,097 employees were participants in
Sharepurchase, with a total of 12.9 million shares held on their behalf by
the Sharepurchase trustee.
Dilution Limits
The outstanding awards under ISOP and Sharesave are intended to be
satisfied by the issue of new Barclays shares or through treasury shares
within the limits agreed by shareholders when these plans were approved.
These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers’ guidelines
restricting dilution from employee share plans. The overall limits under the
guidelines are that no more than 10% of a company’ s issued share capital
may be used in any ten-year period. Up to 5% may be used for executive
share plans. Shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited
issued as a result of option exercises under the BGI EOP also count
towards these limits. As at 31st December 2007, Barclays headroom
under these limits, i.e. the amount remaining available for issue, was 4.2%
and 1.5% respectively.
Employees’ Benefit Trusts (EBTs)
The trustees of the Barclays EBTs grant awards under ESAS and PSP 
over existing Barclays shares which they have purchased in the market.
The trustees of the Barclays EBTs have informed the Bank that their
normal policy is to abstain from voting in respect of the Barclays shares
held in trust.
The trustees of the Sharepurchase EBT may vote in respect of Barclays
shares held in the Sharepurchase EBT, but only at the direction of the
participants. The trustees will not otherwise vote in respect of shares held
in the Sharepurchase EBT.
Pensions
All Group pension arrangements are managed in accordance with the
Global Retirement Fund Governance Framework to ensure best practice 
in respect of regulatory compliance, governance, investment and
administration. The framework is overseen by the Committee.
Pension benefits for executive Directors are provided through defined
benefit plans, defined contribution plans, unfunded unapproved retirement
benefit arrangements, cash or a combination of these. The pension benefit
applicable will depend on the date an executive Director was appointed
and their individual situation. Annual performance related bonuses are not
included in pensionable salary. 
The Group’ s closed UK defined benefit pension arrangement, of which
John Varley and Gary Hoffman are members, is a non-contributory
scheme. Benefits are provided on leaving service at normal pension age
(60) by reference to the executive Director’ s length of service, normally by
reference to 1/60th of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable
service (John Varley’ s pension accrual is provided through the scheme in
accordance with his service contract as set out in the notes to the
pensions table on page 152).
The Group’ s closed UK defined benefit pension arrangement also provides
that, in the event of death before retirement, a cash lump sum of up to four
times salary is paid together with a dependant’ s pension of 50% of the
pension that would have been payable had the member remained in
active service until their normal pension age. For death in retirement, a
dependant’ s pension is payable of approximately 50% of the member’ s
pension at the date of death, not taking into account commutation of any
cash lump sum at the time of the member’ s retirement. If a member is
granted a deferred pension that has not yet come into payment, the
widow/widower receives a pension of 50% of the deferred pension
payable. Where applicable, children’ s pensions are payable, usually up to
the age of 18. Enhanced benefits may be payable if it is determined that a
member is unable to work as a result of serious ill-health.
The Group’ s US non-contributory defined benefit arrangement, of which
Robert E Diamond Jr is a member, provides a benefit at age 65 of 1/60th of
final average pensionable pay plus 0.3% of final average pensionable pay
in excess of the US Internal Revenue Service’ s covered compensation limit 2
Governance
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 149
for each year of pensionable service (up to a maximum of 30 years). In line
with current market practice, final average pay in the US includes an
element of bonus subject to overall plan limits. In the event of a member’ s
death before retirement, a spouse’ s pension of approximately 50% of the
member’ s pension had the member taken early retirement on the date of
death, is payable. On death after retirement, a spouse’ s pension of 50% of
the pension in payment is payable. In addition, enhanced benefits are
payable if the member qualifies for disability benefits. 
The US Restoration Plan, of which Robert E Diamond Jr is also a member, is
an unfunded unapproved arrangement which restores reductions in the
benefits provided through the approved US plan resulting from the
application of relevant compensation and benefit limitations under the US
Internal Revenue Code. Robert E Diamond Jr participates in this plan on
similar terms to other Barclays senior executives participating in US benefit
plans. 
Robert E Diamond Jr also participates in the Barclays Bank PLC 401K Thrift
Savings Plan and Thrift Restoration Plan on similar terms to other Barclays
senior executives in the US. 
Where appropriate, cash allowances are provided to executive Directors in
lieu of being able to join a Group pension arrangement. Chris Lucas,
Naguib Kheraj and Frits Seegers received such cash allowances in 2007.
In the event that an executive Director builds up pension benefits close to,
or in excess of, the HMRC Lifetime Allowance, the executive Director is
eligible to opt for a cash allowance instead of continued pension accrual.
The allowance given is no more than the cost of funding the existing
pension benefit. 
Service Contracts
The Group has service contracts with its executive Directors. The effective
dates of the contracts for the executive Directors who served during 2007
are shown in the table below. The service contracts do not have a fixed
term but provide for a notice period from the Group of one year and
normally for retirement at age 65, except for Naguib Kheraj who has left
the Group. The Committee’ s policy is that executive Directors’ contracts
should allow for termination with contractual notice from the Group or, in
the alternative, termination by way of payment in lieu of notice (in phased
instalments). In the event of gross misconduct, neither notice nor a
payment in lieu of notice will be given. Payments in lieu of notice are
subject to contractual mitigation.
The Committee’ s approach when considering payments in the event of
termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including
the reason for termination, contractual obligations and share and pension
plan rules.

Barclays Capital, BGI, Barclays Wealth and GRCB
The Committee has established frameworks for the governance of
remuneration in these businesses. Ranges have been set for key financial
and remuneration ratios. The Committee approves aggregate bonus and
long-term incentive expenditure, and strategic investment for new hires.
The Committee also approves individual remuneration for the members 
of the management teams, and any employee with total remuneration in
excess of £750,000.
The BGI EOP
BGI is Barclays asset management business headquartered in San
Francisco. The BGI EOP (BGI Equity Ownership Plan) was approved by
shareholders at Barclays 2000 AGM to provide the employee share
incentive arrangements required to recruit and retain the quality of senior
management and investment talent appropriate for building a global
investment management business. The BGI EOP was designed to provide
participants with a long-term equity interest in BGI to meet the
expectations of, in particular, BGI’ s key investment talent in the United
States, who could expect to participate in the equity of their employer.
Under the terms of the BGI EOP , options are granted at fair value to key BGI
employees over shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited
(BGI Holdings) within an overall cap of 20% of the issued ordinary share
capital of BGI Holdings.
All grants of options are approved by the Committee. The Committee is
also advised of option exercises and share sales by employees. Directors 
of Barclays PLC are not eligible to receive options under the BGI EOP .
In summary the BGI EOP operates as follows:
– certain key BGI employees are granted options over shares in 
BGI Holdings;
– the option exercise price is based on the fair value of a BGI Holdings
share at the date of grant determined by an independent appraiser;
– the options generally vest evenly over a three-year period and can
normally be exercised in two annual exercise windows;
– option holders are required to fund the exercise without any financial
support from any member of the Barclays Group.
Once employees become shareholders, they are subject to the Articles of
BGI Holdings under which:
– shareholders are required to hold the shares for a minimum of 355 days.
As shareholders, employees derive the full risks and rewards of
ownership, including voting rights and entitlement to any ordinary
dividends paid by BGI Holdings;
– on expiry of the minimum holding period, shareholders may, but are not
obliged to, offer their shares for sale usually during two annual sales
windows;
– Barclays Bank PLC, at its discretion, has a right to purchase shares so
offered, but is not obliged to do so.
Notes
a Details of executive Directors standing for re-election at the 2008 AGM are set out on
page 130.
b Notice period from Barclays to executive Director .
c One year’s contractual remuneration is calculated as follows: 12 months’ base salary ,
bonus, if eligible (being the average of the previous three years’ bonus awards, in some
cases (Gary Hoffman, Chris Lucas and Naguib Kheraj) capped at 100% of base salary),
medical benefit (while an employee) and continuation of pension benefits. Payments 
in lieu of notice are subject to mitigation if alternative employment is found during any
period in which pay in lieu of notice is paid.

Remuneration report
150 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
The table below contains information on the number of shares in BGI
Holdings over which options were granted, outstanding and exercised in
2006 and 2007:
Number Number
granted outstanding Number
during year at year end exercised
Year (000s) (000s) (000s)
2006 3,973 6,929 2,188
2007 2,599 7,502 1,632
In 2007 BGI employees exercised options over 1.6m (2006: 2.2m) shares
for consideration of £57m (2006: £44m); Barclays Bank PLC purchased
4.9m (2006: 4.9m) shares offered for sale by shareholders for consideration
of £488m (2006: £410m). As at 31st December 2007, employees own
5.9% of BGI Holdings (2006: 9.4%). 
BGI EOP – Accounting and disclosure
The BGI EOP is accounted for as an equity settled share-based payment 
in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. The fair value of the
services received from the employees is measured by reference to the fair
value of the share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost of 
the employee services received in respect of the share options granted is
recognised in the income statement over the period that the services are
received. The cost for 2007 of £54.8m (2006: £37.4m, 2005: £14.9m) is
included in staff costs in Note 8 to the accounts. In accordance with IFRS 2,
details of share options granted and exercised, together with weighted
average fair values at grant date and weighted average exercise prices are
set out in Note 44 to the accounts. In accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings 
per Share’, unexercised options are taken into account in the calculation 
of diluted earnings per share as set out in Note 11 to the accounts.
For Group reporting, the exercise of options by employees is treated as a
deemed disposal of interests in a subsidiary, as its holding in the subsidiary
has been reduced for the consideration represented by the exercise price.
Any subsequent purchase of shares offered for sale by employees is
treated as a purchase of an additional investment in a subsidiary entity.
The cash flows relating to these capital transactions are included in the
consolidated cash flow statement and disclosed, along with other disposals
and acquisitions, in Note 38 to the accounts and related movements in
goodwill and minority interests are included in Notes 21 and 33 to the
accounts respectively.
Replacement of the BGI EOP
The Group will introduce a new BGI employee share plan in 2008, under
which awards will be made using Barclays PLC shares purchased in the
market. The quantum of awards will be linked to BGI business performance.
Executive Directors will not be eligible to participate in the new BGI plan.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the BGI EOP
and that the BGI EOP will not be renewed in 2010 when it comes to the
end of its life.
Non-executive Directors
The Board determines the fees of non-executive Directors and the fees 
are reviewed annually. The fee structure as at 31st December 2007 is
shown below.
Base fee £65,000
Plus:
Chairman of Board Audit Committee £50,000
Chairman of the Board HR and Remuneration Committee £40,000

base fee of £65,000 is used to buy Barclays shares. These shares, together
with reinvested dividends, are retained on behalf of the non-executive
Directors until they retire from the Board. They are included in the table of
Directors’ interests in Barclays shares on page 158. Non-executive Directors
do not receive awards under share plans for employees, nor do they
accrue pension benefits from Barclays for their non-executive services. 
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but each has a
letter of appointment. For each non-executive Director who served during
2007, the effective date of their appointment, notice period and the Group’ s
liability in the event of early termination are shown in the following table.

Notes 
a Pension accrued during the year represents the change in accrued pension (including
inflation at the prescribed rate of 3.9%) which occurred during the entire year. The
pensions paid from the final salary section of the applicable pension fund are reviewed
annually . Pensions increase by a minimum of the increase in the retail prices index (up to
a maximum of 5%), subject to the scheme rules.
b The transfer values have been calculated in a manner consistent with the Retirement
Benefit Scheme – Transfer Values (GN11) published by the Institute of Actuaries and the
Faculty of Actuaries.
c With the exception of the benefits provided through the US Restoration Plan for Robert E
Diamond Jr , the pension benefits for all Directors shown above are provided for on a
funded basis.

a The performance conditions for the 2005 awards were not met and all awards are due
to lapse in 2008.
b In respect of John Varley , Robert E Diamond Jr , Gary Hoffman and Frits Seegers, the price
used to convert the present fair value of the award to a number of shares was £7.33. 
This was the average over the period 20th February 2007 to 13th March 2007. In respect
of Chris Lucas, the price used to convert the present fair value of the award to a number
of shares was £7.23, which was the price at which shares were purchased in the market
to fund the award.
c The price shown is the mid-market closing price on the date of the award.
d The details of the performance conditions for PSP are included on page 147. 
e Figures shown in the column ‘Shares under initial allocation at 1st January 2007’ for 
Chris Lucas are as at date of joining. Nothing was paid by the participants on the grant 
of awards.
f Robert E Diamond Jr’s award under the Retained lncentive Opportunity reached the end
of its performance period on 31st December 2007. Barclays Capital’s cumulative EP
over the three-year performance period, which started on 1st January 2005, exceeded
the £2bn threshold for the maximum potential value to vest in accordance with the
terms of the award. This resulted in a vesting in February 2008 to the value of
£14,850,000 with 50% payable in cash and the remaining 50% as a recommendation 
to the trustee of ESAS for an award of Barclays shares in the form of a provisional
allocation. Any shares under the ESAS award would be releasable after 12 months from
the award date. Bonus shares are not applicable to this award. Corporate governance

Notes
a Under ESOS, options granted (at market value) to executives were exercisable only if 
the growth in Barclays earnings per share over the three-year period was at least equal
to the percentage increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 6% over the same period.
The performance condition for the 1999 ESOS grant was met.
b Under ISOP , executives were awarded options (at market value) over Barclays shares
which are normally exercisable after three years. The number of shares over which
options can be exercised depends upon performance against specific performance
conditions. For ISOP awards granted in 2000 to 2003, the first 40,000 target shares
under option for each award was subject to an EP performance condition, tested over 
a period of three years. Any amount over 40,000 target shares was subject to a relative
TSR performance condition, to be tested initially over three years. Because the TSR
performance condition was not met over three years in relation to the awards in 2003,
the TSR condition was tested over a period of four years from the original start date.
Awards in 2004 were subject to a relative TSR performance condition. For the 2003 
and 2004 grants under ISOP , which became exercisable in 2007, Barclays was ranked
6th in the peer group under the TSR performance condition. This was sufficient for only
25% of the maximum number of shares under the TSR condition to vest. The remaining
75% lapsed. 
c Robert E Diamond Jr received a grant under the BGI EOP in March 2004. He was not a
Director of Barclays PLC at that time. The BGI EOP is an option plan, approved by
shareholders in 2000 and offered predominantly to participants in the US. Under the BGI
EOP , participants receive an option to purchase shares in Barclays Global Investors UK
Holdings Limited. The exercise price is based on the fair value at the time of grant. The
option normally vests in three equal tranches on the first, second, and third anniversary
of the date of grant. Participants must, in accordance with the Articles of Association of
Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited, keep their shares for 355 days after the
date of exercise, before they may be offered for sale. In line with market practice, the
options were not subject to performance conditions. Robert E Diamond Jr is not eligible
to receive further awards under the BGI EOP . The shares shown in respect of the BGI EOP
in the above table are shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited. 
d Frits Seegers was appointed as an executive Director on 10th July 2006, and Chris Lucas
on 1st April 2007, and therefore no participation in the above plans has been offered 
to them.

Going concern
The Directors confirm they are satisfied that the Company and the Group
have adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the ‘going concern’ basis 
for preparing the accounts.
Internal control
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that management maintain
an effective system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Throughout the year ended 31st December 2007, and to date, the Group
has operated a system of internal control which provides reasonable
assurance of effective and efficient operations covering all controls,
including financial and operational controls and compliance with laws
and regulations. Processes are in place for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks facing the Group in accordance with the
guidance ‘Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’
published by the Financial Reporting Council. The Board regularly reviews
these processes through the Board Committees. 
The Directors review the effectiveness of the system of internal control
semi-annually. An internal control compliance certification process 
is conducted throughout the Group in support of this review. The
effectiveness of controls is periodically reviewed within the business areas.
Regular reports are made to the Board Audit Committee by management,
Internal Audit and the compliance and legal functions covering particularly
financial controls, compliance and operational controls. The Board Audit
Committee monitors resolution of any identified control issues of Group
level significance through to a satisfactory conclusion.
The Group Internal Control and Assurance Framework (GICAF) describes
the Group’ s approach to internal control and details Group policies and
processes. The GICAF is reviewed and approved on behalf of the Group
Chief Executive by the Group Governance and Control Committee. 
Quarterly risk reports are made to the Board covering risks of Group
significance including credit risk, market risk and operational risk,
including legal and compliance risk. Reports covering risk measurement
standards and risk appetite are made to the Board Risk Committee.
Further details of risk management procedures are given in the Risk
management section on pages 80 to 112.
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
The management of Barclays PLC is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Barclays
PLC’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under
the supervision of Barclays PLC’ s principal executive and principal financial
officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and published by
the International Accounting Standards Board.
Barclays PLC’ s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRSs and
that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorisations of management and the Directors of Barclays PLC; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of Barclays PLC’ s assets that
could have a material effect on Barclays PLC’ s financial statements. 
Internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
Management has assessed the effectiveness of Barclays PLC’ s internal
control over financial reporting as of 31st December 2007. In making 
its assessment, management has utilised the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Management concluded that
based on its assessment, Barclays PLC’ s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of 31st December 2007. 
The system of internal financial and operational controls is also subject 
to regulatory oversight in the United Kingdom and overseas. Further
information on supervision by the financial services regulators is provided
under Supervision and Regulation in the Risk management section on
page 126.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for accounts
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the
Auditors’ report set out on page 163, is made with a view to distinguishing
for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the
auditors in relation to the accounts.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare accounts
for each financial year and, with regards to Group accounts, in accordance
with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The Directors have prepared individual
accounts in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
The accounts are required by law and IFRSs to present fairly the financial
position of the Company and the Group and the performance for that
period; the Companies Act 1985 provides, in relation to such accounts,
that references in the relevant part of the law to accounts giving a true 
and fair view are references, to their achieving fair presentation.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts on pages 165 to
265, and the additional information contained on pages 266 to 289, the
Group has used appropriate accounting policies, supported by reasonable
judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they
consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company and the
Group keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy
the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable
them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. Corporate governance
Accountability and audit
160 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Disclosure controls and procedures
The Group Chief Executive, John Varley, and the Group Finance Director,
Chris Lucas, conducted with Group Management an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Group’ s disclosure controls
and procedures as at 31st December 2007, which are defined as those
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the US Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarised and reported within the
time periods specified in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’ s
rules and forms. As of the date of the evaluation, the Group Chief Executive
and Group Finance Director concluded that the design and operation of
these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The Group Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director also concluded that no significant
changes were made in our internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect these controls subsequent to their evaluation.

Independent Auditors’ report
UK Audit Report of the Independent Auditors 
to the members of Barclays PLC 
We have audited the Group and Parent company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’) of Barclays PLC (the ‘Company’) for the year
ended 31st December 2007 which comprise the Consolidated and Parent
company income statements, Consolidated and Parent company 
balance sheets, Consolidated and Parent company cash flow statements,
Consolidated and Parent company statements of recognised income 
and expense and the related notes in the section headed Notes to the
accounts. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out in the section headed Accounting policies. 
We have also audited the information in the Remuneration report that 
is described as having been audited (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities
for the accounts within the section headed Accountability and audit. 
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only
for the Company’ s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving
this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration report have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report 
is consistent with the financial statements. In addition, we report to you 
if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, 
if we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance report reflects the
Company’ s and Group’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the board’ s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’ s or Group’ s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Chairman’ s statement, Group Chief
Executive’ s review, Financial review, Risk management, Directors’ report,
Corporate governance report, the unaudited part of the Remuneration
report, Accountability and audit and Presentation of information. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the
Remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’ s and Company’ s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration report are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy 
of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Remuneration report.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s
and the Parent company’s affairs as at 31st December 2007 and of the
Group’s and the Parent company’s profit and cash flows for the year
then ended;
– the financial statements and the auditable part of the Remuneration
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation; and
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
financial statements.

Notes
a The maintenance and integrity of the Barclays PLC website is the responsibility of the
Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these
matters and, accordingly , the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may
have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the
website.
b Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Barclays PLC
In our opinion, the accompanying Consolidated income statements and
the related Consolidated balance sheets, Consolidated statements of
recognised income and expense and, Consolidated statements of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Barclays PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries at 31st December 2007
and 31st December 2006 and the results of their operations and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31st December 2007,
in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also, in our
opinion the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of 31st December 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued 
by the COSO. The Company’ s management are responsible for these
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in ‘Management’ s report 
on internal control over financial reporting’ in the section headed
Accountability and audit. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements and on the Company’ s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits which were integrated in 2007 and 2006.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates 
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’ s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management
and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 165
Significant Accounting Policies
1. Reporting entity
These financial statements are prepared for the Barclays PLC Group
(‘Barclays’ or ‘the Group’) under Section 227(2) of the Companies Act
1985. The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged 
in retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking, 
wealth management and investment management services. In addition,
individual financial statements have been prepared for the holding
company, Barclays PLC (‘the Company’), under Section 226(2)(b) 
of the Companies Act 1985.
Barclays PLC is a public limited company, incorporated in Great Britain 
and having a registered office in England.
2. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of the Barclays PLC Group, and 
the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They are also in accordance with
IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’ and an amendment to IAS 1
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ on capital disclosures were
implemented in 2007, resulting in new or revised disclosures.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied.
3. Basis of preparation
The consolidated and individual financial statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation
of certain financial instruments and contracts to buy or sell non-financial
items and trading inventories to the extent required or permitted under
accounting standards and as set out in the relevant accounting polices.
They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling (£m), the currency of the
country in which Barclays PLC is incorporated.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the
accounting policies. The notes to the financial statements set out areas
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where
assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial
statements such as fair value of financial instruments (Note 49), allowance
for impairment (Note 47), goodwill (Note 21), intangible assets (Note 22),
and retirement benefit obligations (Note 30).
4. Consolidation 
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements
of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries, including certain special purpose
entities (SPEs) where appropriate, made up to 31st December. Entities
qualify as subsidiaries where the Group has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from
its activities, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one
half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing
whether the Group controls another entity. Details of the principal
subsidiaries are given in Note 40. 
SPEs are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between
the Group and that entity indicates control. Potential indicators of control,
as set out in SIC 12 ‘Consideration – Special Purpose Entities’, include,
amongst others, an assessment of the Group’ s exposure to the risks and
benefits of the SPE.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the 
purchase of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the 
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed, plus any costs directly related to the acquisition. 
The excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Group’ s share of the fair
value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. See
accounting policy 14 for the accounting policy for goodwill. Intra-group
transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent
accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of 
the consolidation.
As the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where a
Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption 
of Regulation 7 of the Partnerships and Unlimited Companies (Accounts)
Regulations 1993 with regard to the preparation and filing of individual
partnership financial statements.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, 
but not control, over the operating and financial management policy
decisions. This is generally demonstrated by the Group holding in 
excess of 20%, but no more than 50%, of the voting rights.
A joint venture exists where the Group has a contractual arrangement 
with one or more parties to undertake activities typically, though not
necessarily, through entities which are subject to joint control. 
Unless designated as at fair value through profit and loss as set out in
policy 7, the Group’ s investments in associates and joint ventures are
initially recorded at cost and increased (or decreased) each year by the
Group’ s share of the post-acquisition profit (or loss), or other movements
reflected directly in the equity of the associated or jointly controlled entity.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate or joint venture is
included in the carrying amount of the investment (net of any accumulated
impairment loss). When the Group’ s share of losses in an associate or joint
venture equals or exceeds the recorded interest, including any other
unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless
it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the entity.
The Group’ s share of the results of associates and joint ventures is based
on financial statements made up to a date not earlier than three months
before the balance sheet date, adjusted to conform with the accounting
polices of the Group. Unrealised gains on transactions are eliminated to
the extent of the Group’ s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment in the
asset transferred.
In the individual financial statements, investments in subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment, if any. 
5. Foreign currency translation
The consolidated and individual financial statements are presented in
Sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’ s entities
are measured using their functional currency, being the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rate prevailing at the period end. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the retranslation and settlement of these
items are recognised in the income statement except for qualifying cash
flow hedges or hedges of net investments. See policy 12 for the policies 
on hedge accounting.
Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using
the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Exchange
differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value
through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on equities classified as available for sale financial
assets and non-monetary items are included directly in equity. Commitment fees, together with related direct costs, for loan facilities
where draw down is probable are deferred and recognised as an
adjustment to the effective interest on the loan once drawn. Commitment
fees in relation to facilities where draw down is not probable are
recognised over the term of the commitment. 
Insurance premiums
Insurance premiums are recognised in the period earned.
Net trading income
Income arises from the margins which are achieved through market-
making and customer business and from changes in market value caused
by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other
market variables. Trading positions are held at fair value and the resulting
gains and losses are included in the income statement, together with
interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and funding
costs relating to trading activities. 
Dividends from subsidiaries
In the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, dividends from
subsidiaries are accounted for on the basis of dividends received in the
accounting period.
7. Financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss; loans and
receivables; held to maturity investments and available for sale financial
assets. Management determines the classification of financial assets and
liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
Financial instruments are classified in this category if they are held for
trading, or if they are designated by management under the fair value
option. Instruments are classified as held for trading if they are:
(i) acquired principally for the purposes of selling or repurchasing in the
near term;
(ii) part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed
together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of
short-term profit-taking; or
(iii) a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee
contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument.
Financial instruments cannot be transferred into or out of this category
after inception. Financial instruments included in this category are
recognised initially at fair value and transaction costs are taken directly to
the income statement. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value
are included directly in the income statement. The instruments are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the
Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
and the transfer qualifies for derecognition.
Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments held for trading
or designated under the fair value option are recognised on trade date,
being the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
The fair value option is used in the following circumstances:
(i) financial assets backing insurance contracts and financial assets
backing investment contracts are designated at fair value through
profit or loss because the related liabilities have cash flows that are
contractually based on the performance of the assets or the related
liabilities are insurance contracts whose measurement incorporates
current information. Fair valuing the assets through profit and loss
significantly reduces the recognition inconsistencies that would arise 
if the financial assets were classified as available for sale;
Consolidated accounts Barclays PLC
Accounting policies
166 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
For the purposes of translation into the presentational currency, assets,
liabilities and equity of foreign operations are translated at the closing 
rate, and items of income and expense are translated into Sterling at 
the rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions, or average rates 
of exchange where these approximate to actual rates. 
The exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation
are included in cumulative translation reserves within shareholders’ 
equity and included in the profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal 
of the operation. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign
subsidiaries are maintained in the functional currency of the foreign
operation, translated at the closing rate and are included in hedges of net
investments where appropriate.
On transition to IFRS, the Group brought forward a nil opening balance on
the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment arising from the
retranslation of foreign operations, which is shown as a separate item in
shareholders’ equity.
6. Interest, fees and commissions
Interest
Interest is recognised in interest income and interest expense in the
income statement for all interest bearing financial instruments classified
as held to maturity, available for sale or other loans and receivables using
the effective interest method. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised
cost of a financial asset or liability (or group of assets and liabilities) and of
allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the expected
future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial
instrument, or when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying
amount of the instrument. The application of the method has the effect 
of recognising income (and expense) receivable (or payable) on the
instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over the
period to maturity or repayment. 
In calculating effective interest, the Group estimates cash flows (using
projections based on its experience of customers’ behaviour) considering
all contractual terms of the financial instrument but excluding future credit
losses. Fees, including those for early redemption, are included in the
calculation to the extent that they can be measured and are considered to
be an integral part of the effective interest rate. Cash flows arising from the
direct and incremental costs of issuing financial instruments are also taken
into account in the calculation. Where it is not possible to otherwise
estimate reliably the cash flows or the expected life of a financial
instrument, effective interest is calculated by reference to the payments 
or receipts specified in the contract, and the full contractual term.
Fees and commissions 
Unless included in the effective interest calculation, fees and commissions
are recognised on an accruals basis as the service is provided. Fees and
commissions not integral to effective interest arising from negotiating, or
participating in the negotiation of a transaction from a third party, such as
the acquisition of loans, shares or other securities or the purchase or sale
of businesses, are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction.
Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised
based on the applicable service contracts. Asset management fees related
to investment funds are recognised over the period the service is provided.
The same principle is applied to the recognition of income from wealth
management, financial planning and custody services that are
continuously provided over an extended period of time. 3
Financial statements
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 167
(ii) financial assets, loans to customers, financial liabilities, financial
guarantees and structured notes may be designated at fair value
through profit or loss if they contain substantive embedded derivatives;
(iii)financial assets, loans to customers, financial liabilities, financial
guarantees and structured notes may be designated at fair value
through profit or loss where doing so significantly reduces
measurement inconsistencies that would arise if the related
derivatives were treated as held for trading and the underlying
financial instruments were carried at amortised cost; and
(iv)certain private equity and other investments that are managed, and
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk
management or investment strategy and reported to key
management personnel on that basis.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and which
are not classified as available for sale. Loans and receivables are initially
recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
They are subsequently valued at amortised cost, using the effective
interest method (see accounting policy 6). They are derecognised when
the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the Group has transferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Regular way purchases and sales of loans and receivables are recognised
on contractual settlement.
Held to maturity
Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that the Group’ s management has the
intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are initially recognised at 
fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs. They are
subsequently valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest
method (see accounting policy 6). They are derecognised when the 
rights to receive cash flows have expired.
Regular way purchases of held to maturity financial assets are recognised
on trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase
the asset.
Available for sale
Available for sale assets are non-derivative financial assets that are
designated as available for sale and are not categorised into any of the
other categories described above. They are initially recognised at fair value
including direct and incremental transaction costs. They are subsequently
held at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are
included as a separate component of equity until sale when the
cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement. Interest
determined using the effective interest method (see accounting policy 6),
impairment losses and translation differences on monetary items are
recognised in the income statement. The assets are derecognised when
the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the Group has transferred
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Regular way purchases and sales of available for sale financial instruments
are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Group commits
to purchase or sell the asset.
Embedded derivatives
Some hybrid contracts contain both a derivative and a non-derivative
component. In such cases, the derivative component is termed an
embedded derivative. Where the economic characteristics and risks of the
embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contract,
and the host contract itself is not carried at fair value through profit or loss,
the embedded derivative is bifurcated and reported at fair value with gains
and losses being recognised in the income statement. 
Profits or losses cannot be recognised on the initial recognition of
embedded derivatives unless the host contract is also carried at fair value.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading
liabilities and liabilities designated at fair value, which are held at fair 
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are derecognised when
extinguished.
Determining fair value
Where the classification of a financial instrument requires it to be stated 
at fair value, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price
for that instrument or by using a valuation model. Where the fair value is
calculated using financial markets pricing models, the methodology is to
calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific
contract and then discount these values back to a present value. These
models use as their basis independently sourced market parameters
including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities
prices, option volatilities and currency rates. For financial liabilities
measured at fair value, the carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the effect
on fair value of changes in own credit spreads. Most market parameters
are either directly observable or are implied from instrument prices. 
The model may perform numerical procedures in the pricing such as
interpolation when input values do not directly correspond to the most
actively traded market trade parameters. However, where valuations
include significant unobservable inputs, the transaction price is deemed to
provide the best evidence of initial fair value for accounting purposes. As
such, profits or losses are recognised upon trade inception only when such
profits can be measured solely by reference to observable market data.
The difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction
price is recognised in profit or loss:
a) on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction, or over the
period until all model inputs will become observable where
appropriate, or;
b) released in full where previously unobservable inputs become
observable.
Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these
may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include
for example, the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of
product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the market
place, the maturity of market modelling, the nature of the transaction
(bespoke or generic). To the extent that valuation is based on models 
or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair
value can be more subjective, dependant on the significance of the
unobservable input to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are
determined based on the best information available, for example by
reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical
techniques.
8. Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective
evidence that loans and receivables or available for sale financial
investments are impaired. These are impaired and impairment losses are
incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result
of one or more loss events that occurred after the initial recognition of the
asset and prior to the balance sheet date (‘a loss event’) and that loss
event or events has had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of
the financial asset or the portfolio that can be reliably estimated. The
criteria that the Group uses to determine that there is objective evidence
of an impairment loss include:
a) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor; 
b) a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or
principal payments;
c) the lender, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’ s
financial difficulty, granting to the borrower a concession that the
lender would not otherwise consider;
d) it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other
financial reorganisation;
e) the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because
of financial difficulties; or f) observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in 
the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of financial assets
since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease
cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the
portfolio, including:
(i) adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in 
the portfolio;
(ii) national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults
on the assets in the portfolio.
For loans and receivables the Group first assesses whether objective
evidence of impairment exists individually for loans and receivables that
are individually significant, and individually or collectively for loans and
receivables that are not individually significant. If the Group determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually
assessed loan and receivable, whether significant or not, it includes 
the asset in a group of loans and receivables with similar credit risk
characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Loans 
and receivables that are individually assessed for impairment and 
for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not
included in a collective assessment of impairment.
The amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’ s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows discounted at the asset’ s original effective interest rate. The amount
of the loss is recognised using an allowance account and recognised in the
income statement.
The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of 
a collateralised loan and receivable asset reflect the cash flows that may
result from foreclosure costs for obtaining and selling the collateral,
whether or not foreclosure is probable.
For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, loans and
receivables are grouped on the basis of similar risk characteristics, taking
into account asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type,
past-due status and other relevant factors. These characteristics are
relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets 
by being indicative of the counterparty’ s ability to pay all amounts due
according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Future cash flows in a group of loans and receivables that are collectively
evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of the contractual
cash flows of the assets in the group and historical loss experience for
assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group.
Historical loss experience is adjusted based on current observable data 
to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect the period 
on which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the effects
of conditions in the historical period that do not currently exist.
The methodology and assumptions used for estimating future cash flows
are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates
and actual loss experience.
Following impairment, interest income is recognised using the original
effective rate of interest which was used to discount the future cash flows
for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
When a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related allowance
for loan impairment. Such loans are written off after all the necessary
procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been
determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off
are credited to the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
reversed by adjusting the allowance account. The amount of the reversal 
is recognised in the income statement.
Equity securities acquired in exchange for loans in order to achieve 
an orderly realisation are accounted for as a disposal of the loan and 
an acquisition of equity securities. Where control is obtained over 
an entity as a result of the transaction, the entity is consolidated. Any
further impairment of the assets or business acquired is treated as an
impairment of the relevant asset or business and not as an impairment 
of the original instrument.
In the case of available for sale financial investments, a significant 
or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also
considered in determining whether impairment exists. Where such
evidence exists, the cumulative net loss that has been previously
recognised directly in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the
income statement. In the case of debt instruments classified as available
for sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria as all other
financial assets. Reversals of impairment of debt instruments are
recognised in the income statement. Reversals of impairment of equity
shares are not recognised in the income statement, increases in the fair
value of equity shares after impairment are recognised directly in equity.
9. Sale and repurchase agreements (including stock borrowing 
and lending)
Securities may be lent or sold subject to a commitment to repurchase
them (a ‘repo’). Such securities are retained on the balance sheet when
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group,
and the counterparty liability is included separately on the balance sheet
as appropriate.
Similarly, where the Group borrows or purchases securities subject to 
a commitment to resell them (a ‘reverse repo’) but does not acquire 
the risks and rewards of ownership, the transactions are treated as
collateralised loans, and the securities are not included in the 
balance sheet.
The difference between sale and repurchase price is accrued over the life
of the agreements using the effective interest method. Securities lent to
counterparties are also retained in the financial statements. Securities
borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these 
are sold to third parties, at which point the obligation to repurchase 
the securities is recorded as a trading liability at fair value and any
subsequent gain or loss included in net trading income.
10. Securitisation transactions
Certain Group undertakings have issued debt securities or have entered
into funding arrangements with lenders in order to finance specific loans
and advances to customers. 
All financial assets continue to be held on the Group balance sheet, and a
liability recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction, unless:
(i) substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the financial
instruments have been transferred, in which case, the assets are
derecognised in full; or
(ii) if a significant portion, but not all, of the risks and rewards have been
transferred, the asset is derecognised entirely if the transferee has the
ability to sell the financial asset, otherwise the asset continues to be
recognised only to the extent of the Group’ s continuing involvement. 
Where (i) or (ii) above applies to a fully proportionate share of all or
specifically identified cash flows, the relevant accounting treatment 
is applied to that proportion of the asset.

11. Collateral and netting
The Group enters into master agreements with counterparties whenever
possible and, when appropriate, obtains collateral. Master agreements
provide that, if an event of default occurs, all outstanding transactions
with the counterparty will fall due and all amounts outstanding will be
settled on a net basis. 
Collateral
The Group obtains collateral in respect of customer liabilities where this 
is considered appropriate. The collateral normally takes the form of a lien
over the customer’ s assets and gives the Group a claim on these assets 
for both existing and future liabilities.
The Group also receives collateral in the form of cash or securities in
respect of other credit instruments, such as stock borrowing contracts,
and derivative contracts in order to reduce credit risk. Collateral received 
in the form of securities is not recorded on the balance sheet. Collateral
received in the form of cash is recorded on the balance sheet with a
corresponding liability. These items are assigned to deposits received from
bank or other counterparties. Any interest payable or receivable arising is
recorded as interest expense or interest income respectively except for
funding costs relating to trading activities which are recorded in net
trading income.
Netting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported 
in the balance sheet if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to 
set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis, or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. In many
cases, even though master netting agreements are in place, the lack of an
intention to settle on a net basis results in the related assets and liabilities
being presented gross in the balance sheet.
12. Hedge accounting
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, and
equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house price
indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions. 
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when
transactions meet the criteria specified in IAS 39, the Group applies 
fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging 
of a net investment in a foreign operation as appropriate to the risks 
being hedged.
When a financial instrument is designated as a hedge, the Group formally
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged
item as well as its risk management objectives and its strategy for
undertaking the various hedging transactions. The Group also documents
its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. 
The Group discontinues hedge accounting when:
(i) It is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly
effective as a hedge; 
(ii) the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; 
(iii)the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; or 
(iv)a forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable. 
In certain circumstances, the Group may decide to cease hedge accounting
even though the hedge relationship continues to be highly effective by 
no longer designating the financial instrument as a hedging instrument.
To the extent that the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative
differ from changes in the fair value of the hedged risk in the hedged item;
or the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging derivative differs
from the cumulative change in the fair value of expected future cash flows
of the hedged item, the hedge is deemed to include ineffectiveness. The
amount of ineffectiveness, provided it is not so great as to disqualify the
entire hedge for hedge accounting, is recorded in the income statement.
Fair value hedge accounting
Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as 
fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with
changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are
attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, it is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, 
the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income
statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge
relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated 
with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially 
in shareholders’ equity, and recycled to the income statement in the
periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any ineffective
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the
income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when
the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or
loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the
income statement.
Hedges of net investments
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items
that are accounted for as part of the net investment, are accounted for
similarly to cash flow hedges; the effective portion of the gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. The cumulative
gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income
statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.
Hedges of net investments may include non-derivative liabilities as well as
derivative financial instruments although for a non-derivative liability only
the foreign exchange risk is designated as a hedge.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Derivative contracts entered into as economic hedges that do not qualify
for hedge accounting are held at fair value through profit or loss. 
13. Property, plant and equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and provisions for impairment, if any. Additions and subsequent
expenditures are capitalised only to the extent that they enhance the
future economic benefits expected to be derived from the assets.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property
and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
economic lives. The depreciable amount is the gross carrying amount, 
less the estimated residual value at the end of its useful economic life.  The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation:
Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property
(more than 50 years to run) 2-3.3%
Leasehold property Over the remaining
(less than 50 years to run) life of the lease
Costs of adaptation of freehold and 
leasehold property
a
7-10%
Equipment installed in freehold and
leasehold property
a
7-10%
Computers and similar equipment 20-33%
Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 10-20%
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the
calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment 
are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances. 
When deciding on depreciation rates and methods, the principal factors
the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological
developments and expected market requirements for, and the expected
pattern of usage of, the assets. When reviewing residual values, the Group
estimates the amount that it would currently obtain for the disposal of the
asset after deducting the estimated cost of disposal if the asset were
already of the age and condition expected at the end of its useful
economic life. 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land, although, in common with all
long-lived assets, it is subject to impairment testing, if deemed appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds
with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
14. Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated entities
and joint ventures, and represents the excess of the fair value of the
purchase consideration and direct costs of making the acquisition, over
the fair value of the Group’ s share of the assets acquired, and the liabilities
and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition. 
For the purpose of calculating goodwill, fair values of acquired assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to market
values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. This
discounting is either performed using market rates or by using risk-free
rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows. Goodwill is capitalised
and reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are
indications that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Goodwill on
acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the amount of
the investment. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the
carrying amount of the goodwill relating to the entity sold.
The carrying amount of goodwill in the UK GAAP balance sheet as at 
31st December 2003 has been brought forward without adjustment on
transition to IFRSs.
Computer software
Computer software is stated at cost, less amortisation and provisions for
impairment, if any. 
The identifiable and directly associated external and internal costs of
acquiring and developing software are capitalised where the software is
controlled by the Group, and where it is probable that future economic
benefits that exceed its cost will flow from its use over more than one year.
Costs associated with maintaining software are recognised as an expense
when incurred.
Capitalised computer software is amortised over three to five years.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets consist of brands, customer lists, licences and
other contracts, core deposit intangibles, mortgage servicing rights and
customer relationships. Other intangible assets are initially recognised
when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, 
the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets 
not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future
economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use. The
value of intangible assets which are acquired in a business combination is
generally determined using income approach methodologies such as the
discounted cash flow method and the relief from royalty method that
estimate net cash flows attributable to an asset over its economic life and
discount to present value using an appropriate rate of return based on the
cost of equity adjusted for risk. 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation and provisions
for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner
that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows,
generally over 4-25 years. 
15. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, or more frequently where events or changes 
in circumstances dictate, property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets, are assessed for indications of impairment. If indications are
present, these assets are subject to an impairment review. Goodwill is
subject to an impairment review as at the balance sheet date each year.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount 
of the asset with its recoverable amount: the higher of the asset’ s or the
cash-generating unit’ s net selling price and its value in use. Net selling
price is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be
disposed of in a binding sale agreement in an arms-length transaction
evidenced by an active market or recent transactions for similar assets.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows
obtainable as a result of the asset’ s continued use, including those
resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on 
a pre-tax basis. 
The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by 
the amount of any impairment and this loss is recognised in the income
statement in the period in which it occurs. A previously recognised
impairment loss relating to a fixed asset may be reversed in part or in full
when a change in circumstances leads to a change in the estimates used
to determine the fixed asset’ s recoverable amount. The carrying amount of
the fixed asset will only be increased up to the amount that it would have
been had the original impairment not been recognised. Impairment losses
on goodwill are not reversed. For the purpose of conducting impairment
reviews, cash-generating units are the lowest level at which management
monitors the return on investment on assets.
16. Financial guarantees
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make
specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a
specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the
terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the financial statements at
fair value on the date that the guarantee was given. Other than where the
fair value option is applied, subsequent to initial recognition, the bank’ s
liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the higher of the initial
measurement, less amortisation calculated to recognise in the income
statement any fee income earned over the period, and the best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle any financial obligation arising as a
result of the guarantees at the balance sheet date, in accordance with
policy 23. 
Any increase in the liability relating to guarantees is taken to the income
statement in Provisions for undrawn contractually committed facilities and
guarantees provided. Any liability remaining is recognised in the income
statement when the guarantee is discharged, cancelled or expires.

17. Issued debt and equity securities
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities
where the contractual arrangement results in the Group having a present
obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, to
exchange financial instruments on terms that are potentially unfavourable
or to satisfy the obligation otherwise than by the exchange of a fixed
amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of equity
shares. Issued financial instruments, or their components, are classified as
equity where they meet the definition of equity and confer on the holder a
residual interest in the assets of the Company. The components of issued
financial instruments that contain both liability and equity elements are
accounted for separately with the equity component being assigned the
residual amount after deducting from the instrument as a whole the
amount separately determined as the fair value of the liability component. 
Financial liabilities, other than trading liabilities and financial liabilities
designated at fair value, are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method as set out in policy 6. Derivatives embedded in financial
liabilities that are not designated at fair value are accounted for as set out
in policy 7. Equity instruments, including share capital, are initially recognised
at net proceeds, after deducting transaction costs and any related income
tax. Dividend and other payments to equity holders are deducted from
equity, net of any related tax.
18. Share capital
Share issue costs
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or
options including those issued on the acquisition of a business are shown
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period 
in which they are paid or, if earlier, approved by the Barclays PLC 
(the Company) shareholders.
Treasury shares
Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Company’ s
share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders’ 
equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled. Where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in
shareholders’ equity.
19. Insurance contracts and investment contracts
The Group offers wealth management, term assurance, annuity, 
property and payment protection insurance products to customers 
that take the form of long- and short-term insurance contracts.
The Group classifies its wealth management and other products as
insurance contracts where these transfer significant insurance risk,
generally where the benefits payable on the occurrence of an insured
event are at least 5% more than the benefits that would be payable if 
the insured event does not occur. 
Contracts that do not contain significant insurance risk or discretionary
participation features are classified as investment contracts. Financial
assets and liabilities relating to investment contracts, and assets backing
insurance contracts are classified and measured as appropriate under 
IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
Long-term insurance contracts 
These contracts, insure events associated with human life (for example,
death or survival) over a long duration. Premiums are recognised as
revenue when they become payable by the contract holder. Claims and
surrenders are accounted for when notified. Maturities on the policy
maturity date and regular withdrawals are accounted for when due. 
A liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in 
the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised, based on the
expected discounted value of the benefit payments and directly related
administration costs, less the expected discounted value of the future
premiums that would be required to meet the benefits and other expenses.
The calculation of the liability contains assumptions regarding mortality,
maintenance expenses and investment income. 
Liabilities under unit-linked life insurance contracts (such as endowment
policies) in addition reflect the value of assets held within unitised
investment pools. 
Short-term insurance contracts
Under its payment protection insurance products the Group is committed
to paying benefits to the policyholder rather than forgiving interest or
principal on the occurrence of an insured event, such as unemployment,
sickness, or injury. Property insurance contracts mainly compensate the
policyholders for damage to their property or for the value of property lost.
Premiums are recognised as revenue proportionally over the period of 
the coverage. Claims and claims handling costs are charged to income 
as incurred, based on the estimated liability for compensation owed to
policyholders arising from events that have occurred up to the balance
sheet date even if they have not yet been reported to the Group, based 
on assessments of individual cases reported to the Group and statistical
analyses for the claims incurred but not reported.
Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)
Commissions and other costs that are related to securing new insurance
and investment contracts are capitalised and amortised over the estimated
lives of the relevant contracts. 
Deferred income liability
Fees that are designed to recover commissions and other costs related 
to either securing new insurance and investment contracts or renewing
existing investment contracts are included as a liability and amortised 
over the estimated life of the contract. 
Value of business acquired
On acquisition of a portfolio of contracts, such as through the acquisition
of a subsidiary, the Group recognises an intangible asset representing 
the value of business acquired (VOBA), representing the future profits
embedded in acquired insurance contracts and investment contracts 
with a discretionary participation feature. The asset is amortised over 
the remaining terms of the acquired contracts. 
Liability adequacy test
Liability adequacy tests are performed at each balance sheet date to
ensure the adequacy of contract liabilities net of DAC and VOBA assets.
Current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling
and administration costs, and investment returns from the assets backing
the liabilities are taken into account in the tests. Where a deficiency 
is highlighted by the test, DAC and VOBA assets are written off first, 
and insurance liabilities increased when these are written off in full. 
Any deficiency is immediately recognised in the income statement. Reinsurance
Short- and long-term insurance business is ceded to reinsurers under
contracts to transfer part or all of one or more of the following risks:
mortality, investment and expenses. All such contracts are dealt with as
insurance contracts. The benefits to which the Group is entitled under its
reinsurance contracts are recognised as reinsurance assets. The Group
assesses reinsurance assets at each balance sheet date. If there 
is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of the
reinsurance asset is reduced accordingly resulting in a charge to the
income statement.
20. Leases

Assets leased to customers under agreements, which transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, with or without
ultimate legal title, are classified as finance leases. When assets are 
held subject to a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments,
discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease, is recognised 
as a receivable. The difference between the total payments receivable
under the lease and the present value of the receivable is recognised as
unearned finance income, which is allocated to accounting periods 
under the pre-tax net investment method to reflect a constant periodic
rate of return.
Assets leased to customers under agreements which do not transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
operating leases. The leased assets are included within property, plant 
and equipment on the Group’ s balance sheet and depreciation is provided
on the depreciable amount of these assets on a systematic basis over 
their estimated useful lives. Lease income is recognised on a straight-line
basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is 
more appropriate. 
Lessee
The leases entered into by the Group are primarily operating leases.
Operating lease rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless
another systematic basis is more appropriate.
21. Employee benefits
The Group provides employees worldwide with post-retirement benefits
mainly in the form of pensions. The Group operates a number of pension
schemes which may be funded or unfunded and of a defined contribution
or defined benefit nature. In addition, the Group contributes, according to
local law in the various countries in which it operates, to Governmental and
other plans which have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. 
For defined benefit schemes, actuarial valuation of each of the scheme’ s
obligations using the projected unit credit method and the fair valuation 
of each of the scheme’ s assets are performed annually, using the
assumptions set out in Note 30. The difference between the fair value of
the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at
the balance sheet date, adjusted for any historic unrecognised actuarial
gains or losses and past service cost, is recognised as a liability in the
balance sheet. An asset, arising for example, as a result of past over
funding or the performance of the plan investments, is recognised to the
extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution
holidays or refunds of contributions. 
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of
the assets or 10% of the obligations of the plan are recognised in the
income statement over the remaining average service lives of the
employees of the related plan, on a straight-line basis.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group recognises contributions
due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement. Any
contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
The Group also provides health care to certain retired employees, which
are accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period of
employment, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit
pensions plans. 
Short-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, and other
benefits, are accounted for on an accruals basis over the period which
employees have provided services in the year. Bonuses are recognised to
the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that
can be measured reliably.
All expenses related to employee benefits are recognised in the income
statement in staff costs, which is included within operating expenses.
22. Share-based payments to employees
The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions 
in respect of services received from certain of its employees. The fair value
of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the
shares or share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost of the
employee services received in respect of the shares or share options
granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that the
services are received, which is the vesting period. The fair value of the
options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take
into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the
risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life
of the option and other relevant factors. Except for those which include
terms related to market conditions, vesting conditions included in the
terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value. 
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the
number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the
cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in 
the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or share
options. Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the
charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether 
or not the market related vesting condition is met, provided that the 
non-market vesting conditions are met. 
23. Provisions
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences
of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic
benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably
estimated.
When a leasehold property ceases to be used in the business or a
demonstrable commitment has been made to cease to use a property
where the costs exceed the benefits of the property, provision is made,
where the unavoidable costs of the future obligations relating to the lease
are expected to exceed anticipated rental income and other benefits. 
The net costs are discounted using market rates of interest to reflect the
long-term nature of the cash flows. 
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including
redundancy costs when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when 
the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has
raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by starting
to implement the plan or announcing its main features. The provision
raised is normally utilised within nine months.
Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments and similar facilities if it
is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an
asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be
confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where
the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably
measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed
unless they are remote.

Financial statements
24. T axes, including deferred taxes
Income tax payable on taxable profits (‘current tax’), is recognised 
as an expense in the period in which the profits arise. Income tax
recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as an asset only to 
the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against current 
or future taxable profits.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising from the differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated
financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates
and legislation enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date
and is expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the
deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities
are only offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where
there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
25. Segment reporting
Business segments are distinguishable components of the Group that
provide products or services that are subject to risks and rewards that are
different to those of other business segments. Geographical segments
provide products or services within a particular economic environment
that is subject to risks and rewards that are different to those of
components operating in other economic environments. Business
segments are the primary reporting segments. Group costs are allocated
to segments on a reasonable and consistent basis. Transactions between
segments are generally accounted for in accordance with Group policies
as if the segment were a stand-alone business with intra-segment
revenue and costs being eliminated in Head office.
The analyses by geographical segment are based on the location of 
the customer.
26. Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash comprises cash on
hand and demand deposits, and cash equivalents comprise highly liquid
investments that are convertible into cash with an insignificant risk of
changes in value with original maturities of less than three months. 
Repos and reverse repos are not considered to be part of cash equivalents.
27. Trust activities
The Group commonly acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities that
result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts,
retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and income
arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are
not assets of the Group.

Accounting presentation
174 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Future Accounting Developments
Consideration will be given during 2008 to the implications, if any, of the
following new and revised standards and International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as follows:
– IFRS 3 – Business Combinations and IAS 27 – Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements are revised standards issued in January
2008. The revised IFRS 3 applies prospectively to business
combinations first accounted for in accounting periods beginning on or
after 1st July 2009 and the amendments to IAS 27 apply retrospectively
to periods beginning on or after 1st July 2009. The main changes in
existing practice resulting from the revision to IFRS 3 affect acquisitions
that are achieved in stages and acquisitions where less than 100% of
the equity is acquired. In addition, acquisition related costs – such as
fees paid to advisers – must be accounted for separately from the
business combination, which means that they will be recognised as
expenses unless they are directly connected with the issue of debt or
equity securities. The revisions to IAS 27 specify that changes in a
parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss
of control must be accounted for as equity transactions. Until future
acquisitions take place that are accounted for in accordance with the
revised IFRS 3, the main impact on Barclays will be that, from 2010,
gains and losses on transactions with non-controlling interests that do
not result in loss of control will no longer be recognised in the income
statement but directly in equity. In 2007, gains of £23m and losses of
£6m were recognised in income relating to such transactions.
– IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programs addresses accounting by entities
that grant loyalty award credits (such as ‘points’ or travel miles) to
customers who buy other goods or services. It requires entities to
allocate some of the proceeds of the initial sale to the award credits and
recognise these proceeds as revenue only when they have fulfilled their
obligations. The Group is considering the implications of this
interpretation and any resulting change in accounting policy would be
accounted for in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in
Accounting Estimates and Errors in 2009.
– IFRS 8 – Operating Segments was issued in November 2006 and would
first be required to be applied to the Group accounting period
beginning on 1st January 2009. The standard replaces IAS 14 –
Segmental Reporting and would align operating segmental reporting
with segments reported to senior management as well as requiring
amendments and additions to the existing segmental reporting
disclosures. The standard does not change the recognition,
measurement or disclosure of specific transactions in the consolidated
financial statements. The Group is considering the enhancements that
permitted early adoption in 2008 may make to the transparency of the
segmental disclosures.
– IAS – 1 Presentation of Financial Statements is a revised standard
applicable to annual periods beginning on 1st January 2009. The
amendments affect the presentation of owner changes in equity and of
comprehensive income. They do not change the recognition,
measurement or disclosure of specific transactions and events required
by other standards.
– IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs is a revised standard applicable to annual
periods beginning on 1st January 2009. The revision does not impact
Barclays. The revision removes the option not to capitalise borrowing
costs on qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.
– An amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment was issued in January
2008 that clarifies that vesting conditions are service conditions and
performance conditions only. It also specifies that all cancellations,
whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same
accounting treatment, which results in the acceleration of charge. The
Group is considering the implications of the amendment, particularly to
the Sharesave scheme, and any resulting change in accounting policy
would be accounted for in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies,
changes in accounting estimates and errors in 2009.
– Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1
Presentation of Financial Statements were issued in February 2008 that
require some puttable financial instruments and some financial
instruments that impose on the entity an obligation to deliver to
another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on
liquidation to be classified as equity. The amendments, which are
applicable to annual periods beginning on 1st January 2009, do not
impact Barclays.
The following IFRIC interpretations issued during 2006 and 2007 which first
apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2008 are not
expected to result in any changes to the Group’ s accounting policies:
– IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions;
– IFRIC 12 – Service Concession Arrangements;
– IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum
Funding Requirements and their Interaction.

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the number of basic weighted average
number of shares excluding own shares held in employee benefits trusts and shares held for trading.
When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is adjusted for the conversion of outstanding
options into shares within Absa Group Limited and Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited. The weighted average number of ordinary shares
excluding own shares held in employee benefit trusts and shares held for trading, is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares,
totalling 177 million (2006: 150 million, 2005: 149 million).
Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31st December 2007, none were anti-dilutive (2006: 5 million 2005: nil).
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group continued to make on-market purchases of treasury shares under its various employee share schemes.
No adjustment has been made to earnings per share in respect of these purchases. 3

The maximum exposure to credit risk on loans and advances designated at fair value at 31st December 2007 was £23,491m (2006: £13,196m). 
The amount by which related credit derivatives and similar instruments mitigate the exposure to credit risk at 31st December was £2,605m (2006: £28m). 
The net loss attributable to changes in credit risk for loans and advances designated at fair value was £401m in 2007 (2006: £nil; 2005; £nil). The gains or
losses on related credit derivatives was £4m for the year (2006: £nil; 2005; £nil).

A portion of the Group’ s fund management business takes the legal form of investment contracts, under which legal title to the underlying investment 
is held by the Group, but the inherent risks and rewards in the investments are borne by the investors. In the normal course of business, the Group’ s
financial interest in such investments is restricted to fees for investment management services.
Due to the nature of these contracts, the carrying value of the assets is always the same as the value of the liabilities and any change in the value of the
assets results in an equal but opposite change in the value of the amounts due to the policyholders.
The Group is therefore not exposed to the financial risks – market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk inherent in the investments and they are omitted from
the disclosures on financial risks in Notes 46 to 48.
In the balance sheet, the assets are included as ‘Financial assets designated at fair value – held in respect of linked liabilities to customers under
investment contracts’. Cash balances within the portfolio have been included in the Group’ s cash balances. The associated obligation to deliver the value
of the investments to customers at their fair value on balance sheet date is included as ‘Liabilities to customers under investment contracts’. 
The increase/decrease in the value arising from the return on the investments and the corresponding increase/decrease in linked liabilities to customers is
included in the Other income note in Note 6. Notes to the accounts

14 Derivative financial instruments 
Financial instruments
The Group’s objectives and policies on managing the risks that arise in connection with derivatives, including the policies for hedging, are included in 
Note 45 to Note 48 under the headings ‘Financial Risks’, ‘Market Risk’, ‘Credit Risk’ and ‘Liquidity Risk’.
The notional amounts of certain types of financial instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet 
but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the
Group’ s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in
market rates or prices relative to their terms. The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to
which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and, thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly.
The fair value of a derivative contract represents the amount at which that contract could be exchanged in an arms-length transaction, calculated at
market rates current at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values and notional amounts of derivative instruments held for trading are set out in the following table:

income statement. 
A loss of £66m on hedging instruments was recognised in relation to fair value hedges in net interest income (2006: £460m). A gain of £70m on the
hedged items was recognised in relation to fair value hedges in net interest income (2006: £465m).
Ineffectiveness recognised in relation to cash flow hedges in net interest income was a gain of £21m (2006: loss of £23m). Ineffectiveness recognised

19 Current and deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to set off and the balances relate to income tax payable to the
same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities within the same tax group where there is the intention and ability to
settle on a net basis or realise the assets and liabilities simultaneously.
The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is £1,468m (2006: £1,046m).
The amount of deferred tax asset expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is £1,950m (2006: £1,582m).
The deferred tax assets balance includes £450m (2006: £106m) which is the excess deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities in entities which have
suffered a loss in either the current or prior year. This is based on management assessment that it is probable that the relevant entities will have taxable
profits against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The deferred tax (credit)/charge in the income statement comprises the following temporary differences:

Deductible temporary differences (gross) 247 395

The following tax losses expire: £9m in 2008 to 2011, £9m in 2011, £9m in 2012 and £1,201m in 2027. The other tax losses, tax credits and temporary
differences do not expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable
that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits. The unused tax losses include amounts relating to non-UK
branches of Barclays Bank PLC where the future tax benefit might be restricted to the amount in excess of the UK rate.
The amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities
have not been recognised is £5,722m (2006: £3,387m).
The tax charge for the period was based on a UK corporation tax rate of 30% (2006: 30%). The effective rate of tax for 2007, based on profit before tax,
was 28% (2006: 27.2%). The effective tax rate differed from 30% as it took account of the different tax rate applied to profits earned outside the UK, 
non-taxable gains and income and adjustments to prior year tax provisions. The forthcoming change in the UK rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28%
on 1st April 2008 led to an additional tax charge in 2007 as a result of its effect on the Group’ s net deferred tax asset. Notes to the accounts

Barclays Wealth 393 317
Goodwill 7,014 6,092 
The Barclays Financial Planning business previously managed and reported within Barclays Wealth, is now managed and reported within UK Banking.
Goodwill of £312m relating to this business has been transferred to UK Banking and the comparative figures restated.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred by comparing the
carrying value to its recoverable amount. 
Impairment testing of goodwill
The recoverable amount of each operation’ s goodwill is based on value-in-use calculations. The calculation is based upon discounting expected pre-tax
cash flows at a risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the cash generating unit, the determination of both of which requires the exercise of judgement.
The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term sustainable
cash flows. While forecasts are compared with actual performance and external economic data, expected cash flows naturally reflect management’ s view
of future performance. 
At 31st December 2007, the goodwill allocated to UK Banking of £3,131m (2006: £3,132m) included £3,130m (2006: £3,130m) relating to Woolwich,
and the amount allocated to International Retail and Commercial Banking of £1,682m (2006: £1,481m) included £1,054m (2006: £953m) relating to Absa.
The remaining aggregate goodwill of £2,830m (2006: £2,009m) comprised of balances not considered individually significant. 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations for significant goodwill
The values assigned to key assumptions reflect past experience and management judgement. The recoverable amount calculations performed for the
significant amounts of goodwill are sensitive to changes in the following key assumptions: 
Term of cash flow forecasts and growth rates
Cash flows are based on internal management information for a period of up to three years, after which a growth factor suitable for the business is
applied. Growth rates are based on the projected local inflation rates over the term of estimated cash flows. 
The business operation containing Woolwich has applied a growth factor of 2% (proxy for inflation) to cash flows for the period 2011 to 2016. Absa has
applied a growth rate of 8% to cash flows for the three years 2011 to 2013, and a rate of 4% for the years 2014 to 2021. The use of longer cash flow
projections is justified by the long-term nature of these businesses within the Barclays Group.
Discount rates
The business operation containing Woolwich has applied a discount factor of 15%, and Absa has applied 13.62% to forecast cash flows used in the 
impairment testing.
Management believes that reasonable changes in key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of Absa and Woolwich goodwill will not
result in impairment.
No impairment was identified in 2007 or 2006. Notes to the accounts

Operating leased assets represent assets such as plant and equipment leased to customers under operating leases. 
Certain of the Group’ s equipment is held on finance leases. See Note 37.
In 2007 the value of an existing office building in the UK property portfolio was impaired by £2m reflecting local market conditions that had prevented its
disposal in the year. In 2008 the freehold of the building will be disposed of by a short- or long-term leaseback. Consequently the value has been written
down to fair value, less cost of sale.

Assumptions used to measure insurance liabilities
The assumptions that have the greatest effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised above, and the processes used to determine them were
as follows:
Long-term business – linked and non-linked
Mortality – mortality estimates are based on standard industry and national mortality tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect the Group’ s own
experience. A margin is added to ensure prudence – for example, future mortality improvements for annuity business.
Renewal expenses level and inflation – expense reserves are a small part of overall insurance liabilities, however, increases in expenses caused by
unanticipated inflation or other unforeseen factors could lead to expense reserve increases. Expenses are therefore set using prudent assumptions. Initial
renewal expense levels are set by considering expense forecasts for the business and, where appropriate, building in a margin to allow for the increasing
burden of fixed costs on the UK closed life book of business. The inflation assumption is set by adding a margin to the market rate of inflation implied by
index-linked gilt yields.
Short-term business
Short-term business – for single premium policies the proportion of unearned premiums is calculated based on estimates of the frequency and 
severity of incidents.
Changes in assumptions
There have been no changes in assumptions in 2007 that have had a material effect on the financial statements.
Uncertainties associated with cash flows related to insurance contracts and risk management activities
Long-term insurance contracts (linked and non-linked)
For long-term insurance contracts where death is the insured risk, the most significant factors that could detrimentally affect the frequency and severity
of claims are the incidence of disease, such as AIDS, or general changes in lifestyle, such as in eating, exercise and smoking. Where survival is the insured
risk, advances in medical care and social conditions are the key factors that increase longevity.
The Group manages its exposure to risk by operating in part as a unit-linked business, prudent product design, applying strict underwriting criteria,
transferring risk to reinsurers, managing claims and establishing prudent reserves.
Short-term insurance contracts
For payment protection contracts where inability to make payments under a loan contract is the insured risk, the most significant factors are the health of
the policyholder and the possibility of unemployment which depends upon, among other things, long-term and short-term economic factors. The Group
manages its exposure to such risks through prudent product design, efficient claims management, prudent reserving methodologies and bases, regular
product, economic and market reviews and regular adequacy tests on the size of the reserves.
Absa insures property and motor vehicles, for which the most significant factors that could effect the frequency and severity of claims are climatic change
and crime. Absa manages its exposure to risk by diversifying insurance risks accepted and transferring risk to reinsurers.

Sensitivity analysis
The following table presents the sensitivity of the level of insurance contract liabilities disclosed in this note to movements in the actuarial assumptions
used to calculate them. The percentage change in variable is applied to a range of existing actuarial modelling assumptions to derive the possible impact
on net profit after tax. The disclosure is not intended to explain the impact of a percentage change in the insurance assets and liabilities disclosed above.
2007 2006
Net profit Net profit
Change in after tax Change in after tax
variable impact variable impact
%£m %£m
Long-term insurance contracts:
Improving mortality (annuitants only) 10 21 10 23
Worsening of mortality (assured lives only) 10 29 10 25
Worsening of base renewal expense level 20 43 20 23
Worsening of expense inflation rate 10 10 10 9
Short-term insurance contracts:
Worsening of claim expense assumptions 10 3 10 9
Any change in net profit after tax would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in shareholders’ equity.
The above analyses are based on a change in a single assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur.
Options and guarantees
The Group’ s contracts do not contain options or guarantees that could confer material risk.
Concentration of insurance risk
The Group considers that the concentration of insurance risk that is most relevant to the Group financial statements is according to the type of cover
offered and the location of insured risk. The following table shows the maximum amounts payable under all of the Group’ s insurance products. It ignores
the probability of insured events occurring and the contribution from investments backing the insurance policies. The table shows the broad product
types and the location of the insured risk, before and after the impact of reinsurance that represents the risk that is passed to other insurers.

Reinsurer credit risk
For the long-term business, reinsurance programmes are in place to restrict the amount of cover to any single life. The reinsurance cover is spread across
highly rated companies to diversify the risk of reinsurer solvency. Net insurance reserves include a margin to reflect reinsurer credit risk. 200 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007

The Bank is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its Undated Notes and Loans excluding the 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds if, in the
preceding six months, a dividend has not been declared or paid on any class of shares of Barclays PLC or, in certain cases, any class of preference shares of
the Bank. The Bank is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds if, in the immediately preceding 12 months
interest period, a dividend has not been paid on any class of its share capital. Interest not so paid becomes payable in each case if such a dividend is
subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances. During the year, the Bank declared and paid dividends on its ordinary shares and on all classes of
preference shares.
No payment of principal or any interest may be made unless the Bank satisfies a specified solvency test.
The Bank may elect to defer any payment of interest on the RCIs (b, c, n and o above). Any such deferred payment of interest must be paid on the earlier of
(i) the date of redemption of the RCIs, and (ii) the coupon payment date falling on or nearest to the tenth anniversary of the date of deferral of such
payment. Whilst such deferral is continuing, neither the Bank nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of its
ordinary shares or Preference Shares.
The Bank may elect to defer any payment of interest on the TONs if it determines that it is, or such payment would result in it being, in non-compliance
with capital adequacy requirements and policies of the FSA. Any such deferred payment of interest will only be payable on a redemption of the TONs. Until
such time as the Bank next makes a payment of interest on the TONs, neither the Bank nor Barclays PLC may (i) declare or pay a dividend, subject to
certain exceptions, on any of their respective ordinary shares or Preference Shares, or make payments of interest in respect of the Bank’ s Reserve Capital
Instruments and (ii) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.

29 Securitisations
The Group was party to securitisation transactions involving Barclays residential mortgage loans, business loans and credit card balances. In addition, 
the Group acts as a conduit for commercial paper, whereby it acquires static pools of residential mortgage loans from other lending institutions for
securitisation transactions.
In these transactions, the assets, or interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special
purpose entity, or to a trust which then transfers its beneficial interests to a special purpose entity, which then issues floating rate debt securities to 
third-party investors.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt
securities issued in the transaction; lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group’ s continuing involvement in those 
assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual
rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and
also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets, stated at the amount of the Group’ s continuing involvement where appropriate,
together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset in the balance sheet:

Retained interest in residential mortgage loans 895 – 628 –
Retained interests in residential mortgage loans are interest only strips which represent a continuing exposure to the prepayment and credit risk in the
underlying securitised assets, the total amount of which was £23,097m (2006: £15,063m). These are initially recorded as an allocation of the original
carrying amount based on the relative fair values of the portion derecognised and the portion retained. 30 Retirement benefit obligations
Pension schemes
The UK Retirement Fund (UKRF), which is the main scheme of the Group, amounting to 94% of all the Group’ s schemes in terms of benefit obligations,
comprises ten sections.
The 1964 Pension Scheme
Most employees recruited before July 1997 are members of this non-contributory defined benefit scheme. Pensions are calculated by reference to service
and pensionable salary and are normally subject to a deduction from State pension age.
The Retirement Investment Scheme (RIS)
A defined contribution plan for most joiners between July 1997 and 1st October 2003. This was closed to new entrants on 1st October 2003 and the large
majority of existing members of the RIS transferred to afterwork in respect of future benefit accrual with effect from 1st January 2004. There are now no
longer any active members of the RIS.
The Pension Investment Plan (PIP)
A defined contribution plan created from 1st July 2001 to provide benefits for certain employees of Barclays Capital. 
afterwork
Combines a contributory cash balance element with a voluntary defined contribution element. New employees since 1st October 2003 are eligible 
to join afterwork. In addition, the large majority of active members of the RIS (now closed) were transferred to afterwork in respect of future benefit
accrual after 1st January 2004.
Career Average Section
The Career Average Section was established in the UKRF with effect from 1st May 2004 following the transfer of members from the Woolwich Pension
Fund. The Career Average Section is a non-contributory career average scheme and was closed to new entrants on 1st December 2006.
1951 Fund Section, AP89 Section, BCPS Section, CCS Section and Mercantile Section 
Five new sections were established in the UKRF with effect from 31st March 2007 following the merger of the UKRF with five smaller schemes sponsored
from within the Group. All five sections are closed to new members.
The 1951 Fund Section, AP89 Section and Mercantile Section provide final salary benefits calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary.  
The BCPS and CCS Sections provide defined contribution benefits. The benefits built up in these sections in relation to service before 6th April 1997 are
subject to a defined benefit minimum.
In addition, the costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits are generally borne by the UKRF for each of the ten sections.
Governance
The assets of the UKRF are held separately from the assets of the Group and are administered by trustees. 
Barclays Pension Fund Trustees Ltd (BPFTL) acts as corporate trustee for the UKRF . BPFTL is a private limited company, incorporated on 20th December
1990, and is a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
As the corporate trustee for the UKRF , BPFTL is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF and BPFTL holds these assets in trust for the beneficiaries 
of the scheme.
BPFTL comprises nine Directors, of which six are Employer Directors selected by the Bank and three are Employee Directors nominated by the Pension
Fund Advisory Committee (PFAC). Employee Directors are selected from those eligible active employees and pensioner members who apply to be
considered for the role.
Employee Director vacancies are advertised to all eligible active and pensioner members. This enables any eligible member with an interest in becoming
an Employee Director to express that interest and be considered for the role. The PFAC provides the mechanism through which Employee Directors are
selected. The PFAC will accept nominations from eligible members and select from amongst all properly nominated candidates. 
There are also three Alternate Employer Directors and three Alternate Employee Directors. The selection process for these appointments are as detailed
above. The role of alternate directors is to provide cover for individual directors, should they not be available for meetings.
Currently, the Bank decides the funding rate after consulting with the trustees. Under the Pensions Act 2004, which has practical impact for the UKRF 
for the triennial valuation currently in progress with an effective date of 30th September 2007, the Bank and the trustee must agree the funding rate
(including a recovery plan to fund any deficit against the scheme specific statutory funding objective).
In addition to the UKRF , there are other defined benefit and defined contribution schemes in the UK and overseas. The same approach to pensions
governance applies to the other schemes in the UK but different legislation covers schemes outside of the UK where in most cases the Bank has the
power to determine the funding rate.

The UKRF measured using the IAS 19 assumptions, has moved over the year from a £0.5bn deficit at 31st December 2006 to a surplus of £0.7bn at 
31st December 2007. 
The assumptions used for the current year and prior year are detailed on the next page. Among the reasons for this change were the increase in AA 
long-term corporate bond yields which resulted in a higher discount rate of 5.82% (31st December 2006: 5.12%), partially offset by lower than expected
returns, and an increase in the inflation assumption to 3.45% (31st December 2006: 3.08%). A number of additional changes were made to the
assumptions used in valuing the liabilities, including a decrease in the assumed rate of real salary increases to 0.5% (31st December 2006: 1%). 
Mortality assumptions changed from those in force at 31st December 2006. 3
Financial statements
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 209
30 Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
Assumptions
Obligations arising under defined benefit schemes are actuarially valued using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, where a defined
benefit scheme is closed to new members, such as in the case of the 1964 Pension Scheme, the current service cost expressed as a percentage of salary
is expected to increase in the future, although this higher rate will be applied to a decreasing payroll. The latest actuarial IAS valuations were carried out as
at 31st December using the following assumptions:
UK schemes Overseas schemes
2007 2006 2007 2006
% p.a. % p.a. % p.a. % p.a.
Discount rate 5.82 5.12 7.51 6.94
Rate of increase in salaries 3.95 4.08 5.60 5.66
Inflation rate 3.45 3.08 4.13 3.94
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.45 2.88 3.55 3.58
Rate of increase for pensions in deferment 3.30 3.08 2.50 2.24
Initial health care inflation 8.00 8.93 10.00 9.93
Long-term health care inflation 5.00 5.00 5.01 5.00
Expected return on plan assets 6.70 6.32 7.84 7.89
The expected return on plan assets assumption is weighted on the basis of the fair value of these assets. Health care inflation assumptions are weighted
on the basis of the health care cost for the period. All other assumptions are weighted on the basis of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the
period.
The UK Schemes discount rate assumption is based on the yield on the iBoxx (over 15 year) AA corporate bond index.
The overseas health care inflation assumptions relate to the US and Mauritius.
Mortality assumptions
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the UKRF were based on the standard 2000 series tables as published by 
the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. These tables are considered to be most relevant to the population of the UKRF based on their mortality history.
These were then adjusted in line with the actual experience of the UKRF’ s own pensioners relative to the standard table. An allowance has been made for
future mortality improvements based on the medium cohort projections published by the CMIB. On this basis the post-retirement mortality assumptions
for the UKRF includes:
2007 2006 2005 2004 2003

Effect on post-retirement benefit obligation 19.9 (14.6)
Assets
A long-term strategy has been set for the asset allocation of the UKRF which comprises a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate
assets. This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile 
than others. 
The long-term strategy ensures that investments are adequately diversified. Asset managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation
from the long-term strategy within control ranges agreed with the trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely 
to liabilities. The value of assets shown below reflects the actual physical assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a mark to
market basis. The expected return on asset assumptions, both for individual asset classes and overall, have been based on the portfolio of assets created
after allowing for the net impact of the derivatives on the risk and return profile of the holdings.
The value of the assets of the schemes, their percentage in relation to total scheme assets, and their expected rate of return at 31st December 2007 and
31st December 2006 were as follows:

The UKRF plan assets include £39m relating to UK private equity investments (2006: £27m) and £664m relating to overseas private equity investments
(2006: £447m). These are disclosed within Equities. 
Amounts included in the fair value of plan assets include £6m (2006: £7m) relating to shares in Barclays Group, £6m (2006: £10m) relating to bonds
issued by the Barclays Group, £nil (2006: £1m) relating to other investments in the Barclays Group, and £10m (2006: £8m) relating to property occupied
by Group companies.
The expected return on assets is determined by calculating a total return estimate based on weighted average estimated returns for each asset class.
Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as inflation, credit spreads and equity risk premiums.
The actual return on plan assets was £731m (2006: £1,447m).

Funding
The most recent triennial funding valuation of the UK Retirement Fund was performed in September 2004 and forms the basis of the Group’ s
commitment that the fund has sufficient assets to make payments to members in respect of their accrued benefits as and when they fall due. 
This funding valuation uses a discount rate that reflects the assumed future return from the actual asset allocation at that date, and takes into account
projected future salary increases when assessing liabilities arising from accrued service. The funding valuation is updated annually on the basis of interim
assumptions. The UK Retirement Fund recorded a funding surplus of £1.2bn as at 31st December 2007 (2006: £1.3bn).
The Group has agreed funding contributions which, in aggregate, are no less than those which are sufficient to meet the Group’ s share of the cost of
benefits accruing over each year. The Group has, in the recent past, chosen to make funding contributions in excess of this, more consistent with the IAS
service cost. 
Defined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows:
£m
Contributions paid
2007 355
2006 351
2005 354
There is a triennial valuation currently in progress with an effective date of 30th September 2007. To comply with the requirements of the Pensions Act
2004, the Group and trustees plan to agree a scheme specific funding target, statement of funding principles, and a schedule of contributions which in
2008 will supersede those in place under the current actuarial funding valuation.
Excluding the UKRF , the Group is expected to pay contributions of approximately £2m to UK schemes and £41m to overseas schemes in 2008. 
The total contribution to be paid in 2008 to the UKRF is not expected to be significantly different than in previous years.

31 Ordinary shares and share premium (continued)
Issue of new ordinary shares
On 14th August 2007, 336.8 million ordinary shares with an aggregate nominal value of £84 million were issued for a cash consideration, before issue
costs, of £2,425m. The shares were issued to Temasek and China Development Bank at a market price of £7.20 per share. The proceeds of the Temasek
issuance in excess of nominal value and issue costs of £941m were credited to retained earnings. This resulted from the operation of section 131 of the
Companies Act 1985 with regard to the issue of shares by Barclays PLC in exchange for shares in Odysseus Jersey (No1) Limited and the subsequent
redemption of the no par value redeemable preference shares of that company for cash.
Share repurchase
During the year Barclays PLC purchased in the market 300 million of its own ordinary shares of 25p each at a total cost of £1,802m in order to minimise
the dilutive effect of the issuance of Barclays shares to Temasek and China Development Bank on existing shareholders. These transactions represent
4.54% of the issued share capital at 31st December 2007. All shares purchased during the period were open market transactions. 
At the 2007 AGM on 26th April, Barclays PLC was authorised to repurchase 980,840,000 of its ordinary shares of 25p. The authorisation is effective until
the AGM in 2008.
Cancellation of share premium account
On 11th October 2007, the order of the High Court confirming the cancellation of £7,223m of the share premium account was registered with the Registrar
of Companies. This created £7,223m of additional distributable  reserves in Barclays PLC. The purpose of the cancellation of the share premium account
was to create distributable profits in order to allow the payment of dividends following the completion of the share buy-back programme, the redemption
of the preference shares which were to have been issued in connection with the proposed merger with ABN AMRO, and to provide maximum flexibility to
manage the Group’ s capital resources. 
Shares under option
The Group has four schemes that give employees rights to subscribe for new shares in Barclays PLC. A summary of the key terms of each scheme are
included in Note 44.
At 31st December 2007, 74.0 million (2006: 78.9 million) options were outstanding under the terms of the Sharesave Share Option Scheme (Sharesave),
1.4 million (2006: 1.7 million) options were outstanding under the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), 0.5 million (2006: 0.7 million)
options were outstanding under the terms of the Woolwich Executive Share Option Plan (Woolwich ESOP) and 20.5 million (2006: 77.5 million) options
were outstanding under the terms of the Incentive Share Option Plan (ISOP), enabling certain Directors and members of staff to subscribe for ordinary
shares between 2007 and 2016 at prices ranging from 176p to 562p. 
Options and awards arising under the Executive Share Award Scheme, Performance Share Plan and Sharepurchase Scheme, which are described in
Note 44 are not settled by the issuance of new shares but from shares held in employee benefit trusts. Details concerning the shares held in such trusts
are provided in Note 32. Notes to the accounts

The capital redemption reserve and other capital reserve represent transfers from retained earnings in accordance with relevant legislation. These
reserves are not distributable.
The available for sale reserve represents the unrealised change in the fair value of available for sale investments since initial recognition.
The cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the income
statement when the hedged transactions affect profit or loss.
The currency translation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on the retranslation of the Group’ s net investment in foreign operations, net
of the effects of hedging.
Transfers from cash flow hedging reserve
Gains and losses transferred from the cash flow hedging reserve were to: interest income: £93m loss (2006: £7m loss), interest expense: £11m gain
(2006: £73m gain), net trading income: £100m loss (2006: £15m loss), and administration and general expenses: £16m loss (2006: £nil). 3

The Treasury shares primarily relate to Barclays PLC shares held by employee benefit trusts in relation to the Executive Share Award Scheme, Performance
Share Plan and Sharepurchase Scheme, to the extent that such shares have not been allocated to employees. These schemes are described in Note 44.
The total number of Barclays shares held in Group employee benefit trusts at 31st December 2007 was 211.4 million (2006: 168 million). Dividend rights
have been waived on nil (2006: nil) of these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year-end share price of £5.04 (2006: £7.30)
was £1,065m (2006: £1,227m). As at 31st December 2007, options over 16.6 million (2006: 9.6 million) of the total shares held in the trusts were exercisable.
The Group operates in a number of countries subject to regulations under which a local subsidiary has to maintain a minimum level of capital. The current
policy of the Group is that local capital requirements are met, as far as possible, by the retention of profit. Certain countries operate exchange control
regulations which limit the amount of dividends that can be remitted to non-resident shareholders. It is not possible to determine the amount of profit
retained and other reserves that are restricted by these regulations, but the net profit retained of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures at
31st December 2007 totalled £7,311m (2006: £5,667m). If such overseas reserves were to be remitted, other tax liabilities, which have not been provided
for in the accounts, might arise.

Commitments 192,639 205,504
Nature of instruments
In common with other banks, the Group conducts business involving acceptances, performance bonds and indemnities. The majority of these facilities
are offset by corresponding obligations of third parties.
An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank to pay a bill of exchange drawn on a customer. The Group expects most acceptances to be presented, but
reimbursement by the customer is normally immediate. Endorsements are residual liabilities of the Group in respect of bills of exchange, which have been
paid and subsequently rediscounted. 3
Financial statements
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 217
34 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)
Guarantees and letters of credit are given as security to support the performance of a customer to third parties. As the Group will only be required to 
meet these obligations in the event of the customer’ s default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to be considerably below their
nominal amounts.
Other contingent liabilities include transaction related customs and performance bonds and are, generally, short-term commitments to third parties
which are not directly dependent on the customer’ s creditworthiness.
Commitments to lend are agreements to lend to a customer in the future, subject to certain conditions. Such commitments are either made for a fixed
period, or have no specific maturity but are cancellable by the lender subject to notice requirements.
Documentary credits commit the Group to make payments to third parties, on production of documents, which are usually reimbursed immediately 
by customers.
Capital commitments
At 31st December 2007 the commitments for capital expenditure under contract amounted to £6m (2006: £9m).
Assets pledged
Assets are pledged as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or as security deposits
relating to futures and options. The disclosure includes any asset transfers associated with liabilities under repurchase agreements and securities lending
transactions.  
The following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security against these liabilities:

35 Legal proceedings
Barclays has for some time been party to proceedings, including a class action, in the United States against a number of defendants following the collapse
of Enron; the class action claim is commonly known as the Newby litigation. On 20th July 2006, Barclays received an Order from the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Texas Houston Division which dismissed the claims against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc. in
the Newby litigation. On 4th December 2006 the Court stayed Barclays dismissal from the proceedings and allowed the plaintiffs to file a supplemental
complaint. On 19th March 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued its decision on an appeal by Barclays and two other
financial institutions contesting a ruling by the District Court allowing the Newby litigation to proceed as a class action. The Court of Appeals held that
because no proper claim against Barclays and the other financial institutions had been alleged by the plaintiffs, the case could not proceed against them.
The plaintiffs applied to the United States Supreme Court for a review of this decision. On 22nd January 2008, the United States Supreme Court denied
the plaintiffs’ request for review. Following the Supreme Court’ s decision, the District Court ordered a further briefing concerning the status of the
plaintiffs’ claims. Barclays plans to seek the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claims.
Barclays considers that the Enron related claims against it are without merit and is defending them vigorously. It is not possible to estimate Barclays
possible loss in relation to these matters, nor the effect that they might have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Barclays has been in negotiations with the staff of the US Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a settlement of the Commission’ s
investigations of transactions between Barclays and Enron. Barclays does not expect that the amount of any settlement with the Commission would have
a significant adverse effect on its financial position or operating results.
Like other UK financial services institutions, Barclays faces numerous County Court claims and complaints by customers who allege that its unauthorised
overdraft charges either contravene the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 or are unenforceable penalties or both. Pending resolution
of the test case referred to below (the ‘test case’), existing and new claims in the County Courts are stayed, and there is an FSA waiver of the complaints
handling process and a standstill of Financial Ombudsman Service decisions. In July 2007, and by agreement with all parties, the OFT launched the test
case by commencing proceedings against seven banks and one building society including Barclays, the first stage of which seeks declarations on two
issues of legal principle. The hearing commenced on 17th January 2008. Barclays is defending the test case vigorously. It is not practicable to estimate
Barclays possible loss in relation to these matters, nor the effect that they may have upon operating results in any particular financial period. 
Barclays is engaged in various other litigation proceedings both in the United Kingdom and a number of overseas jurisdictions, including the United
States, involving claims by and against it which arise in the ordinary course of business. Barclays does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the
proceedings to which Barclays is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the Group and Barclays has not disclosed the
contingent liabilities associated with these claims either because they cannot reasonably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial 
to the conduct of the claims. Notes to the accounts

36 Competition and regulatory matters
The scale of regulatory change remains challenging, arising in part from the implementation of some key European Union (EU) directives. Many changes
to financial services legislation and regulation have come into force in recent years and further changes will take place in the near future. Concurrently,
there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of the retail banking and consumer credit industries in the UK and elsewhere. 
The nature and impact of future changes in policies and regulatory action are not predictable and beyond the Group’ s control but could have an impact 
on the Group’ s businesses and earnings. In June 2005 an inquiry into retail banking in all of the then 25 Member States was launched by the European
Commission’ s Directorate General for Competition. The inquiry looked at retail banking in Europe generally. In January 2007 the European Commission
announced that the inquiry had identified barriers to competition in certain areas of retail banking, payment cards and payment systems in the EU. 
The Commission indicated it will use its powers to address these barriers, and will encourage national competition authorities to enforce European and
national competition laws where appropriate. Any action taken by the Commission and national competition authorities could have an impact on the
payment cards and payment systems businesses of Barclays and on its retail banking activities in the EU countries in which it operates.
In September 2005 the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) received a super-complaint from the Citizens Advice Bureau relating to payment protection
insurance (PPI). As a result, the OFT commenced a market study on PPI in April 2006. In October 2006, the OFT announced the outcome of the market
study and, following a period of consultation, the OFT referred the PPI market to the UK Competition Commission for an in-depth inquiry in February
2007. This inquiry could last for up to two years. Also in October 2006, the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) published the outcome of its broad
industry thematic review of PPI sales practices in which it concluded that some firms fail to treat customers fairly. Barclays has cooperated fully with 
these investigations and will continue to do so. 
In April 2006, the OFT commenced a review of the undertakings given following the conclusion of the Competition Commission inquiry in 2002 into 
the supply of banking services to small and medium enterprises. Based on the OFT’ s report, the Competition Commission issued its final decision on 
21st December 2007 and decided to release the UK’ s four largest clearing banks (including Barclays) from most of the transitional undertakings given 
by them in 2002.
The OFT has carried out investigations into Visa and MasterCard credit card interchange rates. The decision by the OFT in the MasterCard interchange
case was set aside by the Competition Appeals Tribunal in June 2006. The OFT’ s investigation in the Visa interchange case is at an earlier stage and 
a second MasterCard interchange case is ongoing. The outcome is not known but these investigations may have an impact on the consumer credit
industry in general and therefore on Barclays business in this sector. In February 2007 the OFT announced that it was expanding its investigation into
interchange rates to include debit cards. 
In April 2007, the UK consumer interest association known as Which? submitted a super-complaint to the OFT pursuant to the Enterprise Act 2002. 
The super-complaint criticises the various ways in which credit card companies calculate interest charges on credit card accounts. In June 2007, the OFT
announced a new programme of work with the credit card industry and consumer bodies in order to make the costs of credit cards easier for consumers
to understand. This OFT decision follows the receipt by the OFT of the super-complaint from Which? This new work will explore the issues surrounding
the costs of credit for credit cards including purchases, cash advances, introductory offers and payment allocation. The OFT’ s programme of work is
expected to take six months. 
On 11th February 2008, the OFT announced its recommendations, which include the introduction of an FSA price comparison website, improvements to
customer information in summary boxes and the use of standard terminology.
In September 2006, the OFT announced that it had decided to undertake a fact find on the application of its statement on credit card fees made in April
2006 to current account unauthorised overdraft fees. The fact find was completed in March 2007. On 29th March 2007, the OFT announced its decision
to conduct a formal investigation into the fairness of bank current account charges. The OFT announced a market study into personal current accounts
(PCAs) in the UK on 26th April 2007. The market study will look at: (i) whether the provision of ‘free if in credit’ PCAs delivers sufficiently high levels of
transparency and value for customers; (ii) the implications for competition and consumers if there were to be a shift away from ‘free if in credit’ PCAs; 
(iii) the fairness and impact on consumers generally of the incidence, level and consequences of account charges; and (iv) what steps could be taken 
to improve customers’ ability to secure better value for money, in particular to help customers make more informed current account choices and drive
competition. The study will focus on PCAs but will include an examination of other retail banking products, in particular savings accounts, credit cards,
personal loans and mortgages in order to take into account the competitive dynamics of UK retail banking. The OFT will publish its interim findings after
the test case (see below).
In July 2007, the OFT commenced a test case in the High Court by agreement with Barclays and seven other financial institutions in which the parties
seek declarations on two legal issues arising from the banks’ terms and conditions relating to overdraft charges. The test case does not encompass claims
from local, medium or larger business customers. The proceedings will run in parallel with the ongoing OFT dual inquiry into unauthorised overdraft
charges and PCAs. Please also refer to Note 35.
In January 2007, the FSA issued a statement of good practice relating to mortgage exit administration fees. Barclays agreed to charge the fee applicable 
at the time the customer took out the mortgage, which was one of the options recommended by the FSA.
US laws and regulations require compliance with US economic sanctions, administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, against designated foreign
countries, nationals and others. HM Treasury regulations similarly require compliance with sanctions adopted by the UK government. Barclays has been
conducting an internal review of its conduct with respect to US dollar payments involving countries, persons or entities subject to these sanctions and 
has been reporting to governmental agencies about the results of that review. Barclays received inquiries relating to these sanctions and certain US dollar
payments processed by its New Y ork branch from the New Y ork County District Attorney’ s Office and the US Department of Justice, which, along with
other authorities, has been reported to be conducting investigations of sanctions compliance by non-US financial institutions. Barclays has responded 
to those inquiries and is cooperating with regulators, the Department of Justice and the District Attorney’ s Office in connection with their investigations 
of Barclays conduct with respect to sanctions compliance. Barclays has also been keeping the FSA informed of the progress of these investigations and
Barclays internal review. Barclays review is ongoing. It is currently not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of the issues covered by Barclays review
and the investigations, including the timing and potential financial effect of any resolution, which could be substantial. Barclays does not expect these
matters to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group, but it is not possible to estimate the effect they might have upon operating
results in any particular financial period. 3

Financial statements
41 Other entities
There are a number of entities that do not qualify as subsidiaries under UK Law but which are consolidated when the substance of the relationship
between the Group and the entity (usually a Special Purpose Entity (SPE)) indicates that the entity is controlled by the Group. Such entities are deemed to
be controlled by the Group when relationships with such entities gives rise to benefits that are in substance no different from those that would arise were
the entity a subsidiary.
The consolidation of such entities may be appropriate in a number of situations, but primarily when:
– the operating and financial polices of the entity are closely defined from the outset (i.e. it operates on an ‘autopilot’ basis) with such policies being
largely determined by the Group;
– the Group has rights to obtain the majority of the benefits of the entity and/or retains the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the
entity; or
– the activities of the entity are being conducted largely on behalf of the Group according to its specific business objectives.
Such entities are created for a variety of purposes including securitisation, structuring, asset realisation, intermediation and management.
Entities may have a different reporting date from that of the parent of 31st December. Dates may differ for a variety of reasons including local reporting
regulations or tax laws. In accordance with our accounting policies, for the purpose of inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of Barclays PLC,
entities with different reporting dates are made up until 31st December.
Entities may have restrictions placed on their ability to transfer funds, including payment of dividends and repayment of loans, to their parent entity.
Reasons for the restrictions include:
– Central bank restrictions relating to local exchange control laws.
– Central bank capital adequacy requirements.
– Company law restrictions relating to treatment of the entities as going concerns.
Although the Group’ s interest in the equity voting rights in certain entities exceeds 50%, or it may have the power to appoint a majority of their Boards 
of Directors, they are excluded from consolidation because the Group either does not direct the financial and operating policies of these entities, or on 
the grounds that another entity has a superior economic interest in them. Consequently, these entities are not deemed to be controlled by Barclays.
The table below includes information in relation to such entities as required by the Companies Act 1985, Section 231(5).

Key Management Personnel
The Group’ s Key Management Personnel, and persons connected with them, are also considered to be related parties for disclosure purposes. 
Key Management Personnel are defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of
Barclays PLC (directly or indirectly) and comprise the Directors of Barclays PLC and the Officers of the Group, certain direct reports of the Group Chief
Executive and the heads of major business units.
In the ordinary course of business, the Bank makes loans to companies where a Director or other member of Key Management Personnel (or any
connected person) is also a Director or other member of Key Management Personnel (or any connected person) of Barclays. These loans are made on
substantially the same criteria and terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other
persons and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavourable features.
There were no material related party transactions with companies where a Director or other member of Key Management Personnel (or any connected
person) is also a Director or other member of Key Management Personnel (or any connected person) of Barclays. 
The Group provides banking services to Directors and other Key Management Personnel and persons connected to them. Transactions during the year

Of the loans outstanding above, £nil (2006: £nil, 2005: £0.7m) relates to Directors and other Key Management Personnel (and persons connected to
them) that left the Group during the year. Of the deposits outstanding above, £2.8m (2006: £0.1m, 2005: £nil) related to Directors and other Key
Management Personnel (and persons connected to them) that left the Group during the year.
All loans are provided on normal commercial terms to Directors and other Key Management Personnel (and persons connected to them), with the
exception of £1,540 of loans which are provided to non-Director members of Key Management Personnel on staff preferential interest rates (5%) and
£665 of loans which are provided on an interest free basis.
The loans of £1,540 provided at staff preferential rates of interest reflects the amortized principal amount of a home mortgage loan that was provided 
by Barclays to a non-Director member of key management personnel. The home mortgage loan was granted at a time when Barclays had in place a
corporate policy of providing home mortgage loans at preferential rates of interest to all staff members. This policy has since been discontinued by
Barclays. These home mortgage loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, to all staff members, who
applied for such loans. The loans of £665 provided on an interest free basis relate to the granting of loans to one non-Director member of Barclays 
key management to purchase commuter rail tickets. The commuter rail ticket loans are still provided to all Barclays staff members upon request on 
the same terms. 3

43 Events after the balance sheet date
On 3rd March 2008, Barclays entered into an agreement with Petropavlovsk Finance (Limited Liability Society) to acquire 100% of the Russian Bank,
Expobank, for a consideration of approximately $745m (£373m). The transaction is expected to close in summer 2008 after receipt of appropriate
regulatory approvals. Expobank focuses principally on Western Russia, with a substantial presence in Moscow and St Petersburg. Founded in 1994, 
it has grown rapidly and comprises a blend of retail and commercial banking, operating 32 branches and dealing with a range of corporate and wholesale
clients. As at 31st December 2007, Expobank had net assets of $186m (£93m).
44 Share-based payments
The Group operates share schemes for employees throughout the world. The main current schemes are:
Sharesave
Eligible employees in the UK, Spain and Ireland may participate in the Barclays Sharesave scheme. Under this scheme, employees may enter into contracts
to save up to £250 per month (Ireland: ¤320, Spain: ¤90) and, at the expiry of a fixed term of three, five or seven years (Spain: three years), have the option to
use these savings to acquire shares in the Company at a discount, calculated in accordance with the rules of the scheme. The discount is currently 20% of
the market price at the date the options are granted. Participants in the scheme have six months from the date of vest in which the option can be exercised.
Sharepurchase
Sharepurchase was introduced in January 2002. It is an HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee share plan. The plan is open to all eligible UK
employees, including executive Directors. Under the plan, participants are able to purchase up to £1,500 worth of Barclays PLC ordinary shares per tax
year, which, if kept in trust for five years, can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free. Matching shares were introduced to the scheme during 2005 where
the purchase of Barclays shares by the participant are matched equally by the Company up to a value of £600 per tax year. Any shares in the plan will earn
dividends in the form of additional shares, which must normally be held by the trustee for three years before being eligible for release.
Executive Share Award Scheme (ESAS) 
For certain employees of the Group an element of their annual bonus is in the form of a deferred award of a provisional allocation of Barclays PLC shares
under ESAS. The total value of the bonus made to the employee of which ESAS is an element is dependent upon the business unit, Group and individual
employee performance. The ESAS element of the annual bonus must normally be held for at least three years. Additional bonus shares are subsequently
awarded to recipients of the provisional allocation and vest upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date of award. ESAS awards
are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes. All awards are subject to potential forfeit if the individual resigns and commences work with
a competitor business.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) was approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM to replace the ISOP scheme. Performance shares are ‘free’ Barclays
shares for which no exercise price is payable and which qualify for dividends. Performance share awards are communicated to participants as an initial
allocation. Barclays performance over a three-year period determines the final number of shares that may be released to participants.
Options granted under the following schemes are over subsidiaries of Barclays PLC:
Barclays Global Investors Equity Ownership Plan (BGI EOP)
The Equity Ownership Plan extends to key employees of BGI. The exercise price of the options is determined by the Remuneration Committee of 
Barclays PLC based on the fair value of BGI as determined by an independent appraiser. The options are granted over shares in Barclays Global Investors
UK Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. Options are not exercisable until vesting, with a third of the options held generally becoming
exercisable at each anniversary of grant. The shareholder has the right to offer to sell the shares to Barclays Bank PLC 355 days following the exercise of
the option. Barclays Bank PLC may accept the offer and purchase the shares at the most recently agreed valuation but is under no obligation to do so.
Options lapse ten years after grant. The most recently agreed valuation was £106.03 at 30th June 2007. 
Absa Group Limited Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Transaction
On 25th June 2004, Absa shareholders approved the allocation of 73,152,300, redeemable cumulative option-holding Absa preference shares to 
Batho Bonke Capital Limited. Each redeemable preference share carries the option to acquire one Absa ordinary share. The shares carry the same rights 
as ordinary shares including voting rights, and receive dividends which are payable semi-annually. Options vest after three years and lapse after five years
from the date of issue. Exercise may only occur in lots of 100 and within a price range varying from ZAR48 to ZAR69 (£3.40-£4.89) dependent on the 
30-day volume weighted trading price on the JSE Limited. Options are redeemed by Absa on the final exercise date. 3

Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust (AGLSIT)
In terms of the rules of Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust the maximum number of shares which may be issued or transferred and/or in respect of
which options may be granted to the participants shall be limited to shares representing 10% of the total number of issued shares. Options are allocated
to Absa employees according to the normal Human Resources talent management process. The options issued up to August 2005 had no performance
criteria linked to them and vested in equal tranches after three, four and five years respectively. No dividends accrue to the option holder over the period.
The options expire after a period of ten years from the issuing date. Options issued since August 2005 have vesting performance criteria associated with
them, which require headline earnings per share to exceed an agreed benchmark over a three-year period from July 2005 for the options to vest
Absa Group Limited Share Ownership Trust (AGLSOT)
The Absa Group Limited Share Ownership Trust (AGLSOT) enabled all Absa employees to participate in a one-off offer to purchase 200 redeemable
cumulative option-holding preference shares. Each redeemable preference share carries the option to acquire one Absa ordinary share. Options vest after
three years and lapse after five years from the date of issue. Exercise may only occur in lots of 100 and within a price range varying from ZAR48 to ZAR69
(£3.40-£4.89) dependent on the 30-day volume weighted trading price on the JSE Limited. Options are redeemed by Absa on the final exercise date.
Absa Group Limited Executive Share Award Scheme (AGLESAS)
For certain employees of Absa an element of their annual bonus is in the form of a deferred award of a provisional allocation of Absa Group Limited shares
under Absa ESAS. The total value of the bonus made to the employee of which ESAS is an element is dependent upon the business unit and individual
employee performance. The ESAS element of the annual bonus must be held for at least three years. Additional bonus shares are subsequently awarded
to recipients of the provisional allocation and vest upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date of award. All awards are subject
to potential forfeit if the individual resigns.
In addition, options remain outstanding under the following closed schemes:
Incentive Share Option Plan (ISOP)
The ISOP was open by invitation to the employees and Directors of Barclays PLC. Options were granted at the market price at the date of grant calculated
in accordance with the rules of the plan, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date. The final number of shares over which
the option may be exercised is determined by reference to set performance criteria. The number of shares under option represents the maximum possible
number that may be exercised. No awards were made under ISOP during 2006 or 2007.
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
The ESOS is a long-term incentive scheme and was available by invitation to certain senior executives of the Group with grants usually made annually.
Options were issued with an exercise price equivalent to the market price at the date of the grant without any discount, calculated in accordance with the
rules of the scheme, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date. No further awards are made under ESOS.
Woolwich Executive Share Option Plan (Woolwich ESOP)
Options originally granted over Woolwich PLC shares at market value were exercised in 2001 or exchanged, in accordance with the proposals made under
the offer to acquire the Woolwich, for options over Barclays PLC shares. Under the rules of ESOP , the performance conditions attached to the exercise of
options were disapplied on acquisition of Woolwich PLC by Barclays. Options lapse ten years after grant.
At the balance sheet date, no options remained outstanding or exercisable in respect of the following closed scheme:
Woolwich Save as Y ou Earn (Woolwich SA YE)
Under this scheme, employees entered into contracts to save up to £250 per month and, at the expiry of a fixed term of three, five, or seven years, have
the option to use these savings to acquire the shares in the Company at a discount calculated in accordance with the rules of the scheme. The discount
was 20% of the market price at the date the options were granted.
At the balance sheet date the following cash settled schemes operated within the group:
Barclays Africa Share Plan
The Barclays Africa Share Plan grants a number of notional shares and settles in a cash award linked to the Barclays PLC share price. The exercise price of
options is equal to the increment of the market price of Barclays shares over the original price on the date of grant. The final number of notional shares
over which the option may be exercised is determined by reference to set performance criteria. Awards vest three years from grant and expire four years
from that date.
Absa Group Phantom Performance Share Plan (Absa Phantom PSP)
The Absa Phantom PSP was implemented during 2006 to replace the Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust (AGLSIT) scheme. Shares are awarded at
no cost to participants and the cash paid is equal to the market value of ordinary shares of Absa Group Limited. The performance of Absa over a three-
year period determines the final number of notional shares that any cash payment would be based on. Awards vest after three years to the extent that the
performance conditions are satisfied. Notes to the accounts
For the year ended 31st December 2007

The weighted average fair value per option granted during the year is as follows:
2007 2006
£ £
Sharesave 1.25 1.88
Sharepurchase 6.84 6.55
ESAS 6.96 6.73
PSP 8.03 7.53
BGI EOP 22.18 21.18
AGLSIT 3.18 2.70
AGLESAS n/a 8.42
Fair values for Sharesave, PSP , BGI EOP and AGLSIT are calculated at the date of grant using either a Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo simulation.
Sharepurchase, ESAS and AGLESAS are nil cost awards on which the performance conditions are substantially completed at the date of grant.
Consequently the fair value of these awards is based on the market value at that date.
As described above, the terms of the ESAS scheme require shares to be held for a set number of years from the date of vest. The calculation of the vest
date fair value of such awards includes a reduction for this post-vesting restriction. This discount is determined by calculating how much a willing market
participant would rationally pay to remove the restriction using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The total discount required in 2007 is £66m (2006:
£62m, 2005: £36m).
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2007 are as follows:
2007
Sharesave PSP BGI EOP AGLSIT

The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2006 are as follows:

Expected option life 4 years 3 years 4 years 5 years
The significant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in 2005 are as follows:
2005
Sharesave PSP BGI EOP AGLSIT ISOP
Weighted average share price 5.71 5.33 39.09 8.25 5.73
Weighted average exercise price 4.44 n/a 39.09 8.41 5.66
Expected volatility 24% 20% 25% n/a 34%
Option life 4 years 3 years 4 years 5-8 years 5 years
Expected volatility and dividend yield on the date of grant have been used as inputs into the respective valuation models for Sharesave and PSP . Expected
volatility has been determined using historical volatility of its peers over the expected life of the options for BGI EOP and AGLSIT applies a five-year rolling
period.
The yield on UK government bonds with a commensurate life has been used to determine the risk-free discount rate of 5% for all schemes other than
AGLSIT. Option life is estimated based upon historical data for the holding period of options between grant and exercise dates. The risk-free rate on the
AGLSIT scheme represents the yield, recorded on date of option grant, on South African government zero coupon bond of a term commensurate to the
expected life of the option. 3

For the purposes of determining the expected life and number of options to vest, historical exercise patterns have been used, together with an
assumption that a certain percentage of options will lapse due to leavers. 
The assumed dividend yield for Barclays PLC is the average annual dividend yield on the date of grant of 4%. Dividend yield for AGLSIT of 3.5% was based
on the average 12-month trailing yield over the year to grant date.

There were no modifications to the share-based payment arrangements in the years 2007, 2006 and 2005. As at 31st December 2007, the total liability
arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions was £16m (2006: £7m).
At 31st December 2007, 7.5 million (2006: 6.9 million) options were outstanding under the terms of the BGI EOP (which would represent a 8.1% interest
if exercised). Employees in BGI own 5.9% of the shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited (2006: 9.4%). If all the current options were
exercised, £567.6m (2006: £400.5m) would be subscribed. Since the scheme was introduced, options over 20.9 million (2006: 19.3 million) shares have
been exercised, of which 5.0 million are still held by employees and represent a minority interest in the Group. 
At 31st December 2007, there were 73.2 million, 13.6 million and 0.9 million options granted over Absa Group Limited shares under the Absa Group
Limited Black Economic Empowerment Transaction, Absa Group Limited Share Incentive Trust and Absa Group Limited Share Ownership Trust
respectively. In aggregate, these options would represent a 13.1% interest in Absa Group Limited if exercised. Notes to the accounts

45 Financial risks 
Financial risk management
Barclays PLC is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking, wealth
management and investment management services. Financial instruments are fundamental to the Group’ s business and managing financial risks,
especially credit risk, is a fundamental part of its business activity. Barclays achieves its risk management goals by keeping risk management at the centre
of the executive agenda and by building a culture where risk management is part of everyday business decision-making. Barclays ensures that it has the
capacity to manage the risk in its established businesses as well as new and growing ones, and that its business plans are consistent with risk appetite,
that is, the level of risk Barclays is willing to accept in fulfilling its business objectives.
Barclays risk management policies and processes are designed to identify and analyse risk, to set appropriate risk appetite, limits, and controls, and to
monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date data. Risk management policies, models and systems are regularly reviewed
to reflect changes to markets, products and best market practice. Individual responsibility and accountability, instilled through training, are designed to
deliver a disciplined, conservative and constructive culture of risk management and control.
Risk responsibilities
The Board approves risk appetite and the Board Risk Committee monitors the Group’ s risk profile against this appetite:
– The Group Risk Director, under delegated authority from the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, has responsibility for ensuring
effective risk management and control;
– Business Heads are responsible for the identification and management of risk in their businesses;
– Business risk teams, each under the management of a Business Risk Director, are responsible for assisting Business Heads in the identification and
management of their business risk profiles for implementing appropriate controls. These risk management teams also assist Group Risk in the
formulation of Group Risk policy and the implementation of it across the businesses;
– Within Group risk, Risk-Type Heads and their teams are responsible for establishing a risk control framework and risk oversight; and
– Internal Audit is responsible for the independent review of risk management and the control environment.
Oversight of risk management is exercised by the Risk Oversight Committee which is chaired by the Group Risk Director under authority delegated by the
Group Finance Director. The Risk Oversight Committee oversees management of the Group’ s risk profile, exercised through the setting, review and
challenge of the size and constitution of the profile when viewed against the Group risk appetite.
The Group Executive Committee monitors and manages risk-adjusted performance of businesses and receives a regularly quarterly risk update including
a copy of the Group Risk Profile Report. 
The Board Risk Committee (BRC) reviews the Group risk profile, approves the Group Control Framework and approves minimum control requirements for
principal risks. 
The Board Audit Committee (BAC) considers the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group Control Framework and receives quarterly reports on control
issues of significance and half-yearly reports on impairment allowances and regulatory reports. 
Both BRC and BAC also receive reports dealing in more depth with specific issues relevant at the time. The proceedings of both Committees are reported
to the full Board. The Board approves the overall Group risk appetite.
The Risk Oversight Committee is chaired by the Group Risk Director and oversees the management of the Group’ s risk profile and all of its significant risks.
Oversight is exercised through the setting, review and challenge of the size and constitution of the profile when viewed against the Group’ s risk appetite. 
It has delegated and apportioned responsibility for credit risk management to the Retail and Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committees. 
The main financial risks affecting the Group are discussed in Notes 46 to 48.
46 Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that Barclays earnings or capital, or its ability to meet business objectives, will be adversely affected by changes in the level or
volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, credit spreads, commodity prices, equity prices and foreign exchange rates.
Most market risk arises from trading activities. Barclays is also exposed to interest rate and potential foreign exchange risks arising from financial assets
and liabilities not held for trading.
Market risk management and control responsibilities
The Board approves the overall market risk appetite. The Market Risk Director is responsible for the market risk control framework and, under delegated
authority from the Group Risk Director, sets a limit framework within the context of the approved market risk appetite.
The head of each business, assisted by the business risk management team, is accountable for identifying, measuring and managing all market risks
associated with the business’ activities. Oversight and support is provided by the Market Risk Director, assisted by the central market risk team.
Market risk measurement
The measurement techniques used to measure and control market risk include:
– Daily Value at Risk;
– Stress Tests; and
– Annual Earnings at Risk.
Daily Value at Risk (DVaR)
DVaR is an estimate of the potential loss which might arise from unfavourable market movements, if the current positions were to be held unchanged for
one business day, measured to a confidence level of 98%. Daily losses exceeding the DVaR figure are likely to occur, on average, twice in every 100
business days.
In Barclays Capital, DVaR is an important market risk measurement and control tool. DVaR is calculated using the historical simulation method with a
historical sample of two years. 3
Financial statements
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 235
46 Market risk (continued)
DVaR Back-testing
The DVaR model is regularly assessed. The main approach employed is the technique known as back-testing which counts the number of days when
trading losses exceed the corresponding DVaR estimate. 
On the basis of DVaR estimated to a 98% confidence level, on average there would be five days each year when trading losses would be expected to
exceed DVaR and would therefore be reflected as back-testing exceptions. For Barclays Capital’ s trading book, there were seven instances of a daily trading
loss exceeding the corresponding 98% back-testing DVaR. These back-testing exceptions in 2007 reflected the increased volatility across a number of
markets in which Barclays Capital operates. There were no instances of back-testing exceptions on a similar basis in 2006.
Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR)
AEaR measures the sensitivity of net interest income (NII) over the next 12 months. It is calculated as the difference between the estimated income 
using the current yield curve and the lowest estimated income following a 50 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates. 
AEaR is used primarily to measure interest rate risk arising on non-trading assets and liabilities.
Traded market risk
Traded market risk management
Barclays policy is to concentrate trading activities in Barclays Capital. This includes transactions where Barclays Capital acts as principal with clients 
or with the market. For maximum efficiency, client and market activities are managed together.
In Barclays Capital, the Head of Market Risk is responsible for implementing the market risk control framework. Day to day responsibility for market risk 
lies with the senior management of Barclays Capital, supported by the Market Risk Management team that operates independently of the trading areas.
Daily market risk reports are produced for the main Barclays Capital business areas covering the different risk categories including: interest rate, credit
spread, commodity , equity and foreign exchange. A more detailed trading market risk presentation is produced fortnightly and discussed at Barclays Capital’ s
Traded Products Risk Review meeting. This meeting is attended by the senior managers from Barclays Capital and the central market risk team.
Analysis of trading market risk exposures
The table below shows the DVaR statistics for Barclays Capital’ s trading and non-trading activities. DVaR is the main measure for internal risk
management within Barclays Capital.
Barclays Capital's market risk exposure, as measured by average total Daily Value at Risk (DVaR), increased by 13% to £42.0m (2006: £37.1m). Interest
rate and credit spread risks were broadly unchanged while commodity DVaR and equity DVaR increased by £8.9m and £3.4m respectively. The growth in
both these risks is consistent with Barclays Capital’ s business plan. Diversification across risk types remained significant, reflecting the broad product mix.
Total DVaR as at 31st December 2007 was £53.9m (31st December 2006 £41.9m). This growth reflected the increased market volatility in the second
half of the year.

46 Market risk (continued)
Non-trading interest rate risk
Asset and liability market risk
Interest rate risk arises from the provision of retail and wholesale (non-trading) banking products and services, as well as foreign currency translational
exposures within the Group’ s balance sheet. 
The Group’ s approach is to transfer risk from the businesses either into local treasuries or to Group Treasury using an internal transfer price or interest rate
swap. The methodology used to transfer this risk depends on whether the product contains yield curve risk, basis risk or customer optionality. Limits exist
to ensure there is no material risk retained within any business or product area. 
Sensitivity analysis
Set out below are the impacts on net interest income and equity of a reasonably possible change in market rates of interest, based on the AEaR model
described above.
(a) Impact on net interest income
The sensitivity of the income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest income for one year, based on the non-
trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31st December 2007, including the effect of hedging instruments.
The effect on net interest income, and therefore profit before tax, of a 50 basis points change would be as follows:

As percentage of net interest income 0.19% (0.19%) 0.12% (0.12%)
Note: This table excludes exposures held or issued by Barclays Capital as these are measured and managed using DVaR.
(b) Impact on equity
Interest rate changes affect equity in the following three ways:
– Higher or lower profit after tax resulting from higher or lower net interest income
– Higher or lower available for sale reserves reflecting higher or lower fair values of available for sale financial instruments
– Higher or lower values of derivatives held in the cash flow hedging reserves
The sensitivities of equity shown below are based on scenarios constructed from actual exposures and consider the impact on the cash flow hedging
reserve and the available for sale reserve only. They are calculated by revaluing fixed rate available-for-sale financial assets, including the effect of any
associated hedges, and derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, for the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates. They are based on the
assumption that there are parallel shifts in the yield curve. The effects of taxation have been estimated using the Group’ s effective tax rate of 28% (2006:
27%).

Foreign exchange risk
The group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk.
(a) Transactional foreign currency exposure
Transactional foreign exchange exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency of the transacting entity. 
The Group’ s risk management policies prevent the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside the trading portfolio managed by
Barclays Capital which is monitored through DVaR.
There were no material net transactional foreign currency exposures outside the trading portfolio at either 31st December 2007 or 2006. Due to the low
level of non-trading exposures no reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates would have a material effect on either the Group’ s profit or
movements in equity for the year ended 31st December 2007 or 2006.
(b) Translational foreign exchange exposure
The Group operates in a number of economic environments resulting in structural foreign exchange exposures on net investments in branches,
subsidiaries or associated undertakings, the functional currencies of which are currencies other than Sterling.
Exchange differences are created by the translation of these net assets measured in their functional currencies to Sterling, the Group’ s presentational
currency . These exchange differences are recorded in the consolidated translation reserve and reflected in the statement of recognised income and expense. 
Additionally the Group’ s regulatory capital ratios are sensitive to foreign exchange movements in reserves, goodwill, minority interests and other non-
Sterling debt capital as well as non sterling risk weighted assets.
The Group’ s policy is to economically hedge foreign currency net investments, where practical, after taking consideration of available markets to 
conduct hedging, the size of the investment and the cost of hedging; unless doing so would result in capital ratios which are overly sensitive to 
foreign exchange movements. Notes to the accounts

47 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’ s customers, clients or market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual
obligations to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from commercial and consumer loans and advances, credit cards, and loan commitments arising 
from such lending activities, but can also arise from credit enhancement provided, such as financial guarantees, letters of credit, endorsements 
and acceptances. 
Barclays is also exposed to other credit risks arising from investments in debt securities and other exposures arising from its trading activities (‘trading
exposures’) including, non- equity trading portfolio assets, derivatives as well as settlement balances with market counterparties and reverse repo loans. 
Losses arising from exposures held for trading (derivatives, debt securities) are accounted for as trading losses, rather than impairment charges, even
though the fall in value causing the loss may be attributable to credit deterioration. 
Credit risk management and control responsibilities
The granting of credit is one of the Group's major sources of income and is therefore one of its most significant risks, and the Group dedicates
considerable resources to controlling it effectively. 
The credit risk management teams in each business are accountable to the Business Risk Directors in those businesses who, in turn, report to the heads
of their businesses and also to the Group Risk Director.
The Credit Risk function provides Group-wide direction of credit risk-taking. The teams within this function manage the resolution of all significant credit
policy issues and run the Credit Committee, which approves major credit decisions. 
Each business segment has an embedded credit risk management team. These teams assist Group Risk in the formulation of Group Risk policy and the
implementation of it across the businesses. Examples include ensuring that:
– Maximum exposure guidelines are in place relating to the exposures to any individual customer or counterparty;
– Country risk policy specifies risk appetite by country and avoids excessive concentration of credit risk by country; and
– Policies are in place to monitor exposures to individual industrial sectors. 
The principal committees that review credit risk management, formulate overall Group credit policy and resolve all significant credit policy issues are the
Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee, the Retail Credit Risk Management Committee, the Risk Oversight Committee and the Board Risk
Committee. All these Committees receive regular and comprehensive reports on risk issues. 
The Retail Credit Risk Management Committee (RCRMC) oversees exposures, which comprise unsecured personal lending (including small businesses),
mortgages and credit cards. The RCRMC monitors the risk profile and performance of the retail portfolios by receipt of key risk measures and indicators at
an individual portfolio level, ensuring mitigating actions taken to address performance are appropriate and timely. Metrics reviewed will consider portfolio
composition and both an overall stock and new flow level.
The Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee (WCRMC) oversees wholesale exposures, comprising lending to businesses, banks and other
financial institutions. The WCRMC monitors exposure by country, industry sector, individual large exposures and exposures to sub-investment grade
countries. 
The monthly Wholesale and Retail Credit Risk Management Committees exercise oversight through review and challenge of the size and constitution of
the portfolios when viewed against Group risk appetite for wholesale and retail credit risks. They are chaired by the Group Wholesale and Retail Credit Risk
Directors. 
Corporate and commercial lending 
Corporate accounts which are deemed to contain heightened levels of risk are recorded on graded problem loan lists known as early-warning or watch
lists. These are updated monthly and circulated to the relevant risk control points. Once listing has taken place, exposures are closely monitored and,
where appropriate, reduced.
These lists are graded in line with the perceived severity of the risk attached to the lending, and its probability of default. Businesses with exposure to
corporate customers all work to three categories of increasing concern. By the time an account becomes impaired it will normally have passed through all
three categories, which reflect the need for ever-increasing caution and control. 
Where an obligor’ s financial health gives grounds for concern, it is immediately placed into the appropriate category. All obligors, regardless of financial
health, are subject to a full review of all facilities on, at least, an annual basis. More frequent interim reviews may be undertaken should circumstances
dictate. 
Retail lending
Within the retail portfolios, which tend to comprise homogeneous assets, statistical techniques more readily allow the risk of impairment to be monitored
on a portfolio basis. This applies to UK Retail Banking, Barclays Wealth, International Retail and Commercial Banking and Barclaycard. 
Within Local Business, accounts that are deemed to have a heightened level of risk, or that exhibit some unsatisfactory features which could affect
viability in the short or medium term, are transferred to a separate ‘Caution’ refer stream where a cautious approach is appropriate. Accounts on the
Caution refer stream are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis at which time consideration will be given to continuing with the agreed strategy, returning
the customer to a lower risk refer stream, or instigating recovery or exit action if the strategy has failed. 
Debt securities
Managing credit risk associated with debt securities differs in important respects from the process for loans originated by the Group. Firstly, market prices
are generally available for listed bonds and securities and these prices are a good indicator of the credit standing of the issuer. Secondly, most listed and
some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies which is another strong indicator of overall credit quality. Where such ratings are not
available or are not current, the Group will have regard to its own internal ratings for the securities.   Notes to the accounts

Settlement risk
The Group is exposed to settlement risk in its dealings with market counterparties (predominantly other financial institutions). These risks arise, for
example, in foreign exchange transactions when Barclays pays away its side of the transaction to another bank or other counterparty before receiving
payment from the other side. The risk is that the counterparty may not meet its obligation. It also arises on derivative contracts where the carrying value of
the financial asset is related to the credit condition of the counterparty. 
Settlement risk also arises through the operation of a number of systems through which Barclays makes and receives payments on behalf of its customers. 
While these exposures are of short duration, they can be large. In recent years, settlement risk has been reduced by several industry initiatives that have
enabled simultaneous and final settlement of transactions to be made (such as payment-versus-payment through Continuous Linked Settlement and
delivery-versus-payment in central bank money). 
Barclays has worked with its peers in the development of these arrangements. Increasingly the majority of high value transactions are settled by such
mechanisms. Where these mechanisms are not available, the risk is further reduced by dealing predominantly with highly-rated counterparties, holding
collateral and limiting the size of the exposures according to the rating of the counterparty, with smaller exposures to those of higher risk. 
Country risk
Credit risk is manifested as country risk where difficulties may arise in the country in which the exposure is domiciled, thus impeding or reducing the value
of the asset, or where the counterparty is the country itself.
Barclays manages country risk by setting a country risk appetite, which is known as the Country Guideline and agreed at the Group Credit Committee. All
cross-border or domestic foreign currency transactions are aggregated to give the current utilisation, in terms of country loss given default (CLGD),
against country appetite. The level of CLGD incurred by a counterparty transaction will largely depend on three main factors: the country severity, the
product severity and counterparty grade. The calculation and loss given default is described under ‘Credit Risk measurement’ below.
CLGD is incurred in the country of direct risk, defined as where the majority of operating assets are held. This may differ from the country of incorporation.
However, where transactions are secured with collateral, the country risk can be transferred from the country of the borrower to the country of the
collateral provider. This is only permitted where the collateral definitely covers the borrowing and is not expected to decrease over time. 
Credit risk measurement
Barclays uses statistical modelling techniques throughout its business in its credit rating systems. These systems assist the Bank in frontline credit
decisions on new commitments and in managing the portfolio of existing exposures. They enable a coherent approach to risk measurement across all
credit exposures, retail and wholesale. The key building blocks in the measurement system are the probability of customer default (PD), exposure in the
event of default (EAD), and severity of loss-given-default (LGD). Using these, Barclays builds the analyses that lead to its decision support systems in the
Risk Appetite context described previously. 
Where financial models are used to monitor credit risk, they are based upon customers’ personal and financial performance information over recent
periods as a predictor for future performance. The models are reviewed regularly to monitor their robustness relative to actual performance and amended
as necessary to optimise their effectiveness. 
For corporate and wholesale customers, Barclays also assesses the credit quality of borrowers and other counterparties and assigns them an internal risk
rating. There are two different categories of default rating used. The first reflects the statistical probability of a customer in a rating class defaulting within
the next 12-month period, and is referred to as a point in time rating (PIT). The second also reflects the statistical probability of a customer in a rating class
defaulting, but the period of assessment is 12 months of average credit conditions for the customer type. This type of rating therefore provides a measure
of risk that is independent of the current credit conditions for a particular customer type, is much more stable over time than a PIT rating and is referred to
as a through the cycle (TTC) rating.
Country risk grades are assigned to all countries where the Group has, or is likely to have, exposure and are reviewed every quarter to ensure they remain
appropriate. Country grades, which are derived from long-term sovereign foreign currency ratings, range from 1 (lowest probability of default) to 21
(highest probability of default). A ceiling is applied where a country is graded 12 or lower so that the counterparty cannot be graded higher than the
country, unless some form of protection is available in the event of a cross-border event, such as a significant portion of a counterparty’ s assets or income
being held or generated in a convertible currency. 
As noted above, for listed debt securities, the Group has regard to both external credit ratings and internal default grades where such ratings are not
available or current.
Multiple rating methodologies may be used to inform the rating decision on individual large credits, such as internal and external models, rating agency
grades and, for wholesale assets, market information such as credit spreads. For smaller credits, a single source may suffice, such as the result from a
rating model.
For debt securities and counterparties where third party ratings are used to inform credit decisions, the Group mainly uses those provided by Standards
and Poors’ or Moody’ s. 
Barclays wholesale credit rating contains 21 grades, representing the Group’ s best estimate of credit risk for a counterparty based on current economic
conditions.
Retail customers are not assigned internal risk ratings in this way for account management purposes, although a mapping of the PIT probability of default
to one of eight Barclays Retail Grades (BRG) is used for some internal reporting purposes.
The tables below detail how external rating grades, Default Grades and Barclays Retail Grades relate to the categories of credit quality selected for the
financial statements. Where applicable, the internal measure of probability of default has been presented for indicative purposes. 3

8 Weak / Substandard 10.00% + 
Financial statement descriptions can be summarised as follows:
Strong – there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full. If it is a debt security, then it will be investment grade.
Satisfactory – whilst there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the asset may not be
collateralised, or may relate to retail facilities, such as credit card balances and unsecured loans, which have been conservatively classified as satisfactory,
regardless of the fact that the output of internal grading models may have indicated a higher classification. At the lower end of this grade there are
customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of some deterioration,
mortgages with a high loan to value ratio, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.
Weak/Sub-standard – there is concern over the obligor’ s ability to make payments when due. However, these have not yet converted to actual
delinquency. There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided. However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make
payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.
Credit risk mitigation, collateral, security, and other credit enhancements
The Group uses a wide variety of techniques to reduce credit risk on its lending. The most important of these is performing an assessment of the ability 
of a borrower to service the proposed level of borrowing. Barclays policy is to establish that loans are within the customer’ s capacity to repay, rather than
to rely excessively on security. As a result no security is required for a wide range of lending products. 
Credit risk mitigation
Barclays actively manages its credit exposures. When weaknesses in exposures are detected – either in individual exposures or in groups of exposures –
the Group takes action to mitigate the risks. Such actions may , for example, include; reducing the amounts outstanding (in discussion with the customers,
clients or counterparties if appropriate); using credit derivatives securitising the assets; and, on occasion, selling them. 
Barclays maintains the diversification of its portfolio to avoid unwanted credit risk concentrations. Maximum exposure guidelines are in place relating 
to the exposures to any individual counterparty. These permit higher exposures to higher-rated borrowers than to lower-rated borrowers. They also
distinguish between types of counterparty, for example, between sovereign governments, banks and corporations. Excesses are considered individually 
at the time of credit sanctioning, are reviewed regularly, and are reported to the Risk Oversight Committee and the Board Risk Committee. 
Similarly, country risk policy specifies risk appetite by country and avoids excessive concentrations of credits in individual countries, whilst other policies
limit lending to certain industries. 
A further protection against undesirable concentration of risk is the mandate and scale framework. Mandate and scale limits, which can also be set at
Group level to reflect overall risk appetite, can relate either to the stock of current exposures in the relevant portfolio or to the flow of new exposures into
that portfolio. Typical limits include the proportion of lending with maturity in excess of seven years and the proportion of new mortgage business that 
is buy-to-let.  Notes to the accounts

47 Credit risk (continued)
Businesses may put in place other forms of credit risk mitigation, such as credit derivatives or other forms of credit protection in accordance with their
procedures or policies. Hedges and mitigants are monitored and risk appetite reviewed to ensure that credit risk is kept to acceptable levels.
Collateral and security
Collateral and security can be an important mitigant of credit risk.
The Group routinely obtains collateral and security, such as in the case of a residential or commercial mortgage, a reverse repurchase agreement, or a
commercial loan with a floating charge over book debts and inventories. 
The Group ensures that any collateral held is sufficiently liquid, legally effective, enforceable and regularly reassessed. Before attaching value to collateral,
businesses holding specific, agreed classes of collateral must ensure that they are holding a correctly perfected charge. 
The principal collateral and security types are as follows: 
– Personal lending – mortgages over residential properties; 
– Commercial and industrial sector – charges over business assets such as premises, stock and debtors, and third party credit protection 
(i.e. guarantees); 
– Commercial real estate sector – charges over the properties being financed; and, 
– Over-The-Counter (OTC ) trading exposures – cash; direct debt obligation government (G14+) bonds denominated in the domestic currency of the
issuing country, debt issued by supranationals and letters of credit issued by an institution with a long-term unsecured debt rating of A+/ A3 or better. 
Valuation of the collateral and security taken is within agreed parameters. 
Before reliance is placed on third party protection in the form of bank, government or corporate guarantees or credit derivative protection from financial
intermediary counterparties, a credit assessment is undertaken. Eligibility parameters for guarantees and credit derivative are similar to those applied to
collateral held against OTC traded exposures. 
Any collateral taken in respect of OTC trading exposures will be subject to a ‘haircut’ which is negotiated at the time of signing the collateral agreement. 
A haircut is the valuation percentage applicable to each type of collateral and will be largely based on liquidity and price volatility of the underlying security. 
The Group also uses various forms of specialised legal agreements to reduce risk, including entering into master netting agreement with counterparties,
which the Group uses to restrict its exposure to credit losses. Group policy requires all netting arrangements to be legally documented. The ISDA Master
Agreement is the Group’ s preferred agreement for documenting OTC activity. It provides the contractual framework within which dealing activities across
a full range of OTC products are conducted and contractually binds both parties to apply close-out netting across all outstanding transactions covered by
an agreement if either party defaults or other pre-determined events occur. In the normal course of events, where the master agreement is ISDA, the
collateral document will be the ISDA Credit Support Annex (CSA). The collateral document must give Barclays the power to realise any collateral placed
with it in the event of the failure of the counterparty, and to place further collateral when requested or in the event of insolvency, administration or similar
processes, as well as in the case of early termination. 
Security structures and legal covenants are subject to regular review, at least annually, to ensure that they remain fit for purpose and remain consistent
with accepted local market practice. 
Any properties repossessed are made available for sale in an orderly and timely fashion, with any proceeds realised being used to reduce or repay the
outstanding loan. For business customers, in some circumstances,where excess funds are available after repayment in full of the outstanding loan, they
are offered to any other, lower ranked, secured lenders. Any additional funds are returned to the customer. Barclays does not, as a rule, occupy
repossessed properties for its business use. 
Maximum exposure to credit risk before collateral held or other credit enhancements
For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount. For financial guarantees granted, the
maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount that Barclays would have to pay if the guarantees were to be called upon. For loan commitments
and other credit related commitments that are irrevocable over the life of the respective facilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount
of the committed facilities.
The following table presents the maximum exposure at 31 December 2007 and 2006 to credit risk of balance sheet and off balance sheet financial
instruments, before taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements and after allowance for impairment and netting where appropriate.  3

47 Credit risk (continued)
Whilst the Group’ s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of the assets, or, in the case of off-balance sheet items the amount guaranteed,
committed, accepted or endorsed, in most cases the likely exposure is far less due to collateral, credit enhancements and other actions taken to mitigate
the Group’ s exposure, described below for each class of financial instrument: 
Asset Nature of collateral obtained or other credit risk mitigation
Cash with central banks, items Due to the nature of the counterparties, collateral is generally not sought on these balances which are 
in the course of collection, and considered to be low risk. 
loans and advances to banks
Trading portfolio The credit risk of these assets is reflected in their fair values. No collateral or enhancements are obtained
directly from the issuer or counterparty but may be implicit in the terms of the instrument. 
Financial assets designated at fair value The credit risk of these assets is reflected in their fair values. Debt securities may be collateralised, according to
held on own account their terms. Loans and advances included in this category may be collateralised. 
Derivatives Credit risk is also minimised where possible through netting agreements whereby derivative assets and
liabilities with the same counterparty can be offset. Collateral will also be sought, depending on the
creditworthiness of the counterparty and/or nature of the transaction. 
Loans and advances to customers 
– Residential mortgage loans These are secured by a fixed charge over the property. In addition, portfolios may be securitised. 
– Credit card receivables This lending is generally unsecured. Balances may be securitised. 
– Other personal lending In general this is unsecured. For certain personal lending, a charge over the borrower’s property or other
assets may be sought. 
– Wholesale and corporate loans Various forms of collateral may be sought for these loans, often in the form of a fixed charge over the 
and advances borrower’s property and a floating charge over the current assets of a corporate borrower. Loan covenants
may be put in place to safeguard the bank’s financial position. If the exposure is sufficiently large, either
individually or at the portfolio level, credit protection in the form of guarantees, credit derivatives or
insurance may be taken out. 
– Finance lease receivables The net investment in the lease is secured through retention of legal title to the leased assets. 
Available for sale assets No collateral or enhancements are obtained although collateral may be inherent in the structure of the asset. 
Reverse repurchase agreements and These loans are fully collateralised with the securities legally transferred to the Group. The level of collateral 
cash collateral on securities borrowed is monitored daily and further collateral calls made when required. 
Off balance sheet The Group applies the same risk management policies for off balance sheet risks as it does for its on balance
sheet risks. Collateral may be sought, depending on the strength of the counterparty and/or nature of 
the transaction. 
Acceptances and endorsements Amounts paid are normally repaid by the customer on presentation. 
Guarantees and letters of credit The Group is only required to meet its obligations should the customer default, in which case the Group will 
pledged as security generally have recourse to the customer. 
Commitments These are commitments to future lending and are subject to the Group’ s normal lending policies including
taking collateral depending on the customers’ circumstances. 
Financial assets that would be past due or impaired had their terms not been renegotiated
Financial assets are generally renegotiated either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to an adverse change in the circumstances of
the borrower. In the latter case renegotiation can result in an extension of the due date of payment or repayment plans under which the Group offers a
concessionary rate of interest to genuinely distressed borrowers. This will result in the asset continuing to be overdue (delinquent) and will be individually
impaired where the renegotiated payments of interest and principal will not recover the original carrying amount of the asset. In other cases, renegotiation
will lead to a new agreement, which is treated as a new loan.
Credit risk concentrations
A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are
engaged, otherwise, the product type in accordance with the manner in which the Group manages credit risk.

(b) Financial assets that are past due but not individually impaired 
An age analysis of financial assets that are past due but not individually impaired is set out below.
For the purposes of this analysis an asset is considered past due and included below when any payment due under the strict contractual terms is received
late or missed. The amount included is the entire financial asset, not just the payment, of principal or interest or both, overdue.
The Group expends considerable effort in monitoring overdue assets. Assets may be overdue for a number of reasons, including late processing of
payments or documentation, for example, over weekends and holiday periods. Where assets are considered to be uncollectable they are subject to
individual impairment.
Trading portfolio and derivative assets are measured on a fair value basis such that their carrying amount reflects expected defaults. Amounts that are
past due as a result of counterparty credit issues are not significant.

Collateral and other credit enhancements held
Financial assets that are past due or individually assessed as impaired may be partially or fully collateralised or subject to other forms of credit
enhancement.
Assets in these categories subject to collateralisation are mainly corporate and residential mortgage loans. 
For corporate loans, security may be in the form of floating charges where the value of the collateral varies with the level of assets such as inventory and
receivables held by the customer. For these and other reasons collateral given is only accurately valued on origination of the loan or in the course of
enforcement actions and as a result it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the collateral held.
A description and the estimated fair value of collateral held in respect of residential mortgage loans that are past due or individually assessed as impaired
was as follows:
2007 2006
Fair Fair

Nature of assets
– Residential Property 6,488 6,183
Total 6,488 6,183
Collateral included in the above table reflects the Group’ s interest in the property in the event of default.That held in the form of charges against residential
property in the UK is restricted to the outstanding loan balance. In other territories, where the Group is not obliged to return any sale proceeds to the
mortgagee, the full estimated fair value has been included.
Collateral and other credit enhancements obtained
The carrying value of assets held by the Group as at 31st December 2007 as a result of the enforcement of collateral was as follows:

The Group does not use assets obtained in its operations. Assets obtained are normally sold, generally at auction, or realised in an orderly manner for the
maximum benefit of the Group, the borrower and the borrower’ s other creditors in accordance with the relevant insolvency regulations. Notes to the accounts

This is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its obligations when they fall due and to replace funds when they are withdrawn, with consequent failure
to repay depositors and fulfil commitments to lend. The risk that it will be unable to meet its obligations is inherent in all banking operations and can be
impacted by a range of institution specific and market-wide events including, but not limited to, credit events, merger and acquisition activity, systemic
shocks and natural disasters.
Intraday liquidity
The need to monitor, manage and control intraday liquidity in real time is recognised by the Group as a mission critical process: any failure to meet specific
intraday commitments would have significant consequences.
The Group policy is that each operation must ensure that it has access to sufficient intraday liquidity to meet any obligations it may have to clearing and
settlement systems. Major currency payment flows and payment system collateral are monitored and managed in real time to ensure that at all times
there is sufficient collateral to make payments. 
Day to day funding
Day to day funding is managed by short-term mismatch limits for the next day, week and month which control cash flows to ensure that requirements
can be met. These requirements include replenishment of funds as they mature or are borrowed by customers. The Group maintains an active presence
in global money markets and monitors and manages the wholesale money market capacity for the Group’ s name to enable that to happen. 
In addition to cash flow management, Barclays Treasury also monitors unmatched medium-term assets and the level and type of undrawn lending
commitments, the usage of overdraft facilities and the impact of contingent liabilities such as standby letters of credit and guarantees.
Liquid Assets
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable assets including UK, US and Euro-area government bonds that can be sold or funded on a secured
basis as protection against any unforeseen interruption to cash flow. The Group accesses secured funding markets in these assets on a regular basis to
ensure market access. The Group does not rely on committed funding lines for protection against unforeseen interruption to cash flow. 
Diversification of liquidity sources
Sources of liquidity are regularly reviewed to maintain a wide diversification by currency, geography, provider, product and term. In addition, to avoid
reliance on a particular group of customers or market sectors, the distribution of sources and the maturity profile of deposits are also carefully managed.
Important factors in assuring liquidity are competitive rates and the maintenance of depositors’ confidence. Such confidence is based on a number of
factors including the Group’ s reputation and relationship with those clients, the strength of earnings and the Group’ s financial position. 
Structural liquidity
An important source of structural liquidity is provided by our core retail deposits in the UK, Europe and Africa, mainly current accounts and savings
accounts. Although current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice, the Group’ s broad base of customers – numerically
and by depositor type – helps to protect against unexpected fluctuations. Such accounts form a stable funding base for the Group’ s operations and
liquidity needs.
The Group policy is to fund the balance sheet of the retail and commercial bank on a global basis with customer deposits without recourse to the
wholesale markets. This provides protection from the liquidity risk of wholesale market funding. The exception to this policy is ABSA, which has a large
portion of wholesale funding due to the structural nature of the South African financial sector.
Stress tests 
Stress testing is undertaken to assess and plan for the impact of various scenarios which may put the Group’ s liquidity at risk.
Treasury develops and monitors a range of stress tests on the Group’ s projected cash flows. These stress scenarios include Barclays-specific scenarios
such an unexpected rating downgrade and operational problems, and external scenarios such as Emerging Market crises, payment system disruption
and macroeconomic shocks. The output informs both the liquidity mismatch limits and the Group’ s contingency funding plan. This is maintained by
Treasury and is aligned with the Group and country business resumption plans to encompass decision-making authorities, internal and external
communication and, in the event of a systems failure, the restoration of liquidity management and payment systems.
The ability to raise funds is in part dependent on maintaining the Bank’ s credit rating. The funding impact of a credit downgrade is regularly estimated.
Whilst the impact of a single downgrade may affect the price at which funding is available, the effect on liquidity is not considered significant in overall
Group terms.

Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities
The table below provides detail on the contractual maturity of all financial instruments and other assets and liabilities. Derivatives (other than those
designated in a hedging relationship) and trading portfolio assets and liabilities which are included in the on demand column at their fair value. 
Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for settlement according to such maturity 
and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value. Derivatives designated in a hedging relationship are included according to their
contractual maturity.
Financial assets designated at fair value in respect of linked liabilities to customers under investment contracts have been included in Other assets and
Other liabilities as the Group is not exposed to liquidity risk arising from them; any request for funds from creditors would be met by simultaneously
liquidating or transferring the related investment.

49 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)
Notes
a Fair value approximates carrying value due to the short-term nature of these financial assets and liabilities.
b Financial instruments at fair value (including those held for trading, designated at fair value, derivatives and available for sale) are either priced with
reference to a quoted market price for that instrument or by using a valuation model. Where the fair value is calculated using a valuation model, the
methodology is to calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value.
The expected cash flows for each contract are determined either directly by reference to actual cash flows implicit in observable market prices or
through modelling cash flows using appropriate financial-markets pricing models. Wherever possible these models use as their basis observable
market prices and rates including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.
The process of calculating fair value on illiquid instruments or from a valuation model may require estimation of certain pricing parameters,
assumptions or model characteristics. These estimates are calibrated against industry standards, economic models and observed transaction prices.
Changes to assumptions or estimated levels can potentially impact the fair value of an instrument as reported. The effect of changing these
assumptions, for those financial instruments for which the fair values were measured using valuation techniques that are determined in full or in part
on assumptions that are not supported by observable market prices, to a range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions, would be to increase
the fair value by up to £1.5bn (2006: £0.1bn) or to decrease the fair value by up to £1.2bn (2006: £0.1bn). 
These variations in the assumptions have been estimated on a product by product basis and form part of the Bank’ s internal control processes over
the determination of fair value. 
The valuation model used for a particular instrument, the quality and liquidity of market data used for pricing, other fair value adjustments not
specifically captured by the model, market data and assumptions or estimates in these are all subject to internal review and approval procedures and
consistent application between accounting periods.
The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price (the fair value at initial recognition)
and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently
recognised, was as follows:
2007 2006
At 31st December £m £m
At 1st January 534 260
New transactions 134 359
Amounts recognised in profit or loss during the year (514) (85)
At 31st December 154 534
The net asset fair value position of the related financial instruments increased by £2,842m for the year ended 31st December 2007 (31st December
2006: £2,814m). In many cases these changes in fair values were offset by changes in fair values of other financial instruments, which were priced 
in active markets or valued by using a valuation technique which is supported by observable market prices or rates, or by transactions which have
been realised.
c The fair value for loans and advances, and other lending (including reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed) is
calculated using discounted cash flows, applying either market rates where practicable or, where the counterparty is a bank, rates currently offered by
other financial institutions for placings with similar characteristics. In many cases the fair value approximates carrying value because the instruments
are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently.
d The fair value of customer accounts other deposits and other borrowings (including repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lent) is
estimated using market rates at the balance sheet date. The fair value of these instruments approximate to carrying amount in most cases because,
in general, they are short term in nature and reprice frequently.
e Fair values of short-term debt securities in issue are approximately equal to their carrying amount. Fair values of other debt securities in issue are
based on quoted prices where available, or where these are unavailable, are estimated using other valuation techniques.
f The calculated fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital were based upon quoted market rates for the issue
concerned or equivalent issues with similar terms and conditions.
The Group considers that, given the lack of an established market, the diversity of fee structures and the difficulty of separating the value of the
instruments from the value of the overall transaction, it is not meaningful to provide an estimate of the fair value of financial commitments and
contingent liabilities.

50 Capital Management 
Barclays operates a centralised capital management model, considering both regulatory and economic capital. The capital management strategy is to
continue to maximise shareholder value through optimising both the level and mix of capital resources. Decisions on the allocation of capital resources
are conducted as part of the strategic planning review. 
The Group’ s capital management objectives are to:
– Support the Group’s AA credit rating.
– Maintain sufficient capital resources to support the Group’s risk appetite and economic capital requirements.
– Maintain sufficient capital resources to meet the FSA ’s minimum regulatory capital requirements and the US Federal Reserve Bank’s requirements
that a financial holding company be well capitalised.
– Ensure locally regulated subsidiaries can meet their minimum capital requirements.
External Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Group is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), following guidelines developed by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) and implemented in the UK via European Union Directives. 
Minimum requirements under FSA ’ s Basel rules are expressed as a ratio of capital resources to risk weighted assets (Risk Asset Ratio). Risk weighted
assets are a function of risk weights applied to the Group’ s assets using calculations developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 
Under Basel II, effective from 1st January 2008, the Group has been granted approval by the FSA to adopt the advanced approaches to credit and
operational risk management. Pillar 1 risk weighted assets will be generated using the Group’ s risk models. Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements under
Basel II are Pillar 1 risk weighted assets multiplied by 8%, the internationally agreed minimum ratio.
Under Pillar 2 of Basel II, the Group is subject to an overall regulatory capital requirement based on individual capital guidance (‘ICG’) received from 
the FSA. The ICG imposes additional capital requirements in excess of Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements. Barclays received its ICG from the FSA 
in December 2007. 
Outside the UK, the Group has operations (and main regulators) located in continental Europe, in particular France, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy
(local central banks and other regulatory authorities); Asia Pacific (various regulatory authorities including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority , the Japanese
FSA and the Monetary Authority of Singapore); Africa, where the Group’ s operations are headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa (The South African
Reserve Bank and the Financial Services Board (FSB)) and the United States of America (the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and
the Securities and Exchange Commission). 
The Group manages its capital resources to ensure that those Group entities that are subject to local capital adequacy regulation in individual countries
meet their minimum capital requirements. Local management manages compliance with subsidiary entity minimum regulatory capital requirements
with reporting to local Asset and Liability Committees and to Treasury Committee, as required.

Insurance businesses
Insurance businesses are subject to separate regulation regarding Capital management and have constraints on the transfer of capital. Capital resource
requirements are assessed at company level in accordance with local laws and regulations. However, the requirement is that each life fund should be able
to meet its own liabilities. In the event that this should not be the case, shareholders’ equity would be required to meet its liabilities to the extent that they
could not otherwise be met.
The capital resource requirement of the insurance businesses at 31st December 2007 was £216m (31st December 2006: £225m). 3

51 Segmental reporting
Business segments
The Group reports the results of its operations through seven business segments: UK Banking, Barclaycard, International Retail and Commercial Banking,
Barclays Capital, Barclays Global Investors, Barclays Wealth, and Head Office and other operations.
UK Banking provides banking solutions to Barclays UK retail and commercial banking customers. Barclaycard provides credit card services across Europe
and the United States. International Retail and Commercial Banking provides banking services to personal and corporate customers in Europe, Africa and
the Middle East. Barclays Capital conducts the Group’ s investment banking business providing corporate, institutional and government clients with
financing and risk management products. Barclays Global Investors provides investment management products and services to international institutional
clients. Barclays Wealth provides banking and asset management services to affluent and high net worth clients. Head Office functions and other
operations comprise all the Group’ s central function costs and other central items including businesses in transition.
During 2007 Barclays realigned a number of reportable business segments to better reflect the type of client served, the nature of the products offered
and the associated risks and rewards. The changes have no impact on the Group Income Statement or Balance Sheet, and are summarised as follows:
UK Retail Banking. The unsecured lending business, previously managed and reported within Barclaycard and the Barclays Financial Planning business,
previously managed and reported within Barclays Wealth are now managed and reported within UK Retail Banking. The changes combine these products
with related products already offered by UK Retail Banking. In the UK certain UK Premier customers are now managed and reported within Barclays Wealth. 
Barclaycard. The unsecured lending portfolio, previously managed and reported within Barclaycard, is now managed and reported within UK Retail Banking. 
International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa. A number of high net worth customers are now managed and reported within Barclays
Wealth in order to better match client profiles to wealth services. 
Barclays Wealth. In the UK and Western Europe certain Premier and high net worth customers are now managed and reported within Barclays Wealth
having been previously reported within UK Retail Banking and International Retail and Commercial Banking – excluding Absa. 
The Barclays Financial Planning business previously managed and reported within Barclays Wealth, is now managed and reported within UK Retail
Banking. Finally with effect from 1st January 2007 Barclays Wealth – closed life assurance activities continues to be managed within Barclays Wealth and
for reporting purposes has been combined rather than being reported separately.
The structure and reporting remains unchanged for Barclays Commercial Bank, International Retail and Commercial Banking – Absa, Barclays Capital and
Barclays Global Investors.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis. Internal charges and transfer pricing adjustments are reflected in the
performance of each business. Head office functions and other operations contains a centralised treasury function, which deals with the Group’ s funding
requirements. The funding requirements of each business segment reflects funding at market rates and not internally generated transfer prices and is
therefore not separately disclosed within inter-segment net income.

Sterling £1 Preference Shares
1,000 Sterling cumulative callable preference shares of £1 each (the ‘£1 Preference Shares’) were issued on 31st December 2004 at nil premium.
The £1 Preference Shares entitle the holders thereof to receive sterling cumulative cash dividends out of distributable profits of Barclays Bank PLC, semi-
annually at a rate reset semi-annually equal to the sterling interbank offered rate for six-month sterling deposits.
Barclays Bank PLC shall be obliged to pay such dividends if (1) it has profits available for the purpose of distribution under the Companies Act 1985 as at
each dividend payment date and (2) it is solvent on the relevant dividend payment date, provided that a capital regulations condition is satisfied on such
dividend payment date. The dividends shall not be due and payable on the relevant dividend payment date except to the extent that Barclays Bank PLC
could make such payment and still be solvent immediately thereafter. Barclays Bank PLC shall be considered solvent on any date if (1) it is able to pay its
debts to senior creditors as they fall due and (2) its auditors have reported within the previous six months that its assets exceed its liabilities.
If Barclays Bank PLC shall not pay, or shall pay only in part, a dividend for a period of seven days or more after the due date for payment, the holders of the
£1 Preference Shares may institute proceedings for the winding-up of Barclays Bank PLC. No remedy against Barclays Bank PLC shall be available to the
holder of any £1 Preference Shares for the recovery of amounts owing in respect of £1 Preference Shares other than the institution of proceedings for the
winding-up of Barclays Bank PLC and/or proving in such winding-up.
On a winding-up or other return of capital (other than a redemption or purchase by Barclays Bank PLC of any of its issued shares, or a reduction of share
capital, permitted by the Articles of Barclays Bank PLC and under applicable law), the assets of Barclays Bank PLC available to shareholders shall be applied
in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares and any other class of shares in the capital of Barclays Bank PLC then in issue ranking junior to
the £1 Preference Shares on such a return of capital and pari passu on such a return of capital with the holders of any other class of shares in the capital of
Barclays Bank PLC then in issue (other than any class of shares in the capital of Barclays Bank PLC then in issue ranking in priority to the £1 Preference
Shares on a winding-up or other such return of capital), in payment to the holders of the £1 Preference Shares of a sum equal to the aggregate of: (1) an
amount equal to the dividends accrued thereon for the then current dividend period (and any accumulated arrears thereof) to the date of the
commencement of the winding-up or other such return of capital; and (2) an amount equal to £1 per £1 Preference Share.
After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of the £1 Preference Shares will have no right or
claim to any of the remaining assets of Barclays Bank PLC and will not be entitled to any further participation in such return of capital. The £1 Preference
Shares are redeemable at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, in whole but not in part only, subject to the Companies Act and its Articles. Holders of the £1
Preference Shares are not entitled to receive notice of, or to attend, or vote at, any general meeting of Barclays Bank PLC. 274 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007

Barclays Bank PLC.
On a winding-up of Barclays Bank PLC or other return of capital (other than a redemption or purchase of shares of Barclays Bank PLC, or a reduction of
share capital), a holder of Preference Shares will rank in the application of assets of Barclays Bank PLC available to shareholders (1) junior to the holder of

Barclays Bank PLC (together, the ‘RCIs’) would, for the purposes only of calculating the amounts payable in respect of such securities on a winding-up of
Barclays Bank PLC, subject to limited exceptions and to the extent that the TONs and the RCIs are then in issue, rank pari passu with the holders of the
most senior class or classes of preference shares then in issue in the capital of Barclays Bank PLC. Accordingly, the holders of the preference shares would
rank equally with the holders of such TONs and RCIs on such a winding-up of Barclays Bank PLC (unless one or more classes of shares of Barclays Bank
PLC ranking in priority to the preference shares are in issue at the time of such winding-up, in which event the holders of such TONs and RCIs would rank
equally with the holders of such shares and in priority to the holders of the preference shares).
Subject to such ranking, in such event, holders of the preference shares will be entitled to receive out of assets of Barclays Bank PLC available for
distributions to shareholders, liquidating distributions in the amount of ¤10,000 per 4.875% Preference Share, ¤10,000 per 4.75% Preference Share,
£10,000 per 6.0% Preference Share, US$10,000 per 6.278% Preference Share, US$25 per 6.625% Preference Share, US$25 per 7.1% Preference Share
and US$25 per 7.75% Preference Share, plus, in each case, an amount equal to the accrued dividend for the then current dividend period to the date of
the commencement of the winding-up or other such return of capital. If a dividend is not paid in full on any preference shares on any dividend payment
date, then a dividend restriction shall apply.
This dividend restriction will mean that neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may (a) declare or pay a dividend (other than payment by Barclays PLC
of a final dividend declared by its shareholders prior to the relevant dividend payment date, or a dividend paid by Barclays Bank PLC to Barclays PLC or to a
wholly owned subsidiary) on any of their respective ordinary shares, other preference shares or other share capital or (b) redeem, purchase, reduce or
otherwise acquire any of their respective share capital, other than shares of Barclays Bank PLC held by Barclays PLC or a wholly owned subsidiary, until the
earlier of (1) the date on which Barclays Bank PLC next declares and pays in full a preference dividend and (2) the date on or by which all the preference
shares are redeemed in full or purchased by Barclays Bank PLC.
Holders of the preference shares are not entitled to receive notice of, or to attend, or vote at, any general meeting of Barclays Bank PLC. Barclays Bank PLC
is not permitted to create a class of shares ranking as regards participation in the profits or assets of Barclays Bank PLC in priority to the preference shares,
save with the sanction of a special resolution of a separate general meeting of the holders of the preference shares (requiring a majority of not less than
three-fourths of the holders of the preference shares voting at the separate general meeting), or with the consent in writing of the holders of three-
fourths of the preference shares.
Except as described above, the holders of the preference shares have no right to participate in the surplus assets of Barclays Bank PLC. 276 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007

preceding six months, a dividend has not been declared or paid on any class of shares of Barclays PLC. 3

n Financial risks
The only significant financial instruments that are held by Barclays Bank PLC and not Barclays PLC are investments in Barclays PLC ordinary shares, dealt
with as trading portfolio equity assets and available for sale financial investments as appropriate.
There consequently are no significant differences in exposures to market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and the fair value of financial instruments between
Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC, and no differences in the manner in which these financial risks are managed. Therefore the disclosures regarding
financial risks appearing in Notes 45 to 48 are in all material respects the same for Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays PLC.
o Capital
The Barclays Bank PLC Group’ s policies and objectives for managing capital are the same as those for the Barclays PLC Group, disclosed in Note 50.

Acts 1948 to 1980. The Company is registered under company number
48839. The Company was reregistered as Barclays PLC on 1st January 1985.
The objects of the Company are set out in full in clause 4 of its
Memorandum of Association which provides, among other things, that
the Company’ s objects are to carry on business as an investment and
holding company in all its aspects.
The Company may, by special resolution, amend its Articles of Association.
The Company is proposing to adopt new Articles of Association at its
annual general meeting in 2008, to update its Articles of Association for
the operative provisions of the Companies Act 2006. A summary of the
proposed changes may be found in the notice of annual general meeting
that accompanies this report.
Directors
(i) The minimum number of Directors (excluding alternate Directors) is
five. There is no maximum limit. There is no age limit for Directors.
(ii) Excluding executive remuneration and any other entitlement to
remuneration for extra services (including service on board committees)
under the Articles, a Director is entitled to a fee at a rate determined 
by the Board but the aggregate fees paid to all Directors shall not exceed
£1,000,000 per annum or such higher amount as may be approved 
by an ordinary resolution of the Company. Each Director is entitled to
reimbursement for all travelling, hotel and other expenses properly
incurred by him/her in or about the performance of his/her duties.
(iii) No auditor or member of a firm of auditors of the Group of companies
may be appointed a Director. A Director may hold any other office of the
Company on such terms as the Board shall determine.
(iv) At each annual general meeting (‘ AGM’) of the Company, one third of
the Directors (rounded down) are required to retire from office by rotation
and may offer themselves for re-election. The Directors so retiring are
those who have been longest in office (and in the case of equality of
service length are selected by lot). Other than a retiring Director, no person
shall (unless recommended by the Board) be eligible for election unless 
a member notifies the Company Secretary in advance of his/her intention
to propose a person for election.
(v) The Board has the power to appoint additional Directors or to fill a
casual vacancy amongst the Directors. Any Director so appointed holds
office until the next AGM, when he/she may offer himself/herself for 
re-election. He/she is not taken into account in determining the number 
of Directors retiring by rotation.
(vi) The Board may appoint any Director to any executive position or
employment in the Company on such terms as they determine.
(vii) A Director may appoint either another Director or some other person
approved by the Board to act as his/her alternate with power to attend
Board meetings and generally to exercise the functions of the appointing
Director in his/her absence (other than the power to appoint an alternate).
(viii) A Director may hold positions with or be interested in other
companies and, subject to legislation applicable to the Company and the
FSA ’ s requirements, may contract with the Company or any other
company in which the Company is interested. A Director may not vote or
count towards the quorum on any resolution concerning any proposal in
which he/she (or any person connected with him/her) has a material
interest (other than by virtue of his/her interest in securities of the
Company) or if he/she has a duty which conflicts or may conflict with the
interests of the Company, unless the resolution relates to any proposal:
(a) to indemnify a Director or provide him/her with a guarantee or
security in respect of money lent by him/her to, or any obligation
incurred by him/her or any other person for the benefit of (or at 
the request of), the Company (or any other member of the Group);
(b) to indemnify or give security or a guarantee to a third party in respect
of a debt or obligation of the Company (or any other member of the
Group) for which the Director has personally assumed responsibility;
284 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
(c) to indemnify a Director or provide him/her with a guarantee or
security for any liability which he/she may incur in the performance
of his/her duties or to obtain insurance against such a liability;
(d) involving the acquisition by a Director of any securities of the
Company pursuant to an offer to existing holders of securities 
or to the public;
(e) that the Director underwrite any issue of securities of the Company
(or any of its subsidiaries);
(f) concerning any other company in which the Director is interested 
as an officer or creditor or shareholder but, broadly, only if he/she
(together with his/her connected persons) is directly or indirectly
interested in less than 1% of either any class of the issued equity
share capital or of the voting rights of that company;
(g) concerning any superannuation fund or retirement, death or
disability benefits scheme under which a Director may benefit or any
employees’ share scheme, so long as any such fund or scheme does
not give additional advantages to the Director which are not granted
to the employees who are in the fund or scheme; and
(h) concerning any other arrangement for the benefit of employees of
the Company (or any other member of the Group) under which the
Director benefits or stands to benefit in a similar manner to the
employees concerned and which does not give the Director any
advantage which the employees to whom the arrangement relates
would not receive.
(ix) A Director may not vote or be counted in the quorum on any resolution
which concerns his/her own employment or appointment to any office of
the Company or any other company in which the Company is interested.
(x) Subject to applicable legislation, the provisions described in sub-
paragraphs (viii) and (ix) may be relaxed or suspended by an ordinary
resolution of the Company.
(xi) A Director is required to hold an interest in ordinary shares having a
nominal value of at least £500, which currently equates to 2,000 Ordinary
Shares. A Director may act before acquiring those Ordinary Shares but
must acquire the qualification Ordinary Shares within two months from
his or her appointment. Where a Director is unable to acquire the requisite
number of Ordinary Shares within that time owing to legislative, regulatory
or share-dealing restrictions, he/she must acquire the Ordinary Shares as
soon as reasonably practicable once the restriction(s) end.
(xii) The Board may exercise all of the powers of the Company to borrow
money, to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled
capital and to issue debentures and other securities.
Classes of share
The Company has two classes of shares, Ordinary Shares and Staff Shares,
to which the provisions set out below apply:
(i) Dividends
Subject to the provisions of the Articles and applicable legislation, the
Company in general meeting may declare dividends by ordinary resolution,
but such dividend may not exceed the amount recommended by the
Board. The Board may also pay interim or final dividends if it appears they
are justified by the Company’ s financial position.
The profits which are resolved to be distributed in respect of any period 
are applied first in payment of a fixed dividend of 20% per annum on the
Staff Shares and then in payment of dividends on the Ordinary Shares. 
No dividend will be declared on the Staff Shares unless a dividend is also
paid on the Ordinary Shares in respect of that period. Any Staff Share held
by anyone not an employee of Barclays or Barclays Bank (an ‘Employee’)
will be treated as a Ordinary Share in respect of dividends, up to a maximum
dividend of 6% for the year upon the amount paid up on that share.
All unclaimed dividends payable in respect of a share may be invested or
otherwise made use of by the Board for the benefit of the Company until
claimed. If a dividend is not claimed after 12 years of it becoming payable,
it is forfeited and reverts to the Company.
The Board may (although it currently does not), with the approval of an
ordinary resolution of the Company, offer shareholders the right to choose
to receive an allotment of additional fully paid Ordinary Shares instead of
cash in respect of all or part of any dividend. 4
Shareholder information
(v) Redemption and Purchase
Subject to applicable legislation and the rights of the other shareholders,
any share may be issued on terms that it is, at the option of the Company
or the holder of such share, redeemable. The Company currently has no
redeemable shares in issue.
The Company may purchase its own shares subject to the provisions of
applicable legislation, the Articles and the approval of any class of
convertible shares in issue (by extraordinary resolution or written consent
of 75% of such class).
(vi) Calls on capital
The Directors may make calls upon the members in respect of any monies
unpaid on their shares. A person upon whom a call is made remains liable
even if the shares in respect of which the call is made have been
transferred. Interest will be chargeable on any unpaid amount called at a
rate determined by the Board (of not more than 20%).
If a member fails to pay any call in full (following notice from the Board that
such failure will result in forfeiture of the relevant shares), such shares
(including any dividends declared but not paid) may be forfeited by a
resolution of the Board, and will become the property of the Company.
Forfeiture shall not absolve a previous member for amounts payable by
him/her (which may continue to accrue interest).
The Company also has a lien over all partly paid shares of the Company for
all monies payable or called on that share and over the debts and liabilities
of a member to the Company. If any monies which are the subject of the
lien remain unpaid after a notice from the Board demanding payment,
Barclays may sell such shares.
(vii) Variation of Rights
The rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the sanction
of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders
of the shares of that class.
The rights of shares shall not (unless expressly provided by the rights
attached to such shares) be deemed varied by the creation of further
shares ranking equally with them.
Annual and extraordinary general meetings
The Company is required to hold a general meeting each year as its AGM
in addition to other meetings (called extraordinary general meetings) as
the Directors think fit. The type of the meeting will be specified in the
notice calling it. Under the Companies Act 1985, not more than 15
months may elapse between the date of one AGM and the next. Under the
Companies Act 2006, the AGM must be held within six months of the
financial year end. An extraordinary general meeting may be convened by
the Board on requisition in accordance with the applicable legislation.
In the case of an AGM or a meeting for the passing of a special resolution
(i.e. requiring the consent of a 75% majority) 21 clear days’ notice is
required. In other cases 14 clear days’ notice is required. The notice must
be in writing and must specify the place, the day and the hour of the
meeting, and the general nature of the business to be transacted. A notice
convening a meeting to pass an extraordinary or special resolution shall
specify the intention to propose the resolution as such. The accidental
omission to give notice of a general meeting or the non-receipt of such
notice will not invalidate the proceedings at such meeting.
Subject as noted above, all shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at
general meetings. The Articles do, however, provide that arrangements
may be made for simultaneous attendance at a general meeting at a place
other than that specified in the notice of meeting, in which case
shareholders may be excluded from the specified place.
(ii) Voting
Every member who is present in person or represented at any general
meeting of the Company and who is entitled to vote has one vote on a
show of hands. On a poll, every member who is present or represented has
one vote for every share held. Any joint holder may vote in respect of jointly
owned shares, but the vote of the senior holder (as determined by order in
the share register) shall take precedence. If any sum payable remains
unpaid in relation to a member’ s shareholding, that member is not entitled
to vote that share or exercise any other right in relation to a meeting of the
Company unless the Board otherwise determine.
If any member, or any other person appearing to be interested in any of the
Company’ s Ordinary Shares, is served with a notice under Section 793 of
the Companies Act 2006 and does not supply the Company with the
information required in the notice, then the Board, in its absolute
discretion, may direct that that member shall not be entitled to attend or
vote at any meeting of the Company.
The Board may further direct that if the shares of the defaulting member
represent 0.25% or more of the issued shares of the relevant class, that
dividends or other monies payable on those shares shall be retained by the
Company until the direction ceases to have effect and that no transfer of
those shares shall be registered (other than certain specified ‘approved
transfers’). A direction ceases to have effect seven days after the Company
has received the information requested, or when the Company is notified
that an ‘approved transfer’ to a third party has occurred, or as the Board
otherwise determines.
(iii) Transfers
Certificated shares shall be transferred in writing in any usual or other form
approved by the Board and executed by or on behalf of the transferor.
Transfers of uncertificated shares shall be made in accordance with the
applicable regulations. The Board may make any arrangements to regulate
and evidence the transfer of shares as they consider fit in accordance with
applicable legislation and the rules of the FSA.
In order to transfer a Staff Share, the transferor must serve a notice on the
Company (a ‘Transfer Notice’) indicating his/her wish to transfer such
share at such sum as he/she specifies as the fair value (subject to a
maximum amount determined in accordance with the Articles). The Staff
Shares must be transferred at the specified fair value to such Employee as
is willing to purchase it and who has been identified by the Board within 60
days of the Transfer Notice. If the Company has not found a person willing
to purchase the share within 60 days of the Transfer Notice, the Staff
Share may be freely transferred at any price (although the Board may
decline to prepare or register the transfer). Such a procedure may also be
initiated by the Board if a Staff Share is held by a non-Employee.
Registration of shares may be suspended, subject to applicable legislation,
for such periods as the Board may determine (but for not more than 30
days in any calendar year).
The Board is not bound to register a transfer of partly paid shares, or fully
paid shares in exceptional circumstances approved by the FSA. The Board
may also decline to register an instrument of transfer of certificated shares
unless it is duly stamped and deposited at the prescribed place and
accompanied by the share certificate(s) and such other evidence as
reasonably required by the Board to evidence right to transfer, it is in
respect of one class of shares only, and it is in favour of not more than four
transferees (except in the case of executors or trustees of a member).
(iv) Return of Capital and Liquidation
In the event of any return of capital by reduction of capital or on liquidation,
the Ordinary Shares and the Staff Shares rank equally in proportion to the
amounts paid up or credited as paid up on the shares of each class, except
that in the event of a winding up of the Company the holders of the Staff
Shares are only entitled to participate in the surplus assets available for
distribution up to the amount paid up on the Staff Shares plus 10% of 
such amount.
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 285 Shareholder information
Limitations on foreign shareholders
There are no restrictions imposed by the Company’ s Memorandum or
Articles or (subject to the effect of any economic sanctions that may be in
force from time to time) by English law which relate only to non-residents
of the UK and which limit the rights of such non-residents to hold or vote
the Company’ s Ordinary Shares.
Notices
A document or information may be sent by the Company in hard copy
form, electronic form, by being made available on a website, or by another
means agreed with the recipient. A document or information may only be
sent in electronic form to a person who has agreed to receive it in that
form or, in the case of a company, who has been deemed to have so
agreed pursuant to applicable legislation. A document or information may
only be sent by being made available on a website if the recipient has
agreed to receive it in that form or has been deemed to have so agreed
pursuant to applicable legislation, and has not revoked that agreement.
In respect of joint holdings, documents or information shall be sent to the
joint holder whose name stands first in the register.
A member who (having no registered address within the UK) has not
supplied an address in the UK at which documents or information may be
sent is not entitled to have documents or information sent to him/her.
Alteration of share capital
The Company may, by way of ordinary resolution: 
– increase its share capital by a sum to be divided into shares of an
amount prescribed by the resolution;
– consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a
larger nominal amount;
– subject to legislation, sub-divide all or part of its shares into shares of a
smaller nominal amount and may decide by that resolution that the
resulting shares have preference or other advantage or restrictions; and
– cancel any shares which, at the date of the resolution, have not been
subscribed or agreed to have been subscribed for and diminish the
amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.
The Company may also, by special resolution, reduce its share capital 
or capital redemption reserve or any share premium account or other
undistributable reserve in any manner authorised by legislation.
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, upon the recommendation of
the Board capitalise all or any part of an amount standing to the credit of a
reserve or fund to be set free for distribution provided that amounts from
the share premium account, capital redemption reserve or any profits not
available for distribution should be applied only in paying up unissued
shares issued to members and no unrealised profits shall be applied in
paying up debentures of the Company or any amount unpaid on any share
in the capital of the Company.
286 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007
Indemnity
Subject to applicable legislation, every current and former Barclays
Director, other officer and auditor of Barclays shall be indemnified by
Barclays against any liability incurred by him/her in the actual or purported
exercise of, or in connection with, his/her duties and powers.
Taxation
The following is a summary of the principal tax consequences for holders
of Ordinary Shares of Barclays PLC, Preference Shares of the Bank, or ADSs
representing such Ordinary Shares or Preference Shares, and who are
citizens or residents of the UK or US, or otherwise who are subject to UK
tax or US federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of such
securities, that own the shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes.
It is not, however, a comprehensive analysis of all the potential tax
consequences for such holders, and it does not discuss the tax
consequences of members of special classes of holders subject to special
rules or holders that, directly or indirectly, hold 10% or more of Barclays
voting stock. Investors are advised to consult their tax advisers regarding
the tax implications of their particular holdings, including the
consequences under applicable state and local law, and in particular
whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty, as defined below.
A US holder is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is, for US federal
income tax purposes, (i) a citizen or resident of the US, (ii) a US domestic
corporation, (iii) an estate whose income is subject to US federal income
tax regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if a US court can exercise primary
supervision over the trust’ s administration and one or more US persons
are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
Unless otherwise noted, the statements of tax laws set out below are
based on the tax laws of the UK in force as at 27th February 2008 and 
are subject to any subsequent changes in UK law, in particular any
announcements made in the Chancellor’ s expected UK Budget in 
March 2008.
This section is also based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations,
published rulings and court decisions (the Code), and on the Double
Taxation Convention between the UK and the US as entered into force in
March 2003 (the Treaty), all of which are subject to change, possibly on a
retroactive basis.
This section is based in part upon the representations of the ADR
Depositary and the assumption that each obligation of the Deposit
Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance
with its terms.
For purposes of the Treaty, the Estate and Gift Tax Convention between
the United Kingdom and the United States, and the Code, the holders of
ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as owners of the underlying ordinary
shares or preference shares, as the case may be. Generally, exchanges of
shares for ADRs and ADRs for shares will not be subject to US federal
income tax or to UK capital gains tax. 4
Shareholder information
T axation of UK holders
Taxation of dividends 
In accordance with UK law, Barclays PLC and the Bank pay dividends on
ordinary shares and preference shares without any deduction or
withholding tax in respect of any taxes imposed by the UK government or
any UK taxing authority.
If the shareholder is a UK resident individual liable to income tax only at the
basic rate or the lower rate, then there will be no further tax liability in
respect of the dividend received. If, however, the individual shareholder is
subject to income tax at the higher rate (currently 40%), there will be a
further liability to tax. Higher rate taxpayers are taxable on dividend
income at a special rate (currently 32.5%) against which can be offset a
tax credit of one-ninth of the cash dividend received. Tax credits are not
repayable to shareholders with no tax liability.
Taxation of shares under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Where a shareholder elects to purchase shares using their cash dividend,
the individual will be liable for income tax on dividends reinvested in the
Plan on the same basis as if they had received the cash and arranged the
investment themselves. They should accordingly include the dividend
received in their annual tax return in the normal way. The tax
consequences for a UK individual are the same as described in ‘Taxation of
dividends’ above.
Taxation of capital gains
Where shares are disposed of by open market sale, a capital gain may
result if the disposal proceeds exceed the sum of the base cost of the
shares sold and any other allowable deductions such as share dealing
costs, indexation relief (up to 5th April 1998) and taper relief (expected to
be withdrawn for disposals after  5th April 2008). To arrive at the total base
cost of any Barclays PLC shares held, the amount subscribed for rights
taken up in 1985 and 1988 must be added to the cost of all other shares
held. For this purpose, current legislation permits the market valuation at
31st March 1982 to be substituted for the original cost of shares
purchased before that date.
The calculations required to compute chargeable capital gains, particularly
taper and indexation reliefs, may be complex. Capital gains may also arise
from the gifting of shares to connected parties such as relatives (although
not spouses or civil partners) and family trusts. Shareholders are advised
to consult their personal financial adviser if further information regarding a
possible tax liability in respect of their holdings of Barclays PLC shares is
required.
Stamp duty
Stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% is normally
payable on the purchase price of shares acquired.
Inheritance tax
An individual may be liable to inheritance tax on the transfer of ordinary
shares or preference shares. Where an individual is liable, inheritance tax
may be charged on the amount by which the value of his or her estate is
reduced as a result of any transfer by way of gift or other gratuitous
transaction made by them or treated as made by them. 
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2007 287
T axation of US holders
Taxation of dividends
A US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount
of any dividend paid by Barclays PLC or the Bank, as applicable, out of its
current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal
income tax purposes). Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder in
taxable years beginning before 1st January 2011 that constitute qualified
dividend income will be taxable to the holder at a maximum tax rate of
15%, provided that the holder has a holding period of the shares or ADSs
of more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before
the ex-dividend date (or, in the case of preference shares or ADSs relating
thereto, if the dividend is attributable to a period or periods aggregating
over 366 days, provided that the holder holds the shares or ADSs for more
than 90 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before the ex-
dividend date) and meets certain other holding period requirements.
Dividends paid by Barclays or the Bank, as applicable, with respect to the
ordinary or preference shares or ADSs will generally be qualified dividend
income.
A US holder will not be subject to UK withholding tax. The US holder will
include in gross income for US federal income tax purposes the amount of
the dividend actually received from Barclays or the Bank. Dividends must
be included in income when the US holder, in the case of shares, or the
Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the
dividend, and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction
generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from
other US corporations. For foreign tax credit purposes, dividends will
generally be income from sources outside the United States and will,
depending on a US holder’ s circumstances, be either ‘passive’ or ‘general’
income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to a US
holder. 
The amount of the dividend distribution includable in income will be the
US Dollar value of the pound Sterling payments made, determined at the
spot Pound Sterling/US Dollar rate on the date the dividend distribution is
includable in income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted into US Dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from
currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the
dividend payment is includable in income to the date the payment is
converted into US Dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and, for
foreign tax credit limitation purposes, from sources within the US and will
not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend
income.
Distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as
determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a return
of capital to the extent of the US holder’ s basis in the shares or ADSs and
thereafter as capital gain. Shareholder information
Taxation of capital gains
Generally, US holders will not be subject to UK tax, but will be subject to US
tax on capital gains realised on the sale or other disposition of ordinary
shares, preference shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a noncorporate US
holder that is recognised in taxable years beginning before 1st January
2011 is generally taxed at a maximum rate of 15% where the holder has a
holding period of greater than one year. The gain or loss will generally be
income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit
limitation purposes.
Taxation of premium on redemption or purchase of shares
No refund of tax will be available under the Treaty in respect of any
premium paid on a redemption of preference shares by the Bank or on a
purchase by Barclays PLC of its own shares. For US tax purposes,
redemption premium generally will be treated as an additional amount
realised in the calculation of gain or loss.
Stamp duty
No UK stamp duty is payable on the transfer of an ADS, provided that the
separate instrument of transfer is not executed in, and remains at all times
outside, the UK.
Estate and gift tax 
Under the Estate and Gift Tax Convention between the United Kingdom
and the United States, a US holder generally is not subject to UK
inheritance tax.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting 
security holders
Other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time to
time, there are currently no UK laws, decrees or regulations which would
affect the transfer of capital or remittance of dividends, interest and other
payments to holders of Barclays securities who are not residents of the UK.
There are also no restrictions under the Articles of Association of either
Barclays PLC or the Bank, or (subject to the effect of any such economic
sanctions) under current UK laws, which relate only to non-residents of the
UK, and which limit the right of such non-residents to hold Barclays
securities or, when entitled to vote, to do so.
Documents on display
It is possible to read and copy documents that have been filed by Barclays
PLC and Barclays Bank PLC with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission at the US Securities and Exchange Commission’ s office of
Investor Education and Assistance located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington
DC 20549-0213. Please call the US Securities and Exchange Commission
at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference rooms
and their copy charges. Filings with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission are also available to the public from commercial document
retrieval services, and from the website maintained by the US Securities
and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.

Forward-looking statements
This document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A 
of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to certain of the Group’s
plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future financial condition and
performance. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they
do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes
use words such as ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’,
‘believe’, or other words of similar meaning. Examples of forward-looking statements
include, among others, statements regarding the Group’s future financial position,
income growth, impairment charges, business strategy, projected levels of growth in
the banking and financial markets, projected costs, estimates of capital expenditures,
and plans and objectives for future operations. By their nature, forward-looking
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and
circumstances, including, but not limited to, UK domestic and global economic and
business conditions, the effects of continued volatility in credit markets, market related
risks such as changes in interest rates and exchange rates, the policies and actions of
governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in legislation, the further
development of standards and interpretations under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) applicable to past, current and future periods, evolving practices with
regard to the interpretation and application of standards under IFRS, progress in the
integration of Absa into the Group’s business and the achievement of synergy targets
related to Absa, the outcome of pending and future litigation, the success of future
acquisitions and other strategic transactions and the impact of competition – a number
of which factors are beyond the Group’s control. As a result, the Group’s actual future
results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the
Group’s forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Barclays speak only as of the
date they are made. Barclays does not undertake to update forward-looking statements
to reflect any changes in Barclays expectations with regard thereto or any changes in
events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. The reader
should, however, consult any additional disclosures that Barclays has made or may
make in documents it has filed or may file with the SEC.

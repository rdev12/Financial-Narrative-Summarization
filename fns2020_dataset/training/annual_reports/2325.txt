In the last 18 months the Company has made significant progress towards
its objective of building a successful exploration and production business. 
Chairman’s
Statement
uring this period the Company has completed
the processing and interpretation of the Falkland
Islands 2D seismic data and commissioned a
number of specialist studies all aimed at reducing the
technical exploration risk. 
The results of the technical work have confirmed our
belief that an excellent fold belt play exists to the south of
the Falkland Islands. The work also confirmed the scale of
the opportunity, with numerous structural leads mapped,
seven of which exceed 50 square kilometres in size.
These structures are potentially capable of holding very
large volumes of hydrocarbons.
The evaluation has produced far better results than
expected at the outset and the Company has been fortu-
nate to find that its acreage (in which we hold a 100%
interest) contains the majority of the play fairway.

              Borders & Southern Petroleum plc
The management team’s strategy from the outset was to
attract large Independent and major oil companies as
partners in the projects that we pursue. The challenge is
to determine the right time to bring in such partners by
way of a farmout. We need to optimise the commercial
terms of any agreement whilst reducing the technical risk
enough to attract the partner. 
In order to understand how major oil and gas companies
would perceive the current risk profile of Borders &
Southern’s licensed acreage, the Company invited a very
limited number of companies to review the data, with a
view to them potentially becoming a joint venture partner.
We did not believe it appropriate to launch a full farmout
campaign at this time. 
The selected small number of companies took up our invi-
tation and made multiple visits to our offices to review the
data. Discussions with some of these potential partners
are ongoing. 
In the meantime, in order to maintain the pace of explo-
ration the Company is currently evaluating the best way to
further reduce the technical risk. One option being con-
sidered is a focused 3D seismic survey. Therefore the
Company is working with consultants on 3D survey
design and assessing how much data is required to deliv-
er a significant risk reduction and how much it will cost. If
we proceed with 3D seismic acquisition then it is likely to
occur in the last quarter of 2007 at the start of the Austral
summer season.

Ultimately, of course, we want to drill our Falkland Islands
prospects as soon as practical. The objective is to align
the drilling programme with other licence holders in the
Falkland Islands region so that we can take advantage of
the cost benefits of a combined drilling programme.
Discussions with these licence holders are ongoing.
However, if a joint venture partner is brought into our
acreage, the incoming partner is likely to assume opera-
torship of our licences and will accordingly seek input into
the timing of exploration drilling. 
In addition to progressing the evaluation of the Falkland
Islands licences the management team has been assess-
ing opportunities in other regions with the intention of
adding new licences to the Company’s portfolio. Applying
strict screening criteria, the Company has been and will
continue to be very selective when considering new
licences. Borders & Southern will ensure that any 
additions to the exploration portfolio will be consistent
with our strategy and at least equal in quality to those
assets in our current portfolio.
Exploration in frontier regions is always challenging.
However the potential rewards are great. Borders &
Southern’s current portfolio holds the potential to discover
and prove up significant volumes of hydrocarbons. We
will continue to progress towards testing this potential.

In November 2004 Borders & Southern gained licences to explore in 
nearly 20,000 square kilometres of the territorial waters of the Falkland
Islands. This acreage is located in the untested South Falkland Basin.
Chief
Executive’s
Review
             Borders & Southern Petroleum plc
FALKLAND ISLANDS EVALUATION
he Company’s specific objective was to investi-
gate the presence of a fold belt play to the south
of the Falkland Islands, the offshore continuation
of the Andes Mountain trend. Throughout the South American
continent, from Venezuela in the north through Colombia,
Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, fold belts provide one of the
most successful hydrocarbon plays. 
Fold belts usually contain numerous, simple geological
structures suitable for trapping hydrocarbons. Providing
there are good reservoir rocks and working source 
systems then fold belts can contain prolific hydrocarbon
provinces. Individual structures can contain billion barrel oil
fields or multi-tcf gas accumulations. Examples of such giant
fields include: El Furrial (Venezuela), Cusiana (Colombia)
and the San Martin / Cashiriari structures (Peru).
Prior to our exploration programme in the South Falkland
Basin there had been only limited evaluation of the fold
belt play. Hints that a play could exist were seen on 
legacy regional seismic data from 1992. However, this
data is insufficient to define where the play might best be
5
developed. In April / May of 2005 we acquired 2862 kilo-
metres of new 2D seismic data. Onboard processing
allowed us to confirm that the play existed and enabled us
to refine the survey during acquisition in order to cover the
most interesting structures. This is why there is a higher
density of seismic lines in the west of the licensed area.
There have been no exploration wells drilled in the basin.
Calibration of the seismic data, necessary for interpretation,
comes from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) wells located
to the east of the Falklands on the Maurice Ewing Bank and
from exploration wells located in the Malvinas Basin to the
west. These wells provide critical stratigraphic information
and demonstrate the presence of a high quality, organic rich
Cretaceous / Jurassic aged marine source rock.
Previous exploration drilling in the contiguous Malvinas
basin during the early 1980s resulted in several sub-
commercial discoveries. Oil flow rates in excess of 3000
bopd have been reported. Importantly the oil has been
typed to source rocks in the same stratigraphic interval

as the source rocks cored in the DSDP wells. Similar
aged organic rich shales are also recorded onshore
South America, on the Antarctic Peninsula, in the Weddell
Sea, and off the west coast of South Africa. This gives a
high degree of confidence that this is a regional source
rock which will be present within Borders & Southern’s
licensed acreage.
Indirect evidence that source rocks are present and 
generating hydrocarbons within the licences come from a
clearly defined bottom simulation reflector, interpreted to
represent gas hydrates. There are also many seismic
amplitude and AVO anomalies within geologically sensi-
ble trapping configurations that might be indicative 
of hydrocarbons.
Borders & Southern’s regional work has demonstrated
that Upper Cretaceous / Tertiary sands are likely to have
been derived from the Falklands Massif to the north of the
Company’s acreage. Mapped canyons and channels 
indicate a north south sediment transport direction. 
The nearest outcrop to the licensed area is Beauchene
Island, located almost midway between the northern limit
of the acreage and the main Falkland Islands. The geology
of Beauchene Island is comprised of quartzitic sand-
stones and quartzites, interpreted to be of Devonian age
by analogy to the quartzites of the Port Stephens and Port
Stanley Formations on the main Falkland Islands. Erosion
of these sandstones and quartzites would provide 
excellent reservoirs in the contract area.

Several prospective play fairways have been identified
and mapped, but the main targets are Late Cretaceous /
Tertiary sands within large anticlinal closures. Additional
stratigraphic plays also occur within this stratigraphic
interval. Subsidiary plays include Lower Cretaceous
sands within tilted fault blocks. This is similar to the proven
play of the Malvinas Basin.
2D SEISMIC INTERPRETATION
Detailed mapping of our new 2D seismic data has
revealed numerous structural leads. These comprise four-
way dip anticlinal closures, three-way dip thrust fault
closed structures, and tilted fault blocks. Many of these
structures are large. Seven leads have a mapped area of
closure over 50 sq km, with one structure exceeding 130
sq km. Significantly these structures display vertical 
closure in excess of 2 km which allows the possibility of
stacked reservoirs, providing multiple targets within the
same prospect. 
During the last 12 months we have undertaken a rigorous
technical evaluation. This started with a regional play fair-
way analysis taking in the whole of the South and East
Falkland Basins. Once the new data had been acquired,
we focused on the licensed area, and brought in specialist
help for specific projects, using experienced industry
consultants and experts from British universities. 
Projects have included geochemical and thermal model-
ling, structural modelling and restoration, seismic AVO
analysis, seismic reprocessing, seismic facies analysis,
and lead specific mapping. All of these studies have been
brought together to help reduce the exploration risks.
In addition to the technical studies we have commis-
sioned independent analysis of the operating environ-
ment and economics. The environment conditions are
described as similar to the West of Shetlands in the UK,
challenging but certainly within the capability of industry
practice. Due to the water depths of between 1500 and
2000 metres it is likely that a drill ship or a high specifica-
tion semi-submersible will be required for an exploration
well. Again, we will be using standard oil industry tech-
nology and the oil industry is already exploring in water
depths out to 3000 metres.
Critically, the minimum field size required for a commer-
cial development has been investigated. This was found
to be around 100 million barrels, assuming an oil price in
excess of $34 per barrel. In the exploration success case,
these volumes should be easily achievable given the size
of mapped structures.
A discovery would be developed using standard tech-
nology involving a Floating Production Storage
Offloading system whereby the crude oil is shipped
direct to market without the need for significant onshore
infrastructure.
NEXT STEPS
All the technical and commercial work we have under-
taken to date has reinforced our view that we have an
excellent position in the South Falklands Basin worthy of
exploration drilling.
In order to progress further we are currently evaluating
additional work programme options. One such option is
3D seismic acquisition. New 3D data would allow the
Company to have greater confidence in the reservoir dis-
tribution across the large structures and to better site
        Borders & Southern Petroleum plc

exploration wells. It may also provide direct hydrocarbon
indicators such as flat spots and amplitude anomalies
conforming to the mapped structure thereby significantly
reducing the technical risks. 
STRATEGY
The Company’s strategy is to build a portfolio of up to five
exploration projects in frontier basins, areas in which a
prolific petroleum system has yet to be defined. As 
frontier exploration has a higher technical risk profile than
exploration in mature basins, the scale of opportunity and
the potential rewards will need to be very large. 
One overriding technical constraint to the screening is the
focus on basins where there is a high degree of confi-
dence of a working source system, through either direct
(oil flow in wells) or indirect technical evidence (direct
hydrocarbon indicators from seismic or seeps).
The Company will seek to minimise the exploration risk
through high quality technical work and the application of
leading edge technologies.
We hope to secure large tracts of our targeted play fair-
ways so that if the drilling of the first prospect is success-
ful then there would be plenty of remaining potential. The
Company will also target those play fairways that contain
individual prospects of significant size. 
In contrast to the relatively high technical risks, the
Company intends to focus on countries where political
and commercial risks are considered to be relatively low. 
The Company sees its role in the industry as one where it
generates ideas, secures the acreage, funds the early
stage of exploration with the acquisition of 2D and/or 3D
seismic data and thereby takes out significant exploration

risk from the opportunity prior to attracting the larger com-
panies to help fund the drilling campaigns. 
Despite the sustained high price of oil and increased
pressure of reserve replacement, the industry majors are
still relatively risk averse and are not pursuing frontier
opportunities. This provides an excellent opportunity for
technically proficient small companies like Borders &
Southern for early entry and risk-reduction exploration
work prior to farming out.  
NEW OPPORTUNITIES
With the price of oil still relatively high, the competition for
acreage is fierce, particularly in proven and emerging
petroleum basins. As the Company screens opportunities
it needs to ensure the quality is as good as its existing
project and also that it focuses on projects that would
appeal to the larger companies. During the last 18 months
we have screened a number of opportunities, but as yet
have not secured a second project. The Company will
continue to take time in order to bring the right projects
into the portfolio.
During the last year we were pleased to welcome Bruce
Farrer into the Company. Bruce trained as a geologist and
joins us from BHP Billiton where he has worked for the last
15 years in various technical and project management
roles. He brings significant operational and evaluation
expertise to the Company based on his experience of
exploration and development projects in Europe, North
and West Africa and the Caribbean.
INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
During the last 18 months the price of oil increased 
to over $75 per barrel (July/August 2006) before falling
back to levels around $60 per barrel. This is still very high
when looking at a five-year trend as the early part of the
decade was characterised by prices around the $30 per
barrel level. Whilst some weakening of the price might
occur many commentators believe that it is unlikely that oil
prices will return to these levels in the short to medium term.
The impact of high oil prices on our business is two fold.
Firstly, there is increased competition for acreage, partic-
ularly in the proven hydrocarbon basins. Secondly, due to
the increased exploration, appraisal, and development
activity there is a higher demand for services, such as
seismic and drilling contractors, which flows through to
both costs and availability.

Financial   
Review
          Borders & Southern Petroleum plc
uring the period under review, the Company did
not incur any significant capital expenditures,
with interest from the cash deposits offsetting the
majority of the Company’s costs.
The cash balances at the beginning and end of the 
period were as follows:
£ million
Cash at 1 July 2005 £10.42
Less:
Overheads and working capital (net of interest) £0.95
Cash at 31 December 2006 £9.47
The cash at 31 December 2006 was held in pounds 
sterling and US dollars in either current accounts or 
short- term cash deposits. It is the Company’s intention to 
continue to hold this cash on current or short-term
deposits until required and to potentially convert further
pounds sterling into US dollars at times when the
exchange rate is favourable.
The Company has sufficient funds to finance current
exploration expenditure commitments and to cover 
general overheads for the next financial year.

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
Directors are required by company law to prepare financial statements which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group at the end of the financial period and of the profit or loss of the Company and the
Group for the period ending on that date. In preparing those financial statements, Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company
and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to
safeguard the assets of the Company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdic-

and parent balance sheets, the Group cash flow statement and the related notes. These financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out therein.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applica-
ble law United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out
in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether the information given in the Directors’ Report is 
consistent with those financial statements. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if informa-
tion specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Highlights Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Review, the Financial Review, Board of Directors’ Report, Audit Committee’s Report, Remuneration Report and the
Corporate Directory. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.

person is entitled to rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of and

as above, we do not accept responsibility for this report to any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby
expressly disclaim any and all such liability.
BASIS OF OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

                                                    1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention and in accordance with
the applicable accounting standards and the Statement of Recommended Practice “Accounting for Oil and Gas
Exploration, Development, Production and Decommissioning Activities”.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has adopted FRS20 ‘share-based payment’ for the first time. The
impact for the current period is to increase the loss by £15,335. There is no change in net assets. There is no impact on
the prior period as there were no share-based payments in existence. Further details are given in note 16.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertaking
made up to 31 December 2006. The acquisitions method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the result
of the subsidiary undertaking acquired in the period is included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date
of acquisition.
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit
and loss account. Its loss for the financial period was £500,996 (2005 – £141,246).
Turnover
At the end of the period the Group had not commenced commercial production from its exploration sites and therefore
has no turnover in the period.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets so as to write off the cost or valuation, less any estimated residual
value, over their expected useful economic life as follows:
Office equipment 33
1
⁄ 3%
Assets are depreciated from the date of acquisition, and on a straight line basis.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group has adopted the full cost accounting policy for expenditure on oil and gas projects. All costs associated with
oil exploration are capitalised on a project-by-project basis, pending determination of feasibility of the project. Costs
incurred include appropriate technical and administrative expenses but not general overheads. If an exploration project
is successful, the related expenditures will be transferred to tangible fixed assets and amortised over the estimated life
of the commercial reserves. Where a licence is relinquished, a project is abandoned, or is considered to be of no further
value to the Group the related costs are written off. All capitalised costs are reviewed annually against the underlying
value of oil and gas reserves, unless the expenditure relates to an area where it is too early to make a decision about
the value of the assets.
Impairment tests
When there is an indication that the value of an asset may be impaired, the net amount at which the asset is recorded
is assessed for recoverability against the discounted future estimated net cash flows expected to be generated from the
estimated remaining commercial reserves. The assessment is made on the basis of future oil prices, exchange rate and
cost levels as forecast at the balance sheet date. A provision is made by way of an additional depreciation charge, where
the carrying value of the asset exceeds the discounted future net cash flows to be derived from its estimated remaining
commercial reserves.

Notes to the 
Financial Statements
                   Foreign currencies
Profit and loss account transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the
date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing
rates at the balance sheet date and the exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the
lease term.
Share based incentives
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 20 the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to Directors
and employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is measured by
a Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model.
Financial instruments
In relation to the disclosures made in Note 25: 
Other than the information about the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk, short-term debtors and creditors
have been excluded from the financial instrument disclosures in note 25.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes; and
Forward exchange contracts are used to fix the exchange rate of committed and anticipated foreign currency
transactions. Gains and losses arising on such hedges are not recognised until until the transaction occurs.
The Group has not made use of any derivative financial instruments in the period.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which represent a liability at the balance sheet date, at rates
expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion
of items of income or expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the
financial statements. Deferred tax balances are not discounted. 
Liquid resources
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, liquid resources are defined as current asset investments and short-
term deposits, held on a rolling monthly basis.

3. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by
the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period. The loss for the financial period for the Group
was £527,024 (2005 – £141,246) and the average number of shares in issue for the year was 127,687,500 
(2005 – 55,413,437). The effect of the share options in issue is anti-dilutive (see note 16 for details of share options). 
4. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
For the purpose of segmental information the operations of the Group consist of one class of business, the exploration
for hydrocarbons. 
During the period the Group’s exploration and evaluation activities took place outside the UK, substantially in the
Falkland Islands. These costs are capitalised, where appropriate, in accordance with the accounting policies as set out
in note 1 above.
The operating loss of the Group is analysed as follows:

This note provides the narrative and numerical disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard 13 “Derivatives and

The main risks arising from the Group’s operations are interest rate risk and foreign currency translation risk. The Group

arranged fixed rates, as described further below. The Group does not currently use derivative instruments to manage its
interest rate risk.
b) Foreign currency translation risk

and treasury functions is pound sterling. Balances are held in £ sterling and USD dollars are purchased when required
and used to meet exploration and evaluation needs.

At 31 December 2006 the Company held cash at bank and in deposits under its control of £9,468,174 (2005 –
£10,416,100), which forms the majority of the Group’s working capital. Of this £397,041 (2005 – £416,100) relates to
deposits placed with banking institutions that are available on demand which carry interest at prevailing United Kingdom
deposit floating rates. The balance represents restricted deposits of £9,071,133 (2005 – £10,000,000) with weighted
average fixed interest rate of 4.613% for three months.
Fair values

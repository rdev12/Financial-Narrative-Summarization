Chairman’s statement
It has been a year of major change  
at Kingﬁsher, with the appointment of  
a new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and 
signiﬁcant developments within the 
portfolio of our businesses. 
In September 2014 Kingﬁsher 
announced a Group CEO succession 
plan, with Sir Ian Cheshire stepping  
down after seven years in the role. The 
succession plan recognised that the next 
ﬁve years of Kingﬁsher’s evolution will be 
particularly busy, with several long-term 
projects underway. With this in mind, and 
with Ian having already served 16 years 
with the business and 14 years on the 
Board, Ian stepped down as Kingﬁsher 
Group CEO in December. On behalf  
of the Board, I would like to thank him  
for his leadership, which transformed 
Kingﬁsher into a stronger business  
during a difﬁcult economic time.  
I wish Ian well in the future.
Kingﬁsher was delighted to announce 
the appointment of Véronique Laury 
as Ian’s successor. Véronique is uniquely 
qualiﬁed for the role, having spent  
26 years in the home improvement  
sector and 11 at Kingﬁsher, most  
recently as CEO of Castorama France.  
An outstanding retailer, Véronique is 
passionate about helping customers  
have better homes, and I am sure she  
will provide the leadership, energy and 
pace to deliver the next stage of our 
strategic journey.
Véronique’s vision for Kingﬁsher is to 
leverage the scale of the business by 
becoming a single, uniﬁed company 
rather than a collection of individual 
businesses. Achieving this will mean 
organising ourselves differently. Key  
areas of focus will include deeper insight 
into customer needs which will then be 
applied consistently across the business, 
selling more similar product ranges 
across our operations and adopting  
a more uniﬁed approach to formats, 
systems and people. We aim to move  
at pace, with work already underway to 
develop a uniﬁed garden and bathroom 
offer across Kingﬁsher and plans to 
address excess selling space at B&Q UK.
Helped by these dynamic actions, we 
aim to drive more shareholder value  
over the medium term by achieving a 
combination of higher sales, maintained 
gross margins, lower costs and capital 
discipline. You can read more about 
Véronique’s plans in the CEO interview  
on pages 6-9 and in the strategic update 
on pages 12-17.
Also in the year, Kingﬁsher announced 
the completion of the disposal of our 
stake in Hornbach and a binding 
agreement to sell a 70% stake in  
B&Q China to Wumei Holdings for  
a cash consideration of £140m.  
In addition, Screwﬁx opened its ﬁrst 
stores in Germany (its ﬁrst overseas 
market) alongside a nationwide online 
delivery service.

Strategic Report
Turning to our ﬁ nancial performance last 
year, the results reﬂ ect a mixed picture 
across our markets, with the UK picking 
up but continental Europe, particularly 
France, proving to be a more challenging 
environment. In France, the slower 
economy and declining housing market 
affected our performance, particularly for 
our more construction-oriented business, 
Brico Dépôt. 
In the UK & Ireland, retail proﬁ t grew, 
helped by initiatives to re-energise 
B&Q and by better demand for trade 
products as housing and construction 
activity improved. Screwﬁ x had another 
outstanding year, with sales up by 
25.5%. The business opened 60 net 
new stores in the year whilst continuing 
to develop its industry-leading 
omnichannel offer.
Our aim is to deliver our strategy 
sustainably and we continued to make 
good progress in this area. Sales from 
products with eco credentials reached 
£2.4bn and, to date, we have installed 
LED lighting in 15% of our store estate, 
which will save us around £3m per 
annum. We continue to integrate our 
sustainable plans within our business 
and aim to reﬂ ect that in our move 
towards a more integrated approach to 
ﬁ nancial reporting. You can read more 
about our commitment to sustainable 
growth in the CEO interview, the Business 
model, and the strategic update.
Despite Group pre-tax proﬁ ts declining 
by 7.5% to £675m, the Board is very 
conﬁ dent in the future prospects of 
the business. This is underlined by the 
ordinary dividend of 10.0p (+1%) and 
the capital returns programme which 
started during the year and was the ﬁ rst 
such programme in Kingﬁ sher’s history. 
£200m was returned to shareholders 
during the year, via a special dividend 
and share buy-back programme. This 
programme will continue in 2015/16 with 
a further £200m planned for the year.
One other Board change during the year 
saw Philippe Tible step down from the 
Board in July. Philippe spent 11 years 
at Kingﬁ sher, most recently as CEO 
Castorama & Brico Dépôt brands. I would 
like to thank Philippe for his important 
work developing our businesses in 
France and, more recently, in Eastern 
Europe. He put in place a ﬁ rst class 
management team and nurtured a 
pipeline of executive talent which will 
beneﬁ t the business enormously in 
the future. 
As always, I would like to pay tribute 
to Kingﬁ sher’s 79,000 staff across our 
businesses. They continue to do a 
tremendous job and will be crucial in 
helping deliver the Board’s vision of 
Kingﬁ sher’s future. It is an exciting time 
and I believe we can look forward to the 
next stage of Kingﬁ sher’s development 
with great optimism.

programme which started

MY
FIRST
120
DAYS
In my ﬁ rst few months I have visited 
all the countries in which we operate, 
I have been to every operating 
company, met the local Boards and 
visited people’s homes. Looking at 
the way people live it is clear to me 
that customers’ needs are more 
similar than different.
as Kingﬁ sher CEO 7 www.kingﬁsher.com
Strategic Report
CEO’s Q&A interview
Q
  You’ve only been CEO for a 
few months, what are your 
ﬁrst impressions?
A
  In my ﬁrst three months I visited all 
our countries and visited customers’ 
homes in each one. One of the 
things those visits made clear to me 
was how similar people’s needs are. 
They want more space, more light, 
better storage. The second point  
is the energy and enthusiasm of  
our staff. We are fortunate to have 
such a loyal, hard-working group of 
colleagues and one of my priorities 
will be to ensure that Kingﬁsher is  
a great company that people want 
to work for. 
Q
  Having reviewed the Company’s 
business and strategy, what were 
your key ﬁndings?
A
  The ﬁrst point is that home 
improvement is a great market with 
huge potential. It’s a big market, 
worth £235bn in Europe and it’s  
still largely fragmented, so there  
is plenty of scope to grow. Home 
improvement is a top spending 
priority for consumers as people 
want a better home and a better 
life. These human needs are being 
fuelled further by socio-economic 
trends across the world. These 
include changing demographics 
(such as ageing populations and 
more people working from home), 
urbanisation (which means that 
homes are generally getting 
smaller), more home technology, 
rising energy costs and more and 
more regulatory requirements. 
Another factor is the rise in 
specialist communities as people 
look to share information, ideas and 
know-how in all sorts of areas from 
music, to car sharing, to holidays. 
Home improvement can be one of 
those communities. Kingﬁsher is 
also in a great position within the 
market. We serve over a million 
customers a day, we have market 
leading positions and buying scale 
of more than £7bn a year. But I am 
very clear that we can make more 
of the assets we have. To achieve 
these ambitions we will need to 
organise ourselves very differently.
Q
  You are talking about organising 
Kingﬁsher in a more uniﬁed way 
than before. Can you describe 
how this will work in practice? 
A
  Kingﬁsher has made good progress 
over the years in terms of its 
individual businesses working more 
closely together, on things like direct 
sourcing and own brand 
development. But they still basically 
operate in individual silos, with only 
limited sharing. For example, 
Kingﬁsher’s businesses sell a 
combined total of nearly 400,000 
skus (stock keeping units) across 
the top ﬁve operating companies 
(B&Q UK, Screwﬁx, Castorama 
France and Poland, Brico Dépôt 
France). That is too many and 
shows that there has been 
proliferation at the local level.  
Q
  How do you feel about being 
appointed CEO of Kingﬁsher?
A
  I am delighted and honoured to be 
Kingﬁsher’s CEO. It’s a great business 
and I am proud to lead it. I would like 
to thank Sir Ian Cheshire for all his 
help and advice over my 11 years  
at Kingﬁsher. He built really strong 
foundations which I aim to build on, 
an appropriate message for a home 
improvement company! I know the 
business and the people well, so  
I know how much opportunity there  
is for our Company. I am excited by 
the challenge.
Q
  You’ve worked in home 
improvement for your entire 
career. What is it about the 
industry that you enjoy?
A
  Yes, I’ve worked in home 
improvement for 26 years so I 
feel I know our market as well as 
anyone. Some might say it’s not 
very glamorous but I think it is.  
Not only have I worked in home 
improvement all my working life  
but I have also been involved in the 
complete renovation of three homes 
in France over the years. People’s 
homes are their most important 
asset and they also have a strong 
emotional commitment to them. 
That emotional commitment makes 
home improvement a great 
business to be in - you are helping 
people improve their home. It is a 
positive business and a fast-moving 
one. That makes it very enjoyable. 
“ Home improvement is a great market 
with huge potential. It’s a top spending 
priority for consumers as people want  
a better home and a better life.” 8 Kingﬁ sher Annual Report 2014/15
Of these skus, only 7,000 are 
sold by more than one of our 
businesses. Again, this shows that 
we have not been making the most 
of our scale. Going forward, our 
aim is to organise the business in a 
more uniﬁ ed way. This will enable 
individual country management 
teams to concentrate on what they 
do best, running their stores and 
hiring great people.
Q
  Is there a risk with this level 
of change?
A
  To be honest I think there is a 
bigger risk in not doing it. If 
Kingﬁ sher is to make the most of its 
scale and unlock its potential, then 
I believe we need to organise 
ourselves in a very different way. We 
have appointed a new leadership 
team structured along these lines, 
including roles which will head up 
our ‘Big Box’ stores, our ‘Medium-
Box’ stores and Omnichannel 
operations worldwide too. 
CEO’s Q&A interview continued
Q
  You’ve recently named your 
leadership team. Can you tell us 
about the mix of skills and 
experience they have?
A
  The new leadership team combines 
existing and new talent with 
cross-company roles that are more 
focused. We recently announced 
that Arja Taaveniku will be joining 
Kingﬁ sher as Chief Offer & Supply 
Chain Ofﬁ cer. From 1994 to 2012 
she held a variety of senior roles at 
IKEA of Sweden. We will also be 
appointing a new Chief People 
Ofﬁ cer in due course. They will join 
existing members of the leadership 
team, our Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, 
Karen Witts, and our three 
Operations Directors, Guy Colleau, 
Alain Souillard and Steve Willett.
 
Q
  You’ve announced signiﬁ cant 
changes to the B&Q UK store 
portfolio. Can you explain 
your thinking and whether 
similar changes might be 
needed in other markets?
A
  Kingﬁ sher has said for some time 
that B&Q can meet local customer 
needs from fewer stores and that 
some of our branches could be 
smaller. We announced the ﬁ rst 
phase of this plan in 2013 and have 
now announced the second phase, 
which was based on a catchment 
by catchment review of all our local 
trading areas, designed to retain 
customers and sales. This involves 
the closure of 15% of B&Q’s space 
and the right-sizing of six further 
stores. We are looking to close 
a small number of loss-making 
stores in continental Europe as 
well. As we build for the future we 
will also be starting a revitalisation 
programme at our Big Box stores 
across Europe, drawing on our 
latest, most developed formats 
from around the Company.
Q
  You’ve announced a deal to 
sell a controlling stake in B&Q 
China. Was it a disappointment 
to withdraw from such a 
promising market?
A  China is a market with great 
potential, but it is also a very 
difﬁ cult market and our business 
there was loss-making. I am 
delighted to have found a strong 
retail partner who will help us 
release the ﬁ nancial value of our 
business in China and enable us 
to focus our resources on Europe, 
where there are signiﬁ cant 
opportunities for growth.
“ Going forward, our aim is to 
organise the business in a more 
uniﬁ ed way. This will enable the 
individual country management 
teams to concentrate on what 
they do best.”
Véronique Laury 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 9 www.kingﬁsher.com
Strategic Report
Q
  Kingﬁsher has been a big 
champion of sustainability.  
Will it be important under  
your leadership?
A  We are committed to delivering our 
strategy in a sustainable way and 
this approach should become 
business as usual. There are a 
broad range of opportunities in this 
area. These include commercial 
opportunities to help support our 
success today, while enabling us  
to grasp those that come from a 
changing environment over the long 
term, as well as the social and 
community aspects of sustainability. 
I want Kingﬁsher to be a great 
company that people want to work 
for, and that has a fair and equitable 
approach to business. There are 
also signiﬁcant opportunities in 
creating communities around home 
improvement, as it’s an area where 
people want ideas and advice.  
The collaborative economy is  
very interesting for us.
Q
  You are one of the few female 
CEOs in the FTSE100. Is enough 
being done to address this?
A
  I think things are heading in the 
right direction, but it takes time.  
For my own part, I hope that I am  
a good example for all the young 
women out there who want to 
become chief executives. I have  
not done anything differently from  
a man. I have just been passionate 
about what I was doing and been 
true to my convictions. Hopefully, I 
provide the proof that it’s possible. 
The key for a business is to have  
a pipeline of talent that you can 
develop and promote from.
Q
  If you look forward 5-10 years, 
what sort of Kingﬁsher would  
you like to see?
A
  I would like us to be the leading 
home improvement company; 
genuinely international in scope, 
innovative and unique in what  
we offer customers and a real 
community for people who are 
interested in home improvement,  
or want to learn. I am passionate 
about working with all our people  
to make those things happen and 
help our customers have better 
homes and better lives.

Our business model
What we do
Kingﬁsher is a home improvement 
company specialising in the sale of 
home improvement products and 
services. 
The vast majority of our sales take  
place through our 1,202 stores in 11 
countries across Europe and in China  
and increasingly through our 
omnichannel presence.
How we do it 
In the broadest sense, our business 
creates value for society in a number  
of ways. We help people to have better 
homes for themselves and their families, 
and we have a long heritage of helping 
them do this in a more sustainable way. 
We operate in the heart of local 
communities, supporting local projects, 
positively impacting the environment and, 
importantly, providing local employment. 
Over 79,000 people work in our 
businesses and many more work for our 
suppliers. In addition, we contributed 
£1.7 billion in 2014/15 to the economies 
in which we operate through taxes paid 
and collected. We aim to do more than 
minimise our impact; instead, we aspire  
to have a positive one. We call this 
sustainable ambition Net Positive and  
we believe this gives us a ‘licence to 
operate’ for the long term.
Financial value 
This section concentrates on the ﬁnancial 
value that we create – that is, the cash we 
generate. Cash is the life-blood of any 
business as it can be reinvested to keep  
a business healthy and growing, and is 
also used to reward the owners who bear 
all the investment risk. For Kingﬁsher, 
maximising our cash generation in a 
responsible way means maximising sales 
and minimising costs whilst observing  
key behaviours – responsibility, honesty, 
passion, openness and adaptability. 
The better we are at this, the more cash 
we generate and the more value we 
create for our people, our shareholders 
and society at large.
Maximising sales
We believe home improvement is an 
attractive retail sector as spending 
on the home is a key priority for 
householders. 
As a specialist in this area we aim  
to provide a wide product choice  
and expert advice while using our 
international strength and capability to 
bring new, more sustainable and more 
affordable products to market. We focus 
on the following areas to maximise sales:
Customers
We aim to have mass appeal with a 
compelling choice of products and 
services so that we can capture a large 
share of the home improvement market. 
Our customers are non-professional 
(non-pro) customers who do home 
improvement jobs for themselves, and 
professional (pro) customers who do 
them for others. The non-pro customers 
are people who do jobs themselves, 
people who need help and those who 
want to learn. The ‘pro’ category are  
light trade and people who help others, 
such as the expert in a family or a group 
of friends.
People
Retail is a people business and it  
is particularly true in our sector as 
customers often need help and advice 
when shopping for home improvement 
products and services. We aim to recruit 
and retain diverse and talented teams  
to serve our customers and we prioritise 
investment in their training and 
development as we move towards 
creating ‘ONE’ Kingﬁsher.
Offer
We use our scale and international reach 
to ﬁnd the world’s best products and 
make them available to customers in their 
local market. The rate of innovation in 
home improvement tends to be slower 
than in other retail sectors, such as 
electricals or clothing, and so we aim to 
increasingly deploy our international scale 
and experience to work with suppliers  
to stimulate more innovation and create 
leading, unique and effective products. 
Formats/Channels
We want to make home improvement as 
easy as possible for our customers and 
this includes giving them as wide a 
choice as possible of ways to shop with 
us. As well as having local stores with 
extended opening hours, we increasingly 
offer home delivery and ‘click & collect’ 
via the internet. This type of retailing is 
called omnichannel and our most 
advanced business in this area is 
Screwﬁx in the UK. 
Low costs
The biggest cost in our business is 
buying the products that we sell to our 
customers. Our suppliers beneﬁt from 
the huge scale that we can offer them  
as one of the largest buyers of home 
improvement products in the world.  
The certainty of large scale orders means 
they can operate their businesses more 
efﬁciently and these beneﬁts are shared 
between the manufacturer and Kingﬁsher 
– helping to minimise our costs. The next 
major cost is selling and distribution, 
principally the cost of running our stores, 
the cost of getting products to our stores 
and the cost of our people. We are 
constantly working on a rolling 
programme of cost efﬁciencies and 
productivity initiatives to minimise  
these costs sustainably.
Cash generated
The net result of maximising our sales 
whilst minimising our costs is the 
optimisation of the cash we generate  
each year. Over the last seven years we 
have generated £6.1 billion of operating 
cash ﬂow from our business model. We 
have strengthened our balance sheet  
by eliminating our ﬁnancial net debt  
and we have reinvested £2.3 billion in 
modernising and expanding our store 
network and upgrading our IT and supply 
chain infrastructure to underpin our 
future prospects. In addition, we have 
returned £1.4 billion to our shareholders 
as dividends and share buybacks. Over 
the same period our market value has 
grown from £3.4 billion to £8.2 billion. 
Our strategy for delivering this is 
described on the following pages. www.kingﬁ sher.com

Following the appointment of Véronique 
Laury as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the 
leadership team reviewed Kingﬁsher’s 
business and strategy. They concluded 
that Kingﬁsher’s position and prospects 
in the attractive European home 
improvement market were strong,  
but that the business needed to be 
organised very differently to deliver  
the full potential of ‘ONE’ Kingﬁsher. 
A summary of the review ﬁndings  
are below: 
• Home improvement is a great  
market with huge potential. Home 
improvement is a top customer 
spending priority, with an estimated 
58% of Europeans doing a home 
improvement project last year. The 
market is resilient and its growth is 
supported by favourable megatrends 
which are similar across all markets. 
For example, changing demographics 
as well as ongoing societal trends 
mean that households are needing  
to adapt their homes, while increasing 
urbanisation means most people are 
living in smaller homes. In addition,  
the rise in home technology and 
automation is changing the type of 
improvements people want to make  
to their homes, all of which provide  
us with sustainable opportunity. 
• We are right to focus on Europe+
*
. The 
European home improvement market 
is an attractive sector, worth £235
 
billion
(1)
 across a customer base of 320 
million homes
(1)
. Kingﬁsher currently 
has a 5%
(1)
 share of this large, resilient 
and fragmented market, meaning 
there is plenty of scope for growth.
• We can achieve signiﬁcant beneﬁts 
from developing a more common, 
unique and effective offer. It is 
becoming increasingly clear that 
customer needs are already largely  
the same, that the markets we serve 
are fundamentally more similar than 
different and that there are few known 
manufacturing brands across the 
sector. There is therefore an 
opportunity for Kingﬁsher to develop  
a unique offer that can be sold across 
our businesses. Kingﬁsher already  
has signiﬁcant scale, with over a  
million customers a day. The potential 
of our £7.4 billion buying scale is still 
relatively untapped and we have a 
fragmented supplier base. However, 
we have made progress on group 
sourcing (now at 22% of sales
(2)
) and 
establishing our own brand product 
ranges (now at 30% of sales).
• There is no one, clear winning format 
or channel in our market today. 
Kingﬁsher’s multi-format structure  
is therefore an advantage, having 
businesses across ‘Big Box’  
format, ‘Medium Box’ format and 
Omnichannel formats. However, being 
omnichannel everywhere is a ‘given’.
• We can achieve signiﬁcant beneﬁts 
from unifying activities and 
standardising processes. Currently 
there are few shared processes  
within Kingﬁsher and the sharing of 
infrastructure is limited. There is also 
no standardised operating model, 
which means, for example, that our 
Brico Dépôt businesses in France, 
Spain, Romania and Portugal operate 
in different ways. www.kingﬁ sher.com
Strategic Report
13
Going forward, we will operate within 
the following guiding principles:
1. Customer needs come ﬁ rst
2.  Create a unique and leading offer
3.  Same products across Europe presented to customers 
in the same way
4.  Limited number of formats and omnichannel everywhere
5. Low cost always
6. One company culture
Following these principles will drive higher sales from having a unique, 
differentiated offer at good prices for our customers whilst maintaining 
our gross margin rate and lowering our cost base. Combining this with 
continued strict capital discipline will deliver improved ﬁ nancial metrics 
for our shareholders.

Seeding sustainability 
and empowering our 
people 
We are a people business 
and it is our people that 
make us what we are 
and will determine our 
sustained success. 
We’ve been sharing our 
sustainability ambitions 
to actively encourage our 
employees to change the 
way they do things so 
we can meet changing 
customer needs and drive 
sustainable growth. 
B&Q’s former 
horticulture buyer, 
Ben Smith, re-imagined 
bedding plants last year, 
enabling him to redesign 
the way the plants are 
packaged and presented. 
The easyGrow innovation 
he’s introduced makes 
our bedding plants 
healthier, planting easier, 
our customer experience 
better and in the process 
he’s also eliminated two 
unsustainable materials 
- peat and polystyrene. 
Last year B&Q sold 
2 million more bedding 
plants than the previous 
season. Ben has 
subsequently been 
promoted and is now 
working on a wider 
gardening offer that 
could be sold in all 
Kingﬁ sher markets. 
Ben isn’t alone in 
rethinking our offer 
- we’re challenging all 
our people to be “a little 
more like Ben” so that 
we can deliver growth 
in a sustainable way. 14 Kingﬁ sher Annual Report 2014/15
Strategic update continued
We are organising ourselves very differently
In order to unlock Kingﬁ sher’s true potential the Company needs to be organised very differently. This will 
involve taking what is essentially a locally managed set of businesses and creating instead a single uniﬁ ed 
company where customer needs come ﬁ rst.

Sustainably enhancing 
our customer offer 
We want to understand 
the reality of how our 
customers live so we can 
develop the products and 
services that really meet 
their needs. At the end of 
last year we asked 17,000 
householders across 
Europe about their homes 
and their biggest fear is 
high energy bills. It’s the 
number one concern in 
all our European markets 
and people are now 
eight times more likely to 
prioritise energy efﬁ ciency 
projects than they were 
two years ago. 
Our energy efﬁ ciency 
innovations are helping 
people make their homes 
warmer and more 
affordable to run. For 
example, our newly 
refurbished Castorama 
store in Hénin-Beaumont 
enables customers to 
get help from specially 
trained energy efﬁ ciency 
sales advisors. Providing 
solutions to people’s 
energy concerns means 
we’re best placed to 
address the growing €70bn 
in-home energy efﬁ ciency 
market in Europe.
As our homes become 
more energy efﬁ cient and 
we spend more time in 
them, we also need to 
help ensure that homes 
are healthy.

 Indoor 
air pollutants are an 
increasing concern, 
contributing to health 
conditions such as allergies 
and respiratory conditions. 
We’ve led the industry 
offering minimal VOC 
paint for many years but 
Castorama’s Respiréa 
paint innovation actually 
improves indoor air 
quality by capturing and 
absorbing formaldehyde.

Formats/
Channels
Our goal is to present the same products 
to customers across Europe in the same 
way under a simpliﬁed model. This will 
drive operational efﬁciencies whilst 
recognising that customer needs are 
evolving quickly so we need to adapt to 
this fast changing retail environment. Our 
existing channels will be managed under 
three formats: Big Box, Medium Box  
and Omnichannel, and each will be 
standardised across all of our markets. 
First sharp decisions:
Address our property tail.
• Kingﬁsher has said for some time that B&Q 
UK & Ireland can adequately meet local 
customer needs from fewer stores and  
that some of the stores should be smaller.  
As a result of detailed catchment reviews 
Kingﬁsher announced the following plans:
 – Close 15% of surplus B&Q space (c60 
stores; 6 right-sizes) over the next two 
years with the right-sizes planned to be 
completed in the full year 2015/16. The 
closures are being prioritised by the most 
over-spaced catchments in order to retain 
customers and sales. This will give rise to 
an exceptional charge of around £350m 
relating principally to onerous lease 
provisions over the next two years.
 – Optimise vacant space through a 
combination of outright sale and 
sub-letting. We are already in discussions 
with several retailers.
• Close the small number of loss-making 
stores we have across Europe. 
Do more of the good we have:
• Start Big Box revitalisation programme 
across Europe, drawing on our latest,  
most developed formats. 
• Extend the Screwﬁx Germany trial by ﬁve 
outlets taking the total to nine, replicating 
our highly successful omnichannel format 
developed in the UK.
1  Across top ﬁve operating companies: Castorama 
France, Brico Dépôt France, B&Q UK & Ireland, 
Screwﬁx UK and Castorama Poland.
Offer 
Of a total of 393,000
(1)
 products sold 
across the company, only 7,000 products 
(representing 7% of sales) are currently 
sold in at least two operating companies. 
Of the 393,000 products a large 
proportion relate to delisted and  
ex-promotional ranges which do not  
form part of existing retail planograms.  
Beyond this, driven by the knowledge 
that customer needs are more similar 
than different across geographies, 
planogram product ranges can be more 
similar in all our markets across Europe. 
First sharp decision:
• Develop plan to cut existing product tail.
Our work to mobilise ‘ONE’ Kingﬁsher will be focused  
on the following ﬁve areas.
For each of these we have identiﬁed the ﬁrst ‘sharp’ decisions that are being implemented at pace. 
A key step in developing this new organisation (‘ONE’ Kingﬁsher) is the creation of a new leadership  
team with more focused cross-company roles including: 
• Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
• Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
• Chief Offer & Supply Chain Ofﬁcer
• Three operations directors by format for  
Big Box, Medium Box & Omnichannel
• Chief Digital & IT Ofﬁcer
• Chief People Ofﬁcer 
Customer 
Everything will be based on our deep 
knowledge of customer needs and the 
customers’ shopping journey. 
First sharp decision: 
• To develop uniﬁed garden and bathroom 
businesses across Europe, covering the full 
design process from customers’ needs to 
customers’ homes.

Strategic Report
Infrastructure 
& Processes
Unifying our processes and infrastructure 
will not only drive operating efﬁ ciencies 
but will also make us a simpler and more 
agile organisation. 
First sharp decisions:
• Pilot company-wide uniﬁ ed SAP IT 
platform in B&Q Ireland, then look 
to accelerate.
• Unify the process for managing 
£1.2 billion goods not for resale (e.g. 
store maintenance, cleaning and 
merchandising equipment).

Responding to trends 
rooted in sustainability 
Wood is in more than a 
third of our products – 
some of it is obvious, like 
that used in our ﬂ ooring 
or our bathroom cabinets, 
some is less so, like the 
wooden frames underneath 
our baths that you don’t 
see. Security of supply 
and pricing pressures are 
real concerns, particularly 
as demand for wood 
products is set to triple 
by 2050*. That’s why 
we are passionate about 
sustainably sourcing 
our wood to ensure the 
world retains its much 
needed forests. 
Kingﬁ sher continues to 
lead the industry with 92% 
of its timber volume for 
products coming from 
sustainable (certiﬁ ed) 
sources. To ensure that 
by 2020 it’s all sustainably 
sourced, we’ve recently 
introduced a timber policy 
for all our markets and 
we know we can get 
there because B&Q 
UK has already done it. 
Sustainable sourcing 
protects our forests, helps 
us continue to secure 
supply and enables us 
to differentiate ourselves 
from our competitors.

To drive through these changes 
we have announced a new leadership 
team and the need to move to a wider 
reorganisation of the structure of 
our teams in order to unlock the real 
potential of ‘ONE’ Kingﬁ sher. The new 
leadership team combines existing 
and new talent with cross-company 
and more focused roles.
We are pleased to announce that Arja 
Taaveniku will be joining Kingﬁ sher in 
early May as Chief Offer & Supply Chain 
Ofﬁ cer. She has 22 years of experience 
from the IKEA Group, including 13 years 
at IKEA of Sweden, working in various 
senior roles involved in developing, 
managing and supplying the global 
IKEA product range (e.g. she was 
Global Business Area manager for IKEA 
Kitchen & Dining from 2008 to 2012). 
Since 2012 she has been CEO of the 
Ikano Group.
We are also appointing three Operations 
Directors by format. Guy Colleau will 
become our Operations Director for 
Big Box (B&Q, Castorama, Koçtas). 
Alain Souillard will become our 
Operations Director for Medium Box 
(Brico Dépôt). Steve Willett will become 
our Omnichannel Operations Director 
(Screwﬁ x) as well taking the role of 
Chief Digital & IT Ofﬁ cer. Our operating 
company CEOs will report into our 
Operations Directors. A Chief People 
Ofﬁ cer will be appointed in due course.

Overview 
The results for the year reflect a mixed picture across our 
markets, with the UK market improving but continental  
Europe, particularly France, proving to be a more challenging 
environment. However, our ongoing focus on cash and tight 
capital discipline meant we were able to continue to invest in  
the business whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet, pay 
£234 million in annual cash dividends and return a further  
£200 million to shareholders via special dividends and share  
buy backs.  
Total sales grew by 2.9% on a constant currency basis to  
£11.0 billion with LFL sales up 0.5% (2013/14: up 0.7%). On a 
reported rate basis, which includes the impact of exchange rates, 
sales declined by 1.4%. Sales growth benefited from the addition 
of new space, with 74 new stores, including 60 Screwfix trade 
counters in the UK, opening during the year (excluding four 
stores opened in the Turkey JV).  
On a constant currency basis retail profit of £733 million  
declined by 1.6%, including £22 million of new country 
development costs resulting from launching Brico Dépôt in 
Romania and Portugal and Screwfix in Germany during the  
year. Reported retail profit declined 5.9% reflecting £34 million 
adverse foreign exchange movement on translating foreign 
currency results into sterling.  
Adjusted pre-tax profit decreased by 7.5% to £675 million, 
primarily reflecting the more challenging trading environment  
in France, adverse foreign exchange movements and the 
investment in new country development. Furthermore, underlying 
net interest (excluding exceptional items and FFVR) for the year 
was £10 million higher reflecting a pensions interest charge on 
the defined benefit pension deficit at the start of the year.  
During the year the Group sold its stake in Hornbach and for 
comparative purposes adjusted pre-tax profit excludes their 
results (2013/14: before exceptional items Hornbach contributed  
£14 million to pre-tax profit and 0.6p to earnings per share).  
Statutory pre-tax profit, which includes the impact of exceptional 
items before tax and Hornbach’s results prior to disposal, 
decreased by 15.2% to £644 million. A reconciliation from  
the adjusted basis to the statutory basis for pre-tax profit is

France 349 396 (11.8)% (6.5)%
Kingfisher France sales declined by 1.0% (-2.3% LFL) to £4,132 
million in an ongoing soft market impacted by weak consumer 
confidence and a declining housing and construction market.  
Across the two businesses, three net new stores were opened, 
three were revamped, and two Castorama stores were converted 
to Brico Dépôt, adding around 2% new space. ‘Click, pay & 
collect’ omnichannel capability had been rolled out to 34 stores 
by the end of the year. 
Gross margins were down 10 basis points, with ongoing self-help 
initiatives offset by higher price promotional activity. Despite 
continued focus on cost control including lower levels of variable 
pay, retail profit declined by 6.5% to £349 million.  
Castorama total sales declined by 1.7% (-1.4% LFL) to £2,291 
million. According to Banque de France data, sales for the home 
improvement market were down around 1.5%. LFL sales of 
outdoor products were up 3% and sales of indoor and building 
products were down 2%. 
Brico Dépôt, which more specifically targets trade professionals 
and highly proficient retail customers, was impacted by the on-
going slow house building market with new housing starts and 
planning consent data down around 12% and 8% respectively. 
Total sales declined by 0.1% (-3.2% LFL) to £1,841 million.

UK & Ireland 276 238 +16.2% +16.1%
Kingfisher UK & Ireland sales were up 5.5% (+3.2% LFL) to 
£4,600 million and retail profit grew by 16.1% to £276 million. 
Gross margins were down 60 basis points impacted by the 
recognition in Q1 of more promotionally-led showroom sales 
(kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms) from Q4 last year. Tight 
cost control continued despite higher levels of variable pay.  
On a value basis, the UK home improvement leader market  
was up 4.8%, reflecting better weather year on year, a stronger 
UK economy and more buoyant housing construction. On the 
same definition, Kingfisher UK sales were up around 3.5%.  
The market for the smaller tradesmen was up around 7%. 
During the year B&Q reduced prices on c.5,000 products 
helping improve price perception and increase sales volumes. 
Over time, as the initiative gains momentum, the resulting growth 
in sales volume will also drive growth in sales on a value basis, 
however so far it is too early for the results to be seen in 
Kingfisher UK’s sales performance on a value basis.  
Consequently, on a volume basis (being quantity of products 
sold), the UK home improvement leader market was up 3.6%. 
On the same definition, Kingfisher UK sales were up 6.5% with 
both businesses ahead of the market. 
B&Q UK & Ireland’s total sales were up 1.9% (+1.4% LFL) to 
£3,765 million. Sales of outdoor seasonal and building products 
were up 4%. Sales of indoor products, excluding showroom, 
were up 2%. Sales of showroom products were down 5%,  
driven by the decision to reduce promotional activity, and  
instead offer customers ‘every day great value’.  
FY 2014/15 has been a year of re-energising the business. 
Examples of initiatives have included simplifying in-store price 
messaging, lowering prices and increasing customer transactions 
with better targeted marketing. The results have been 
encouraging, helping to drive sales and deliver profit growth, 
while improving value perception and marketing awareness.  
B&Q has also been working on driving productivity benefits 
across the business. B&Q aims to be a simpler, more efficient 
business with a lower cost operating model and with stores that 
are easier for customers to shop. Various initiatives have been 
introduced including ‘store friendly deliveries’ (making it quicker 
and easier for store staff to replenish) and roller checkouts 
(improved customer experience as well as scanning and 
database accuracy). The projects are on track and are expected 
to deliver discounted paybacks of less than 18 months.  
B&Q also launched ‘Click, Pay & Collect’ on over 14,000 
products with the release of the new diy.com supported by better 
online content. Transacted online sales, including home delivery, 
are making encouraging early progress, growing 63%.  
Screwfix, the highly successful omnichannel business, grew  
total sales by 25.5% (+13.4% LFL) to £835 million, driven by 
new ranges, a strong promotional programme reinforcing its 
value credentials and the continued roll out of new outlets, 
complemented by further digital and mobile development.  
Sixty net new outlets were opened, taking the total to 395.

Other International total sales increased by 5.0% (+0.1% LFL) to 
£2,234 million driven by store openings and LFL growth in Russia 
and Poland. Retail profit decreased by 19.5% to £108 million 
primarily driven by higher losses in China and new country 
development charges partly offset by profit growth in Poland.  
Other International (established):  
Sales in Poland were up 0.7% (+0.4% LFL) to £1,055 million. 
LFL sales of seasonal products were up 4% with sales of indoor 
and building products broadly flat. Gross margins were up 50 
basis points benefiting from ongoing self-help initiatives. Retail 
profit grew by 1.7% to £118 million supported by the sales 
growth and higher gross margins, offset by higher levels of 
variable pay.  
In Russia sales grew by 19.0% (+14.9% LFL) to £408 million, 
benefiting from a strong market. Retail profit declined by  
14.6% to £10 million largely reflecting adverse foreign currency 
exchange movements on the cost base. In Turkey, Kingfisher’s 
50% JV, Koçtaş, grew sales by 13.1% (+4.2% LFL) to £319 
million reflecting new store openings, improvements in customer 
offer and more promotional activity. Retail profit contribution was 
flat at £9 million after higher pre-opening costs compared to last 
year. In Spain sales grew by 14.2% (-5.5% LFL) to £306 million 
reflecting new store openings. Retail profit was £2 million 
(2013/14: £1 million retail profit).  
During the year nine net new stores, representing around 6% 
new space, were added in our established geographies, one  
in Russia, four in Spain and four in Turkey. 
New country development activity: 
Romania – In Q2 2013/14 Kingfisher acquired a chain of  
15 home improvement stores trading under the name 
Bricostore. Since then, work has been underway to transform 
these stores into the successful Brico Dépôt format aimed  
at trade professionals and highly proficient retail customers. 
Following encouraging results from the early conversions, the 
transformation programme was accelerated during 2014/15  
with 14 stores now trading as Brico Dépôt. The business 
delivered sales of £91 million and retail loss of £12 million 
reflecting this year of transition.  
Portugal – In a wider strategy to expand Brico Dépôt across 
Iberia, the first two Brico Dépôt stores opened during the year 
generating sales of £12 million. Retail loss of £2 million includes 
store pre-opening costs and central operations.  
Germany – During FY 2013/14 Kingfisher announced its plans  
to evaluate international opportunities for its highly successful 
omnichannel business, Screwfix. In the summer a four store  
pilot commenced in the Frankfurt area, supported by a website 
offering 'click & collect' as well as country-wide next day delivery. 
Sales and brand awareness are building with an encouraging 
number of repeat customers; retail loss including start-up costs 
was £8 million. A further five stores are planned for FY 2015/16 
within the Frankfurt area.  
Assets held for sale – China: 
In December 2014 Kingfisher announced a binding agreement 
to sell a controlling 70% stake in its B&Q China business to 
Wumei Holdings Inc for a total cash consideration of £140 
million. The agreement follows Kingfisher’s previous 
announcement of its plans to look for a strategic partner to help 
develop its B&Q business in China. The transaction is awaiting 
MOFCOM (Chinese Ministry of Commerce) approval and is 
expected to complete during H1 2015/16. 
During 2014/15 sales declined by 9.8% (-9.7% LFL) to  
£361 million impacted by a slowing Chinese property market 
which was down 11%. Retail loss was £9 million (2013/14:  
£6 million reported loss). If the disposal is approved, China  
will be accounted for as an investment and its results will  
not be consolidated in Group retail profit.

During the year there were restructuring costs of £17 million 
relating to the B&Q UK transformation plan (2013/14: £7 million 
credit following the successful exit of the Examinership process 
in B&Q Ireland).  
Transaction costs of £15 million are associated with Mr Bricolage 
and the agreement to sell a controlling stake in the B&Q China 
business (2013/14: £5 million for Bricostore Romania). 
These exceptional charges were more than offset by a £106 
million tax credit including the tax impact on exceptional items 
and the release of prior year provisions which have either been 
agreed with the tax authorities, reassessed, or time expired 
(2013/14: £114 million primarily reflecting the successful 
resolution of the Kesa demerger French tax case). 
Earnings per share 
Adjusted basic earnings per share decreased by 8.3% to 20.9p 
(2013/14: 22.8p) reflecting the lower profits and an increased 
tax rate. As noted previously, this excluded the impact of 
exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and  
the effect of prior year tax items. Including these items basic 
earnings per share decreased by 19.0% to 24.3p (2013/14:

Strategic Report
Dividends and capital returns 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 6.85p which results 
in a full year dividend of 10.0p, an increase of 1.0% (2013/14: 
9.9p). The final dividend reduces full year dividend cover on 
adjusted earnings to 2.1 times (2013/14: 2.3 times). Going 
forward we are comfortable with dividend cover in the range  
of 2.0 to 2.5 times, a level the Board believes is prudent and 
consistent with the capital needs of the business. 
The final dividend for the year ended 31 January 2015 will be 
paid on 15 June 2015 to shareholders on the register at close  
of business on 15 May 2015, subject to approval of shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 9 June 2015.  
A dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is available to shareholders 
who would prefer to invest their dividends in the shares of the 
Company. The shares will go ex-dividend on 14 May 2015. For 
those shareholders electing to receive the DRIP the last date for 
receipt of election is 22 May 2015. 
In addition to the annual dividend, Kingfisher announced last 
year its intention to commence a multi-year capital returns 
programme to return surplus capital to shareholders. In FY 
2014/15 a total of £200 million was returned to shareholders, 
£100 million by a special dividend of 4.2p per share paid on  
25 July 2014 and £100 million via a share buyback. The Group 
will return a further £200 million to shareholders in FY 2015/16. 
Around £30 million of shares have been purchased already with 
the balance expected to be returned as a share buyback over the 
remainder of the year.  
Taxation  
Kingfisher’s effective tax rate is sensitive to the blend of tax rates 
and profits in the Group’s various jurisdictions. The adjusted 
effective rate of tax, calculated on profit before exceptional items, 
prior year tax adjustments and the impact of rate changes, is 27% 
(2013/14: 26%). This effective rate of tax is higher than in 2013/14 
reflecting higher losses in developing countries for which no future 
tax benefit is currently recognised for accounting purposes. 
The overall rate of tax includes the impact of exceptional items 
and prior year adjustments. The impact of such items reduced 
the rate from 27% to 11% reflecting the release of prior year 
provisions which have either been agreed with tax authorities, 
reassessed, or time expired.

Tax contribution  
Kingfisher makes a significant economic contribution to the 
countries in which it operates. In 2014/15 it contributed £1.7 
billion in taxes it both pays and collects for these governments. 
The Group pays tax on its profits, its properties, in employing 
79,000 people, in environmental levies, in customs duties and 
levies as well as other local taxes. The most significant taxes  
it collects for governments are the sales taxes charged to its 
customers on their purchases (VAT) and employee payroll 
related taxes. Taxes paid and collected together represent 
Kingfisher's total tax contribution, which is shown below:

Kingfisher participates in the Total Tax Contribution survey that 
PwC perform for the Hundred Group of Finance Directors. The 
2014 survey ranked Kingfisher 33rd for its Total Tax Contribution 
in the UK. In 2014, 103 companies contributed to the survey. 
Taxation governance and risk management 
The Kingfisher Code of Conduct applies high standards of 
professionalism and integrity which underpins the Group's 
approach to tax policy, strategy and governance, which is Board 
approved. Our core tax objective is to pay the right amount of tax 
at the right time and to comply with all relevant tax legislation in 
all Group entities. The Kingfisher Group undertakes its activities, 
and pays tax in the countries in which it operates, in compliance 
with the local and worldwide tax rules. In all countries where it 
has activities, it has the staff, premises and other assets required 
to run its business there. The responsibility for tax policy and 
management of tax risks lies with the Chief Financial Officer  
and the Group Tax Director who engage regularly with the  
main Board and the Audit Committee on all tax matters. 
We manage the tax that we pay and the risks that arise having 
regard to the interests of all stakeholders including our investors, 
our customers, our staff and the governments and communities 
in the countries in which we operate. Tax risks can arise from 
changes in law, differences in interpretation of law and the failure 
to comply with the applicable rules and procedures. We manage 
and control these risks through local management, the tax 
professionals we employ and using advice from reputable 
professional firms. Where disputes arise with the authorities 
these are dealt with promptly in a professional, open and 
constructive manner. 
Economic returns 
Management are focused on Kingfisher Economic Profit (KEP) 
as a main measure of return on capital. It is used in the capital 
investment process, to assess performance and drive returns in 
strategic plans. Information on the calculation of KEP is included 
in the glossary. In 2014/15 KEP was £34 million, down from  
£74 million in the previous year reflecting the start-up nature of 
investment in new developing countries, the higher effective tax 
rate and foreign exchange translation.

exceptional items (excluding property disposals). 
Net cash at the end of the year was £329 million (2013/14:  
£238 million net cash), excluding cash held in B&Q China.  
Free cash flow of £450 million was generated in the year, a 
decrease of £109 million against the prior year due primarily to 
lower profits and an increase in working capital requirements, 
partially offset by lower capital expenditure and higher receipts 
from the disposal of assets. The year on year movement in 
working capital was primarily driven by a lower level of customer 
deposits for kitchen and bathroom sales at B&Q. This reflects 
B&Q’s move to a new ‘Every Day Great Value’ offer during 
2014/15 with attractive prices all year round. As a result, unlike 
last year, customer deposits were less concentrated into the UK’s 
traditional January sale period, impacting the year end position. 
Of the £450 million of free cash flow £434 million was returned 
to shareholders in the form of the ordinary dividend, an 
additional special dividend and share buybacks. A further £17 
million was used to buy shares to cover future share awards for 
employee incentive schemes. The proceeds from the disposal  
of the Group’s shareholding in Hornbach AG have partially  
offset these additional outflows. 
Capital expenditure 
Gross capital expenditure for the year was £275 million 
(2013/14: £304 million). Of this around 30% was invested in 
new stores and relocations, 30% on refreshing existing stores 
and 40% on IT, supply chain and omnichannel development.  
A total of £50 million of proceeds from disposals were received 
during the year (2013/14: £12 million). 
The Group has a rigorous approach to capital allocation and 
authorisation including an annual five year strategic planning and 
capital allocation process, a project by project capital approval 
process and an annual post-investment review process. 
Financial risk management 
Kingfisher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for 
managing certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed, 
details of which are provided in note 24 of the accounts. 
Management of balance sheet and liquidity risk  
and financing 
The Group finished the year with £329 million of net cash  
on the balance sheet. However, the Group’s overall leverage is 
more significant when including capitalised lease debt that in 
accordance with accounting standards does not appear on the 
balance sheet. The ratio of the Group’s lease adjusted net debt 
(capitalising leases at 8 times annual rent) to EBITDAR on a 
moving annual total basis is 2.3 times as at 31 January 2015.  
At this level the Group has financial flexibility whilst retaining  
an efficient cost of capital.

Kingfisher currently holds a BBB credit rating with two of the 
three rating agencies. The third agency remains at BBB-  
with positive outlook. Kingfisher aims to maintain its solid 
investment grade credit rating whilst investing in the business 
where economic returns are attractive and paying a healthy 
annual dividend to shareholders. After satisfying these key  
aims and taking into account the economic and trading outlook, 
any surplus capital would be returned to shareholders.  
Kingfisher regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities 
required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent 
cash flow forecast for the next five years, determining the  
level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning  
for repayments of debt at its maturity and identifying an 
appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve  
against unexpected outflows. 
At 31 January 2015 the Group had a £200 million committed 
facility that expires in 2016 and was undrawn. A new £225 
million committed facility that expires in March 2020 has been 
executed since the balance sheet date. The next significant debt 
maturity is in May 2016 when the Group is required to repay  
US Private Placement debt with a nominal value of $68 million. 
The terms of the US Private Placement note agreement and  
the committed bank facility require only that the ratio of Group 
operating profit, excluding exceptional items, to net interest 
payable must be no less than 3:1 for the preceding 12 months  
at half year and full year ends. At the year end the Group’s  
ratio was significantly higher than this requirement. 
The maturity profile of Kingfisher’s debt is illustrated at: 
www.kingfisher.com/index.asp?pageid=76 
The Group has entered into interest rate derivative contracts  
to convert the fixed rate payable on its MTNs and US Private 
Placement notes to a floating rate of interest. The floating interest 
rates paid by the Group under its financing arrangements are 
based on LIBOR and EURIBOR plus a margin, which were not 
changed during the year. In December 2014, the sterling MTN 
of £73 million was repaid. 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are: 
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and retain financial flexibility in order to continue  
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and 
• To maintain a solid investment grade credit rating of BBB. 
The Group manages its capital by: 
• Continued focus on free cash flow generation; 
• Setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the 
context of current year and forecast free cash flow generation; 
• Rigorous review of capital investments and post investment 
reviews to drive better returns; and  
• Monitoring the level of the Group’s financial and leasehold 
debt in the context of Group performance and its credit rating. 
Kingfisher Insurance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, is 
subject to minimum capital requirements as a consequence of 
its insurance activities. The Group complied with the externally 
imposed capital requirements during the year.  
Acquisitions and disposals 
On 23 July 2014 Kingfisher entered into a binding agreement 
with the principal shareholders of Mr Bricolage to acquire their 
shareholdings subject to satisfactory anti-trust clearance. At a 
late stage Mr Bricolage and the ANPF (an organisation controlled 
by Mr Bricolage’s franchisees holding 41.9% of the share capital 
of Mr Bricolage), indicated that the undertakings in France 
required to obtain the competition clearance were no longer  
in their interests. Without the consent of Mr Bricolage and the 
ANPF, the competition clearance undertakings necessary to 
finalise the transaction could not be given. The agreement also 
made provision that it would lapse if the anti-trust clearance  
was not obtained by 31 March 2015 although an extension 
could have been agreed by all parties. The ANPF did not  
agree to this extension. 
Notwithstanding Kingfisher’s efforts to pursue the completion  
of the transaction, the anti-trust clearance was not obtained by 
31 March 2015 and therefore the July 2014 agreement lapsed 
on that date and the transaction could not proceed. Kingfisher  
is considering all of its options.  
On 22 December 2014, Kingfisher announced a binding 
agreement to sell a controlling 70% stake in its B&Q China 
business to Wumei Holdings Inc for a total cash consideration  
of £140 million. The agreement followed Kingfisher’s previous 
announcement of its plans to look for a strategic partner to help 
develop its B&Q business in China. The transaction is conditional 
on MOFCOM (Chinese Ministry of Commerce) approval and, if 
approved, is expected to close during the first half of Kingfisher’s 
2015/16 financial year. 
The Group received proceeds of €236 million (£198 million) 
following the disposal of its 21% stake in Hornbach in  
March 2014. 
In 2013/14 the Group acquired 100% of Bricostore Romania  
for £63 million (including debt). 
   24 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Pensions 
At the year end, the Group had a net surplus of £112 million 
(2013/14: £100 million deficit) in relation to defined benefit 
pension arrangements, of which a £194 million surplus 
(2013/14: £29 million deficit) is in relation to the UK Scheme. 
The favourable movement is driven by the strong asset returns 
over the year, only partially offset by the impact of the reduced 
discount rate applied to the scheme liabilities. This accounting 
valuation is sensitive to a number of assumptions and market 
rates which are likely to fluctuate in the future. 
To aid understanding of the impact that changes to the 
assumptions could have on the reported UK pension position,  
we have included a sensitivity analysis as part of the pension 
disclosure in note 27 of the Group Financial Statements.  
Further details of key assumptions are also contained within  
the note. 
Property  
The Group owns a significant property portfolio, most of which is 
used for trading purposes. A valuation was performed for internal 
purposes in November 2014 with the portfolio valued by external 
professional valuers. Based on this exercise, on a sale and 
leaseback basis with Kingfisher in occupancy, the value of 
property is £3.2 billion at year end (2013/14: £3.5 billion).  
The main reasons for the year on year change are foreign 
exchange movements and disposals.

This is compared to the property net book value of £2.4 billion

Retail profit on a fully rented basis 
The Group currently operates out of a mix of owned and  
leased property with the mix varying significantly between  
our geographic markets. In order to compare divisional 
performance more easily, a summary of the retail profit  
margins on a fully rented basis is set out below:

leasehold basis 5.2% 5.8% 7.6%
Impact of new accounting standard and China disposal  
on 2015/16 reporting 
The results for 2015/16 will be impacted by both a new IFRS 
accounting requirement, IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’, and how Kingfisher 
accounts for China if the proposed sale of 70% is approved  
by China’s competition authority. To help the readers of the 
accounts, restatement data tables for 2014/15 have been 
published at: www.kingfisher.com/index.asp?pageid=59 
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’, will apply from 2015/16 with restatement of 
2014/15 comparatives. This will not have a material impact on 
the annual results of Kingfisher, but will change the quarterly 
phasing in operating costs of certain French levies, in order to 
recognise the liabilities as they are triggered under the local 
legislation. As a result the related costs will no longer be spread 
over the year but will be recognised in the final quarter. Hence 
French and Group retail profit will be increased in Q1 to Q3 and 
decreased in Q4. 
Subject to competition authority approval, the disposal of the 
Group’s 70% controlling stake in B&Q China would result in  
the Group accounting for its remaining 30% interest as an 
investment. Adjusted measures for 2015/16 and 2014/15 
comparatives would exclude B&Q China’s operating results to

Statutory reporting for 2014/15 would not be restated. 
Net Positive and integrated reporting 
Kingfisher is committed to operating sustainably and to making a 
positive contribution to society through its business activities. 
Kingfisher’s Net Positive approach is enabling the business to 
improve efficiency and resilience while generating revenue and 
supporting brand preference. Sustainability makes financial 
sense – the business has generated £2.4 billion in sales of 
products with eco credentials in 2014/15, and there are a 
number of energy saving initiatives underway, for example 
installing LED lighting across 15% of stores to date is saving  
£3 million per annum. The business is also trialling an  
approach to establish the financial benefits of initiatives to  
reduce waste, with a view to rolling this out across Kingfisher. 
Reflecting the importance of Net Positive, the Group has 
integrated sustainability considerations into its capital 
expenditure processes. 
Increasingly, the business aims to report in an integrated way 
taking account of financial, economic, social and environmental 
performance, and to reflect all the factors that contribute to our 
business success. This supports decision-making within the 
business while enabling investors and stakeholders to more 
easily assess the business value of our commitment to Net 
Positive and the contribution the business makes to society.

Given the scale of our businesses, the Board of Directors recognises that the nature, scope and potential impact of our key business 
and strategic risks are subject to constant change. As such, the Board has implemented the necessary framework to ensure that it 
has sufficient visibility of the Group’s key risks and the opportunity to regularly review the adequacy and effectiveness of our mitigating 
controls and strategies. The Board has considered the risks following the review of the business and strategy by the Leadership team 
and the risks have been amended to reflect the future operations of the business. 
During the year the Board has also considered the nature and level of risk that we are prepared to accept in order to deliver our 
business strategies and has reviewed and approved our internal statement of risk appetite. This describes both the current and 
desired levels of acceptable risk, supported by high level qualitative risk statements, ensuring that risks are proactively managed  
to the level desired by the Board. 
The Corporate governance report on page 33 describes the systems and processes through which the directors manage and mitigate 
risks. The Board considers that the principal risks to achieving its strategic aims are set out below. 
Group risks Mitigation 
Organising Kingfisher as a more 
unified company with a common 
customer offer rather than a 
collection of individual businesses 
fails to deliver the anticipated 
benefits. 
We are organising the business differently, becoming a more unified company rather than  
a collection of individual businesses. The new leadership team structure reflects the new 
organisational design.  
As with all initiatives undertaken, the leadership team will monitor the programme and 
benefits realisation on a regular basis, ensuring sufficient resources are available to deliver 
the requirements. We will continue to ensure that changes are only implemented once  
we have completed an appropriate level of planning and testing, relative to the risk. In 
addition, we ensure that the assumptions and insight, that support the introduction of  
new products or services, will deliver the benefits to both our customers and our 
shareholders prior to their introduction. 
 
Our investments fail to deliver value 
to the Group, especially our 
investment in the IT strategy 
programme. 
We continually review and assess opportunities for expansion, in terms of both online  
and bricks and mortar retail, across all of the territories and regions in which we operate.  
We are investing in our financial and operational systems to develop a company-wide IT 
solution. The IT strategy project is supported and monitored via the programme team  
and the programme office. Each business is represented on the project team to ensure  
the appropriate solution is delivered to the company. Regular updates are given to the 
leadership team and all decisions are approved in line with our investment methodology. 
Country and market entry strategies are based on the application of a proven operating 
model and supported by the part of the business with the most relevant experience, 
capabilities and capacity to successfully lead a market entry strategy. 
We also ensure that any proposed acquisition or market entry strategy is subject to an 
appropriate level of challenge and due diligence from both the leadership team and 
specialist Group functions, which may include the Tax, Treasury, Legal, Group Finance  
and Group Risk and Internal Audit functions. This due diligence is also supported by 
external and independent advisors when necessary. 
Following an acquisition, integration plans are prepared and monitored at divisional and 
Group levels. Existing management teams are supplemented with Group resources to 
monitor and assist with the integration.  
All investments are evaluated and monitored via our post investment review methodology  
in place across the business. 
 
  
Risks 27 www.kingﬁsher.com
Strategic Report
Group risks Mitigation 
We fail to deliver the benefits of a 
more unified and unique offer and 
standardised activities and 
processes. 
We aim to offer customers a product range which is differentiated from that of our 
competitors through innovation and exclusivity. To support this, we continue to evolve  
and innovate across our product ranges, formats and customer offer. We have: 
 Project teams to identify the optimum opportunities for presenting the same products  
in our stores across Europe,  e.g. a unified bathroom and garden offer. 
 Performance of the ranges and brands is tracked and strategies updated accordingly. 
 A strong sourcing network which is focused on securing Group buying opportunities. 
 Initiatives to take the best practice and best product from across the Group. 
 
We fail to create enough innovation 
opportunities. 
We view innovation as an area of future growth. The leadership team is responsible for 
developing new business opportunities. The leadership team reviews the opportunities 
identified and works within a risk weighted project appraisal framework. 
 
We fail to identify and maximise 
potential cost reductions and 
efficiency savings. 
Ensuring we operate efficiently and reduce our costs is a key area of focus for us. As part of 
our five year planning process each business reviews its cost base and identifies potential 
savings which are then monitored as part of the budgeting and forecasting processes.  
As part of our investment in IT we have identified a number of benefits and benchmarked 
these externally.  
In future, the cost base will be reviewed across the Group to identify further potential 
savings. Reviews of our processes and infrastructure will be carried out to develop a  
unified approach and realise further costs and efficiency savings. 
 
Our investments in new store 
formats, customer markets and 
customer proposition strategies  
fail to stimulate increased consumer 
spend and do not deliver the 
desired sales growth in our  
mature markets. 
We continue to invest in our Omnichannel strategy. We continue to invest in Omnichannel 
technologies and take learnings from our businesses which have well developed models, 
e.g. Screwfix. We are developing a platform which will be rolled out across the Group to offer 
alternative channels for customers. Our investment in the IT strategy programme will provide 
systems and capabilities to respond to the changing ways that customers shop. 
We continue to invest in our existing store portfolio whilst seeking to minimise its cost base 
and optimise sales densities. Where there are opportunities to expand and innovate we  
will do so using a combination of existing and new formats. We will pursue low risk market 
entry and new flexible store format strategies based on the utilisation of current skills and 
capabilities available within the Group.

Group risks Mitigation 
Uncertainty surrounding the 
resilience of the global economy 
and increased geo-political volatility, 
particularly in Russia, may impact 
both consumer confidence and the 
long-term sustainability and 
capabilities of our supplier base. 
The spread of countries in which the Company operates aids in the mitigation of this risk, 
however, with continuing market volatility and uncertainty across all of the economies  
in which we operate, particularly within the Eurozone, we continue to monitor potential 
exposures and risks and provide effective risk management solutions to both our  
businesses and our strategic suppliers. These include: 
 The provision of supply chain finance programmes to support strategic suppliers. 
 Support from a strong portfolio of international banking partners that provide flexibility, 
access to funding and reliable local retail cash and card payment processing services. 
 Diversification of cash holdings across a number of financial institutions with the strongest 
short-term credit rating. 
 An appropriate and prudent mix of hedging policies, cash deposits and debt financing  
to minimise the impact of foreign exchange currency volatility on the Group. 
 The geo-political drivers for uncertainty and volatility in the Eurozone are being monitored 
continuously, such that if risks escalate, measures are implemented to ensure there is 
sufficient and co-ordinated contingency planning. 
 A cross-functional steering group established to monitor developments in Russia, consider 
business continuity action and undertake scenario planning. 
 
We do not make the necessary 
investment in our people to ensure 
that we have the appropriate 
capacity, skills and experience. 
Across our businesses we are developing our talent and building our leadership capacity. 
Specific examples of this include:  
 The Chief People Officer will join the leadership team to prioritise the build of capabilities, 
effective KPIs and relevant reward structures. We have begun to align reward structures 
across the Group. 
 Focused development activities for our store-based colleagues and an increased focus on 
how we support and recognise the role of our customer advisors across the organisation. 
 We are creating a strong pipeline of developing talent through structured programmes 
including graduate and high potential schemes e.g. LEAD programme for the development 
of senior leaders. 
 
We fail to deliver our sustainability 
targets due to not integrating our 
sustainability plan into the day to 
day operations of the business. 
 Our commitment to sustainability remains one of Kingfisher’s key values and across the 
organisation we continue to ensure that we engage and take advice from our expert 
partners (BioRegional and Forum for the Future). 
 As part of our business planning process, we set and annually review sustainability plans 
for each business.  
 Monthly Board reports monitor the progress of our largest operating companies in 
achieving their sustainability targets.  
 Data is reported annually to the Group and signed off by the local Boards. 
 Within each business, responsibility has been assigned to a team or individual for the 
delivery of the sustainability targets. Meetings of the sustainability teams are held twice  
a year to exchange best practice and progress common initiatives. 
 Our Net Positive Advisory Council provides an external review of our processes and 
provides technical support and advice. 
 
Risks continued 29 www.kingﬁsher.com
Strategic Report
Risk Mitigation 
A lack of perceived price 
competitiveness, particularly when 
compared to more discount based  
or online competitors, would affect 
our ability to maintain or grow  
market share.  
 
Significant investment in pricing to reinforce and communicate our value credentials.  
This is supported by: 
 The use of improved customer insight and analytical tools to optimise product ranging  
and pricing strategies. 
 More targeted use of online and mass media tools to communicate and reinforce price 
perception (for example, price comparison websites, such as kitchen-compare.com and 
bathroomcompare.com in the UK).  
 
We fail to maintain a safe 
environment for our customers  
and store colleagues which results  
in a major incident or fatality that  
is directly attributable to a failure in 
our Health & Safety management 
systems. 
With 79,000 employees and millions of customers visiting our stores each week, robust 
health and safety systems are a priority. The Board is committed to creating and sustaining 
a safe environment for both our staff and customers and regularly reviews and challenges 
Health & Safety performance, standards and targets across our businesses.  
As regulatory requirements vary from country to country, each operating company is 
required to designate a director with specific responsibility for health and safety. This person 
is then responsible for ensuring that a written health and safety policy is communicated and 
that appropriate health and safety arrangements are in place to protect our employees and 
customers and that we comply with local regulatory requirements. 
The Group Health and Safety Committee sets the policy and standards for the Group. 
Compliance is monitored across our businesses through a programme of self-certification 
and Health & Safety audits, with issues reported through local Audit Committees and 
escalated to the Group Executive, Group Audit Committee or Board where necessary. 
 
Kingfisher’s reputation and brand 
are affected by a major 
environmental or ethical failure,  
a significant corporate fraud  
or material non-compliance  
with legislative or regulatory 
requirements resulting in punitive  
or custodial procedures. 
Both employees and suppliers working for or with Kingfisher must conduct themselves 
according to our minimum standards of ethics and behaviours as defined by our Code of 
Conduct. Responsibility for compliance with our Code of Conduct rests with each Group 
operating company Chief Executive and appropriate resources are available to our 
businesses to ensure that both staff and suppliers are aware of, and comply with, the code 
and our businesses can manage the legislative or regulatory challenges presented by their 
respective jurisdictions.

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present Kingfisher’s Corporate Governance 
report for the year ended 31 January 2015.  
During the year, the Board of Kingfisher plc has continued to 
apply solid governance practices, amending where necessary 
those robust, efficient and effective frameworks and systems 
developed over a number of years, by which the whole  
business is governed and reviewed. This report aims to provide 
shareholders with an understanding of the arrangements we 
undertake in order to maintain the highest standards of corporate 
governance across Kingfisher, arrangements which we consider 
to be essential for the long-term success of the Company. 
As a company listed on the London Stock Exchange, Kingfisher 
is required to review its operations annually by reference to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code‘) and a statement  
of compliance with the Code is set out on page 34. 
It is the role of the Board to provide leadership to the Group. As 
Chairman of the Board, I lead the Board in reviewing long-term 
strategy, monitoring, supporting and, where required, challenging 
the executive team, whose job it is to manage the Company 
successfully day to day, driving performance of the business  
and creating value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
For the Board to be effective in discharging its responsibilities,  
it must maintain a level of independence and objectivity, the 
correct balance of experience and skills and be comprised of 
sufficient knowledge of the operations of the business. I believe 
that the Kingfisher Board, with its vast experience and diversity  
of expertise, assists the Company in delivering its strategy and 
maximising shareholders’ long-term interests.  
The leadership of the Board is particularly important during times 
of change. In July, Philippe Tible left the business and on 8 
December 2014, Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down as Group Chief 
Executive and resigned as a director of the Board on 31 January 
2015. The Board oversaw a robust succession process for Sir Ian, 
more details of which can be found on page 45 in the report of 
the Nomination Committee, and the Board unanimously agreed 
that Véronique Laury be appointed his successor as Chief 
Executive Officer. Véronique assumed the role on 8 December 
2014. I would like to personally thank Ian for all his hard work  
in leading the transformation of the Company during his seven 
years as Group Chief Executive.  
The Board has continued to review its governance framework 
and has adjusted, where necessary, the roles, structure and 
accountabilities of its mechanisms of governance. During the 
year, the governance structure below the Board and primary 
committee level was again reviewed to ensure the correct and 
accurate flow of information and responsibility. 
This review included a full review of the terms of reference of the 
Group Executive Committee, the Kingfisher Capital Expenditure 
Committee and the Financial Initiatives, Tax and Treasury 
Committee, and these were amended where necessary to reflect 
the operations of those committees and the authorities delegated 
to them. As part of the review, in order to make the governance 
structure below primary committee level more relevant and agile, 
the structure of meetings of the Group Executive Committee  
was changed to allow for greater focus on strategic review and 
direction and a more streamlined overview of trading and 
operational matters. During the year, a Group Sustainability 
Committee was established, with the remit to monitor progress 
against Net Positive targets and agree and drive the direction  
of the Group’s approach to sustainability.  
The revised Group governance structure, together with an overview 
of each of these committees, is set out on pages 39 to 40. 
I believe that the changes the Company has made during the year 
have further enhanced its governance framework and improved 
the operation of the Board and its committees. The following 
pages of this report explain, in greater detail, the structure and 
processes in place to ensure good governance and set out the 
operations of the Board’s primary committees. I am pleased to 
endorse this report, which I believe provides an insight into how, 
through its actions, the Board and its committees have fulfilled 
their governance responsibilities and worked to ensure that strong 
governance practices remain embedded across the Group.

“This report aims to provide 
shareholders with an understanding  
of the arrangements we undertake in 
order to maintain the highest standards 
of corporate governance across 
Kingfisher, arrangements which  
we consider to be essential for the 
long-term success of the Company.” 34 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Compliance with the UK Corporate  
Governance Code 
Kingfisher is subject to and has reviewed its operations and 
governance framework to ensure that it reflects the principles  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, published by the 
Financial Reporting Council (the FRC) and available on their 
website, www.frc.org.uk. In accordance with the Listing  
Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the Board confirms that, 
throughout the year ended 31 January 2015, and as at the  
date of this report, the Company has complied with the 
provisions set out in the September 2012 edition of the  
Code, save for as set out below.  
Provision D.1.1 Provides that grants under long-term incentive 
schemes should normally be phased rather than awarded in  
one large block. 
As reported in our 2011/12 annual report, the Company  
set stretching long-term targets for management as part  
of the Creating the Leader phase of Kingfisher’s strategy.  
The Remuneration Committee approved awards under  
the Performance Share Plan (the ‘Plan’) of up to 500%  
of base salary. 
The award was higher than the normal award of 200% but  
in making it the Committee took into account the fact that  
no further awards would be made under the Plan until the 
financial year 2014/15, and felt that it created a better focus  
on a single performance period aligned to the next phase of  
the Group’s strategy, rather than the more commonly used 
overlapping performance periods. 
Leadership 
The role of the Board 
The Board’s primary responsibility is to promote the long-term 
success of the Company and deliver sustainable shareholder 
value. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the management, 
direction and performance of the Group, and leads and controls 
the Group’s business. The Board is also responsible for ensuring 
appropriate resources are in place to achieve its strategy and 
deliver sustainable performance. Through authorities delegated 
to its committees, the Board directs and reviews the Group’s 
operations within an agreed framework of controls, allowing risk 
to be assessed and managed within agreed parameters. The 
Board is collectively accountable to the Company’s shareholders 
for the proper conduct and success of the business. 
The Board’s powers are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, which are available to view on its website, and  
may be amended by a special resolution of its members. The 
Board may exercise all powers conferred on it by the Articles,  
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and other 
applicable legislation. 
The Board has established a formal schedule of matters reserved 
for its approval, and has delegated other specific responsibilities 
to its principal committees: the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees. These are clearly defined within  
the written terms of reference of the respective committees, 
which are available on the Company’s website. Information on 
the responsibilities and work of each of the Board’s committees 
is set out on pages 41 to 66. 
During the year, as part of its annual review process, the  
matters reserved for the Board were reviewed and where 
necessary amended to reflect best practice. The schedule  
of matters reserved for the Board includes the consideration  
and approval of: 
 the Group’s overall strategy, medium-term plans and  
annual budgets; 
 financial statements and Group dividend policy, including 
recommendation of the final dividend; 
 major acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure;  
 major changes to the capital structure including tax and 
treasury management; 
 major changes to accounting policies or practices; 
 the Group’s corporate governance and compliance 
arrangements; 
 the system of internal control and risk management policy; 
 the Group’s risk appetite statements; and 
 review of management development strategy. 
Composition of the Board 
During the year, the Board was made up of the non-executive 
Chairman, four executive directors and six non-executive 
directors. The number of executive directors reduced to three 
following the departure of Philippe Tible at the end of July. The 
current balance of the Board’s skills, experience and knowledge, 
together with regular briefings by executives below Board level, 
ensures that views, perceptions and discussions are not 
dominated by any one specific view. The structure, size and 
composition of the Board is continually reviewed to ensure it 
remains suitable for the needs of the business. 
There is an established, formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the selection and appointment of new directors  
to the Board, and this is described in the Nomination Committee 
Report on page 45. At the Annual General Meeting to be held  
on 9 June 2015, shareholders will be asked, in accordance  
with Principle B.7.1 of the Code, to re-appoint the directors. 
Role of the non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors provide a strong, independent and 
external insight to the Board and its committees, and have  
a wealth of experience and business knowledge from other 
sectors and industries. The terms and conditions of appointment 
of each of the non-executive directors are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office and will also be available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting. 
At its meeting in January 2015, the Board considered the 
independence of each of the non-executive directors (other than 
the Chairman, who was deemed independent by the Board at 
the date of his appointment) against the criteria specified in the 
Code, and concluded that each remained fully independent of 
management and free from any relationship that could interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement.

Governance
Role of the Senior Independent Director 
Since his appointment in January 2012, Mark Seligman has 
acted as Senior Independent Director (SID), supporting the 
Chairman, and is available for approach or representation from 
significant shareholders who feel they are unable to raise issues 
with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial 
Officer. In accordance with the FRC guidelines, the role of  
the SID is formally set out in writing, and available on the 
Company’s website.  
Roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer are separate and clearly defined. As part of  
the annual review process, the written roles of the Chairman  
and Chief Executive Officer were reviewed to ensure they  
remained compliant with, and took account of, best practice 
developments, and were in line with FRC guidance. The written 
roles for both are available to view on the Company’s website.  
In accordance with best practice, the Chairman is responsible  
for the overall operation, leadership and governance of the 
Board, setting the tone and style of Board discussions, and 
creating the conditions for overall Board and individual director 
effectiveness. He is also responsible for ensuring that all 
members of the Board develop an understanding of the views  
of major shareholders, that there is an open dialogue with 
shareholders and that the chairmen of the Board’s principal 
committees are available to answer shareholder questions at  
the Annual General Meeting. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for executive 
management of the Group’s business, consistent with the 
strategy and commercial objectives agreed by the Board.  
She leads the Senior Leadership team in effecting decisions  
of the Board and its committees, and is responsible for the 
maintenance and protection of the reputation of the Company 
and its subsidiaries. The Chief Executive Officer is also 
responsible for promoting and conducting the affairs of the 
Group with the highest standards of integrity, probity and 
corporate governance. 
Company Secretary 
The General Counsel & Company Secretary acts as Secretary  
to the Board and its committees and, with the consent of the 
Board, may delegate responsibility for the management of  
the committees to other suitably qualified staff. The Company 
Secretary is responsible for ensuring that good quality 
information flows from executive management to the Board  
and its committees and that correct Board procedures are 
followed. She advises the Board on legal, corporate governance 
matters and facilitates the inductions of new directors and  
assists in providing professional development as required.  
All directors have access to the Company Secretary for 
governance compliance and legal advice. The appointment  
and removal of the Company Secretary is one of the matters 
reserved to the Board.  
Diversity on the Board 
In September 2011, the Board announced its approach to 
diversity. The statement, which is available on the Company’s 
website, confirmed that the Board is committed to ensuring 
directors of the Company possess and demonstrate a broad 
balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and 
diversity, including gender diversity. The Board remains 
committed to that statement. 
In order to maintain the appropriate balance of skills, experience 
and knowledge on the Board, the Nomination Committee 
considers each prospective candidate on their individual merits, 
regardless of gender, age, race, nationality, religion or disability, 
in the belief that balanced and diverse Boards are effective.  
The Company encourages diversity and an inclusive culture  
as it believes that this benefits our business by providing access  
to a wide range of skills, experience and perspectives and allows 
us to reflect our diverse customer base. The Board is committed 
to maximising the benefits of such a diverse workforce to deliver 
real sustainable benefits for the Group and its shareholders. 
Achieving balanced representation of men and women at  
all levels throughout the Group is a priority and the charts 
demonstrating the gender split at Board level, senior 
management level, and for the workforce as a whole,  
can be found in the Financial Review on page 25.

Board meetings 
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings throughout  
the year and unscheduled supplementary meetings as  
and when necessary. These meetings are structured to allow open 
discussion. At each meeting the Board receives certain regular 
reports, which include an update from the Chief Executive Officer, 
current trading/finance (including liquidity) reports from the Chief 
Financial Officer, and capital expenditure approvals and reports 
from the General Counsel & Company Secretary (including 
governance, legal, insurance and risk updates). Regular people-
related updates from the Group Human Resources Director  
and Net Positive progress updates and public affairs updates  
from the Group Sustainability Director are also provided to the 
Board at its meetings throughout the year. 
All directors participate in discussing strategy, trading and 
financial performance, and risk management of the Group. 
Comprehensive briefing papers are circulated to all directors 
approximately one week before each meeting in digital format. 
Should a director be unable to attend a particular meeting, they 
are provided with all relevant briefing papers and are given the 
opportunity to discuss any issues with the Chairman or the Chief 
Executive Officer and, where possible, participate by telephone  
for critical discussions and approvals on specific matters. 
The Board generally meets at the Group’s head office in London 
but holds at least one meeting each year overseas. During the 
year under review, the Board held a meeting in Lille, France 
where it reviewed the French Brico Dépôt and Castorama brands 
and considered the operations of the Brico Dépôt businesses in 
Portugal, Romania and Spain. The Board also visited a number 
of stores in the area. It is the Board’s intention to hold one off-site 
meeting outside the UK, in a country in which the Group 
operates in the coming year, to receive presentations from the 
senior management of the operating company and experience 
the challenges facing that business. The Chairman and the non-
executive directors meet regularly without executive directors 
being present.  
The Chairman maintains regular contact with the SID. 
 
Activities during the year 
During the year, as part of its regular business, the Board: 
 received regular strategic presentations from management  
and held ‘deep dive’ discussions with management of the 
Group’s operating companies, information technology and 
Group sourcing management; 
 considered regular updates on health and safety progress; 
 reviewed the Group’s anti-bribery and corruption policies  
and procedures to ensure continued compliance with  
the UK Bribery Act; 
 reviewed the Group’s risk profile and reviewed the Group  
risk appetite statement; 
 received a progress update on the Group’s Net  
Positive strategy;  
 considered the Group’s capital structure and cash position; 
 considered post-investment reviews of capital expenditure 
projects over three years; and 
 reviewed and approved the Group’s major IT  
programme and processes. 
In addition to its regular business, the Board also: 
 approved succession plans for the role of Chief Executive 
Officer, and for the departure of Philippe Tible as a director  
of the Board; 
 considered and approved the arrangements for the disposal  
of a majority stake in its business in China; 
 reviewed and proposed to shareholders for approval the rules 
of the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan; and 
 considered and approved the acquisition of the Mr Bricolage 
business in France, subject to competition clearance being 
achieved, at an agreed cost.

Board evaluation 
In accordance with provision B.6 of the Code, the Board is 
required to conduct a review of its performance each year. 
During the year under review, to ensure that they continue to  
be effective and each director remained committed to their role 
and had sufficient time to manage their commitments, the  
Board and its committees evaluated their effectiveness using  
an externally facilitated questionnaire and a series of one-to-one 
interviews between each director and the Chairman. The 
questionnaire was developed by reference to the topics 
discussed and recommendations made during the previous 
year’s evaluation, and drafted following discussions between  
the Chairman, the Company Secretary and the external 
facilitator, Linstock. Responses to the questionnaire were  
collated and the output was used by the Chairman in his 
individual meetings with directors as part of the evaluation 
process. The evaluation was conducted in December 2014  
and the areas considered during the evaluation were: 
 Board composition and expertise;  
 time management oversight; 
 Board support; 
 strategic oversight; 
 risk management and internal control; 
 succession planning and human resource management; and  
 priorities for change. 
The results of the evaluation were considered by the Board  
at its meeting in January 2015. No significant issues were 
highlighted and the review indicated that the Board continued  
to work efficiently and effectively, and that the contribution and 
commitment of each director, and their interaction with each 
other, remained good, and the challenge offered by the non-
executive directors was robust and appropriate. As a result of  
the evaluation, the Board agreed to undertake the following 
activities during the 2015/16 financial year: 
 support the new Chief Executive Officer with her review  
of the organisation, strategy phasing, articulating the  
customer proposition and omnichannel development; 
 conduct a third-party review of Board papers to increase clarity 
and brevity, to enhance Board discussion; 
 conduct in-depth reviews of two of the Group’s new markets, 
in Romania and Germany; 
 review the forward business agenda to ensure that there  
is sufficient time to focus on key Group programmes and 
initiatives such as the development of a more common  
and unique offer and the omnichannel proposition; 
 maintain its oversight of the Group’s performance relative  
to its competitors and customer trends; and  
 increase its exposure to the Group’s senior management  
below the Board.  
As part of the evaluation process, the Chief Executive Officer 
carried out a performance review of the executive directors.  
The non-executive directors, led by the SID, conducted a 
performance review of the Chairman in respect of the  
financial year. 
The Board has confirmed that the contribution of each of  
the directors continues to be effective and that shareholders 
should be supportive of their re-appointment to the Board. 
The Board will continue to review its procedures, effectiveness 
and development in the year ahead, and the Chairman will use 
the output of the most recent Board evaluation in his individual 
meetings with the directors during the year.

Induction, information and professional development 
All new directors appointed to the Board receive an induction 
pack as part of their comprehensive induction programme 
tailored to their experience, background and particular areas  
of focus. The induction programme is designed to develop 
directors’ knowledge and understanding of the Group’s 
operations and culture.  
The induction programme includes: 
 individual one-to-one meetings with the Chairman, the
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and
other directors;
 site visits to the Group’s stores and those of its competitors;
 meetings with management of the Group’s operating
companies and other senior management; and
 if required, external training courses at the Group’s expense.
In accordance with best practice, the Chairman considers and 
addresses the development needs of the Board as a whole, if 
any, and ensures that each director updates their individual 
skills, knowledge and expertise. 
As part of her induction as new Chief Executive Officer, 
Véronique Laury conducted visits to most of the Group’s 
operating companies to meet with management and understand 
the particular nature of the businesses. The Company Secretary 
arranged for the Group’s corporate lawyers to provide a training 
session on her duties and responsibilities as a director of a UK 
listed company. Amongst other topics, the training covered 
Listing Rules compliance and the control and release of inside 
information, and provided case studies and practical situations 
for consideration. Ms Laury also attended shareholder roadshows 
in London and the United States and met with the Company’s 
major institutional investors.  
The Board also receives regular reports and feedback from 
discussions with the Company’s institutional shareholders and is 
informed of any issues or concerns raised by them. This process 
allows directors to develop necessary understanding of the views 
of these shareholders and also enables the Board to judge 
whether investors have a sufficient understanding of the Group’s 
objectives. In addition to planned development and briefings, 
each director is expected to take responsibility for identifying  
their own individual needs and to take necessary steps to ensure 
that they are adequately informed about the Group and their 
responsibilities as a director. The Board is confident that all its 
members have the requisite knowledge, ability and experience  
to perform the functions required of the directors of a listed 
company. There is also an agreed procedure whereby directors 
may take independent professional advice at the Group’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties. 
Subsequent training in specific aspects of the Group’s 
businesses is provided to directors, when requested, or regularly 
as part of site visits. Directors are briefed on issues at Board and 
committee meetings and have full and timely access to relevant 
information ahead of each meeting.  
Conflicts of interest 
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to avoid 
a situation where he or she may have a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts with the interests of the Company. The Company 
has robust procedures in place to identify, authorise and manage 
such conflicts of interest, and these procedures have operated 
effectively during the year.  
A register of directors’ situational and transactional conflicts  
is maintained by the Company Secretary and reviewed by the 
Board on a regular basis and directors have a continuing duty to 
update the Board with any changes to their conflicts of interest. 
Following review, the Board confirmed that there were no 
situations of which they were aware which would, or potentially 
could, give rise to conflicts with the interests of the Company, 
other than those that might arise from directors’ other 
appointments, which are set out in the directors’ biographies  
on pages 30 to 31.

Relations with shareholders 
The Company is committed to communicating its strategy  
and activities clearly to its shareholders and, to that end, 
maintains an active dialogue with investors through a planned 
programme of investor relations activities. The investor relations 
programme includes: 
 formal presentations of preliminary and interim results;
 Q1, Q2 pre-close and Q3 trading statements regular meetings between institutional investors and senior
management to ensure that the investor community receives
a balanced and complete view of the Group’s performance
and the issues faced by the Group;
 hosting investors’ and analysts’ sessions at which
senior managers from relevant operating companies
deliver presentations which provide an overview of their
individual businesses;
 responding to enquiries from shareholders through the
Company’s investor relations team;
 regular meetings between institutional investors and
analysts and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to discuss business performance; and
 a comprehensive investor relations section on the
Company’s website.
The Chairman, the SID and the chairmen of the Board’s 
committees are available to meet major investors on request.  
The SID has a specific responsibility to be available to 
shareholders who have concerns, and for whom contact  
with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial 
Officer has either failed to resolve their concerns, or for whom 
such contact is inappropriate. 
Annual General Meeting 
The principal means of communication with private investors is  
by electronic communications and through the Annual General 
Meeting, which is attended by all the Company’s directors, and 
allows all shareholders present the opportunity to question the 
Chairman and the directors, as well as the chairmen of the 
Board’s committees. After the Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders have the opportunity to meet informally with 
directors. At the Annual General Meeting in June 2015, the 
Chairman intends to use his discretion to call for a poll on all 
resolutions. The results of the poll in relation to all resolutions  
will be disclosed to those in attendance at the meeting, 
published on the Company’s website and announced to the 
London Stock Exchange shortly after the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting. 
Committees 
The Board has delegated authority to its principal committees to 
carry out certain tasks as defined in each committee’s respective 
terms of reference. The written terms of reference in respect  
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are 
available on the Company’s website. The Board is satisfied that 
the terms of reference for each of these committees satisfy the 
requirements of the Code. The terms of reference of the principal 
committees are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
The minutes of committee meetings are made available to all 
directors on a timely basis. In addition, at each Board meeting, 
the chairmen of the principal committees provide the Board with 
a brief synopsis of the work carried out by their committee, if any, 
between Board meetings.  
In addition to the principal committees, the Board is  
supported by the work of the Group Executive Committee  
and its subcommittees. Together, these committees form a 
fundamental element of the Company’s corporate governance 
framework. The Group’s governance structure and a brief

and the other management committees is set out below:

Executive Committee were reviewed during the year. The 
Committee consists of the Leadership Team and comprises  
the executive directors, the Operations Director, Omnichannel 
and Chief Digital and IT Officer, the Operations Director, Big Box 
and the Operations Director, Medium Box. The Committee meets 
formally ten times a year under the chairmanship of the Chief 
Executive Officer.  
The Committee’s primary focus is the strategic direction of the 
Group. In addition, the Committee monitors top talent within the 
business and reviews key items requiring formal Board approval, 
including dividend planning, key projects and strategic capital 
expenditure decisions.  
In accordance with its formal terms of reference, the Group 
Executive Committee is also responsible for reviewing and 
making recommendations to the Board on: 
 strategic and business plans of individual businesses; 
 the Group’s capital structure and funding; 
 strategic capital expenditure proposals, major acquisitions  
or disposals of businesses;  
 the Group’s key risks and risk appetite; 
 management development and senior executive succession 
plans; and 
 the Group’s Net Positive programme. 
During the year, the Committee met ten times and, in addition  
to its standing agenda, reviewed: 
 the Group’s branding strategies and Group procurement  
and sourcing arrangements; 
 operating budgets and monthly trading performance; 
 a potential franchise model for its Brico Dépôt business; 
 the embedding of appropriate health and safety behaviours 
across the Group;  
 the Group’s IT strategy, planning and execution;

behaviours; and 
 HR proposals for management development and  
succession planning. 
One Team Board 
The One Team Board consists of the Group Executive 
Committee, the CEOs of each of the Group’s operating 
companies and other senior Group employees who report 
directly to members of the Group Executive Committee. The 
primary purpose of the Board, which meets at least quarterly,  
is the implementation of Group Strategy and the day to day 
management of the Group’s businesses. At its meetings, the  
One Team Board considers performance against strategy and 
budget and reviews Group-wide people-related activities. 
Capital Expenditure Committee 
The Capital Expenditure Committee is responsible for reviewing 
and approving all capital expenditure projects relating to property 
and non-property proposals in excess of an agreed threshold of 
£0.75m, which is reviewed periodically.  
The Committee will review and make recommendations to the 
Board regarding all projects exceeding its agreed approval 
threshold of £15m. The Committee comprises the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Operations  
Director, Omnichannel and Chief Digital and IT Officer, the 
Group Finance and Planning Director, the Company Secretary 
and the Group Property Investment Director. 
Financial Initiatives, Tax and Treasury Committee 
The primary purpose of the Committee is to monitor compliance 
with policies and control issues relating to Group Finance, and

and Secretariat functions, and, where appropriate, recommend 
certain initiatives for approval of the Board. The Committee 
comprises the Chief Financial Officer, Group Finance and 
Planning Director, Group Treasurer, Group Tax Director,  
Head of Group Pensions and Company Secretary. 
Disclosure Committee 
The Committee’s primary purpose is to ensure that information to 
be disclosed by the Company in its reports is properly identified, 
recorded, processed, summarised and reported to senior 
management of the Company and to the Audit Committee. The 
Committee assists in ensuring that disclosures fairly represent 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and, in  
the case of the Annual Report and Accounts, ensure that when 
taken as a whole, they are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide shareholders with the information needed to assess 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee 
comprises the Chief Financial Officer, Group Finance and 
Planning Director, Company Secretary, Group Chief Accountant 
and the Group Communications Director. 
Group Health and Safety Committee 
The Committee’s primary purpose is to review the management  
of health and safety risks across the Group and monitor 
performance on, and compliance with, Group policies, 
procedures and practices in relation to all aspects of health  
and safety, with the aim of providing safe environments for 
employees, customers, suppliers and contractors and driving 
continuous improvements. The Committee comprises the Group 
Company Secretary, the Director of Risk & Compliance, a regional 
representative of each of Kingfisher’s Divisions and the Group 
Property Services Director. The Chief Financial Officer has Board 
responsibility for health and safety and attends meetings of the 
Committee on a regular basis and delegates day to day oversight 
to the Company Secretary as Chairman of the Committee. 
Group Sustainability Committee 
The Committee was established in 2014 and met twice in the 
year under review. Its primary purpose is to provide direction  
on the development and integration of sustainability throughout 
the Group and oversee its implementation. The Committee is 
chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and members are drawn 
from the Group Executive Committee and senior leadership from 
the Group’s operating companies. The Committee is responsible 
for agreeing the direction of Kingfisher’s sustainability approach 
and for monitoring progress against the Company’s Net Positive 
targets. On behalf of the Group Executive Committee, the 
Committee assures consistency by approving policy standards 
and processes in relation to sustainability for each operating 
company. It also shares best practices across the Group and 
supports the development of capacity and capability at all levels 
throughout the business to deliver Net Positive. 
Details of each of the Board’s principal committees, including 
membership, are set out in the following reports.

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee  
for 2014/15.  
During the year under review, the Committee carried out its 
duties in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the 
Code’) and reviewed its operations in relation to the Code.  
The Committee is appointed by the Board from amongst its  
non-executive directors, and its principal duties are to provide 
effective oversight and governance of the internal control and  
risk management processes of the Company, to review the 
financial statements and related accounting policies, review  
the effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions  
and provide updates and recommendations to the Board. 
In addition to the activities outlined above, during the year, the 
Committee continued the analysis of the Company’s risks and 
associated mitigating controls and focused on compliance, 
financial governance and internal audit functions. It also 
considered the appropriateness of significant judgements  
made in connection with the financial statements, in particular  
in relation to rebates, further details of which are contained  
later in this report. 
The Committee maintained its good working relationship with  
the Group Finance Director, Group Audit and Risk Management 
Director, the Group Finance and Planning Director, the Company 
Secretary and the Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP. The 
Committee maintained, reviewed and where necessary amended its 
standing agenda, which is linked to the Group’s financial calendars. 
In order to improve the understanding of their operations, during 
the year the Committee received in-depth presentations from 
management of the Group’s operating companies, including  
the key strategic risks impacting each business. The Committee 
considered and reviewed the Group’s adequate procedures  
in relation to bribery and corruption and the provision of a 
whistleblowing service. On 1 October 2014, changes were made 
to the Code in relation to the identification and management of 
principal risks of the business, within an agreed risk appetite, 
and provision of a longer-term viability statement of the 
Company. The changes to the Code are applicable to the 
2015/16 financial year and the Committee will work during  
the year to reflect those changes as required by the revised  
Code and provide necessary levels of enhanced disclosure  
in this report next year.  
A fuller description of the operations of the Committee is set  
out below. I will be available at the Annual General Meeting  
to answer any questions about the work of the Committee.

as the Committee member with recent and relevant financial 
experience. All other members of the Audit Committee are 
deemed to have the necessary ability and experience  
to understand financial statements. The attendance by  
members at Committee meetings is set out on page 41.  
All members of the Committee receive appropriate induction,  
in addition to the induction which all new directors receive.  
The induction programme includes an overview of the business, 
its financial dynamics and risks. New Committee members  
also obtain access to the Group’s operations and staff, and  
all members of the Committee undertake ongoing training  
as required. 
The Committee is required, under its terms of reference, to  
meet at least three times a year. During the year, the Committee 
met four times. The Committee has a standing agenda linked to 
events in the Group’s financial calendar for consideration at each 
meeting, and within the annual audit cycle, to ensure that its 
work is in line with the requirements of the Code. At the invitation 
of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief 
Executive Officer attended all meetings, as did the Chief 
Financial Officer, Group Audit and Risk Management Director, 
Group Finance and Planning Director and the external auditor. 
Private meetings were also held with the external and internal 
auditors at which management were not present. 
The effectiveness of the Audit Committee was considered  
as part of the Board evaluation detailed on page 37. At its 
meeting in January 2015, the Committee considered the 
contents of the review and concluded that the evaluation had 
found the Committee provided robust and appropriate challenge 
to the business and continued to operate efficiently and 
effectively. It was agreed that no specific actions were required 
by the Committee as a result of the review.  
Detailed below is the key work undertaken by the Committee 
during the year under review and up to the date of this  
Annual Report.  
Activities of the Audit Committee during the year 
Internal controls and risk 
The Committee received and considered reports during  
the year from the Group’s internal audit function on the work 
they had undertaken in reviewing and auditing the Group, in 
order to assess the quality and effectiveness of the internal 
control system. 
The Committee also received and considered reports from the 
Group’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP, which included any 
control findings relevant to their audit. 
The Committee considered reports on the output from the 
Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate  
risks and reviewed the annual report on the Group’s systems of 
internal control and their effectiveness, and reported the results 
of the review to the Board. Further information on the Group’s 
risk management and internal control procedures can be found 
on page 44. 
As part of the Committee’s continuing programme to increase  
its awareness of the Group’s operations and to understand the 
implementation of operating company control processes, the 
Committee met with, and received presentations from, the  
senior management of operating companies in France (Brico 
Dépôt and Castorama), Turkey and Poland, and received a 
presentation from the senior management of its IT function, 
Kingfisher Information Technology Services Limited. The significant 
matters the Committee considered in the year included: 
 Internal audit perform store audits in each of our operating
companies. As part of this work, control issues relating to
health and safety processes were identified across the Group.
The issues have been isolated instances of non-compliance
with our health and safety procedures. Action plans have
been put in place to address these issues. This is supported
by the Group Health and Safety Committee. The Committee
was satisfied that the necessary steps were being taken to
improve the standards of health and safety across the Group.
 the internal audit function has carried out regular reviews of
the Group-wide Easier IT Programme to provide the
Committee with assurance over the governance, performance
and delivery of the major IT programme. This is a significant
project for the Group and the Committee is satisfied that the
correct level of control is being maintained. Further reviews
will be carried out in 2015.
 the Committee received two presentations from the IT
function, focusing on cyber risks the Group faces and the
mitigation in place. The Committee was satisfied that adequate
steps were being taken to protect the Group against the cyber
threat. This area has been added to the standing agenda and
will be reviewed at least twice a year by the Committee.
 the Committee reviewed policies and processes in relation to
rebates during 2014/15 as a result of the change in industry
context around that area, in addition to their disclosure within
the financial statements. The Company has historically had
strong policies in place surrounding rebates and, as such,
no significant concerns were raised as part of this review.
In addition, the Committee continued to monitor the progress  
on the standardisation and improvement of the Group’s internal 
control processes, in a number of key areas. 
The Committee reviewed the operation of the Group 
whistleblowing helpline, which allows employees within the  
Group and its suppliers to report suspicions of fraud, financial 
and operational irregularities and other improprieties. The 
‘SpeakUp’ service was reviewed along with arrangements  
to acknowledge, investigate and close down reports at the 
Committee’s meeting in January 2015 and, having considered 
the extension of the service during the year to include all Group 
sourcing offices and the expansion of reporting permitted in 
France, the number, location and type of incidents reported,  
the Committee concluded that the Group continued to  
maintain adequate mechanisms for recording disclosures.  
Financial reporting and significant financial issues  
During the year, the Committee formally reviewed the  
Company’s annual and interim financial statements and 
associated announcements. The reviews considered significant 
accounting principles, policies and practices and their 
appropriateness, financial reporting issues and significant 
judgements made. The Committee also considered whether  
the 2014/15 Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced 
and understandable, having received input and guidance from 
the Disclosure Committee. 
Corporate governance continued 43 www.kingﬁsher.com
Governance
In conducting these reviews, the Committee considered the  
work and recommendations of the Group finance function  
and received reports from the Group’s external auditor on their 
findings, including any control observations relevant to their  
audit work. The significant reporting matters the Committee 
considered in the year are detailed below: 
 the Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill to 
determine whether any impairment had been suffered. The 
Committee reviewed the significant financial assumptions 
used, including validity of cash flow projections and the 
selection of appropriate discount and long-term growth rates;  
 the Committee considered the treatment of exceptional items, 
which are presented as exceptional to help provide an 
indication of the Group’s underlying business performance; 
 the Committee reviewed the significant judgements relating  
to stock. This included a review of the appropriateness of  
the Group’s stock provisioning policy which takes into 
consideration such factors as stock turn, damage and 
obsolescence; and 
 the Committee reviewed the significant judgements relating  
to rebates, including the disclosures made in the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements section in Note 3 to  
the financial statements on page 96. Based on the reports 
received from the Group’s finance function, the significant 
majority of the Group’s supplier income relates to volume-
based agreements, with the remainder representing other 
rebate income for which recognition is more judgemental. The 
Committee noted that volume-based income is largely based 
on calendar year purchases, therefore the risk of misstatement 
is reduced significantly for year-end reporting. The Committee 
reviewed the report from the Group finance and risk functions 
of the application of those key judgements and the related 
controls in place over all rebates, and is satisfied with the 
judgements taken and control environment in relation to the 
recognition of rebate income and financial statement reporting. 
Group internal audit 
The Committee considered and reviewed updates from the 
internal audit programme at each of its meetings during the  
year. Reports from the internal audit function to the Committee 
included updates on the Group’s risk management systems, 
findings from reviews, and reviews of the remit, organisation, 
annual plan and resources of the internal audit function. In line 
with best practice, an external evaluation of the function was 
carried out during the year by Grant Thornton LLP, with input 
from the function’s key stakeholders within the Group. The 
review found the function to have a strong mix of competencies 
and experience, a good methodology to deliver a risk based plan 
and sufficient resources to deliver the plan. No significant issues 
were highlighted by the review. 
External audit 
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the 
Board with regard to the reappointment of the external auditor. In 
doing so, the Committee takes into account auditor independence 
and audit partner rotation. Deloitte LLP were appointed as 
external auditor in 2009/10 following a formal tender process. 
Richard Muschamp was appointed lead audit partner following 
the conclusion of the 2013/14 audit process, and will serve as 
lead partner until the external audit contract is put out to tender, 
which in accordance with provision C.3.7 of the Code in relation 
to audit tendering would mean the Company putting the external 
audit contract out to tender by 2019 at the latest. 
During the year, the Committee agreed the approach and  
scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the external  
auditor, Deloitte LLP, and undertook an assessment of their 
qualifications, expertise and resources, independence and the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. The Committee also 
reviewed and agreed the terms of engagement, the fees, and 
areas of responsibility and the work to be undertaken by the 
external auditor, and agreed the fees payable in respect of the 
2014/15 audit work. Details of the amounts paid to the external 
auditor for their audit services are given in Note 7 to the accounts 
on page 100. In addition, the external auditor provided the 
Committee with a schedule of each matter on which there was 
an initial difference between them and management in relation 
to the accounting treatment, and with the final decisions on 
these issues.  
The Committee also considered the effectiveness and 
independence of the external auditor. In consideration  
of its effectiveness, the Committee reviewed the experience  
and expertise of the audit team, the fulfilment of the agreed  
audit plan and any variations to it, feedback from the Group’s 
businesses and the contents of the external audit report. 
In considering the independence of the external auditor, the 
Committee received a statement of independence from the 
auditor, a report describing their arrangements to identify,  
report and manage any conflicts of interest, and reviewed  
the extent of non-audit services provided to the Group. The 
Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the effectiveness 
and independence of the external auditor. 
The Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte  
LLP be proposed for re-appointment by shareholders as the 
Company’s external auditor at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. As a result of its work during the year, the Committee 
has concluded that it acted in accordance with its terms of 
reference and has ensured the independence and objectivity  
of the external auditor. 
In addition to their statutory duties, the services of Deloitte LLP 
are also engaged where, as a result of their position as external 
auditor, they either must, or are best placed to, perform the work 
in question. This is primarily work in relation to matters such as 
the interim review, additional assurance procedures, shareholder 
circulars, Group borrowings, tax compliance, regulatory filings 
and certain business acquisitions and disposals. Other work is 
awarded on the basis of competitive tendering. 
The Committee reviewed and approved the scope of non-audit 
services provided and proposed by the external auditor to ensure 
that there was no impairment of independence and objectivity, 
and subsequently monitored the non-audit work performed to 
ensure it was within policy guidelines.  
The Group has a policy on the use of its external auditor for  
non-audit work and this is regularly reviewed. The external 
auditor is precluded from engaging in non-audit services that 
would compromise their independence or violate any laws or 
regulations affecting their appointment as external auditor.  
The approval of the Chairman of the Committee is required  
prior to awarding contracts for non-audit services to the external 
auditor, where in excess of specified amounts. The Group’s 
policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit work  
can be found on the Group’s website. 
During the year, Deloitte LLP charged the Group £1.8m 
(2013/14: £1.8m) for audit and audit-related services and a 
further £0.2m (2013/14: £0.4m) for non-audit services.   44 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Accountability, risk management and internal control 
Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control, which is designed to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and ensure the reliability of the financial information for 
both internal use and external publication, and to comply with 
the Turnbull guidance and the Code.  
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the effectiveness of  
the internal control system, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management in accordance with 
the Code, for the period from 1 February 2014 to the date of 
approval of this Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15. 
If significant losses were to be incurred during the year as a 
result of a failure of controls, a detailed report would be provided 
to the Audit Committee and the Board. The Board confirms that 
no significant weaknesses were identified in relation to the review 
carried out during the year and, therefore, no remedial action  
was required. 
The Board has approved a set of policies, procedures and 
frameworks for effective internal control. The Group has 
procedures for the delegation of authorities for significant 
matters, to ensure approval is sought at the appropriate level. 
These procedures are subject to regular review and provide an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group. Such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring the 
system and the maintenance of effective control is delegated to 
the management of each of the Group’s operating companies. 
The Group’s risk management and reporting process helps 
Group management to identify, assess, prioritise and mitigate 
risk. Management at each operating company has responsibility 
for the identification and evaluation of the significant risks 
applicable to their business and any mitigating actions to be 
taken. The Group Executive Committee reviews, identifies and 
evaluates the risks that are significant at a Group level, as well  
as the mitigating actions against those risks. These are then 
considered by the Board. The types of risks identified included 
both strategic and material operational risks and are detailed  
on pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report. 
Management is required to apply judgement in evaluating the 
risks facing the Group in achieving its objectives, in determining 
the risks that are considered acceptable to bear, in assessing the 
likelihood of those risks materialising, in identifying the Group’s 
ability to reduce the incidence and impact on the business of 
risks that do materialise, and in ensuring the costs of operating 
particular controls are proportionate to the benefit provided. 
Monitoring 
There are clear processes for controlling and monitoring the 
system of internal control and reporting any significant control 
failings or weaknesses together with details of corrective action. 
These include: 
 an annual planning process and regular financial reporting, 
comparing results with plan and the previous year on a 
monthly and cumulative basis; 
 written reports from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer submitted at each Board meeting; 
 operating company management report formally to the  
Audit Committee on a regular basis on the control environment 
in their business and actions taken to maintain or improve  
the environment as appropriate; and 
 reports and presentations to the Board on certain areas  
of specialist risk. These include treasury, insurance, tax  
and pensions. 
A formal bi-annual certification is provided by the CEO and 
Finance Director of each operating company stating that 
appropriate internal controls were in operation and confirming 
compliance with Group policies and procedures. Any 
weaknesses are highlighted and the results are reviewed by 
operating company management, the Group Audit and Risk 
Management Director, the Group Finance and Planning Director, 
the Audit Committee and the Board. The internal audit function 
monitors and selectively checks the results of this exercise, 
ensuring that representations made are consistent with the 
results of its work during the year. 
The internal audit function follows a planned programme of 
reviews that are aligned to the Group’s risks. The function: 
 works with the operating companies to develop, improve  
and embed risk management tools and processes into their 
business operations; 
 reports directly to the Audit Committee and has the authority  
to review any relevant part of the Group; 
 oversees the operation of the individual operating companies’ 
audit committees; and 
 provides the Audit Committee and the Board with objective 
assurance on the control environment across the Group.  
Risk appetite 
During the year, the Board also considered the nature and level 
of risk that it was prepared to accept in order to deliver business 
strategies, and reviewed and approved the Group’s internal 
statement of risk appetite. This statement of risk appetite 
describes both the current and medium-term levels of 
acceptable risk, supported by high level qualitative risk 
statements, ensuring that risks are proactively managed to  
the level desired by the Board.

The role of the Nomination Committee is to review the 
composition of the Board and plan for its refreshment as 
applicable with regard to composition, balance and structure. 
The Committee is also asked to lead, on behalf of the Board,  
the selection process for new Board appointments and to make 
recommendations in respect of such appointments while 
maintaining an appropriate balance of diversity of skills.  
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Nomination 
Committee is required to: 
 review the structure, size and composition of the Board  
and make recommendations to the Board, as appropriate; 
 identify the balance of skills, knowledge, diversity  
and experience on the Board and nominate candidates  
to fill Board vacancies; 
 review the time commitment required from the  
non-executive directors; 
 consider succession planning, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the  
future skills and expertise needed on the Board; and 
 review the leadership needs of the organisation, both  
executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring the 
continued ability of the organisation to compete effectively  
in the marketplace. 
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed during the 
year and were amended in line with best practice and are 
available on the Company’s website (www.kingfisher.com). 
Committee composition 
The Committee comprises the Chairman and all the non-
executive directors and meets periodically as required. External 
advisers may be invited to attend meetings when particular 
issues are to be considered.  
Meeting attendance 
The Committee meets as necessary to fulfil its responsibilities 
and meet its objectives. In the year under review, the Committee 
met on seven occasions and attendance at those meetings is 
recorded below.

Directors did not attend those parts of the meeting where their own reappointment 
was considered. 
Activities during the year 
The Committee is responsible for leading the process by which 
directors are appointed to the Board and there is a formal, 
rigorous and transparent procedure for the selection and 
appointment of new Board directors. Candidates are identified 
using objective criteria and selected with due regard to the 
benefits of a diverse Board. At its meetings during the year, the 
Committee considered executive and non-executive succession 
planning, skill requirements, and the Board effectiveness review. 
During the year, the Committee considered the departure of 
Philippe Tible and recommended he step down from the Board 
and from his membership of the Group Executive Committee  
at the end of July, but remain with the business until the end  
of the 2014/15 financial year.  
The Committee also considered and recommended to the Board 
the appointment of Véronique Laury as Chief Executive Officer, 
as successor to Sir Ian Cheshire. Véronique was selected 
following consideration of a number of internal and external 
candidates for the role. A search for suitable candidates for the 
role was commissioned using a reputable independent search 
consultancy. Following an extensive review of candidates, 
Véronique was selected as the preferred candidate and her 
appointment was recommended by the Committee. 
Following the appointment of Véronique, and a review of the 
Board and its committees, the Committee is of the firm belief  
that the revised composition of the Board represents a strong, 
well balanced and diverse Board, with membership being made  
up of specialists in the fields of retail, technology, finance and 
human resources, and with the necessary experience and skills 
to meet the Group’s current and future requirements. The 
Committee will continue to take all appropriate action in order  
to ensure that the right talent to manage the business will be in 
place in the future. 
As part of its ongoing review of talent pipelines across the Group, 
in October 2014, the Committee considered a talent report 
presented by the Group HR Director, which highlighted 
succession considerations for the Board in support of its strategy. 
In the coming year, the Committee will continue to review  
and assess the requirements of the Board and its committees  
in terms of their composition and will undertake appropriate 
succession planning activity to ensure the correct balance of 
skills, expertise and experience. It will also take all appropriate 
action in order to ensure that the right talent to manage the 
business will be in place in the future. 
I will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer  
any questions about the work of the Committee.

Annual Statement from the Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the 2014/15 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on behalf of the Board. 
2014/15 is the first year that Kingfisher has operated under the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy that was approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 AGM. The Committee considers this 
policy to remain appropriate and therefore we will not be taking  
a policy to a vote at this year’s AGM. For ease of reference an 
extract from the approved policy has been attached at the back 
of this report on pages 67 to 75. 
Our work this year has focused on implementing remuneration 
under this policy. Further details are set out in this letter and in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration.  
A year of transition 
2014/15 saw a number of changes to the executive management 
team. 
In June and September respectively we announced that Philippe 
Tible and Sir Ian Cheshire would be stepping down from the 
Board and leaving the Company at the end of the year. As set out 
in the Chairman’s statement, both changes were a part of agreed 
succession processes. As a result, both Mr Tible and Sir Ian 
Cheshire were treated as good leavers under our remuneration 
policy and were allowed to retain unvested share awards. 
Following a robust recruitment process, we are pleased to have 
appointed Véronique Laury as Chief Executive Officer. Ms Laury’s 
remuneration arrangements were published on our website at 
the relevant time. The ongoing package structure is consistent 
with other executive directors. She received no enhancements or 
additional awards as part of her recruitment. The Company has 
provided her with support as part of her relocation. 
“ As a result of the challenging business 
environment, the Group financial measures  
for the 2014/15 annual bonus did not meet the 
threshold performance targets and so have not 
paid out. This reflects our rigorous approach to 
target setting and linking pay to performance.”

Governance
All decisions taken by the Remuneration Committee in respect  
of these individuals were in line with the Remuneration Policy. 
Full details of the remuneration arrangements can be found in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration and further information 
regarding the CEO succession process can be found in the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 45. 
Business outcomes 
2014/15 was a challenging year. The results for 2014/15 
reflected a mixed picture across our markets with the UK picking 
up but continental Europe, particularly France, proving to be a 
more challenging environment. In France, the slower economy 
and declining housing market affected our performance.  
In the UK & Ireland, retail profit grew, helped by initiatives  
to re-energise B&Q and by better demand for trade products  
as housing and construction activity improved.  
Further information regarding the Group’s performance during 
the year can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 29. 
Incentive outcomes 2014/15 
As a result of the challenging business environment outlined 
above, the Group financial measures for the 2014/15 annual 
bonus did not meet the threshold performance targets and so 
have not paid out. This reflects our rigorous approach to target 
setting and linking pay to performance. Stronger performance  
in B&Q resulted in 26.7% of the financial elements of Kevin 
O’Byrne’s bonus paying out. The Committee has considered  
the personal performance of each director and determined the 
appropriate payout under this element of the bonus. Details are 
set out on page 53.  
No LTIP awards had performance periods ending in 2014/15. 
Following our review of remuneration policy last year, we moved 
from the one-off LTIP award which supported the turnaround in 
2011 to annual LTIP grants, the first of which will vest based on 
performance in 2016/17. 
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2015/16 
The Committee has considered salary increases for executive 
directors for 2015/16. Ms Laury joined the Board in December 
2014 with a salary of £700,000 just before our salary review in 
February 2015. In the salary review no salary increases were 
made for Véronique Laury and Kevin O’Byrne. As outlined in  
last year's Remuneration Report, Karen Witts was appointed to 
the role of Chief Financial Officer at a salary below the market 
median with a plan to bring her up to median as she became 
established in role. Karen has developed strongly in the role and 
is now considered by the Remuneration Committee to be fully 
established. Accordingly her salary was increased by 4.8% to 
£550,000. This completes the phased movement in her salary 
since joining the Board and, from now on, she will be considered 
for salary reviews as for any other executive director. The average 
salary increase across the wider UK employee population was 2%. 
Bonus and LTIP award levels for 2015/16 are consistent with 
awards granted in 2014/15. A working capital measure will 
replace the cash flow measure for the 2015/16 annual bonus  
to reflect a key management team focus in the coming year.  
The other annual bonus measures are consistent with the 
2014/15 bonus. The LTIP will continue to be measured  
against EPS and KEP.  
The Committee has considered the updated UK Corporate 
Governance Code, and has incorporated malus and clawback 
provisions into the annual cash bonus, deferred bonus and  
LTIP for 2015/16. 
Wider employee considerations 
The Committee is kept informed of remuneration arrangements 
across the Company and is mindful of ensuring all employees 
benefit from the success of Kingfisher. 
Our employees benefited following the maturity of Sharesave 
awards during the year, with over 2,000 employees sharing  
an average of over £1,500 each. The majority of those receiving 
this additional remuneration were store-based colleagues at B&Q 
and Screwfix. 
Participation in Sharesave continues to grow and this year a 
record number of employees joined our scheme. 
Shareholder engagement 
The Committee welcomes the views of shareholders on 
remuneration on an ongoing basis. We consulted extensively with 
shareholders in 2013/14 when developing our remuneration 
policy and received strong support at our 2014 AGM with 
98.93% and 99.73% of shareholders voting in favour of our 
remuneration policy and remuneration report respectively. 
I very much hope you will support the 2014/15 Annual Report  
on Remuneration at our forthcoming meeting in June, where  
I will be available to answer any questions about the work of  
the Committee.

Annual Report on Remuneration 
The Annual Report on Remuneration explains how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy was implemented for the financial year  
to 31 January 2015 and the resulting payments to each of the directors. The Annual Report on Remuneration, together with the 
Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, will be proposed for an advisory vote by shareholders at  
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 9 June 2015. These reports have been prepared in accordance with the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the ‘Regulations’) and also  
include the items required to be disclosed under UKLA Listing Rule 9.8.8R. Certain information has been subject to audit by  
the Group’s auditor, Deloitte LLP. 
Appointment of Véronique Laury as Chief Executive Officer 
Véronique Laury was appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 8 December 2014. Details of her remuneration package are set  
out below. All elements of the package are in line with the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
Extract from Recruitment Policy Application for Véronique Laury 
Contract Ms Laury was moved to a UK employment contract from her French contract and therefore  
has the same policy terms as other UK-based executive directors. Her new contract provides  
for 12 months’ notice from either side, with provision for any termination sums to be paid in 
monthly instalments and to reduce/cease if she finds an alternative position. The maximum  
sum due under her contract will be 12 months’ base salary only (with no allowance for benefits). 
Base salary 
Base salary is set at an 
appropriate level to recruit the 
best candidate based on skills, 
experience and current 
remuneration. 
Base salary was set at £700,000. This reflects Ms Laury's significant retail experience, knowledge 
of the Kingfisher business and her proven track record, including her time spent as Group 
Commercial Director and CEO Castorama France.  
It is the Company's intention to move her base salary towards the market median rate over the 
next three to four years. This may result in percentage reviews being in high single digits in some 
years as she develops and performs in her role. 
Benefits 
Benefits will be in line with normal 
policy and may include, where 
appropriate, relocation benefits. 
Benefits were offered on the same terms as other executive directors and within policy.  
Ms Laury is entitled to participate in the UK defined contribution pension scheme or to receive  
a cash alternative. Ms Laury’s employer’s pension contribution rate is set at 14%, which is lower 
than the maximum of 30% allowed under the policy. 
As Ms Laury was resident in France at the time of her appointment, the Company has provided 
support to set up a base in London. The amount of support to be provided has been capped  
at 50% of her annual base salary (inclusive of any tax payable on expenses reimbursed). 
Incentives 
Normal incentive awards will  
be made under the annual  
bonus plan and long-term 
incentive plan in line with the 
Remuneration Policy. 
The same award levels will apply as for other executive directors, i.e. a maximum of 200% of 
base salary for the annual bonus and 200% for the LTIP. The new annual bonus opportunity 
applied from the date of her appointment and the new LTIP award level will apply from the grant 
made in 2015. 
Commitment made prior to 
appointment 
For internal promotions any 
commitments made prior to 
appointment may continue to  
be honoured as the executive  
is transitioned to the new 
remuneration arrangements. 
With the exception of unvested share awards granted to Ms Laury prior to her promotion to  
Chief Executive Officer and the 2014/15 annual bonus up to her date of appointment, which will 
all continue to run their normal course, there are no historical arrangements being honoured. 
Additional awards 
The Committee would be mindful 
of best practice guidelines in 
considering whether an enhanced 
LTIP or other award was 
necessary on recruitment. 
No enhancements or additional awards were given. 
Further details of her remuneration are set out within this Report.

shown in the table above. Full details of Ms Laury’s remuneration arrangements are set out on pages 52-55 and estimates of potential future remuneration can  
be found on page 49. 
(2) Mr Tible stepped down as an executive director on 31 July 2014 and his remuneration for the six months from 2 February 2014 to 31 July 2014 is shown in the table 
above. All the awards have been converted from euros into sterling using the average exchange rate for the financial year of 1.24 (2013/14: 1.17). 
(3) Bonus payments made to Mr Tible include a payment of £46,406 (2013/14: £58,190) in relation to the all employee Interessement and Participation schemes in  
France, as well as the award under the annual bonus which is detailed in the notes to the single figure table below. 
(4) The value of the LTIP has been restated from the estimate disclosed in 2013/14 to take into account the movement in the share price and subsequent dividend equivalent 
shares received before the vesting date. The shares were valued in last year’s report based on the average share price for the last three months of the 2013/14 financial 
year. The restatement has applied the actual share price at the date of vesting in June 2014 for the first tranche and the average share price for the last three months of 
the 2014/15 financial year for the second tranche which is not due to vest until June 2015. This has also fed into a restatement of the overall totals for 2013/14.

(4) Sir Ian Cheshire's Sharesave option matured on 1 December 2014. Having saved £250 a month over the three-year saving period, he exercised his option over 4,522 
ordinary shares and retained all the shares. The shares were acquired at an option price of 199p per share, resulting in a notional gain of £5,382 based on the closing 
price of Kingfisher shares on 4 December 2014 (318.0p) when the option was exercised.

3. Annual Bonus  
The executive directors’ targets for the 2014/15 bonus were based on both financial targets and individual objectives as set  
out in the tables below, with annual bonus payments determined by reference to performance over the financial year ending  
31 January 2015. For the financial targets, achievement is calculated on a straight-line basis between start to earn and target  
and between target and maximum.  
The table below shows the target ranges set and the outcomes achieved as a % of maximum.

Notes 
Targets are shown on the same currency basis as the out turns. 
The values above for Ms Laury and Mr Tible relate to the bonus earned for the period they were executive directors. 
The targets for Mr O'Byrne were set at business unit level. These are considered commercially sensitive and are therefore not disclosed. 
The annual bonus will be paid in April 2015 for the financial year 2014/15. For the current executive directors, 50% of the annual bonus awarded will be deferred  
for a period of three years in Kingfisher shares, and be due to  vest in 2018. Former executive directors will receive their bonus award wholly in cash. 
 
   54 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
4. LTIP 
The value of LTIPs shown in the single figure table shows the level of award resulting from targets set and measured over the relevant 
reporting period. The 2011 PSP award level was determined with reference to performance ending in 2013/14. Therefore, although 
the vesting of this award was in two equal tranches in June 2014 and June 2015, the full combined value of the two elements was 
shown in 2013/14 using the share price for the last three months of the 2013/14 financial year. There was no LTIP based on 
performance ending in 2014/15 and hence the value for the 2014/15 column is nil. 
The shares which vested during the financial year on 17 June 2014 under the first tranche are set out below along with the second 
tranche which is due to vest on 17 June 2015.

(4)  This is the second tranche, being the second half of the total number of shares vesting adjusted for dividend equivalents during the 2014/15 financial year and  
time prorated for the two former executive directors. 
(5) Since these awards had not vested at the date this Report was finalised, the average share price for the last three months of the 2014/15 financial year (319.29p)  
has been used to determine the value. 
 
5. Pensions 
(audited information) 
UK pension arrangements  
Executive directors based in the UK are eligible to join the UK defined-contribution pension plan (the ‘DC Scheme’). 
The Company operates a policy to limit the combined employer and member pension contributions during a tax year to the  
annual allowance (currently £40,000), with the excess employer contribution being directed into a taxable monthly cash allowance.  
In addition, executive directors may choose to opt out of the DC Scheme completely, for example, if they have reached the lifetime 
allowance (currently £1.25m). 
A summary of the arrangements for the UK-based executive directors is set out below. 
 
Employer contribution rate into 
defined contribution pension scheme 
Member of the 
UK DC Scheme 
Cash allowance in lieu of employer 
contributions into DC Scheme 
Executive directors    
Véronique Laury 14% No Yes, in full 
Kevin O’Byrne 20% No Yes, in full 
Karen Witts 20% Yes Yes, in excess of the annual allowance
Former executive directors    
Sir Ian Cheshire 30% Yes Yes, in excess of the annual allowance
Cash allowances are provided on a cost-neutral basis for the Company. This means that a discount is applied for those executive 
directors joining after the introduction of pension salary sacrifice (SMART pensions) in 2012. This takes into account the fact that 
employer’s national insurance is payable on the cash alternative whereas currently it is not payable on employer pension contributions 
into the defined-contribution scheme. Accordingly, the cash alternative for Véronique Laury is 12.5% of base salary and 17.5% of 
base salary for Karen Witts. 
Based on Véronique Laury’s current working pattern and her habitual residency status, there is a legal requirement for her to remain 
in the French social security system rather than move to the UK system. Ms Laury’s pension benefit has been reduced to the 
employer contribution rate available to all UK employees to take into account the fact that she will continue to accrue pension rights  
in the French state system. This will be continually monitored and, in the event that she does revert to the UK social security system, 
her pension benefit may increase to an employer DC contribution of 20% of salary or a cash alternative of 17.5%, in line with the 
approved Remuneration Policy. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 55 www.kingﬁsher.com

Non-UK pension arrangements 
Philippe Tible was a member of a separate French defined benefit pension scheme. A condition for a pension to crystallise under  
this scheme required Mr Tible to leave the Kingfisher Group no earlier than his 62
nd
 birthday. This condition was met following the 
termination of his contract of employment on 31 January 2015. On leaving the Group he qualified for a deferred defined benefit 
pension of €225,289 based on 12 years of service with the Company which could be drawn from the scheme’s normal retirement 
date at the age of 65. The scheme allows for the early drawing of the pension providing a 3% discount factor is applied for each year 
it is drawn early, for which Mr Tible opted. Accordingly, the final pension payable which Mr Tible started to draw from his date of 
leaving was €213,928 per annum. 
During the year the relevant French works councils and the potential beneficiaries of this scheme were informed of its closure from 
the end of the 2014/15 financial year. Mr Tible will be the last executive to qualify for a defined benefit pension under this scheme.

(1) Sir Ian Cheshire is eligible to a deferred pension from the Kingfisher defined-benefit section, which was closed to future accrual of benefits on 30 June 2012.  
This was a final salary scheme but was subject to a scheme salary cap of £136,200 at the date of closure. At his date of termination on 31 January 2015, the value  
of pension was £34,997, which can be drawn from the normal retirement date of the age of 65. Sir Ian has chosen to draw his pension immediately resulting in a  
3% discount being applied per year of early  drawing.  
(2) The increase in Sir Ian's defined-benefit arrangement over the year was an indexation uplift of 0.7% (£243) to £34,997. The methodology for reporting purposes takes  
the difference between the opening deferred pension position adjusted for CPI and the closing position which has been adjusted for RPI. 
(3) The increase in Mr Tible’s defined-benefit pension accrual is shown for the six month period that he was an executive director to be consistent with the other reward 
elements. Over the full year the increase in pension accrual was £211,465. 
(4) Salary sacrifice member contributions into the Kingfisher DC Scheme were made by Sir Ian Cheshire and Karen Witts to the value of £41,672 and £40,250 respectively.  56 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15

The table below sets out the treatment in relation to the executive directors who left the business during the year, which was  
applied in line with the Remuneration Policy. Sir Ian Cheshire received a total payment for loss of office of £938,970 and  
Philippe Tible received a total payment for loss of office of £610,338. A breakdown below also includes the treatment of the

Extract from Remuneration Policy  Application  
 Sir Ian Cheshire Philippe Tible 
 Stepped down as Chief Executive Officer 
with effect on 8 December 2014 but 
remained as an executive director until 
leaving the Company on 31 January 2015. 
Stepped down as an executive director  
with effect on 31 July 2014 and left the 
Company on 31 January 2015. 
Base salary, benefits and pension 
If notice is served by either party, the 
executive director may continue to receive 
base salary, benefits and pension for the 
duration of their notice period. 
Notice was served on 10 September  
2014 when the Group’s succession 
programme was publicly announced.  
Sir Ian Cheshire continued to receive  
his base salary, benefits and pension 
contributions as normal for the period  
up to 31 January 2015. 
From 1 August 2014, Mr Tible was 
employed on his existing terms until  
31 October 2014. Thereafter he continued 
to be employed on a part-time basis and 
his salary was prorated accordingly. He 
continued to receive his fixed employment 
benefits (e.g. company car, medical 
insurance) in full. He also continued to 
participate in the pension scheme as 
normal up to his departure date.  
Payment in lieu of notice 
For any period of notice not served: 
 Sir Ian Cheshire would receive phased 
payments of 15% of base salary 
respectively for a maximum of  
12 months subject to mitigation; 
 Philippe Tible would receive a payment 
of a maximum of three months’ 
remuneration. 
Sir Ian Cheshire is eligible for a monthly 
payment of £127,350 for a maximum  
of just over seven months, this being the 
balance of his 12-month notice period  
not worked. The maximum value of 
payments under the liquidated damages,  
in the event that mitigation is not applied, 
would be £931,970. 
Notice was served between the period from 
the external announcement at the 2014 
AGM to the leaving date. As such there was 
no outstanding notice period remaining at 
the point of departure and no payment in 
lieu of notice was payable. 
Dismissal indemnity 
Dismissal indemnity determined by the 
collective convention applicable to all 
French employees. 
– As legally required, €297,000 (£232,249) 
was paid based on 3% of annual 
remuneration per year of service with  
the Group.  
Settlement agreement 
In the event of a settlement agreement, 
 the Committee may agree payments it 
considers reasonable in settlement of  
legal claims. 
– €150,000 (£117,297) was paid on 
departure in respect of statutory rights 
under protection legislation in France. 
Non-Compete 
In respect of Philippe Tible, an amount 
equal to 50% of annual salary and car 
benefit must be paid to him on a monthly 
basis if his employment is terminated by 
the Company. 
– €318,500 (£249,062) to be paid in  
12 equal monthly instalments following  
Mr Tible's departure. This amount is 
standard practice under French law in 
order to ensure that the non-compete 
provision is enforceable. 
Annual Bonus 
If notice is served by either party, the 
executive director may receive bonus 
payments in cash on a prorated basis  
from the start of the financial year up to  
the date of termination of employment, 
based on the determination of the results  
at the year end against targets set. 
Sir Ian Cheshire was eligible for a  
2014/15 annual bonus as normal as he 
was employed for the full financial year.  
The personal weighting of the performance 
measures attaching to the annual bonus 
(20% of the bonus mix) was assessed 
based on the successful handover to his 
successor Véronique Laury for the period 
from 10 September 2014 to 31 January 
2015. The overall bonus award  
was £203,760. 
Mr Tible was eligible for the 2014/15 
annual bonus payment as normal for the 
six month period he was an executive 
director for which he received £58,813.  
He continued to be eligible for a bonus in 
his new role based on specific objectives 
relating to the Mr Bricolage acquisition, 
although the award level determined at  
the year end was nil.

Deferred Bonus 
Deferred bonus awards granted under the 
KISS lapse if the executive director resigns 
or is dismissed for cause. In all other 
circumstances, the award will vest in full  
on the date of cessation of employment. 
Note that awards granted under the  
KISP from 2015 onwards in ‘good leaver’ 
circumstances would vest on the normal 
vesting date. 
These vested in full at the date of 
termination. The shares were valued at 
£1,007,973 (based on 294,041 shares). 
These vested in full at the date of 
termination. The shares were valued at 
£542,536 (based on 158,266 shares). 
LTIP 
If an executive director ceases to be 
employed as a result of a reason defined  
as a good leaver within the rules of the 
KISP or the PSP, which includes ill-health, 
retirement or any reason at the discretion  
of the Committee, then the awards will  
vest on the normal vesting date, but will be 
adjusted on a time prorated basis (unless 
the Committee decides, acting fairly and 
reasonably, that such an adjustment would 
be inappropriate). 
The second tranche of the award granted 
under the Performance Share Plan in 2011 
will vest on the normal vesting date of 15 
June 2015 and will be prorated (90.6%) to 
take into account the length of time Sir Ian 
Cheshire was employed over the vesting 
period. The estimated face value of the 
shares taking into account the pro-rata is 
£810,403 (based on 236,407 shares). 
The second tranche of the award granted 
under the Performance Share Plan in 2011 
will vest on the normal vesting date of 15 
June 2015 and will be prorated (90.6%)  
to take into account the length of time  
Mr Tible was employed over the vesting 
period. The estimated face value of the 
shares taking into account the pro rata is 
£455,033 (based on 132,740 shares). 
Other 
Reasonable reimbursement of  
professional fees in connection with 
settlement agreements. 
A contribution of £7,000 was made 
towards legal fees. 
A contribution of €15,000 (£11,730) was 
made towards legal fees. 
Sir Ian Cheshire and Mr Tible were not granted long-term incentive awards under the KISP in 2014/15. 
The face value of unvested awards at the date of departure has been calculated at 342.80p per share, being the closing price of Kingfisher shares on 30 January 2015. 
Payments in euros have been converted into sterling using the average exchange rate for the last three months of the financial year (1.2788). 
Payments to past directors 
There were no payments to past directors. 
Outside appointments for executive directors 
Subject to the rules governing conflicts of interest, the Company is supportive of its executive directors holding non-executive roles 
outside the Group, as it recognises that such roles can broaden their experience and knowledge, which can be of benefit to the 
Group. Subject to the Committee’s agreement, any fees may be retained by the individual.  
Sir Ian Cheshire is a non-executive director, member of the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director of Whitbread 
plc, and is paid £55,000, £5,000 and £10,000 per annum respectively for fulfilling these roles and he retained these fees. In 
addition, Sir Ian Cheshire was lead non-executive member of the Department for Work and Pensions Board until November 2014,  
for which he waived his fee.  
Kevin O’Byrne is a non-executive director, Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee of Land Securities 
Group plc, and is paid £67,500, £10,000 and £17,500 per annum respectively for fulfilling these roles. He retains these fees.  
Karen Witts is a non-executive director of Imperial Tobacco Group plc, and is paid £75,000 per annum for fulfilling this role. She 
retains these fees.  
Performance graph 
The graph below shows Kingfisher’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) for the six years to 31 January 2015, which assumes that  
£100 was invested in Kingfisher on 1 February 2009. The Company chose the FTSE100 Index as an appropriate comparator  
for this graph, as Kingfisher has been a constituent of that index throughout the period.

(2) The original LTIP grant level shows the award level initially given three years prior to the date the vesting percentage was determined. 
(3) The value of the LTIP for 2013/14, when the award level for the 2011 PSP was determined, has been restated using the share price at the date of vesting for the first 
tranche, which vested in June 2014, and the average share price for the last three months of the 2014/15 financial year for the second tranche, which is due to vest  
in June 2015. 
(4) Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down as Chief Executive Officer on 8 December 2014 and Ms Laury took over the position on this date. Sir Ian Cheshire's remuneration in  
the table is from the start of the financial year up until 8 December 2014, and Ms Laury's is from 8 December to the end of the financial year. 
 
Change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer 
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Chief Executive Officer’s salary, benefits and bonus between 2013/14  
and 2014/15 compared with the average percentage change in the average of each of those components for all full-time equivalent 
employees based in the UK. The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the Chief Executive Officer  
is based in the UK (albeit with a global role and responsibilities) and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local 
market conditions.  
As required by statute, the table shows the details for the Chief Executive Officer role and therefore includes a combination of the 
remuneration of Sir Ian Cheshire and Véronique Laury for 2014/15. As Ms Laury’s overall remuneration is lower than Sir Ian 
Cheshire’s, the calculation for 2014/15 results in a downward movement in the year-on-year percentage change. If the table below 
reflected Sir Ian Cheshire’s remuneration for the full financial year, the percentage movement on a like-for-like basis would be an 
increase of 2.0% in base salary and a decline of 21.8% across the three elements combined. The significant benefits movement  
for the Chief Executive Officer is due to the inclusion of initial relocation support offered to Ms Laury in 2014/15 and the Sharesave 
Plan that vested for Sir Ian Cheshire.

Executive directors’ shareholdings and share interests 
(audited information) 
Executive directors are required to build a significant shareholding in the Company within five years from the date of their first award 
under a qualifying plan. Unvested awards are not included when assessing holding requirements. Vested awards are included when 
assessing holdings, but are adjusted to take account of the tax liability arising on exercise. 
The table below sets out the beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company of the executive directors and a summary of 
outstanding share awards as at 31 January 2015. Calculations are based on a share price of 342.8p (being the closing price of a 
Kingfisher share on 30 January 2015).

The KISS awards were granted on 23 April 2014 and were calculated by reference to the average share price for the three dealing days prior to grant of 418.67p per share. 
The awards are structured as nil-cost options. The UK awards have an exercise period of four years less one day, and overseas awards have an exercise period of six months. 
Leavers have six months to exercise awards from the date of termination.

(1) Based on the average share price for the three dealing days prior to grant date on 15 September 2014 of 316.55p per share. 
(2) The main grant date for the 2014 LTIP was 3 July 2014. At the time of grant, the business was considering plans for CEO succession, and as this was considered  
to be potentially price-sensitive, there were restrictions on share dealing for certain senior individuals which included the executive directors at the time and Ms Laury.  
As a result the grant was delayed until shortly after the public announcement on CEO succession on 10 September 2014. The share price between the two dates fell,  
so in order to prevent executive directors benefiting from the delay, the number of shares awarded was based on 200% of salary using the share price at the main grant 
date on 3 July 2014. As well as not benefiting from the delayed grant, the Company did not wish for executive directors to be disadvantaged. The vesting date for the  
main grant was therefore applied, being 3 July 2017. This explains why the face value of the award in the table is less than 200% of salary and why the vesting period  
is less than three years. 
(3) All awards lapse seven years less one day from the actual date of grant. 
(4) The award for Ms Laury was based on her position before her appointment as Chief Executive Officer. 
 
The performance measures attached to the 2014 LTIP were EPS and KEP with equal weighting of 50% each.  
A definition of KEP is included in the glossary. The targets for the EPS element were as follows:  
Performance Measure 
Threshold – 
25% vesting 
Maximum – 
100% vesting
Earnings per share – compound annual growth up to 2016/17 4% 11.5%
The EPS growth targets were set to be consistent with market practice in the FTSE 100 and in particular the retail sector. The 
intention is to operate this range consistently over the policy period. The threshold level of performance provides for real growth, 
which is considered suitably challenging in what remains an uncertain economic environment, but sets an achievable level of 
performance to ensure participants place value on the plan and are motivated by it. The Maximum performance level ensures that  
full vesting is only achieved for outstanding double-digit performance over a three-year period, well in advance of typical industry 
growth rates. 
KEP targets are calibrated to be consistent with the EPS growth targets, recognising that in weaker performance scenarios offsetting 
capital efficiencies should be identified, whereas stronger performance scenarios may allow increased capital investment. The Board 
considers the KEP targets to be commercially confidential because of the additional information they contain regarding potential 
capital investment plans, and so these targets will be disclosed in full at the point of vesting of the award.

(1) The CSOP is an HMRC-approved plan, where gains on exercise are subject to capital gains tax. The CSOP awards are underpinned by a KISS award over the same 
number of shares. At the time of exercise, sufficient CSOP underpin shares are exercised to meet the total option price of the CSOP award (£30,000). The proceeds  
are paid to Kingfisher and the CSOP award subsequently exercised. The excess CSOP underpin shares (which by definition are to the same value as the capital gain  
on the CSOP) then lapse. 
(2) This is made up of the £30,000 used to fund the exercise of the CSOP plus the value of dividend equivalents accrued over the period.

Dilution limits 
Kingfisher’s share plans contain limits that set out the quantum of newly issued shares that may be used to satisfy awards granted 
under those plans. These limits are in line with the current Investment Association guidance on headroom limits which provide that 
overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital, with  
a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on executive plans. The Company has always operated within these limits. The 
Committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential vesting of options  
or share awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits. Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market 
purchased shares are excluded from such calculations. No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 31 January 2015.

in her role as she gained more experience as a Chief Financial Officer. This is a second and final adjustment to align  
her with the market following her appointment in 2012.  
It is the Company’s intention to move Ms Laury’s base salary towards the market median over the next three to four years.  
This may result in percentage reviews being in high single digits as she develops and performs in her role.

Annual Bonus 2015/16 
Implemented in line with Policy.  
The weightings of the metrics in the annual bonus scheme for 2015/16 are as follows: 
Profit before tax – 30% 
Like-for-like sales – 30% 
Working capital – 20% 
Personal objectives – 20% 
For the financial metrics, all executive directors will be measured on Group performance. 
At threshold level of performance, the award will be 10% of maximum. 
Profit before tax excludes exceptional items according to the judgement of the Committee. 
Like-for-like sales is set as an absolute target, but the Committee applies judgement in measuring the outcome against target,  
taking into account sales growth against the local market out-turn and any consequent increase or decrease in market share. 
Any exchange rate upsides/downsides will be removed from the results when determining award levels, since they are considered  
to be outside the executive directors’ control.  
In the opinion of the Board/Remuneration Committee, the annual bonus performance conditions and personal objectives for  
2015/16 are commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed. These will be disclosed retrospectively next year to the  
extent that they are not commercially sensitive.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 
Implemented in line with Policy. The performance measures to be attached to the 2015 LTIP are EPS and KEP with equal  
weighting of 50% each. A definition of KEP is included in the glossary. The targets for the EPS element are as follows: 
Performance Measure 
Threshold - 
25% vesting 
Maximum – 
100% vesting
Earnings per share – compound annual growth up to 2017/18 4% 11.5%
The EPS growth targets were set to be consistent with market practice in the FTSE 100 and in particular the retail sector.  
The intention is to operate this range consistently over the policy period. The threshold level of performance provides for real  
growth, which is considered suitably challenging in what remains an uncertain economic environment, but sets an achievable level  
of performance to ensure participants place value on the plan and are motivated by it. The maximum performance level ensures that 
full vesting is only achieved for outstanding double-digit performance over a three-year period, well in advance of typical industry 
growth rates. 
KEP targets are calibrated to be consistent with the EPS growth targets, recognising that in weaker performance scenarios offsetting 
capital efficiencies should be identified, whereas stronger performance scenarios may allow increased capital investment. The Board 
considers the KEP targets to be commercially confidential because of the additional information they contain regarding potential 
capital investment plans so these targets will be disclosed in full at the point of vesting of the award. 
Malus and clawback 
As a result of the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2014, clawback provisions have now been included in the rules  
of the annual bonus scheme and the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan. 
Clawback provisions will apply for three years from the award of an annual bonus and two years from the vesting of a  
long-term incentive. 
The malus and clawback provisions allow unvested awards to be reduced or delivered awards to be recovered in the  
following circumstances: 
 The Company’s financial results being materially misstated; 
 The determination of the award being made in error; 
 The actions of a participant leading to the Company suffering reputational damage; or 
 Material misconduct of a participant.

The Remuneration committee 
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is a Committee of the Board with delegated powers which are set out in its terms  
of reference, which are available to view on the Company’s website. The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed on an annual 
basis and were last updated in October 2014. 
The Committee’s main responsibilities are to: 
 Determine the Group’s framework and policy for executive remuneration and to submit the Remuneration Policy to shareholders 
for approval at least on a triennial basis; 
 Determine individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and in addition have oversight of the remuneration 
packages of senior executives below Board level; 
 Select and appoint advisors to the Committee; 
 Report to shareholders on an annual basis on the work of the Committee and submit the Annual Report on Remuneration for  
an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board on the Committee’s activities at the Board meeting immediately following the 
meeting of the Committee.

The Committee is scheduled to meet three times a year and meets additionally as required. During the year, the Committee  
met four times. 
   66 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
During 2014/15 the Committee: 
 
 agreed the award level of the 2013/14 annual bonus; 
 recommended the 2013/14 Directors’ Remuneration Report for endorsement by the Board and subsequent approval  
by shareholders; 
 recommended the approval of the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan to shareholders and implemented the plan following 
shareholder approval; 
 considered the UK Corporate Governance Code and implemented malus and clawback arrangements accordingly; 
 agreed the performance targets for the annual bonus for the 2014/15 financial year and monitored progress against those targets; 
 implemented and tested the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and concluded that 
the Policy remained appropriate and that no changes be proposed to shareholders; 
 considered the French ‘Top Hat’ pension scheme and agreed to its closure, effective 31 January 2015; 
 considered and agreed the exit arrangements for Philippe Tible and Sir Ian Cheshire; and 
 agreed the remuneration arrangements for Véronique Laury. 
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for the next layer of management below the Group executive  
and with information on wider employee pay reviews.  
The Committee approves the policy on share award levels for all employees and uses this information to ensure that there is 
consistency of approach throughout the Group. 
Advisors to the Committee 
During the financial year to 31 January 2015, the following external advisors provided services to the Committee. Unless otherwise 
stated, the advisors have no other connection with the Group, and the Committee firmly believes that the advice received was, and 
continues to be, objective and independent. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
PwC were appointed by the Committee as its principal advisors on 1 February 2013. PwC is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group (the professional body for executive remuneration consultants). PwC provided the Committee with executive 
remuneration advice, including advice relating to the operation of employee and executive share plans, and provided other services  
to the Group. The fees paid to PwC during 2014/15 were £185,358. During 2014 the Remuneration Committee conducted a review 
of its effectiveness. As part of this it considered the advice received from PwC and is confident that PwC provides objective and 
independent advice to the Remuneration Committee. 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Freshfields) 
Freshfields provided legal advice to the Committee on employment and remuneration issues. Freshfields also provides advice to the 
Group on other legal matters. 
 
Voting at the Annual General Meeting

Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
For reference, the following is an extract from Kingfisher’s 
Remuneration Policy. It includes minor modifications to remove 
any comments relevant to the prior year.  It does not include the 
changes made to malus and clawback provisions or the change 
in the maximum monthly saving limit under Sharesave. 
The full policy can be found in the 2013/14 Remuneration report 
at www.kingfisher.com. 
The key principles of the Remuneration Policy are to: 
 provide executive directors with a remuneration package  
that recognises the experience of the individual concerned 
and the value created; 
 ensure that performance-related remuneration constitutes  
a substantial proportion of the remuneration package;  
 ensure that executive directors' interests are aligned with 
shareholders by delivering rewards in shares and requiring a 
significant personal holding in Kingfisher shares in accordance 
with the Group's share ownership policy;  
 be competitive in the talent markets in which the Group 
operates; 
 be fair, transparent and straightforward to understand; and  
 ensure remuneration principles apply consistently throughout 
the Group and, where practical, are translated into local 
practice at the appropriate organisational level.  
The Committee is satisfied that this Remuneration Policy strikes 
an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable elements 
of remuneration, and between promoting short and long-term 
business objectives. 
 
 
Remuneration Policy  
Element and purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Assessment of performance 
Base salary    
Base salary reflects the 
individual’s role, experience 
and contribution to the  
Group and is set at levels 
 that support the recruitment 
and retention of executive 
directors of the calibre 
required by the Group. 
Base salaries are set with reference to two primary 
comparator groups: i) FTSE 25-75 excluding 
financial services organisations, and ii) FTSE 100 
retailers and privately held retailers which are 
considered to be of a similar size and market 
capitalisation to the Group. The Committee also 
takes account of pay levels in other large European 
retailers. Alternative peer groups may need to be 
referenced depending on the domicile of 
individual executive directors outside the UK.  
The Committee does not apply a strict 
mathematical approach to the market data,  
which it considers to be only one relevant input. 
Instead, the Committee has regard to its overall 
assessment of appropriate levels of salary, within 
the benchmark range taking into account the 
market, economic conditions, affordability, the 
level of increases awarded to employees generally 
and the individual’s performance, contribution  
and experience. 
Salaries are reviewed, but not necessarily 
adjusted, annually. Out of cycle reviews may  
be conducted in exceptional circumstances if 
determined appropriate by the Committee.  
Base salaries are paid monthly in cash. 
Whilst there is no prescribed or 
formulaic maximum, the annual 
increase will normally not exceed 
the level awarded to the general 
workforce. Higher increases may 
be made where there have been 
significant changes in the 
responsibility and accountability  
in a role, or where there are large 
variances to the market, for 
example in the case of a recently 
appointed executive director 
appointed on a salary below the 
market median. Any significant 
increases will be fully explained. 
Individual performance is an 
important factor considered by the 
Committee when reviewing base 
salary each year.

Benefits    
Benefits are provided  
to assist executive directors  
in the performance of their 
roles and are designed  
to be competitive and  
cost effective. 
The Group may provide pension contributions  
(set out below), a company car or cash alternative, 
allowance for financial planning, medical 
insurance, and life assurance cover. Other benefits 
may be provided from time to time if considered 
reasonable and appropriate by the Committee,  
to include items such as relocation allowances, 
and will be explained in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report. 
The Group pays the cost of providing benefits on  
a monthly basis or as required for one-off events 
such as financial planning advice. 
Store discount may be offered to all directors on the 
same basis as offered to other Group employees. 
Maximum levels of benefit  
provision are: 
 Car allowance £25,000  
per annum 
 Private medical insurance on a 
family basis 
 Life assurance cover of 4x base 
salary (see notes) 
 Financial planning at £2,500  
per annum. 
There are a number of variables and 
unknowns impacting the maximum 
payable in the event of relocation; 
however, the Committee would  
pay no more than is necessary in 
such situations. 
Store discount of up to 20%  
is offered. 
By exception, life assurance cover for 
Kevin O’Byrne is provided at 7x base 
salary. The additional 3x cover is 
funded by him through an equivalent 
0.25% reduction in his pension  
cash allowance. 
None 
 
    
All-employee share plans    
To enable investment in 
shares in Kingfisher on the 
same terms as other UK-
based employees. 
UK-based executive directors may participate in a 
tax approved all-employee scheme (Sharesave) 
under which they make monthly savings over a 
period of three or five years, that may be used to 
buy Kingfisher shares at a discounted price when 
the scheme matures. They may also choose to 
withdraw their savings at the end of the saving 
period or at any time during the savings contract. 
UK-based executive directors may also participate 
in the Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Designed to 
promote employee share ownership, the SIP 
enables participants to make monthly investments 
in Kingfisher shares. 
The maximum monthly limit for  
the Sharesave plan is currently  
£250 per month. 
The maximum monthly amount an 
individual may invest in partnership 
shares is currently £125 per month. 
The SIP also allows the award of free 
and matching shares up to the limits 
set by the Government.  
The Group may increase the amounts 
that can be saved or invested under 
the Sharesave and SIP plans in line 
with any increases authorised by the 
UK Government for approved plans. 
None 
Pension    
To provide retirement 
benefits and support 
retirement planning in a tax 
efficient way through a 
competitive scheme. 
Pension provision for executive directors (with the 
exception of Philippe Tible) is by way of 
contributions to a defined contribution scheme.  
A cash allowance is available to those who choose 
not to participate in the defined contribution 
scheme as a result of having applied for protection 
upon exceeding or getting close to Lifetime 
Allowance limits. For executive directors who 
choose to remain in the scheme, to avoid total 
member and employer contributions exceeding 
the Annual Allowance (£40,000 for the tax year 
2014/15), employer contributions can be paid as  
a taxable cash allowance on a cost neutral basis  
to the Company.  
A French non-contributory defined benefit 
arrangement is in operation for Philippe Tible as 
divisional CEO of Castorama and Brico Dépôt. 
For the defined contribution scheme 
or cash allowance, the maximum 
annual pension contribution is 30% 
of base salary for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 20% of base salary for 
other UK-based executive directors. 
For the defined benefit arrangement 
in which the divisional CEO of 
Castorama and Brico Dépôt, Philippe 
Tible, participates, the pension 
notionally accrues at a value of 1.5% 
of final pensionable pay for each year 
of service, with crystallisation of the 
pension being conditional upon him 
retiring from the company.

Element and purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Assessment of performance 
Annual bonus    
To incentivise executive 
directors to achieve or 
exceed annual financial, 
strategic and personal 
objectives set by the 
Committee at the start of 
each financial year. The 
deferred element of the 
annual bonus is intended 
to support longer-term 
shareholder alignment and 
retention.  
Annual bonuses are paid after the end of the 
financial year to which they relate. 
50% of the annual bonus is paid in cash shortly 
after the financial year end. The remaining 50% of 
the annual bonus is deferred for three years in 
Kingfisher shares. Vesting of these shares is not 
subject to performance conditions and no match 
is applied. Shares delivered on the exercise of an 
award attract additional dividend shares calculated 
on the basis of the re-investment back into shares 
of the dividend that would have been received had 
the shares been beneficially held. 
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the 
bonus outcome if the pure application of a formula 
is not felt to produce an appropriate result in light 
of overall underlying performance. In particular the 
Committee has the discretion to adjust payments 
downwards if profits have fallen. Any adjustment 
made using this discretion will be explained. 
Malus may be applied whereby part or all of an 
unvested deferred bonus award may be reduced 
(including, if appropriate, reduction to zero) in  
the event of financial misstatement, serious 
reputational damage, or material misconduct in 
individual cases. Deferred bonus awards will vest 
in full in the event of a change of control of the 
Company. 
 
The on-target and maximum 
annual bonus payable are 100% 
and 200% of base salary 
respectively. 
The level of payment at threshold 
is set on an annual basis but will 
not exceed 25%. 
The specific measures, targets and 
weighting may vary from year to year in 
order to align with the Group’s strategy, 
but always with a substantial proportion 
based on key financial metrics. For the 
2014/15 financial year, 60% of the 
annual bonus is linked to key financial 
metrics, 20% is related to KPIs for which 
there is a particular focus during the year 
in question; examples would include 
Group sourcing and productivity. 20%  
is for personal performance based on 
achievement of personal objectives and 
contribution to the One Team strategy, 
including behaviours. 
Where executive directors have specific 
management accountability for the 
results of one or more operating 
companies they may, in addition to, or 
as a substitute for Group targets, also 
have targets related to the performance 
of those businesses. 
The actual performance targets set are 
not disclosed at the start of the financial 
year, as they are considered to be 
commercially sensitive. 
Long-term incentive plan    
To incentivise executive 
directors to achieve 
superior returns for 
shareholders and drive 
shareholder alignment  
and retention of executives 
over the performance 
period of the awards. 
Performance conditions are 
aligned with shareholder 
interests and the Group’s 
strategic objectives. 
Awards will be granted annually under the 
Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan, subject to a three-
year vesting period and stretching performance 
conditions. 
Shares delivered on the exercise of an award 
attract additional dividend shares calculated on 
the basis of the re-investment back into shares of 
the dividend that would have been received had 
the shares been beneficially held. 
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the 
LTIP outcome if the pure application of a formula 
is not felt to produce an appropriate result in light 
of overall underlying performance. In particular, 
the Committee has the discretion to adjust 
payments downwards if profits have fallen.  
Any adjustment made using this discretion will  
be explained. 
Malus may be applied whereby part or all of an 
unvested long-term incentive award may be 
reduced (including, if appropriate, reduction to 
zero) in the event of financial misstatement, 
serious reputational damage, or material 
misconduct in individual cases.  
In the event of a change of control of the 
Company, awards will vest subject to assessment 
of performance up to the date of change of control 
and will be reduced on a time prorated basis 
unless the Committee considers that such a 
reduction is inappropriate. 
The maximum annual award is 
200% for executive directors, with 
the flexibility to award up to 250% 
for the Chief Executive Officer. The 
Chief Executive Officer’s award in 
2014/5 will be 200%. 
25% of the award vests for 
threshold performance. 
Awards vest based on performance  
over three years against performance 
measures chosen by the Committee  
to align with business and strategic 
priorities. For the 2014/5 financial year 
the measures for executive directors are:  
 50% EPS 
 50% Kingfisher Economic  
Profit (KEP). 
The Committee may adjust the 
performance measures attaching to 
awards and the weighting of these 
measures if it feels this will create  
greater alignment with business and 
strategic priorities. 
A significant change to the measures 
used would only be adopted following 
consultation with major shareholders.

Profit sharing arrangements   
Participation Scheme 
To enable French employees 
to share in the financial 
success of the French 
businesses. 
Philippe Tible participated in this scheme as  
an employee of a French company on the  
same terms as all French employees. 
The Participation Scheme is a mandatory  
scheme based on a legal requirement for a 
proportion of the Castorama and Brico Dépôt 
France profits to be distributed to employees.  
It is paid in cash shortly after the financial year 
end, although the scheme provides the option  
to defer the payment for a period of five years  
to receive certain taxation exemptions. 
Under the Participation Scheme 
the maximum opportunity is set by 
the French government. There are 
two limits set which are based on  
a set multiple of the Annual Social 
Security ceiling (PASS). This is 
updated each year but for 2014 
stood at €37,548. 
These limits are: 
 The maximum salary that the 
award level as a % of salary is 
applied is 4 PASS (€150,192) 
 The maximum possible 
payment is 0.75 PASS 
(€28,161). 
The award level is determined as a 
proportion of profits as set with 
reference to the minimum required 
by the French government and  
a more favourable formula that  
has been agreed with the French 
Works Council. 
Over the last five years the award level 
of a % of salary (up to the salary cap) 
has remained within the 5% – 7% 
range. On Philippe Tible’s actual 
salary the award levels were less  
than 2% of salary. 
Interessement Scheme 
To enable French employees 
to share in the financial 
success of growth in the 
French businesses. 
Philippe Tible participated in this scheme as an 
employee of a French company on the same 
terms as all French employees. 
This scheme creates a profit pool which is divided 
by the cost of wages and salaries to determine an 
award level as a % of salary. 
Payment are made in cash on a quarterly basis 
although the scheme provides the option to defer 
the payment for a period of five years to receive 
certain taxation exceptions. 
Since the design is in the form of a 
profit pool, there is no set cap as 
such. However the award level for 
Philippe Tible had not exceeded 
20% of salary historically. 
The profit pool is based on a formula 
which is linked to a proportion of the 
sales and profit growth. 
Shareholding requirements    
To ensure alignment of 
interests of executive 
directors and shareholders 
over the long term. 
Executive directors are required to build a 
significant shareholding in the Company before 
the fifth anniversary of the date of their first award 
under a qualifying share plan. Consideration will 
be given to extending the five-year time frame in 
the event that share awards vesting from deferred 
bonus shares or the LTIP alone do not provide 
enough shares to meet the shareholding 
requirement. Unvested deferred bonus awards are 
not included in the assessment of the holding 
requirement until the transfer of beneficial 
ownership to the executive director at the end of 
the three-year deferral period. Nil-cost options 
which have vested but the executive has yet to 
exercise are considered to count towards the 
shareholding after taking into account an 
adjustment for tax. 
Chief Executive Officer: 
shareholding of 300% of  
base salary. 
Other executive directors: 
shareholding of 200% 
of base salary.

Legacy Awards    
Performance Share  
Plan (‘PSP’) 
A one-off exceptional award of 500% of base 
salary was granted under the PSP in 2011. This 
award was granted to create focus on a single 
three-year period of the Creating the Leader 
strategy. The awards were to vest in two equal 
tranches in June 2014 and June 2015. 
On exercise, additional dividend shares are added 
to the award, with a value equivalent to the value 
of dividends reinvested into shares from the date 
of grant to the date of transfer. 
Malus may be applied to unvested awards if the 
Committee determines that the grant of awards 
was not justified.  
Certain awards granted prior to 2011 have  
vested but have not been exercised and  
therefore remain outstanding. 
500% of base salary for all 
executive directors. 
Awards are subject to stretching 
performance targets, 50% based on 
EPS and 50% on KEP. 
Following completion of the financial 
year, the vesting percentage has 
been determined by the Committee 
at 31% of the maximum award level, 
subject to continued employment.

Company Share Option  
Plan (‘CSOP’) 
An HMRC-approved share option plan was used to grant 
awards with a value up to a limit of £30,000. The option 
price was determined at the time of grant by reference to 
the market price immediately before the date of grant. 
The options are linked to an underpinning KISS Award 
and the two awards must be exercised simultaneously. On 
exercise, the proceeds of the underpinning KISS Award 
are used to fund the exercise price of the CSOP Award.

directors of the calibre 
required by the Group. 
The fees paid to the Chairman are determined by  
the Committee, while the fees of the non-executive 
directors are determined by the Board with affected 
persons absenting themselves from the discussions  
as appropriate. 
The Committee reviews the Chairman’s fees annually.  
The Chairman’s fees are determined with reference to 
time commitment and relevant benchmark market data. 
Contributions may be made towards the cost of running 
the Chairman’s office. 
The Board determines non-executive directors’ fees  
under a policy which seeks to recognise the time 
commitment, responsibility and technical skills required  
to make a valuable contribution to an effective Board. 
A base fee is paid to all non-executive directors  
and additional fees are also paid to the Senior 
Independent Director and the Chairmen of the  
Audit and Remuneration Committees.  
The Board annually reviews fees paid to non-executive 
directors against those in similar companies and taking 
into account the time commitment expected of them. 
Fees are paid monthly. 
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not 
participate in any of the Company’s performance-related

Approach to recruitment 
remuneration  
When hiring a new executive director, or making internal 
promotions to the Board, the Committee will in principle 
apply the same policy as for existing executive directors, 
as detailed in the Remuneration Policy. The rationale for 
the package offered will be explained in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report.  
Base salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit 
the best candidate based on their skills, experience and 
current remuneration. 
Benefits would be in line with normal policy and may 
include, where appropriate, relocation benefits or other 
benefits reflective of normal market practice in the territory 
in which the executive director is employed. 
Normal incentive awards would be made under the 
annual bonus plan and long-term incentive plan in line 
with the Remuneration Policy. 
For internal promotions any commitments made prior to 
appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive 
is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.  
The Committee would be mindful of best practice 
guidelines in considering whether any enhanced LTIP or 
other award was necessary on recruitment in order to 
secure the preferred candidate (e.g. to buy out awards 
forgone from the incoming executive’s previous employer). 
The Committee’s policy is to seek to avoid buying out 
awards foregone. Normally the Committee would seek 
only to make performance-related awards under the long-
term incentive plan, for example by prorating them into 
recently awarded plan cycles to ensure alignment with 
existing executive directors. However, each case will need 
to be considered on its own facts at the particular time 
where such awards are made. If a buy-out award would 
be required, the Committee would aim to reflect the 
nature, timing and value of an award foregone in any 
replacement award which may be in the form of a 
restricted stock or performance-related award as 
appropriate. The Committee would aim to minimise  
the cost to the Company. 
Normal Awards 
The normal maximum incentive 
opportunity on recruitment will  
be in line with the Remuneration 
Policy for executive directors. 
Additional LTIP Award 
Under the plan rules, the 
Committee may, on the 
recruitment of an executive 
director, make an additional one-
off performance-linked award 
under the long-term incentive plan 
of up to an equal face value to the 
normal policy award (i.e. up to 
250% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and 200% of 
base salary for the other executive 
directors). This provision is 
normally used to pro rate incoming 
executives into recently awarded 
long-term incentive plan cycles. 
Buy-out Award 
The Committee normally seeks to 
avoid explicitly buying out awards 
foregone at a previous employer, 
preferring instead to make long-
term incentive plan awards as  
set out above. 
Where, in exceptional 
circumstances, buy-out awards  
are made, they are not subject  
to a formal maximum, although 
would be designed to reflect only 
the value foregone or less. In 
establishing the appropriate value 
of any buy-out the Committee 
would also take into account  
the value of any additional long-
term incentive plan award made 
on joining. 
None 
The Committee will operate the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan and the Group’s legacy plans (the Performance Share Plan, 
Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme and Company Share Option Plan) (together the ‘Plans’) in accordance with the rules of those 
Plans and where relevant with the UKLA Listing Rules. 
In addition to the discretions set out as part of this Remuneration Policy, the rules provide the Committee with discretion on  
certain matters regarding the administration and operation of these Plans, including, but not limited to the following: 
 the impact of a change of control or restructuring; 
 any adjustments to performance conditions or awards required as a result of a corporate event (such as a transaction,  
corporate restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue); 
 the operation of malus provisions; and 
 minor administrative matters to improve the efficiency of operation of the plans or to comply with local tax law or regulation. 
The Committee retains certain discretions in relation to the Annual Bonus Plan, which include but are not limited to: 
 the determination of and timing of any bonus payment; 
 the impact of a change of control or restructuring; and 
 any adjustments required as a result of a corporate event (such as a transaction, corporate restructuring event, special  
dividend or rights issue). 
In relation to the Plans and the Annual Bonus Plan, the Committee retains the ability to amend the performance conditions and/or 
measures in respect of any award or payment if one or more event(s) have occurred which would lead the Committee to consider  
that it would be appropriate to do so, provided that such an amendment would not be materially less difficult to meet. 
If the Committee used any of the discretions set out above these would, where relevant, be disclosed in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report and the views of major shareholders may also be sought. 
Discretion in relation to the Group’s All-Employee Share Plans (Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan) would be exercised within  
the parameters of the HMRC and the UKLA Listing Rules.

Notes to the remuneration policy table 
Annual bonus 
The performance conditions are set annually based on the metrics the Committee feels are most appropriate for the business.  
Like-for-like sales performance is a key metric, and profit before tax ensures that this sales growth is delivered in a way that creates 
value for shareholders. Other strategic KPIs are chosen to support particular objectives for the year, and the individual component 
enables outstanding contribution to be incentivised and rewarded. 
Annual bonus targets are set with reference to internal budgets and analyst consensus forecasts, with maximum pay-out requiring 
performance well ahead of budget. 
Long-term incentive plan 
The Committee believes that long-term incentive plan measures should be aligned to shareholder value while providing line of sight  
to management, so that they are meaningful and incentivising. EPS growth is a key measure of our success in growing value for 
shareholders over time, while KEP balances profit growth with efficient management of our balance sheet. 
The setting of LTIP targets takes into account analyst consensus forecasts, internal projections, and the levels of performance 
required over the long term to deliver absolute value appreciation for shareholders. 
Differences in remuneration policy for all employees 
All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits and may also receive bonus, pension, profit share and share awards which  
vary according to local jurisdiction and market practice. The maximum provision and incentive opportunity available is determined  
by the seniority and responsibility of the role.

Expenses 
Reimbursement of reasonably incurred costs in accordance with their duties. 
Non-compete 
During employment and for 12 months after leaving. In respect of Philippe Tible, an amount equal to 50% of annual salary  
and car benefit must be paid to him on a monthly basis if his employment is terminated by the Company. This amount is 
standard under French law in order to ensure that the non-compete provision is enforceable. 
Contractual  
termination payment 
Executive directors 
 
In the case of resignation, no payments on departure will be made on termination, even if by mutual agreement the notice period 
is cut short. If notice is served by the Company in full, no other payments should be due on departure. For any period of notice 
period not served, the payment takes the form of liquidated damages, which pays the departing executive 8.3% of salary per 
month for the remainder of their notice period. These monthly payments are subject to mitigation. The maximum payment  
post departure would be 1 x base salary. 
If notice is served by either party, the executive director may continue to receive base salary and benefits for the duration of  
their notice period, during which time the executive director may continue their duties or be assigned a period of garden leave. 
The Group’s policy is that payments for termination will not exceed 12 months’ base salary.  
The terms of the phased payment clauses in the service contracts of Sir Ian Cheshire and Kevin O’Byrne were consistent with  
the governance guidelines at the time the contracts were put in place. In circumstances where the Company were to terminate 
their agreements, they would have received phased payments of 15% and 12% of base salary respectively for a maximum of  
12 months from the date of termination subject to mitigation. 
The termination clause in Philippe Tible’s contract would have been determined by the collective convention which applies to all 
French employees. A termination payment would have been made up of two parts: (i) the dismissal indemnity which would have 
been 3% of annual remuneration per year of service and (ii) a payment for any unpaid notice which would have been a maximum 
of three months’ remuneration. The combined cost based on years of service to date would have been approximately 1 x base 
salary. Remuneration in this context consists of base salary, car benefit and cash bonus award. 
In the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement 
of legal claims. This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection 
legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions. The Committee may also include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of 
professional fees in connection with such agreements.

Non-executive directors are appointed under letters of engagement. Appointments have historically been for an initial period of

the need to progressively refresh the Board. 
The appointment may be terminated by either party giving the other not less than three months’ prior written notice, unless 
terminated earlier in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, and the Company has no obligation to pay 
compensation when the appointment is terminated.

Leaver provisions for  
annual bonus 
If notice is served by either party, the executive director may receive bonus payments in cash on a prorated basis from the  
start of the financial year up to the date of termination of employment, based on the determination of the results at the  
year end against targets set. 
In the event that an executive director ceases to be employed during or shortly after the financial year and before the date of  
the annual bonus award, the Committee has the discretion to make a bonus payment and determine the basis upon which it is 
made and its value taking into account the individual circumstances of the departure. If the executive ceases employment as a 
result of a reason defined as a good leaver (which includes ill-heath or retirement), then the normal approach would be to award a 
time prorated bonus in cash based on the actual results against the performance measures set once they have been determined 
following the end of the financial year. In the case of resignation, no bonus award will be made. Leaver provisions for  
share incentives 
The rules of the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan and the Group’s legacy plans (the Performance Share Plan, Kingfisher Incentive 
Share Scheme and Company Share Option Plan) (together the ‘Plans’) set out the treatment that will be applied to awards and 
options if a participant leaves the Group before the end of the vesting period. A summary of the treatment is set out below: 
Long-Term Incentive Awards (granted under the Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan (‘KISP’) from 2014 onwards and the  
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)) 
Awards will normally lapse upon cessation of employment (with the exception of unvested awards granted under the KISP,  
which lapse on the date of notice of termination of employment), except in certain circumstances as described below. In 
determining the extent to which awards should vest when an executive departs, the Committee will consider all the facts of the 
executive’s departure, including their performance and the extent to which the departure is at the instigation of the Company. 
If an executive director ceases to be employed as a result of a reason defined as a “good leaver” within the rules of the KISP or the 
PSP, which includes ill-health, retirement or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee, then the awards will vest on the 
normal vesting date, but will be adjusted on a time prorated basis (unless the Committee decides, acting fairly and reasonably, 
that such an adjustment would be inappropriate). The Committee retains the discretion to reduce further awards granted under 
the KISP to reflect any personal performance issues. If the award is structured as a nil-cost option, it will normally be exercisable 
for a period of six months from the normal vesting date (unless the Committee determines that it may vest on the date of 
cessation). In circumstances where the participant ceases to be employed as a result of death, then the award will vest on  
the date the Company is notified and, if the award is structured as a nil-cost option, then it will be exercisable for a period of  
12 months from the date of notification. The Committee will determine the vesting of the award based upon the performance 
conditions attached to the awards and a reduction in the number of shares on a time prorated basis (unless the Committee 
decides, acting fairly and reasonably, that such an adjustment would be inappropriate). 
In the event of a takeover or other corporate event (such as the winding-up of the Company), awards will vest on the date  
of notification, but will be adjusted on a time pro-rated basis (unless the Committee decides, in its absolute discretion, that  
such an adjustment would be inappropriate) and in the case of an award structured as a nil-cost option, will be exercisable  
for a period of one month from the date of notification. 
Deferred Bonus Awards (granted under the KISP from 2015 onwards and the KISS up to 2014) 
Awards granted under the KISS lapse if the executive director resigns or is dismissed for cause. In all other circumstances,  
the award will vest in full on the date of cessation of employment and will remain exercisable for a period of six months  
(12 months in the case of death). 
Deferred Bonus Awards which will be granted under the KISP from 2015 onwards will lapse if the executive director resigns or  
is dismissed for cause. If an executive director ceases to be employed as a result of a reason defined as a “good leaver” which 
includes ill-health, retirement or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee, then the awards will vest on the normal 
vesting date. If the award is structured as a nil-cost option, it will be exercisable for a period of six months from the normal  
vesting date. In circumstances where the participant ceases to be employed as a result of death, then the award will vest  
in full on the date the Company is notified and, if the award is structured as a nil-cost option, then it will be exercisable for  
a period of 12 months from the date of notification. 
In the event of a takeover or other corporate event (such as the winding-up of the Company), awards will vest on the date of 
notification and in the case of an award structured as a nil-cost option, will be exercisable for a period of one month from the  
date of notification. 
Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’) 
The CSOP is an HMRC-approved share option plan. Options granted under the CSOP are linked to an underpinning deferred 
bonus award granted under the KISS and the two must be exercised simultaneously. Options granted under the CSOP will 
normally lapse upon cessation of employment. If an executive director ceases to be employed as a result of a reason defined  
as a “good leaver” within the rules of the CSOP, which include injury, disability or the sale or transfer of the business or company 
that employs them, then the option will vest on the cessation of employment and will be exercisable for a period of six months.  
If the executive director leaves due to retirement, the award will vest on the normal vesting date or if the cessation of employment 
is within six months of the normal vesting date it will vest on the date of cessation.

Strategic Report 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to present a  
fair review of the operations of the business during the year to  
31 January 2015 and the position of the Company at year end 
along with the principal risks and uncertainties faced. The 
Strategic Report of the Company, which includes the Group’s 
Key Performance Indicators, a statement on Corporate 
Responsibility, a Financial Review including financial and  
capital risks, is detailed on pages 2 to 29 and is incorporated  
by reference and deemed to form part of this report. 
Dividends 
The directors recommend a final dividend of 6.85p (2013/14: 
6.78p) per ordinary share amounting to £160m (2013/14: 
£159m) to be paid on 15 June 2015 to members appearing on 
the Register at the close of business on 15 May 2015. Together 
with the special dividend of 4.2p per ordinary share, amounting 
to £100m, paid on 25 July 2014 and the interim dividend of 
3.15p (2013/14: 3.12p) per ordinary share, amounting to £75m 
(2013/14: £74m), paid on 14 November 2014, the total dividend 
for the financial year ended 31 January 2015 will be 14.2p 
(2013/14: 9.9p) per ordinary share, amounting to £335m 
(2013/14: £233m). 
The Kingfisher Employee Benefit Trust has waived all dividends 
payable by the Company in respect of the ordinary shares held 
by it. The total dividends waived in the year to 31 January 2015 
were in aggregate £1.02m. 
Directors 
Full biographical details of current directors are set out on  
pages 30 to 31. In accordance with the principles of the Code, 
shareholders will be asked, too approve the appointment of 
Véronique Laury as a director and to re-appoint the other 
directors at the AGM in 2015. 
Directors’ indemnity arrangements 
The Company has provided qualifying third-party deeds of 
indemnity for the benefit of each director and former director 
who held office during the 2014/15 financial year. The Company 
has also purchased and maintained Directors’ and Officers’ 
liability insurance throughout 2014/15. Neither the indemnities 
nor the insurance provides cover in the event that the director 
concerned is proved to have acted fraudulently.

in the Company’s shares and share options are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 66. No  
director had a material interest at any time during the year  
in any derivative or financial instrument relating to the  
Company’s shares. 
Principal risk identification and management 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group have  
been reviewed by the Board and are shown in the Risks section 
on pages 26 to 29. The Risks section also provides information 
on the performance of the Board in actively managing those 
risks, to allow assessment of how the directors have performed 
their statutory duty to promote the success of the Company. 
People 
The commitment of the Group’s employees is vital to ensure  
that high standards of customer care and service are maintained 
throughout the business. The Group is fully committed to treating 
their employees and customers with dignity and respect, and to 
valuing diversity. It is Group policy to: 
• ensure there is no discrimination in employment on the
grounds of race, gender, age, disability, marital status,
sexual orientation or religious belief;
• implement measures in stores to ensure a level of customer
service for disabled people equivalent to that offered to non-
disabled people; and
• maintain a mechanism which customers and employees can
use to give feedback on the Group’s performance and ensure
that all customer comments are analysed, responded to and
acted upon.
A breakdown of employee gender diversity, as required by the 
Companies Act 2006, can be found on page 25 and forms part 
of the Directors’ Report disclosures. During the year B&Q UK 
continued its long-established policy of promoting age diversity, 
with around a quarter of its employees aged over 50. 
The Group employs over 79,000 people across our markets and 
invests in our people drawing on their energy, skills and ideas to 
achieve the Group’s goals. The aim is to create great workplaces 
and strive to be an employer of choice in our sector. The Group’s 
commitment to Net Positive supports employee loyalty, 
productivity and engagement and we create opportunities for  
our people to get involved. This starts from the top, and during 
2014/15 200 of the Group’s most senior leaders demonstrated 
their commitment by spending a day volunteering, helping to 
improve an orphanage in Bucharest. 
Development 
The Group’s statement on employee development is set out in 
the People section of the Company’s website, and details of 
employee involvement through participation in share incentive 
schemes are contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 46 to 66. 
We invest in training and development for employees at all levels 
from our apprenticeship and work experience schemes to our 
graduate programmes and management and leadership training. 
Castorama France operates a ‘Go Alternative’ programme which 
recruits and develops young people for a variety of career paths 
at its stores and offices. Run through partnerships with schools 
and other organisations it supports young recruits to develop  
the skills they need to take on managerial roles. Nearly 500 
apprentices participated during 2014/15. 
There are also a number of communication channels in place  
to help employees to develop their knowledge of, and enhance 
their involvement with, the Group. These channels include 
engagement surveys, briefing groups, internal magazines and 
newsletters that report on business performance and objectives, 
community involvement and other applicable issues. Directors 
and senior management regularly visit stores and discuss 
matters of current interest and concern with employees.

Political donations 
The Board annually seeks and obtains shareholders’ approval  
to enable the Group to make donations or incur expenditure  
in relation to EU political parties, other political organisations  
or independent election candidates under section 366 of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
The Group made no political donations during the year  
(2013/14 £nil). As with previous annual approvals, the Group 
had no intention of changing its current policy and practice of  
not making political donations. The Board seeks the approval  
on a precautionary basis to avoid any unintentional breach of 
relevant provisions. Shareholder approval will be sought at this 
year’s AGM to renew this authority; further details are provided  
in the Notice of AGM. 
Significant agreements – change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change control of the Company following a 
takeover bid, such as bank loan agreements, Medium Term 
Note (‘MTN’) documentation, private placement debt and 
employee share plans. None of these are deemed to be 
significant in terms of their potential impact on the business  
of the Group as a whole except for: 
• the £200 million credit facility dated 8 July 2011 between  
the Company, HSBC Bank plc (as the facility agent) and the 
banks named therein as lenders, which contains a provision 
such that in any event of a change of control any lender may, 
if they so require, notify the agent that they wish to cancel 
their commitment whereupon the commitment of that lender 
will be cancelled and all their outstanding loans, together with 
accrued interest, will become immediately due and payable; 
and  
• the US$297 million US Private Placement notes, issued 
pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated 24 May 2006 
by the Company to various institutions, which contains a 
provision such that in the event of a change of control, the 
Company is required to make an offer to the holders of the 
US Private Placement notes to prepay the principal amount  
of the notes together with interest accrued. 
The Company does not have agreements with any director or 
officer that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of 
the Company’s share incentive schemes may cause options and 
awards granted under such schemes to vest on a takeover.

Share capital 
Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out in  
Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. All of the 
Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up and rank 
equally in all respects. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares, in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which 
can be obtained from the Company’s website. The holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s Annual 
Reports and Accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings 
of the Company, to appoint proxies and to exercise voting rights. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or on 
the exercise of voting rights attached to them, except (i) where 
the Company has exercised its right to suspend their voting rights 
or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of their holder 
of any person interested in them to provide the Company with 
information requested by it in accordance with Part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006 or (ii) where their holder is precluded  
from exercising voting rights by the Financial Services Authority 
Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 
The Company has a Sponsored Level 1 American Depository 
Receipt (“ADR”) programme in the United States. 
Authority to allot shares 
At the AGM in 2014 shareholders approved a resolution to give 
the directors authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £124,494,647. In addition, shareholders approved a 
resolution to give the directors authority to allot up to a nominal 
amount of £248,989,295 in connection with an offer by way of  
a rights issue in accordance with ABI guidance. If this additional 
allotment authority were used, the ABI guidance would be 
followed. The directors have no present intention to issue 
ordinary shares, other than pursuant to employee share incentive 
schemes. These resolutions remain valid until the conclusion  
of this year’s AGM. As at 30 March 2015, the directors have  
not used this authority. In order to retain maximum flexibility,  
a resolution will be proposed at this year’s AGM to renew this 
authority. It is the Company’s current intention that shares 
acquired under this authority will be cancelled. 
Authority to purchase own shares 
At the AGM in 2014, shareholders approved a resolution for the 
Company to make purchases of its own shares to a maximum 
number of 237,261,243 ordinary shares, being approximately 
10% of the issued share capital. This resolution remains valid 
until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. As at 30 March 2015, the 
directors had used this authority to purchase 38,102,117 under 
several buyback programmes. All the shares purchased under 
this authority to date have been cancelled. In order to retain 
maximum flexibility, a resolution will be proposed at this year’s 
AGM to renew this authority. It is the Company’s current intention 
to continue with its buyback programme throughout 2015 and  
all shares acquired under this authority will be cancelled.

Going concern 
The directors confirm that, after reviewing expenditure 
commitments, expected cash flows and borrowing facilities,  
they have a reasonable expectations that Kingfisher plc (the 
“Company) and the Kingfisher group of companies (the “Group”) 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the next financial year and the foreseeable future. For this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these 
financial statements. Further details of the Group’s liquidity are 
provided in the Financial Review on page 18. 
Disclosure of information to auditors 
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that: so far as he or she is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as defined by section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that he or  
she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
Responsibility for preparing financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
• UK Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the Group Financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (”IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected  
to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under s. 393 of the Companies Act 
2006, the directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the  
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of  
the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company financial statements,  
the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• follow applicable UK Accounting Standards (except where 
any departures from this requirement are explained in the 
notes to the parent Company financial statements); and  
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements in accordance  
with IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements”, the directors 
are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial performance; 
and  
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation, regulation and practice in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements may differ from legislation, regulation  
and practice in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement 
The directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties they face; and  
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a  
whole are fair, balanced and understandable and provide  
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Directors’ Statement of Responsibility 80 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Opinion on financial statements of Kingfisher plc 
In our opinion: 
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 January 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the 52 weeks 
then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
 the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the 
consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets, the 
consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 38 
for the Group and 1 to 17 for the Parent Company financial 
statements. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements 
is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Going concern 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ 
statement on page 79 that the Group is a going concern. We 
confirm that: 
 we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and 
 we have not identified any material uncertainties that may  
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are 
those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team and are consistent with the risks identified in 
the previous year: 
 
Subject  Nature of risk  How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Inventories  As at 31 January 2015 the value of inventory held by 
the Group was £2,021 million as disclosed in note 17 
to the financial statements.  
Assessing net realisable value of inventory is an area 
of significant judgement. In particular with regards  
to the estimation of provisions for slow-moving and 
obsolete inventory.  
The Group’s Principal accounting policy on inventory 
is on page 93 and the critical accounting estimates 
and judgements on inventory are on page 96.  
 We focused on the valuation of  year end inventory, 
including challenging judgements taken regarding 
obsolescence and net realisable value provisions. 
Inventory provisioning has been assessed using 
historic stock performance and compared to the 
Group provision recognised. Our procedures included 
assessing the adequacy of, and movements in, 
inventory provisions held by recalculating a sample  
of items included within the provision to determine 
whether there was an appropriate basis of valuation. 
Supplier rebates  The Group receives significant amounts of supplier 
incentives, discounts and rebates, and recognises 
these as a deduction in cost of sales. 
These largely comprise of volume-based rebates 
based on percentage levels agreed for the calendar 
year, but also include arrangements with a greater 
degree of judgement such as advertising and 
marketing support.  
Assessing the timing of recognition of the reduction  
in cost of sales earned from suppliers, including 
adherence to contractual terms, is an area of 
complexity requiring both a detailed understanding  
of the contractual arrangements themselves as well  
as complete and accurate source data to apply the 
arrangements to. 
The Group’s Principal accounting policy on rebates  
is on page 92 and the critical accounting estimates 
and judgements on rebates are on page 96. 
 We obtained and reviewed a sample of contracts with 
suppliers to assess the conditions required for rebate 
income to be recognised and verified whether or not 
these had been met. 
We tested the accuracy of the amounts recognised by 
agreeing a sample to individual supplier agreements. 
For volume-based agreements, we recalculated the 
rebates due based on shipments in the year and 
contractual terms. For other rebates, we also focussed 
on the timing of recognition of the rebate income 
based on the contractual performance obligations.  
We circularised a sample of suppliers to further 
corroborate whether the arrangements recorded  
were accurate and complete and, where outstanding 
balances were significant at the year end, to confirm 
the amounts owed. Our audit also assessed the 
recoverability of such amounts owed.

Subject  Nature of risk  How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Property  As at 31 January 2015 the value of property,  
plant and equipment held by the Group was  
£3,203 million as disclosed in note 14 to the  
financial statements.  
As a result of the diverse property portfolio across  
the Group, there are several technically complex or 
judgemental aspects of property accounting and 
accounting for leases across the Group, including: 
 classification of leases under IAS 17: “Leases”; 
 other property related provisions, including onerous 
leases;  
 the assessment of carrying values of freehold stores 
and store assets for potential impairment; and 
 accounting for store closure costs. 
The key assumptions applied by management in the 
impairment reviews are: 
 country-specific discount rates; 
 store costs, including rent, staff payroll costs and 
general operating costs; and 
 forecast sales growth and margins. 
The Group’s Principal accounting policy on property, 
plant and equipment is on page 93 and the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements on impairment 
are on page 96. 
 For leasehold property, we focused our work on the 
identification of complex or unusual lease contracts  
to assess whether they were appropriately accounted 
for under IAS 17: “Leases”. We also performed 
procedures to identify leases which could be 
considered onerous - for example, we reviewed the 
properties currently under lease, and identified those 
which may be vacant or underutilised, or where 
properties are sublet whether the estimated rental 
income leads to an onerous contract. 
For freehold properties and store assets with 
indicators of impairment, we challenged the 
impairment models and calculations by: 
 checking the mechanical accuracy of the 
impairment models; 
 assessing the discount rates applied to the 
impairment reviews for each country and comparing 
the rates to our internal benchmark data; 
 comparing forecast growth rates to economic data;  
 considering the historical budgeting accuracy at a 
store level; and 
 challenging forecast sales growth and margins. 
We challenged the assumptions used by 
management in estimating store closure costs and  
the timing of recognition of associated provisions. 
Goodwill and 
intangible 
assets 
 As at 31 January 2015 the value of goodwill held  
by the Group was £2,414 million as disclosed in note 
12 to the financial statements. 
Determining the appropriate carrying value of  
goodwill and intangible assets requires management 
to make significant estimates including the operating 
cash flow projections, discount rates and long term 
growth rates.  
The goodwill attributable to cash generating units is 
reviewed for impairment using a value in use model, 
as described in note 12 to the financial statements. 
The Group’s Principal accounting policy on Goodwill 
and intangible assets is on page 92 and the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements on impairment 
are on page 96. 
 We reviewed the assumptions used in the impairment 
model for goodwill and intangible assets, including 
comparison of the input assumptions to externally and 
internally derived data, and challenged the key inputs 
used. We made use of our internal specialists when 
assessing these inputs. 
We considered the sensitivity of the model to  
changes in key assumptions by performing  
our own independent calculations. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of impairment testing and 
whether disclosures about the sensitivity of the 
outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in 
key assumptions properly reflected the risks inherent 
in the assumptions. 
Taxation  Due to the estimation uncertainty in respect of 
settlements with tax authorities around the world, 
assessing the Group’s exposure to significant tax  
risks and the level of provisions recognised is a 
judgemental area. 
The Group’s Principal accounting policy on Taxation 
is on page 94 and the critical accounting estimates 
and judgements on Taxation are on page 96. 
 We engage tax specialists who have considered all 
significant taxation exposures across the Group, 
including challenging the estimates and judgements 
made by management when calculating the income 
tax payable in each territory and the associated 
provisions held.  
In assessing the provisions we have considered the 
tax environment in the significant territories in which 
the Group operates, the outcome of past settlements 
and the status of tax audits. 
The tax specialists reviewed correspondence with 
taxation authorities in significant locations, as well  
as reviewing the opinions or other support received 
from external counsel and other advisers where 
management has relied on them to make 
assumptions on the level of taxation payable. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee  
discussed on page 42.   82 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect 
to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters. 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.  
We determined materiality for the Group to be £34 million 
(2013/14: £35 million), which is 5% (2013/14: 5%) of profit 
before taxation, before exceptional items, and below 1% 
(2013/14: below 1%) of equity. We use profit before taxation, 
before exceptional items, to exclude the effect of volatility from 
our determination.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them all audit differences in excess of £0.7 million (2013/14: 
£0.7 million), as well as differences below that threshold that,  
in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We  
also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that  
we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
As in the prior year, our Group audit scope focused primarily  
on all significant trading entities and the Group head office,  
and included B&Q UK, Castorama France, Brico Dépôt France, 
Castorama Poland, Castorama Russia, B&Q China, Screwfix UK, 
Brico Dépôt Spain, Bricostore Romania and the Koçta joint 
venture. These locations represent the principal business units 
and account for 99% (2013/14: 99%) of the Group’s revenue, 
98% (2013/14: 98%) of the Group’s profit before tax after taking 
into account the allocation of central sourcing costs,  
and 98% (2013/14: 97%) of the Group’s net assets. The 
locations in scope were selected to provide an appropriate  
basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. Our audit work at these locations 
was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual 
entity which were lower than Group materiality. The entities 
which are out of our scope are primarily individually insignificant 
cost entities and other smaller operations. The Group audit team 
continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been 
designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits locations 
considered the most significant each year. For the remaining 
locations where Group audit work is performed but no visit is 
carried out, the Senior Statutory Auditor has discussed and 
challenged the key areas of judgement with the lead audit 
partner of the component in the current year and a senior 
member of the Group engagement team has visited the location. 
We also held regional planning briefings, attended by the 
component auditors from each of the eleven locations discussed 
above, at which we discussed developments in the Group 
relevant to our audit, including risk assessment and audit 
procedures to respond to the risks identified. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006  
In our opinion: 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be  
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006; and 
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting 
records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to  
you if, in our opinion: 
 we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit; or 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report  
if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland),  
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information  
in the annual report is: 
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or 
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in  
the course of performing our audit; or 
 otherwise misleading. 
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Kingﬁsher plc continued 83 www.kingﬁsher.com
Governance
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have 
not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they  
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and  
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with  
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure 
that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team and independent  
partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a  
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and  
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting  
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
1 General information 
Kingfisher plc (‘the Company’), its subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates (together ‘the Group’) supply home improvement 
products and services through a network of retail stores and 
other channels, located mainly in the United Kingdom, 
continental Europe and China. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 2 to 29. 
The Company is incorporated in the United Kingdom and  
is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of its 
registered office is 3 Sheldon Square, Paddington, London  
W2 6PX. A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, 
including the name, country of incorporation and proportion  
of ownership interest is given in note 5 of the Company’s 
separate financial statements. 
These consolidated financial statements have been approved  
for issue by the Board of Directors on 30 March 2015. 
2 Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated. A prior year restatement as a result of 
the disposal of Hornbach is described in section (a) of this note. 
a. Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company, its 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are made up to the 
nearest Saturday to 31 January each year, except as disclosed  
in note 16 and in note 5 of the Company’s separate financial 
statements. The current financial year is the 52 weeks ended  
31 January 2015 (‘the year’ or ‘2014/15’). The comparative 
financial year is the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2014 (‘the prior 
year’ or ‘2013/14’). The consolidated income statement and 
related notes represent results for continuing operations, there 
being no discontinued operations in the years presented. 
The following non-GAAP measures have been restated in the 
comparatives to exclude the contribution of Hornbach, in order 
to improve comparability following its disposal in the current year:

There was no contribution from Hornbach to the current year 
adjusted (non-GAAP) results. Statutory (GAAP) measures have 
not been restated. 
The directors of Kingfisher plc, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the Group 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future 
and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the 
year ended 31 January 2015. Refer to the Directors’ statement  
of responsibility on page 79. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’) and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS legislation. 
The following new standards, which are mandatory for the first 
time for the financial year ended 31 January 2015, are relevant 
for the Group: 
• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’, builds on 
existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the 
determining factor in whether an entity should be included 
within the consolidated financial statements of the parent 
company. The standard provides additional guidance to assist 
in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. 
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’, focuses on the rights and 
obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than its 
legal form. There are two types of joint arrangements: joint 
operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where  
the investors have rights to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities of an arrangement. A joint operator accounts for its 
share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint 
ventures arise where the investors have rights to the net 
assets of the arrangement and are accounted for under  
the equity method. 
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes 
the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other 
entities, including joint arrangements, associates, structured 
entities and other off balance sheet vehicles. 
The adoption of the above new standards has not had a material 
impact on the Group. Other standards, amendments and 
interpretations which are mandatory for the first time for the 
financial year ended 31 January 2015 are either not currently 
relevant or not material for the Group. 
  90 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements,  
the following new standards and interpretations, which have  
not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue  
but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU): 
• IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’ (effective from the Group’s 2015/16 
financial year); 
• IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’  
(effective from the Group’s 2017/18 financial year); 
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ (effective from the  
Group’s 2018/19 financial year). 
IFRIC 21 sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy 
that is not income tax. The interpretation changes the timing of 
when such liabilities are recognised, particularly in connection 
with levies that are triggered by circumstances on a specific date. 
This will apply from the Group’s 2015/16 financial year, with 
restatement of 2014/15 comparatives. It will not have a material 
impact on the annual results, but will have a significant impact 
on the quarterly phasing of operating profit (and related deferred 
tax) in France, with more costs being recognised in the final 
quarter of the year. It will also result in a restatement of balance 
sheet payables and deferred tax. Refer to www.kingfisher.com  
for further details on the restatement. 
The directors do not expect that the adoption of IFRS 15 and 
IFRS 9 will have a material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 will impact 
both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide  
a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
under the historical cost convention, as modified by the use  
of valuations for certain financial instruments, share-based 
payments and post-employment benefits. A summary of the 
Group’s principal accounting policies is set out below.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  
IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates and 
assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its 
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving critical accounting estimates and 
judgements, which are significant to the consolidated financial 
statements, are disclosed in note 3. 
Use of non-GAAP measures 
In the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain 
measures that are not required under IFRS, the Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (‘GAAP’) under which the  
Group reports. Kingfisher believes that retail profit, adjusted  
pre-tax profit, effective tax rate, adjusted post-tax profit and 
adjusted earnings per share provide additional useful information 
on underlying trends to shareholders. These and other non-
GAAP measures such as net debt/cash are used by Kingfisher 
for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation 
arrangements for employees. The terms ‘retail profit’, ‘exceptional 
items’, ‘adjusted’, ‘effective tax rate’ and ‘net debt/cash’ are not 
defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable 
with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  
They are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to,  
GAAP measures. 
Like-for-like (‘LFL’) sales growth is defined as the constant 
currency, year-on-year sales growth for stores that have  
been open for more than a year. 
Retail profit is defined as continuing operating profit before 
central costs (principally the costs of the Group’s head office), 
exceptional items, amortisation of acquisition intangibles  
and the Group’s share of interest and tax of joint ventures  
and associates. 2013/14 comparatives have been restated  
to exclude the share of Hornbach operating profit. 
The separate reporting of non-recurring exceptional items,  
which are presented as exceptional within their relevant income 
statement category, helps provide an indication of the Group’s 
underlying business performance. The principal items which  
are included as exceptional items are: 
• non-trading items included in operating profit such as  
profits and losses on the disposal, closure or impairment  
of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and investments 
which do not form part of the Group’s trading activities; 
• profits and losses on the disposal of properties and 
impairment losses on non-operational assets; and 
• the costs of significant restructuring and incremental 
acquisition integration costs. 
The term ‘adjusted’ refers to the relevant measure being  
reported for continuing operations excluding exceptional items, 
financing fair value remeasurements, amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, related tax items and prior year tax items (including 
the impact of changes in tax rates on deferred tax). 2013/14 
comparatives have been restated to exclude the share of 
Hornbach results. Financing fair value remeasurements 
represent changes in the fair value of financing derivatives, 
excluding interest accruals, offset by fair value adjustments  
to the carrying amount of borrowings and other hedged items 
under fair value hedge relationships. Financing derivatives are 
those that relate to underlying items of a financing nature.  91 www.kingﬁsher.com
Accounts
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
The effective tax rate represents the effective income tax  
expense as a percentage of continuing profit before taxation 
excluding exceptional items. Effective income tax expense is  
the continuing income tax expense excluding tax on exceptional 
items and tax adjustments in respect of prior years and the 
impact of changes in tax rates on deferred tax. 
Net debt/cash comprises borrowings and financing derivatives 
(excluding accrued interest), less cash and cash equivalents 
and short-term deposits. It excludes balances classified as  
assets and liabilities held for sale. 
b. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures  
and associates. 
(i) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over 
which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from  
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries acquired are recorded under the acquisition method 
of accounting and their results included from the date of 
acquisition. The results of subsidiaries which have been 
disposed are included up to the effective date of disposal. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary  
is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred  
and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting 
from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related 
costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired  
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis,  
the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the  
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Subsequent  
to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests  
is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests  
having a deficit balance. 
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of  
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition-
date fair value of any previous equity interests in the acquiree 
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of  
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of  
a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly  
in the income statement. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains  
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries have been  
changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the  
policies adopted by the Group. 
(ii) Joint ventures and associates 
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control. 
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of  
an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the 
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties 
sharing control. The equity method is used to account  
for the Group’s investments in joint ventures. 
Associates are entities over which the Group has the ability  
to exercise significant influence but not control, generally 
accompanied by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% 
of the voting rights. The equity method is used to account  
for the Group’s investments in associates. 
Under the equity method investments are initially recognised  
at cost.The Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses  
is recognised in the income statement within operating profit, 
and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is 
recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition 
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of
the investment. When the Group’s share of losses equals or  
exceeds its interest, including any long-term receivables, the 
Group does not recognise any further losses, unless it has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint 
venture or associate. 
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its  
joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless  
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures and associates 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with 
the policies adopted by the Group. 
The equity method of accounting is discontinued from the date 
an investment ceases to be a joint venture or associate, that is 
the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control or 
significant influence over the investee or on the date it is 
classified as held for sale. 
c. Foreign currencies
(i) Presentation and functional currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in  
Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Items 
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates  
(i.e. its functional currency). 
(ii) Transactions and balances 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are  
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the date of the transaction or, for practical  
reasons, at average monthly rates where exchange rates  
do not fluctuate significantly.   92 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  
currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange  
at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary 
items are taken to the income statement. Exceptions to this are 
where the monetary items form part of the net investment in a 
foreign operation or are designated and effective net investment 
or cash flow hedges. Such exchange differences are initially 
deferred in equity. 
(iii) Group companies 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are expressed  
in Sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. 
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiaries are expressed in 
Sterling at average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of foreign operations, 
including joint ventures and associates, are recognised in a 
separate component of equity. 
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
retranslation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of 
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. When a foreign 
operation is sold, such exchange differences recorded since  
1 February 2004 are recognised in the income statement as  
part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition  
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the rates of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Goodwill arising prior to 1 February 2004 
is denominated in Sterling.

d. Revenue recognition 
Sales represent the supply of home improvement products and 
services. Sales exclude transactions made between companies 
within the Group, Value Added Tax, other sales-related taxes  
and are net of returns, trade and staff discounts. 
Sales of in-store products are generally recognised at the point  
of cash receipt. Where award credits such as vouchers or loyalty 
points are provided as part of the sales transaction, the amount 
allocated to the credits is deferred and recognised when the 
credits are redeemed and the Group fulfils its obligations to 
supply the awards. 
For delivered products and services, sales are recognised either 
when the product has been delivered or, for installation income, 
when the service has been performed. Sales from delivered 
products and services represent only a small component of  
the Group’s sales as the majority relates to in-store purchases  
of products. 
Other income is generally composed primarily of external  
rental income and profits and losses on disposal of assets.  
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight 
line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs 
incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and  
recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
e. Rebates 
Rebates received from suppliers mainly comprise volume related 
rebates on the purchase of inventories. Contractual volume 
related rebates are accrued as units are purchased based on the 
percentage rebate applicable to forecast total purchases over the 
rebate period, where it is probable the rebates will be received 
and the amounts can be estimated reliably. Discretionary rebates 
are not anticipated and only recognised once earned. Rebates 
relating to inventories purchased but still held at the balance 
sheet date are deducted from the carrying value so that the  
cost of inventories is recorded net of applicable rebates. Such 
rebates are credited to the Cost of sales line in the income 
statement when the goods are sold. 
Other rebates received, such as those related to advertising  
and marketing, are recognised in the income statement  
when the relevant conditions have been fulfilled. 
f. Dividends 
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the 
Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised  
when they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
g. Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising  
from assets acquired in a business combination that are  
not individually identified and separately recognised.  
Such benefits include future synergies expected from the  
combination and intangible assets not meeting the criteria  
for separate recognition. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is not amortised and is tested annually for impairment 
by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash generating 
unit or groups of cash generating units to which the goodwill 
relates. The recoverable amount is assessed by reference  
to the net present value of expected future pre-tax cash flows 
(‘value-in-use’) or fair value less costs to sell if higher. The 
discount rate applied is based upon the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks 
associated with the relevant cash generating unit or groups of 
cash generating units. When the recoverable amount of the  
goodwill is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the income statement which cannot 
subsequently be reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of  
an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold. 
(ii) Computer software 
Where software is not an integral part of a related item of 
computer hardware, it is classified as an intangible asset. 
Costs that are directly associated with the acquisition or 
production of identifiable software products controlled by the 
Group, which are expected to generate economic benefits 
exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible 
assets. Capitalised costs include those of software licences and 
development, including costs of employees, consultants and an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads.   93 www.kingﬁsher.com
Accounts
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Costs associated with identifying, sourcing, evaluating or 
maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense  
as incurred. 
Software under development is held at cost less any  
provisions for impairment, with impairment reviews being 
performed annually. 
Amortisation commences when the software assets are available 
for use and is over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years. 
h. Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Cost  
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the business  
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provisions for impairment.  
Properties that were held at 1 February 2004 are carried at 
deemed cost, being the fair value of land and buildings as  
at the transition date to IFRS. All property acquired after  
1 February 2004 is carried at cost. 
(ii) Depreciation 
Depreciation is provided to reflect a straight line reduction  
from cost to estimated residual value over the estimated useful 
life of the asset as follows: 
Freehold land – not depreciated 
Freehold and long leasehold 
buildings 
– over remaining useful life 
Short leasehold land and buildings – over remaining period  
of the lease 
Fixtures and fittings – between 4 and 20 years
Computers and electronic 
equipment 
– between 3 and 5 years 
Motor cars – 4 years 
Commercial vehicles – between 3 and 10 years
Long leaseholds are defined as those having remaining lease 
terms of more than 50 years. Asset lives and residual values  
are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
(iii) Impairment 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment 
is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference 
to the net present value of expected future pre-tax cash flows 
(‘value-in-use’) of the relevant cash generating unit or fair  
value less costs to sell if higher. The discount rate applied is 
based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital with 
appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant 
cash generating unit. Any impairment in value is charged to the 
income statement in the period in which it occurs.  
(iv) Disposal 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset 
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds  
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
income statement. Sales of land and buildings are accounted  
for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts.  
(v) Subsequent costs 
Subsequent costs are included in the related asset’s carrying 
amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,  
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item  
can be measured reliably.  
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
i. Leased assets 
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements which give 
rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if 
they had been purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the 
lower of the fair value or the present value of the minimum lease 
payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease.  
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term  
or their useful life. Obligations relating to finance leases, net of 
finance charges in respect of future periods, are included, as 
appropriate, under borrowings due within or after one year.  
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to finance  
costs in the income statement over the lease term.  
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments  
are generally charged to the income statement in the period  
to which the payments relate, except for those leases which 
incorporate fixed minimum rental uplift clauses. Leases which 
contain fixed minimum rental uplifts are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Where a lease is taken out for land and buildings combined,  
the buildings element of the lease may be capitalised as a 
finance lease if it meets the criteria for a finance lease, but the 
land element will in most cases be classified as an operating 
lease. If the contracted lease payments are not split between 
land and buildings in the lease contract, the split is made based 
on the market values of the land and buildings at the inception  
of the lease.  
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are 
released to the income statement on a straight line basis over  
the lease term. 
j. Investment property 
Investment property is property held by the Group to earn rental 
income or for capital appreciation. The Group’s investment 
properties are carried at cost less depreciation and provision  
for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a consistent basis 
with that applied to property held for use in the business. 
k. Capitalisation of borrowing costs 
Interest on borrowings to finance the construction of properties 
held as non-current assets is capitalised from the date work 
starts on the property to the date when substantially all the 
activities which are necessary to get the property ready for  
use are complete. Where construction is completed in parts,  
each part is considered separately when capitalising interest.  
Interest is capitalised before any allowance for tax relief. 
l. Inventories 
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value, on a weighted average cost basis. 
Trade discounts and rebates received are deducted in 
determining the cost of purchase of inventories. Cost includes 
appropriate attributable overheads and direct expenditure 
incurred in the normal course of business in bringing goods  
to their present location and condition. Costs of inventories 
include the transfer from equity of any gains or losses on 
qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases.   94 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale. Write downs to net realisable value are made 
for slow moving, damaged or obsolete items and other events  
or conditions resulting in expected selling prices being lower  
than cost. The carrying value of inventories reflects known and 
expected losses of product in the ordinary course of business.  
m. Employee benefits 
(i) Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates various defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension schemes for its employees, some of which 
are required by local legislation. A defined benefit scheme is a 
pension scheme which defines an amount of pension benefit 
which an employee will receive on retirement. A defined 
contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the 
Group usually pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.  
In all cases other than some of the legally required schemes,  
a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing 
liabilities. The assets of each of these funds are either held  
under trusts or managed by insurance companies and are 
entirely separate from the Group’s assets. 
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect  
of defined benefit pension schemes is the fair value of scheme 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation  
at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is 
calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged  
to the statement of comprehensive income as they arise. 
For defined contribution schemes, the Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.  
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense when they are due. 
(ii) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based 
compensation schemes. The fair value of the employee  
services received in exchange for the grant of options or  
deferred shares is recognised as an expense and is calculated 
using Black-Scholes and stochastic models. The total amount  
to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the options or deferred shares 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect 
expected and actual levels of options vesting due to  
non-market vesting conditions.  
n. Taxation 
The income tax expense represents the sum of the tax  
currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable  
is based on taxable profit for the year.  
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported  
in the income statement because it excludes items of income  
or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years or 
which are never taxable or deductible. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable  
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding  
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to  
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences or unused tax 
losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised  
if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition  
of goodwill in a business combination. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects 
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising 
on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at  
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it  
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates which 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Current and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income 
statement, except when they relate to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is  
also recognised directly in equity. 
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against 
each other when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
o. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal  
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more 
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.  
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate which reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific  
to the liability. 
p. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows  
from the financial asset expire or the Group has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities (or a part of a financial liability) are derecognised  
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged  
or cancelled or expires.  95 www.kingﬁsher.com
Accounts
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group  
has a currently enforceable legal right to set-off the respective 
recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, 
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
(i) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits  
held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
(ii) Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured  
at amortised cost. Where borrowings are in designated and 
effective fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made  
to their carrying amounts to reflect the hedged risks. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the  
income statement using the effective interest method. 
(iii) Other investments (including short-term deposits) 
Other investments may include short-term deposits with banks 
and other investments with original maturities of more than  
three months. Investments classified as ‘available-for-sale’  
under IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’, are initially measured at fair value, with 
subsequent changes in fair value recorded directly in equity.  
Any dividends received are recognised in the income statement. 
On disposal, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised 
in equity are transferred to the income statement. 
(iv) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision  
for bad and doubtful debts.  
(v) Trade payables 
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
(vi) Derivatives and hedge accounting 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to  
which it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives 
are recognised in the income statement as they arise. Changes  
in the fair value of derivatives transacted as hedges of operating 
items and financing items are recognised in operating profit  
and net finance costs respectively.  
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently carried 
at fair value. The accounting treatment of derivatives and other 
financial instruments classified as hedges depends on their 
designation, which occurs at the start of the hedge relationship. 
The Group designates certain financial instruments as: 
• a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability or 
unrecognised firm commitment (‘fair value hedge’); 
• a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or  
firm commitment (‘cash flow hedge’); or 
• a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation  
(‘net investment hedge’). 
Fair value hedges  
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair  
value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value 
attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding 
entry being recorded in the income statement. Gains or losses 
from remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument  
are recognised in the same line of the income statement. 
Cash flow hedges  
Changes in the effective portion of the fair value of  
derivatives that are designated as hedges of future cash flows  
are recognised directly in equity, with any ineffective portion  
being recognised immediately in the income statement  
where relevant. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or 
forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset or liability, then, at the time it is recognised, the associated 
gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been 
recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of 
the non-financial asset or liability. For hedges that result in the 
recognition of a financial asset or liability, amounts deferred in 
equity are recognised in the income statement in the same 
period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.  
Net investment hedges 
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations 
through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the 
retranslation of the borrowings are recognised directly in equity.  
If the Group uses derivatives as the hedging instrument, the 
effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, with any 
ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are  
recycled through the income statement on disposal of the  
foreign operation.  
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents  
in advance the relationship between the item being hedged  
and the hedging instrument. The Group also documents and 
demonstrates an assessment of the relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the 
hedge has been and will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. 
The effectiveness testing is re-performed at each period end to 
ensure that the hedge remains highly effective. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the highly probable forecast transaction occurs.  
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the  
net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred  
to the income statement. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their  
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host 
contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair value  
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.  
q. Assets and liabilities held for sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held  
for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition  
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and  
the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in  
its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and 
customary for sales of such assets.  
   96 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
2 Principal accounting policies continued 
Management must be committed to the sale, which should  
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  
within one year from the date of classification as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for 
sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. This excludes financial assets, deferred tax 
assets and assets arising from employee benefits, which are 
measured according to the relevant accounting policy. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not 
depreciated once classified as held for sale. The Group ceases  
to use the equity method of accounting from the date on which 
an interest in a jointly controlled entity or an interest in an 
associate becomes held for sale. 
3 Critical accounting estimates  
and judgements 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under  
IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on historical experience and other factors including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The estimates, judgements and assumptions which 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill and other assets 
As required, the Group applies procedures to ensure that its 
assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount.  
The procedures, by their nature, require estimates and 
assumptions to be made. The most significant are set out below. 
The Group is required, on at least an annual basis, to test 
whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. As part of this 
testing the recoverable amounts of cash generating units have 
been determined based on value-in-use calculations. The  
use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows 
expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash 
generating unit and the choice of suitable discount and long- 
term growth rates in order to calculate the present value of the 
forecast cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary significantly 
from these estimates. Further information on the impairment 
tests undertaken, including the key assumptions, is given  
in note 12. 
Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets are 
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Computer software under development is assessed for 
impairment annually. When a review for impairment is 
conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash 
generating unit is determined as the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated on the basis of 
management’s assumptions and estimates. 
At each reporting date the Group is required to assess whether 
there is objective evidence that its investments in associates  
and joint ventures may be impaired. This requires estimates  
of the investments’ recoverable amounts, including present 
values of the Group’s share of future cash flows. 
Inventories 
As inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value this requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of 
goods to customers in the future. A high degree of judgement  
is applied when estimating the impact on the carrying value of 
inventories of factors such as slow moving items, shrinkage, 
damage and obsolescence. The quantity, age and condition of 
inventories are regularly measured and assessed as part of range 
reviews and inventory counts undertaken throughout the year 
and across the Group. Refer to note 17 for further information. 
Rebates 
Rebate income received from suppliers represents a material 
element of our gross profit, with a large number of agreements 
with varying terms existing across our operating companies.  
Volume-based rebates represent the significant majority of these 
rebates. Where the percentage rate of such rebates depends  
on the volumes purchased, forecasts are required, particularly  
at interim periods, of full (usually calendar) year purchases. 
Forecasts are informed by historical trading patterns, current 
performance and trends. However this judgement is reduced 
significantly for full year reporting, due to the Group’s January 
financial year end.  
Other types of rebates, such as contributions towards marketing 
and advertising activities, represent a smaller element of the 
Group’s overall rebate income. These require judgement  
on the timing of recognition, in particular assessing when any 
corresponding conditions have been fulfilled. Judgement is also 
required over the recoverability of receivables relating to rebates. 
Income taxes 
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
and there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of 
business. Significant judgement may therefore be required in 
determining the provision for income taxes in each territory. The 
Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based 
on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts 
which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which 
such determination is made. These adjustments in respect of 
prior years are recorded in the income statement, or directly  
in equity as appropriate, and are disclosed in the notes to the 
accounts. Refer to notes 9 and 25 for further information. 
Restructuring provisions 
The Group carries a number of provisions in relation to  
historical and on-going restructuring programmes. The most 
significant part of the provisions is the cost to exit stores and 
property contracts. The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows 
are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the 
closed stores and subletting surplus space. Refer to note  
26 for further information. 
Post-employment benefits 
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised  
on the balance sheet is dependent on a number of assumptions 
including interest rates of high quality corporate bonds, inflation 
and mortality rates. The net interest expense or income is 
dependent on the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds. 
The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and 
changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements 
in the estimated obligations. To help the reader understand the 
impact of changes in the key assumptions, a sensitivity analysis 
is provided in note 27.  97 www.kingﬁsher.com

5 Exceptional items continued 
Current year exceptional items include a £17m restructuring charge in the UK relating to the transformation of B&Q,  
driven by productivity initiatives aimed at delivering a simpler, more efficient business with a lower cost operating model. 
The prior year exceptional credit of £7m reflected the release of provisions that had been recorded in January 2013 when B&Q 
Ireland entered into an Examinership process, which it successfully exited in May 2013 with the closure of only one store. 
Current year transaction costs of £15m have been incurred, including costs relating to Mr Bricolage and the agreement to  
sell a controlling stake in the B&Q China business (2013/14: £5m principally related to Bricostore Romania). 
There is a net charge of £3m relating to the disposal of properties and impairment of non-operational assets (2013/14: £2m profit). 
A net impairment loss of £14m was recognised in the prior year on the Group’s investment in Hornbach. This comprised a loss of 
£45m on remeasurement of the investment to fair value, offset by a £31m gain on the transfer from reserves of cumulative foreign 
exchange gains since transition to IFRS. 
The current year exceptional tax credit of £106m includes the tax impact on exceptional items and the release of prior year 
provisions, which have either been agreed with the tax authorities, reassessed, or time expired. 
In the prior year there was an exceptional tax credit of £114m, which included £118m taxation provision releases related to  
the successful resolution of the Kesa demerger French tax case. A £27m repayment supplement provision release was also 
recognised in relation to this case.

offset by a net loss from fair value adjustments to the carrying value of borrowings and cash of £17m (2013/14: £39m gain).   100 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15

Factors affecting tax charge for the year

are explained below:

Income tax expense 71 49
The effective rate of tax on profit before exceptional items and excluding prior year tax adjustments and the impact of changes  
in tax rates on deferred tax is 27% (2013/14: 26%). Exceptional tax items for the year amount to a credit of £106m, £95m of  
which relates to prior year items. In 2013/14 exceptional tax items amounted to a credit of £114m, with £118m relating to prior  
year items.  
The effective tax rate calculation is set out in the Financial Review on page 21. The overall tax rate for the year is 11%  
(2013/14: 6%) reflecting the release of prior year provisions either agreed with the tax authorities, reassessed or time expired.  
In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of £99m has been charged directly to equity (2013/14: £67m 
credit), of which a £13m credit (2013/14: £19m credit) is included in current tax and a £112m charge (2013/14: £48m credit)  
is included in deferred tax and principally relates to post-employment benefits. 
Future changes in tax rates 
The UK corporation tax rate fell from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and will fall to 20% from 1 April 2015. The Spanish tax rate  
will fall from 30% to 28% for the year ended 31 December 2015 and will fall to 25% for the year ended 31 December 2016.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by  
the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan  
trust (‘ESOP trust’) which for the purpose of this calculation are treated as cancelled. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where both the exercise price is less than the average market 
price of the Company’s shares during the year and any related performance conditions have been met.

Impairment tests for goodwill 
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash generating units (‘CGUs’) as follows:

At 31 January 2015  
Cost 1,798 519 81 – 16 2,414

Impairment –––(124) –(124)
Net carrying amount 1,798 520 81 – 18 2,417
The recoverable amounts of these groups of CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. All CGU  
value-in-use calculations are considered to have been valued using level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy  
of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. 
   105 www.kingﬁsher.com
Accounts
12 Goodwill continued 
The groups of CGUs for which the carrying amount of goodwill is deemed significant are the UK, France and Poland. The Board has 
reviewed a sensitivity analysis and does not consider that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in the value-in-use 
calculations would cause the carrying amounts of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts. The key assumptions used for 
value-in-use calculations are set out below.  
Assumptions 
The cash flow projections are based on approved financial budgets and strategic plans covering a five year period. These are  
based on both past performance and expectations for future market development. 
Key drivers in the plans are like-for-like (‘LFL’) sales, margin and operating profit percentage. LFL sales projections take into 
consideration both external factors such as market expectations, and internal factors such as trading plans. 
Cash flows beyond this five year period are calculated using a growth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth  
rate for retail businesses operating in the same countries as the CGUs. 
The weighted average cost of capital, used to discount future cash flows, is calculated using a combination of the cost of debt,  
leases and equity, weighted according to an estimate of the CGU’s capital gearing. A risk adjustment is also made for the country  
in which the CGU operates. 
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates and long-term growth rates used are as follows: 
 2014/15

Included in land and buildings is leasehold land that is in effect a prepayment for the use of land and is accordingly being 
amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The net carrying amount of leasehold land included

The Group does not revalue properties within its financial statements. A valuation exercise is performed for internal purposes annually 
in November by independent external valuers. Based on this exercise the value of property is £2.7bn (2013/14: £3.4bn) on a sale

A property valuation exercise is performed for internal purposes annually as described in note 14. Based on this exercise the fair 
value of investment property is £60m (2013/14: £77m). All the investment properties held by the Group at fair value are considered 
to have fair values determined by level 2 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’.

In the prior year the Group concluded it had lost the ability to exercise significant influence over the Hornbach businesses based  
on the Group ceasing to participate in the significant financial and operating policy decisions made by Hornbach. The Group’s 
investment was written down to its fair value of £198m, resulting in an exceptional impairment loss of £45m being recognised in  
the consolidated income statement. The impairment loss was included within the Group’s share of post-tax results, however this 
excluded an exceptional transfer from reserves of cumulative foreign exchange gains since transition to IFRS of £31m. The Group 
recorded a £14m pre-exceptional profit in relation to its share of Hornbach’s post-tax results, comprising £26m of operating profit 
less £12m share of interest and tax. Due to active marketing of the shares at the balance sheet date, the investment was reclassified 
as an asset held for sale. In March 2014 the Group received proceeds of €236m (£198m) on disposal of its investment. 
No goodwill is included in the carrying amount of investments in joint ventures and associates (2013/14: £nil).

Non-current bank loans have an average maturity of three years (2013/14: three years) and are arranged at fixed rates of interest  
with an effective interest rate of 3.1% (2013/14: 2.8%). 
Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt 
Medium Term Notes (‘MTNs’) were issued in prior years under the Group’s €2,500m MTN programme and further notes issued  
as a US Private Placement (‘USPP’). In December 2014 the Sterling MTN of £73m was repaid.

(2) $247m swapped to floating rate Sterling based on 6 month LIBOR plus a margin using a cross-currency interest rate swap. 
The Group values its MTNs and USPP on an amortised cost basis, adjusted for fair value gains and losses (based on observable 
market inputs) attributable to the risk being hedged in designated and effective fair value hedge relationships.  
The carrying amounts of the MTNs and USPP have been impacted both by exchange rate movements and fair value adjustments  
for interest rate risk. At 31 January 2015, the cumulative effect of interest rate fair value adjustments is to increase the Group’s  
MTNs and USPP carrying amounts by £19m (2013/14: £25m increase).  
The USPP contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual financial reporting period, the ratio  
of operating profit to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding 12 month 
period. The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 31 January 2015.

Finance leases 
The Group leases certain of its buildings and fixtures and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term maturity for 
buildings is seven years (2013/14: seven years) and for fixtures and equipment is two years (2013/14: two years). Certain building 
leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.

Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair values of borrowings. Where market values are not available  
or are not reliable, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and foreign exchange rates.  
This has resulted in Level 1 inputs for the Medium Term Notes and Level 2 inputs for other borrowings as defined by the fair value 
hierarchy of IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurements’.

The fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows arising from the instruments and adjusted for credit risk. These  
fair value measurements are all made using observable market rates of interest, foreign exchange and credit risk.  
All the derivatives held by the Group at fair value are considered to have fair values determined by Level 2 inputs as defined by the 
fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. There are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have there been 
any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy.  
At 31 January 2015 net derivative assets included in net cash amount to £57m (2013/14: £27m net derivative assets).  
Fair value hedges 
Fair value hedges comprise cross currency interest rate swap contracts that convert US Private Placement fixed rate debt into floating 
rate liabilities. At 31 January 2015 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £164m (2013/14: £307m). During the year, 
cross-currency interest rate swaps have matured to coincide with repayments of underlying debt. The Sterling equivalent amount  
of those matured swaps (at year end exchange rates) was £150m. 
Cash flow hedges 
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge currency exposures of forecast inventory purchases. At 31 January 2015 the Sterling 
equivalent amount of such contracts is £603m (2013/14: £419m). The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred  
to inventories when the purchases occur during the next 12 months. Gains of £5m (2013/14: £9m losses) have been transferred  
to inventories for contracts which matured during the year. 
Non-designated hedges 
The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge against fluctuations in the income statement arising from balance 
sheet positions. At 31 January 2015 the Sterling equivalent amount of such contracts is £704m (2013/14: £813m). These have not 
been accounted for as hedges, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of 
the balance sheet positions. These include short-term foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for embedded derivatives and none of these contracts has any embedded  
derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore the Group is not required to account for these separately. 
The Group enters into netting agreements with counterparties to manage the credit and settlement risks associated with over-the-
counter derivatives. These netting agreements and similar arrangements generally enable the Group and its counterparties to  
settle cash flows on a net basis and set-off liabilities against available assets in the event that either party is unable to fulfil its 
contractual obligations.

24 Financial risk management 
Kingfisher’s treasury function has primary responsibility for managing certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed.  
The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments  
required to manage these risks. Kingfisher’s treasury function is not run as a profit centre and does not enter into any transactions  
for speculative purposes. 
In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivatives. The main types of financial instruments 
used are Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt, bank loans and deposits, money market funds, interest rate swaps, 
commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts. 
Interest rate risk 
Borrowings arranged at floating rates of interest expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas those arranged at fixed  
rates of interest expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain 
interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Group’s underlying debt instruments, principally  
the Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt. 
Currency risk 
The Group’s principal currency exposures are to the Euro, US Dollar, Polish Zloty and Russian Rouble. The Euro, Polish Zloty and 
Russian Rouble exposures are operational and arise through the ownership of retail businesses in France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, 
Ireland, Poland and Russia. In particular, the Group generates a substantial part of its profit from the Eurozone, and as such is 
exposed to the economic uncertainty of its member states. The Group continues to monitor potential exposures and risks, and 
consider effective risk management solutions. 
It is the Group’s policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings into Sterling. In addition, the Group has significant 
transactional exposure arising on the purchase of inventories denominated in US Dollars, which it hedges using forward foreign 
exchange contracts. Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed inventory purchases and  
a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months, and this is monitored on an ongoing basis. 
Kingfisher’s policy is to manage the interest rate and currency profile of its debt and cash using derivative contracts. The effect  
of these contracts on the Group’s net debt/cash is as follows:

Financial instruments principally affected by interest rate and currency risks, being the significant market risks impacting Kingfisher, 
are borrowings, deposits and derivatives. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of net finance costs (reflecting the impact on 
profit) and derivative cash flow hedges (reflecting the impact on other comprehensive income) to changes in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates.

The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash flow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars 
used to hedge forecast US Dollar purchases of inventories. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until  
the purchases occur. See note 23 for further details. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables 
and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are before the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis that the 
Group’s debt, hedging activities, hedge accounting designations, and foreign currency proportion of debt and derivative contracts 
remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 January 2015 and 1 February 2014 respectively. As a consequence, the analysis 
relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended. In preparing the sensitivity  
analysis it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective. 
The effects shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in interest rates and foreign exchange 
rates. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities required to fund its activities. This involves preparing a prudent cash 
flow forecast for the next five years, determining the level of debt facilities required to fund the business, planning for repayments  
of debt at its maturity and identifying an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected outflows.   117 www.kingﬁsher.com

At 31 January 2015 the Group has an undrawn revolving committed facility of £200m which matures in August 2016. The  
£200m facility contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each annual and semi-annual financial reporting period,  
the ratio of operating profit to net interest payable, excluding exceptional items, should not be less than 3 to 1 for the preceding  
12 month period. The Group has complied with this covenant for the year ended 31 January 2015. 
Credit risk 
The Group deposits surplus cash with a number of banks with the strongest short-term credit ratings and with money market funds 
which have AAA credit ratings and offer same day liquidity. A credit limit for each counterparty is agreed by the Board covering the 
full value of deposits and the fair value of derivative contracts. The credit risk is reduced further by spreading the investments and 
derivative contracts across several counterparties. At 31 January 2015, the highest total cash investment with a single counterparty 
was £38m (2013/14: £50m). 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash at bank and short-term deposits and the  
fair value of derivative assets. 
No further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts as the Group has a low 
concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables. Concentration of risk is limited as a result of low individual balances  
with short maturity spread across a large number of unrelated customers. 
At 31 January 2015, trade and other receivables that are past due but not provided against amount to £49m (2013/14: £50m),  
of which £4m (2013/14: £4m) are over 120 days past due.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £20m (2013/14: £22m) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of the remaining £239m (2013/14: £199m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. Included  
in unrecognised tax losses are losses arising in Portugal of £3m which can be carried forward only in the next one to twelve years. 
Other unrecognised losses may be carried forward indefinitely.  
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £3,384m (2013/14: £3,331m) relating to the unremitted earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. This is because the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and therefore no  
tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

Within the onerous property contracts provisions, Kingfisher has provided against future liabilities for properties sublet at a shortfall 
and long-term idle properties, along with properties acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries at above-market rents. Such provisions 
exclude those related to restructuring programmes which are included in the restructuring provisions. The provisions are based  
on the present value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges. 
Restructuring provisions include the estimated costs of the UK and Ireland restructuring programmes. The provisions have been 
discounted to reflect the time value of money and the risks associated with the specific liabilities. 
The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows related to the above provisions are largely dependent on exiting the property lease 
contracts and subletting surplus space.   119 www.kingﬁsher.com

27 Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit 
schemes and defined contribution schemes. The most significant defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are in the  
UK. The principal overseas defined benefit schemes are in France, where they are mainly retirement indemnity in nature, and  
the principal overseas defined contribution scheme is in China. The overseas schemes are not material in relation to the Group 
as a whole. 
Defined contribution schemes 
Costs for the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes, at rates specified in the individual schemes’ rules, are as follows: 
£ millions  2014/15 2013/14
Charge to operating profit 28 27
From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution pension scheme was offered to all UK employees. Eligible UK employees  
have been automatically enrolled into the scheme since 31 March 2013. 
Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s principal defined benefit arrangement is its funded, final salary pension scheme in the UK. This scheme was  
closed to new entrants from April 2004 and was closed to future benefit accrual from July 2012. 
The scheme operates under trust law and is managed and administered by the Trustee on behalf of members in accordance with  
the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The Trustee Board consists of ten Trustee directors, made up of  
five employer appointed directors, one independent director and four member nominated directors. The Trustee Board delegates 
day-to-day administration of the scheme to the Group Pensions Department of Kingfisher plc.  
The main risk to the Group is that additional contributions are required if investment returns and demographic experience is worse 
than expected. The scheme therefore exposes the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk,  
interest rate risk and market (investment) risk. The Trustee Board regularly reviews such risks and mitigating controls, with a risk 
register being formally approved on an annual basis. The assets of the scheme are held separately from the Group and the Trustee’s 
investment strategy includes a planned medium-term de-risking of assets, switching from return-seeking to liability-matching assets. 
Other de-risking activities have included the scheme acquiring an interest in a property partnership, as set out further below. 
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the Trustee and the last full 
valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2013. 
Following this valuation and in accordance with the scheme’s Statement of Funding Principles, the Trustee and Kingfisher have 
agreed annual employer contributions of £36m from April 2014. The contribution schedule has been derived with reference to a 
funding objective that targets a longer-term, low risk funding position in excess of the minimum statutory funding requirements. This 
longer-term objective is based on the principle of the scheme reaching a point where it can provide benefits to members with a high 
level of security, thereby limiting its reliance on the employer for future support. The Company monitors the scheme funding level on 
a regular basis and will review with the scheme Trustee at future valuations the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule 
currently in place. 
The Trust Deed provides Kingfisher with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets assuming the full settlement of plan 
liabilities in the event of a plan wind-up. 
UK scheme interest in property partnership 
In 2010/11, the Group established a partnership, Kingfisher Scottish Limited Partnership (‘Kingfisher SLP’), as part of an arrangement 
with the UK scheme Trustee to address an element of the scheme deficit and provide greater security to the Trustee. The partnership 
interests are held by the Group and by the scheme, the latter resulting from investments of £78m and £106m made by the Trustee  
in January and June 2011 respectively. These investments followed Group contributions of the same amounts into the scheme.  
In accordance with IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’, the investments held by the scheme in Kingfisher SLP do not represent plan  
assets for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly the reported pension position does not  
reflect these investments.  
UK property assets with market values of £83m and £119m were transferred, in January 2011 and June 2011 respectively, into  
the partnership and leased back to B&Q plc. The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute 
alternative properties. The Trustee has a first charge over the properties in the event that Kingfisher plc becomes insolvent. The 
scheme’s partnership interest entitles it to the majority of the income of the partnership over the 20 year period of the arrangement. 
The payments to the scheme by Kingfisher SLP over this term are reflected as Group pension contributions on a cash basis. At the 
end of this term, Kingfisher plc has the option to acquire the Trustee’s partnership interest in Kingfisher SLP. 
The Group has control over the partnership and therefore it is consolidated in these Group financial statements. Accordingly, 
advantage has been taken of the exemptions provided by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 from  
the requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of the partnership’s accounts.  120 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15

All UK scheme assets have quoted prices in active markets, except for £165m (2013/14: £157m) of property and other assets. 
Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are employed in the UK scheme to complement the use of fixed and index-linked bonds for 
liability risk management purposes and are included in the Corporate bonds category above. 
The estimated amount of total contributions to be paid to the UK and overseas pension schemes by the Group during the next 
financial year is £36m. 
Principal actuarial valuation assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes are set by the 
Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at  
the time and changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligations, as illustrated in the 
sensitivity analysis. 
The UK scheme discount rate is derived using a single equivalent discount rate approach, based on the yields available on a  
portfolio of high-quality sterling corporate bonds with the same duration to that of the scheme liabilities. 
2014/15  2013/14 
Annual % rate UK Overseas  UK Overseas

Price inflation 2.8 2.0  3.3 2.0
Rate of pension increases 2.7 –  3.1 –
Salary escalation n/a 2.5  n/a 2.3
For the UK scheme, the mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics 
and experience of the membership of the scheme from 2010 to 2013. The base mortality assumptions have been derived by 
adjusting standard mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected forward to 2013 using the ‘CMI 2013’ core projection improvement 
factors, as published by the UK actuarial profession. In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy. 
The allowance is in line with CMI 2013 improvements subject to a long-term rate of 1.25% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females. 
These improvements take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends. 
   122 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued  
27 Post-employment benefits continued 
The assumptions for life expectancy of UK scheme members are as follows: 
Years  2014/15 2013/14
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now)   
– Male  86.7 86.7
– Female   87.3 87.3
Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years’ time)   
– Male  87.4 87.4
– Female  88.6 88.6
The following sensitivity analysis for the UK scheme shows the estimated impact on the obligation resulting from changes to key 
actuarial assumptions, whilst holding all other assumptions constant. 
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by £53m
Price inflation Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £46m
Rate of pension increases Increase/decrease by 0.1% Increase/decrease by £47m
Mortality Increase in life expectancy by one year Increase by £94m
Due to the asset-liability matching investment strategy, the above impacts on the obligations of changes in discount rate and price 
inflation would be significantly offset by movements in the fair value of the scheme assets.

33 Acquisitions 
In the prior year, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the Bricostore Romania companies from Group Bresson, a French 
retail company. Consideration of £51m comprised £35m cash and a further £16m non-cash element, representing the obligation to 
assume a liability of the vendor. 
Goodwill of £18m was recognised on net assets of £33m, representing a strategic premium to strengthen the Group’s position  
in Eastern Europe and anticipated synergies that will arise from the acquisition.

Owing to local conditions, Bricostore Romania prepares its financial statements to 31 December. In the period from 31 May 2013  
to 31 December 2013, it contributed sales of £72m and a retail profit of £1m. If the acquisition had occurred at the start of the 
financial year, the Group’s sales would have been £11,163m and Group operating profit, after exceptional items, would have  
been £734m for the year ended 1 February 2014.

On 22 December 2014, Kingfisher announced a binding agreement to sell a controlling 70% stake in its B&Q China business to 
Wumei Holdings Inc for a total cash consideration of £140m. The agreement followed Kingfisher’s previous announcement  
of its plans to look for a strategic partner to help develop its B&Q business in China. The transaction is conditional on MOFCOM 
(Chinese Ministry of Commerce) approval and, if approved, is expected to close during the first half of Kingfisher’s 2015/16 financial 
year. On completion, a £12m deposit received in the current year would be repaid. As part of the terms of the transaction, 
Kingfisher would have the option following the second anniversary of the completion of the transaction, or sooner where agreed by 
both parties, to sell the remaining 30% economic interest to Wumei Holdings Inc for a fixed price of the Sterling equivalent of RMB 
582m (£62m at year end exchange rate). At the balance sheet date, Kingfisher was subject to certain contractual restrictions over 
B&Q China’s assets and liabilities as part of the agreement. 
Following the announcement the B&Q China business’ assets and liabilities were classified as a disposal group held for sale.  
The business is presented within the ‘Other International’ reporting segment. 
Assets and liabilities held for sale also include freehold properties in Brazil. 
Prior year assets held for sale comprised the Group’s 21% investment in Hornbach, which was subsequently sold in March  
2014 for €236m (£198m), and a UK freehold property asset.

38 Post balance sheet events 
On 23 July 2014 Kingfisher entered into a binding agreement with the principal shareholders of Mr Bricolage to acquire their 
shareholdings subject to satisfactory French anti-trust clearance. This agreement made provision that it would lapse if the anti-trust 
clearance was not obtained by 31 March 2015 and an extension was not agreed by all parties. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, 
it has become clear that the anti-trust clearance will not be obtained by 31 March 2015 and therefore the July 2014 agreement will 
lapse on that date. Consequently the transaction will not proceed.  129 www.kingﬁsher.com

Notes to the Company financial statements 
1 Principal accounting policies 
The financial statements of Kingfisher plc (‘the Company’)  
are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January each year. 
The directors of Kingfisher plc, having made appropriate 
enquiries, consider that adequate resources exist for the 
Company to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and that, therefore, it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 January 2015. Refer to the Directors’ statement of 
responsibility on page 79. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the use of valuations for certain 
financial instruments, share-based payments and pensions,  
and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards in the United Kingdom and the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s financial statements are included in the 
consolidated financial statements of Kingfisher plc. As permitted 
by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss 
account and statement of total recognised gains and losses  
are not presented. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms 
of FRS 1, ‘Cash flow statements’. The Company is exempt under 
the terms of FRS 8, ‘Related party disclosures’, from disclosing 
related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries of 
Kingfisher plc. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption to provide financial instrument disclosures under  
the terms of FRS 29, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation  
of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated. 
a. Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences on monetary items  
are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Principal rate of exchange against Sterling: 
Euro  2014/15 2013/14
Year end rate 1.33 1.22
b. Intangible assets
Intangible fixed assets are carried in the balance sheet at  
cost less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for 
impairment. Amortisation is provided to reflect a straight line 
reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the 
estimated useful life of the asset. 
c. Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are carried on the balance sheet at  
cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for 
impairment. Depreciation is provided to reflect a straight line 
reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the 
estimated useful life of the asset as follows: 
Fixtures and fittings – between 4 and
20 years 
Computers and  
electronic equipment 
– between 3 and
5 years 
Motor cars – 4 years
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is 
conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference  
to the higher of value-in-use and net realisable value. Any 
impairment in value is charged to the profit and loss account  
in the period in which it occurs. 
d. Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are included in the balance sheet 
at cost, less any provisions for impairment. 
e. Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit  
and loss account in the period to which the payments relate. 
Incentives received or paid to enter into lease agreements are 
released to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis 
over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date on  
which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing 
market rate. 
f. Employee benefits
(i) Pensions 
The Company operates defined benefit and defined contribution 
pension schemes for its employees. A defined benefit scheme  
is a pension scheme that defines an amount of pension  
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. A defined 
contribution scheme is a pension scheme under which the 
Company usually pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. 
In all cases a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the 
accruing liabilities. The assets of each of these funds are either 
held under trusts or managed by insurance companies and  
are entirely separate from the Company’s assets. 
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect  
of defined benefit pension schemes is the fair value of scheme 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 
the balance sheet date, together with an adjustment for any past 
service costs not yet recognised. The defined benefit obligation  
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated 
future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the 
benefits will be paid and which have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. 
A net pension asset is only recognised to the extent that it is 
recoverable either through reduced future contributions or 
through agreed refunds from the scheme. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments 
and changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged 
directly to the profit and loss reserve as they arise. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit  
and loss account, unless the changes to the pension scheme  
are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a 
specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the  
past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over  
the vesting period. 
For defined contribution schemes, the Company has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.  
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense when they are due.  
(ii) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates several equity-settled, share-based 
compensation schemes for the employees of the Company  
and its subsidiaries using the Company’s equity instruments.  131 www.kingﬁsher.com
Accounts
The fair value of the Company’s employees’ services received  
in exchange for the grant of options or deferred shares is 
recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes 
and stochastic models. The total amount to be expensed over 
the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value  
of the options or deferred shares granted, excluding the impact 
of any non-market vesting conditions. The value of the charge  
is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting 
due to non-market vesting conditions. 
The fair value of the compensation given to subsidiaries in 
respect of share-based compensation schemes is recognised  
as a capital contribution over the vesting period. The capital 
contribution is reduced by any payments received from 
subsidiaries in respect of these schemes. 
(iii) Employee Share Ownership Plan trust (‘ESOP trust’) 
The ESOP trust is a separately administered discretionary trust. 
Liabilities of the ESOP trust are guaranteed by the Company  
and the assets of the ESOP trust mainly comprise shares in  
the Company.  
Own shares held by the ESOP trust are deducted from equity 
shareholders’ funds and the shares are held at historical cost 
until they are sold. The assets, liabilities, income and costs  
of the ESOP trust are included in both the Company’s and the 
consolidated financial statements. 
g. Deferred tax 
Provision is made for deferred tax using the incremental 
provision approach and is measured on an undiscounted  
basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods  
in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and  
laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences  
that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet  
date subject to the following: 
• deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-
monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale 
agreement exists at the balance sheet date. Where rollover 
relief is available on an asset, deferred tax is not recognised;  
• deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries only where dividends are accrued as receivable  
or there is an intention to remit these in the foreseeable future; 
• deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are 
regarded as recoverable. Assets are regarded as recoverable 
when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted; and 
• deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences. 
h. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present  
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it  
is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount can be  
reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.  
i. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows 
from the financial asset expire or the Company has substantially 
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial 
liabilities (or a part of a financial liability) are derecognised  
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged  
or cancelled or expires. 
(i) Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs and subsequently measured  
at amortised cost. Where borrowings are in designated and 
effective fair value hedge relationships, adjustments are made  
to their carrying amounts to reflect the hedged risks. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are amortised to the  
profit and loss account using the effective interest method. 
(ii) Other investments (including short-term deposits) 
Other investments may include short-term deposits with banks 
and other investments with original maturities of more than three 
months. Investments classified as ‘available-for-sale’ under FRS 
26, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’, are 
initially measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair 
value recorded directly in equity shareholders’ funds. 
(iii) Trade creditors 
Trade creditors are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
(iv) Derivatives and hedge accounting 
Where hedge accounting is not applied, or to the extent to which 
it is not effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives are 
recognised in the profit and loss account as they arise. 
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a 
derivative contract is entered into and subsequently carried  
at fair value. The accounting treatment of derivatives classified  
as hedges depends on their designation, which occurs at the 
start of the hedge relationship. The Company designates certain 
derivatives as a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability  
(‘fair value hedge’). 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, 
the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable 
to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry being 
recorded in the profit and loss account. Gains or losses from 
remeasuring the corresponding hedging instrument are also 
recognised in the profit and loss account. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company 
documents in advance the relationship between the item  
being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Company  
also documents and demonstrates an assessment of the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument, which shows that the hedge has been and will be 
highly effective on an ongoing basis. The effectiveness testing  
is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge 
remains highly effective. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their  
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of  
host contracts, and the host contracts are not carried at fair  
value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the profit  
and loss account. 132 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15

Within the onerous property contracts provision, the Company has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a 
shortfall and long-term idle properties. The provision is based on the present value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates  
and service charges.  
11 Net pension asset 
The Company participates in both a funded defined benefit scheme and a funded defined contribution scheme. 
Defined contribution scheme 
Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme, at rates specified in the scheme’s rules, are as follows: 
£ millions  2014/15 2013/14
Charge to operating profit 2 2
From July 2012 an enhanced defined contribution scheme has been offered to all Company employees. Eligible Company 
employees have been automatically enrolled into the defined contribution scheme since 31 March 2013. 
Defined benefit scheme 
Kingfisher plc is one of a number of Group companies that participate in the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, and therefore the  
Company has accounted for its share of the scheme assets and liabilities. The valuation of the scheme has been based on the  
most recent actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2013 and has been updated to 31 January 2015. 
The final salary pension scheme was closed to future benefit accrual with effect from July 2012. Under UK accounting standards,  
the amount of surplus that can be recognised is restricted following the closure to future accrual of benefits, resulting in a full 
provision against the net surplus. 
In 2010/11 and 2011/12 the Company entered into two phases of a property partnership arrangement with the scheme Trustee  
to address an element of the scheme deficit. Further details on this arrangement are given in note 27 of the consolidated financial 
statements. The reported pension position, before provision for asset restriction, reflects the Company’s share of the resulting  
scheme asset.

Principal actuarial valuation assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligation of the defined benefit pension scheme are set by the Directors after 
consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. The assumptions are based on the conditions at the time and 
changes in these assumptions can lead to significant movements in the estimated obligation. 
The discount rate is derived using a single equivalent discount rate approach, based on the yields available on a portfolio of high-
quality sterling corporate bonds with the same duration to that of the scheme liabilities. The overall expected rate of return on  
scheme assets reflects market expectations at the balance sheet date of long-term asset returns and the mix of assets in the scheme. 
Annual % rate  2014/15 2013/14
Discount rate 3.0 4.4
Price inflation 2.8 3.3

Equities 6.2 7.2
Bonds 2.3 3.7
Property 5.6 6.5
Other 3.8 4.5
Overall expected rate of return 3.2 4.7
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations have been selected with regard to the characteristics and experience  
of the membership of the scheme from 2010 to 2013. The base mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard 
mortality tables (SAPS tables) projected forward to 2013 using the ‘CMI 2013’ core projection improvement factors, as published  
by the UK actuarial profession. In addition, allowance has been made for future increases in life expectancy. The allowance is in 
line with CMI 2013 improvements subject to a long-term rate of 1.25% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females. These improvements 
take into account trends observed within the scheme over the past decade and general population trends. 
The assumptions for life expectancy of the scheme members are as follows: 
Years 2014/15 2013/14
Age to which current pensioners are expected to live (60 now) 
– Male 86.7 86.7
– Female 87.3 87.3
Age to which future pensioners are expected to live (60 in 15 years’ time) 
– Male 87.4 87.4
– Female 88.6 88.6 138 Kingﬁsher Annual Report 2014/15

The Kingfisher Incentive Share Plan (‘KISP’), Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme (‘KISS’) and Performance Share Plan are 
described as part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 75. 
Restricted Awards are granted as one-off compensatory awards granted under the rules of the KISS. They are granted as nil cost options, 
as with the KISS, but do not accrue dividends until after they are exercised. Vesting dates may vary according to individual grants. 
The Store Manager Incentive Share Scheme contained performance conditions based on store standards, with awards lapsing if not 
maintained throughout the performance period. These awards did not accrue dividends during the vesting period. 
Under the UK Sharesave scheme, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into HMRC approved savings contracts for a 
period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with savings under the contract. The option price is the average market 
price over three days shortly before the invitation to subscribe, discounted by 20%. Options are exercisable within a six month period 
from the conclusion of a three or five year period. The Irish and International Sharesave plans, which operate along similar lines of the 
UK Sharesave scheme, include eligible employees in Ireland and certain overseas locations. 
The rules of all schemes include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances. 
The Employee Share Ownership Plan trust (‘ESOP trust’) 
The ESOP trust is funded by an interest free loan from the Company of £96m (2013/14: £82m) to enable it to acquire shares in 
Kingfisher plc. The shares are used to satisfy options awarded under the KISP, KISS, Performance Share Plan, Store Management 
Incentive Share Scheme and International Sharesave schemes. 
The ESOP trust’s shareholding at 31 January 2015 is 8 million shares (2013/14: 10 million shares) with a nominal value of  
£1m (2013/14: £2m) and a market value of £27m (2013/14: £37m). Dividends on these shares were waived for the interim  
and final dividends.

(1) Adjusted pre-tax profit and adjusted basic earnings per share restated to exclude contribution from Hornbach, following its disposal in 2014/15. There was no contribution 
from Hornbach in 2014/15. 
(2) Like-for-like sales growth in 2012/13 was calculated by comparing 53 weeks against the equivalent 53 weeks of the prior year. Like-for-like sales growth in 2013/14  
is calculated by comparing 52 weeks against the equivalent 52 weeks of the prior year. This only impacts the UK & Ireland businesses with all of the other businesses 
reporting on a calendar basis. The effect of the 53rd week on the results of the Group in 2012/13 was the inclusion of an additional £72m sales and an immaterial  
benefit to retail profit.  
(3) 2012/13 restated for IAS 19 (revised), ‘Employee benefits’, resulting in the reclassification of £3m of pension administration costs from net finance costs to retail profit. 
(4) Other net current (liabilities)/assets and other net non-current liabilities reported above exclude any components of net (cash)/debt.

Unauthorised brokers (boiler room scams)  
Kingfisher plc is legally obliged to make its share register 
available to the general public. Consequently some shareholders 
may receive unsolicited mail, including correspondence from 
unauthorised investment companies. We are aware that some 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are 
typically from overseas based brokers who target UK 
shareholders offering to sell what often turn out to be worthless  
or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are advised  
to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at 
a discount or offers of free company reports. Details of any share 
dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in 
Company mailings.

Payment methods 
Shareholders can elect to receive their dividends in a number  
of ways: 
• Cheque: Dividends will automatically be paid to shareholders 
by cheque, which will be sent by post to the shareholder's 
registered address; 
• BACS: Dividends can be paid by mandate directly to a UK 
bank or building society account through the BACS system. 
This method of payment reduces the risk of your cheque 
being intercepted or lost in the post. Shareholders wishing to 
receive their dividends in this way can update their mandate 
instructions at www.investorcentre.co.uk or should complete  
a dividend mandate form and return it to the Registrars; 
• Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP): The Company also offers 
shareholders a DRIP, whereby shareholders can use their 
cash dividend to buy additional shares in the Company. 
Shareholders can apply online at www.investorcentre.co.uk  
or complete a mandate form and return it to the address 
shown above; and 
• Global Payments Service: This service, provided by the 
Registrar enables shareholders to have dividend payments 
paid directly into their bank account in their chosen local 
currency. To view terms and register, please visit 
www.computershare.com/uk/investor/GPS. 
American Depositary Receipt (ADR) 
The Company has a Sponsored Level 1 ADR programme in the 
United States. Each ADR represents two Kingfisher shares. 
Electronic communication 
Shareholders who have not yet elected to receive shareholder 
documentation in electronic form can sign up by visiting 
www.investorcentre.co.uk/ecomms and registering their details. 
When registering for electronic communications, shareholders 
will be sent an email each time the Company publishes statutory 
documents, providing a link to the information.  
Electing for electronic communications does not mean that 
shareholders cannot obtain hard copy documents. Should 
shareholders require a paper copy of any of the Company’s 
shareholder documentation, they should contact the Registrar  
at the address stated under the section headed ‘Registrar’. 
Corporate website  
Shareholders are encouraged to visit Kingfisher’s corporate 
website (www.kingfisher.com). The website includes information 
about the Company, its strategy and business performance,

governance. The Investor Relations section is a key tool for 
shareholders, with information about Kingfisher’s share price, 
financial results, shareholders meetings and dividends. This 
section also contains frequently asked questions and copies  
of the current and past annual reports.  
Kingfisher has an Investor Relations app for the iPad. The app 
provides access to the latest share price information, corporate 
news, financial reports, presentations, corporate videos and 
earnings webcasts both online and offline. It is updated with the

statutory provisions, in light of the safe harbour provisions of the 
United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  
All statements other than historical facts may be forward-looking 
statements. Such statements are therefore subject to risks, 
assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results  
to differ materially from those expressed or implied because  
they relate to future events.  
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of 
relevant terminology including the words: ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, 
‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘goal’, ‘target’, ‘aim’, 
‘may’, ‘will’, ‘would’, ‘could’ or ‘should’ or, in each case, their 
negative or other variations or comparable terminology and 
include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a 
number of places throughout this Annual Report and Accounts 
and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or 
current expectations and those of our officers, directors and 
employees concerning, amongst other things, our results of 
operations, financial condition, changes in tax rates, liquidity, 
prospects, growth, strategies and the businesses we operate.  
Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
from those estimated by the forward-looking statements include, 
but are not limited to, global economic business conditions, 
monetary and interest rate policies, foreign currency exchange 
rates, equity and property prices, the impact of competition, 
inflation and deflation, changes to regulations, taxes and 
legislation, changes to consumer saving and spending habits; 
and our success in managing these factors.  
Consequently, our actual future financial condition, performance 
and results could differ materially from the plans, goals and 
expectations set out in our forward-looking statements. Reliance 
should not be placed on any forward-looking statement.

FFVR (financing fair value remeasurements) represents  
changes in the fair value of financing derivatives, excluding 
interest accruals, offset by fair value adjustments to the carrying 
value of borrowings and other hedged items under fair value 
hedge relationships.
KEP (Kingfisher Economic Profit) represents earnings after a 
charge for the annual cost of capital employed in the business 
and is derived from the concept of Economic Value Added. 
Management is focused on KEP as a main measure of return 
on capital. It is used in the capital investment process to assess 
performance and drive returns in strategic plans. Earnings are 
defined as adjusted post-tax profit, excluding interest, property 
lease costs and exceptional items. A charge is then deducted by 
applying the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to capital 
employed. For the purposes of consistency both WACC and 
capital employed are lease adjusted and adjusted for exceptional 
items. Leases are capitalised based on an estimate of their long-
term property yields. In order to focus on controllable factors 
both WACC and long-term property yields are based on those  
in place when KEP was introduced.

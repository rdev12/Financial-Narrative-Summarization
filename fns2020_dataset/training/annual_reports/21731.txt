Chairman’s statement
“We remain well placed to 
take advantage of our strong 
position, whichever way our 
markets develop, and the long-
term prospects for the Group are 
excellent. ”
A.M. Thomson l Chairman
Overview
2016 was another challenging year for the Group. The oil & gas and 
other resources’ downturn persisted, with its knock-on impact on 
the capital goods market more generally. This resulted in a decline 
in revenue at constant exchange rates, partially offset by continued 
growth in Bodycote’s automotive and aerospace business. 
The Group, under the stewardship of Stephen Harris and his 
executive team, has once again successfully navigated the business 
through these tough conditions and we remain in a strong financial 
position.
Dividend
The Board considers the dividend to be an important component 
of shareholder returns and is proposing a final ordinary dividend 
of 10.8p, an increase of 4.9%, which will be paid on 2 June 
2017 , subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM). This brings the total ordinary dividend for 2016 to 
15.8p (2015: 15.1p) costing £20.5m which represents a year-on-
year increase of 4.6%. The Board is not recommending a special 
dividend this year, noting that, on top of the bolt-on acquisitions 
completed in 2016, there is a pipeline of further potential 
transactions, as well as other investments to support growth, which 
the Board believes will deliver superior returns for shareholders.
Governance and reporting
One of my key responsibilities as Chairman is to promote effective 
governance across the Group thus ensuring that we remain a 
successful and sustainable entity with good governance procedures 
practised across all 23 countries in which the Group operates. 
In order to enable shareholders to understand how this goal is 
achieved, we have provided a corporate governance statement on 
page 38 of this Annual Report. This describes how the governance 
structure underpins the delivery of the Group’s business strategy. 
On page 24 we have also outlined the principal risks that may 
prevent the business from achieving its objectives and the actions 
being taken to overcome these potential obstacles.
During the year we introduced a new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy, following approval at the Group’s AGM in May 2016. Details 
of the arrangements for directors’ remuneration can be found in 
the Board report on remuneration on pages 54 to 73 of this Annual 
Report.

Board matters
It is the responsibility of every board to ensure that there is an 
appropriate succession plan in place across the business, including 
for the Board of Directors. 2016 marked a number of changes to our 
Board, testing and proving the efficacy of our planning. 
It was with great sadness that we learned of Raj Rajagopal’s 
passing in November 2016. Raj, our Senior Independent Director, 
served on the Board from September 2008 until his retirement after 
the 2016 AGM. He was succeeded as Senior Independent Director 
by Ian Duncan, who also chairs the Group’s Audit Committee and is 
a member of the Board’s other committees.
I was delighted to welcome Pat Larmon to our Board in September. 
Pat joins us with a strong background in packaging products, 
originally as a business owner, and more recently as President 
of Bunzl’s North America business since 2003. His experience in 
running complex multi-site operations, as well as in completing and 
integrating multiple bolt-on acquisitions, will serve Bodycote very 
well.
David Landless, who demonstrated his dedication to Bodycote by 
agreeing to stay on as Group Finance Director in order to effect 
a smooth handover to his successor, retired from the business 
at the end of 2016. I would like to thank David for his service and 
dedication during his 17 years at the Group. 
I was also pleased to welcome Dominique Yates to the Board 
in November as David’s successor. Dominique joins us with 
ten years of experience as Chief Financial Officer, with quoted 
company experience at Symrise AG and, most recently, Regus 
plc. Dominique assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer at the 
beginning of January 2017 .
People
Bodycote is a service business, but first class service is delivered 
by passionate and professional people, who understand their 
customers’ needs and meet their demanding requirements time 
after time. We will continue to invest in training and developing our 
employees to ensure that our talented workforce remains one of 
our competitive advantages. As noted above, 2016 has not been an 
easy year for the Group and, once again, I would like to thank all of 
our employees for their dedication. 
Shareholders
During the year I met with a number of Bodycote’s largest 
shareholders and received positive feedback from them on their 
views of the Group. In the coming year I will maintain this valuable 
dialogue. I also look forward to meeting as many shareholders as 
possible at this year’s AGM in May 2017 , when there will be an 
opportunity to discuss the Group’s business and future prospects 
with Board members.
Summary
The performance of the Group was creditable in 2016 through 
another challenging year. Decisive cost actions and measured 
investments have helped mitigate the negative impacts of weak 
market conditions.
We have a strong, high-performance culture serving a wide range of 
international customers, with a committed workforce and absolute 
integrity in our operating procedures. We remain well placed to 
take advantage of our strong position, whichever way our markets 
develop, and the long-term prospects for the Group are excellent. 
I remain confident that these should ensure an attractive return for 
both our employees and our shareholders over the coming years.

Chief Executive’s review
“Our outlook is positive and 
we remain optimistic that 
we are well placed to take 
advantage of an upturn in our 
markets. ”
S.C. Harris l Group Chief Executive
Overview
Reported revenues for the Group were up 6% in 2016. However, 
the significant weakness in the oil & gas market and the knock-on 
effect on general industrial demand continued to exert considerable 
downward pressure on Group results. Group revenue on a like-
for-like basis
1
 was down 3.5%. Like-for-like sales to the energy 
markets were down 27%. Excluding the impact of these falling 
energy revenues, the Group had flat sales year on year. It should be 
noted that like-for-like revenues at the half year were down 6%. The 
improved performance for the full year was due to a notable pickup 
in activity in the fourth quarter. 
Civil aerospace in Western Europe was strong, particularly in 
the second half, while the North American business was more 
mixed as the supply chains for this sector continue to go through 
adjustment associated with the changeover of aircraft and engine 
platforms.
In automotive, car and light trucks built on the strong start to 2016, 
accelerating through the year such that the second half growth 
rate was 6% on a like-for-like basis. While the background market 
demand in the car and light truck market has moderated over recent 
months, Group revenues continue to grow on the back of new 
programme wins.
Specialist Technologies performed well overall, increasing their 
contribution to Group headline operating profit to 42%. While 
two of these technologies, Surface Technology and HIP Product 
Fabrication, continue to be hard hit by low levels of activity in the 
oil & gas sector, the remaining technologies once again showed 
good growth. Margins continued to exceed 30% in Specialist 
Technologies.
The Group’s headline operating margin
2
 was resilient at 16.6%. 
Headline operating profit declined 2% from £102.1m to £99.6m 
(13% at constant exchange rates). The robust margin performance 
was partly helped by favourable currency translation. However, 
the Bodycote Margin Model is helping to drive improvements and 
this, together with the improved flexibility the Group now has in its 
cost base and the favourable impact on mix coming from Specialist 
Technologies, combined to deliver margin resilience that would not 
have been possible in past downturns.
04 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2016 25229.04    9 March 2017 5:13 PM    PROOF 5 post self editing
We completed the acquisition of five plants in 2016, in line with 
our bolt-on strategy in Classical Heat Treatment. In some cases 
these acquisitions brought new capability into the Group, but in 
all cases they strengthened our network and enhanced our local 
cluster strength. They were all completed in the second half of the 
year with the majority in the final quarter and, correspondingly, had 
an immaterial impact on our Group result. They will, on the other 
hand, provide us with a small impetus as we enter 2017 . Annualised 
sales from the acquisitions will be around £20m, with average 
Group margins expected to be achieved in 2017 . We have a good 
acquisition pipeline and fully intend to continue to execute these 
acquisition opportunities provided we are confident that they will 
create further shareholder value.
Basic headline earnings per share were 37 .0p, a decline of 6%, 
principally reflecting a higher tax rate in 2016. Cash generation has 
remained strong, with 92% of headline operating profit turned 
into cash
3
 (2015: 80%). Indeed, even after spending £30m on 
acquisitions, capital investment of £63m (corresponding to 1 .1 
times depreciation), restructuring costs and £48m of dividends, 
the Group’s year end net cash position only reduced by £11 .2m 
to £1 .1m (2015: £12.3m). The Group continues to be in a strong 
financial position, with plenty of available financial headroom.
Strategic progress
We continued our strategy of investing in areas where we see  
high-growth potential but are always mindful of the Group’s 
minimum 20% hurdle rate for return on capital employed. 
Expenditure in the year included new facilities in the USA, Mexico, 
Poland and France, as well as continued expansion of our Specialist 
Technologies’ capacities and capabilities, and further deployment 
of the Group’s ERP programme. The strategy of preferential 
investment in Specialist Technologies continues to benefit the 
Group.
The Group’s strategy remains relevant and unaltered. The drive for 
operational efficiency in the more mature parts of the business, 
expansion of the Group’s footprint in rapid-growth countries and the 
focus on growth in the higher value-added businesses, particularly 
Specialist Technologies, are all designed to increase the quality of 
the Group’s earnings and create significant value. We have made 
further progress during this challenging year and remain readier 
than ever to respond to developments in our markets. 
Summary and outlook 
The Group delivered a robust performance in 2016 despite 
significant headwinds in some key business sectors. The speed and 
effectiveness of management’s actions, in addition to the continued 
focus on improved mix, resulted in resilient margins. 
While our business, by its nature, has limited forward visibility, we 
continue to demonstrate that we are capable of adapting with great 
agility to changes in market conditions. Our outlook is positive and 
we remain optimistic that we are well placed to take advantage of 
an upturn in our markets. 
The Board is confident that management’s continued focus on 
business improvements and execution of the Group strategy will 
generate good returns through the cycle.

Provider of essential services to engineering manufacturers 
Classical Heat T reatment
■ ■ Working to very exacting quality 
specifications, heat treatment uses 
precisely controlled furnaces to process 
a huge variety of metals and alloys, 
improving their material properties.
■ ■ Bodycote’s Classical Heat Treatments 
describe a group of mature heat 
treatment processes and includes metal 
joining technologies which are used to 
join and assemble parts.
Virtually every type of metal component, 
whatever its application, has received some 
form of processing before its introduction to 
service to enable it to perform to the required 
standard and last longer.

Specialist T echnologies
■ ■ Bodycote’s Specialist Technologies refer 
to a group of processes which require 
very specialist expertise and technology. 
These technologies, some of which are 
proprietary, offer unique solutions for a 
variety of applications.
The global leader
Customer focus
■ ■ Bodycote is focused on continual 
improvement of our quality of service and 
takes an active role in finding solutions 
to technical issues and promoting mutual 
business development with our customers.
■ ■ Bodycote seeks to secure service-specific 
arrangements with our customers which 
provide protection from supply disruption 
by leveraging Bodycote’s unique facility 
network.
Global network
■ ■ Bodycote’s global network of 189  
market-focused facilities (see pages 12 
and 13) in 23 countries brings economies 
of scale, particularly for logistics and 
equipment utilisation. This makes 
Bodycote’s processing inherently more 
efficient than customers’ in-house 
operations (see page 32) and competitors, 
thereby enhancing our competitive 
position in the sub-contract market. 
■ ■ The capital intensive nature of Bodycote’s 
business also provides significant barriers 
to entry. The scope of Bodycote’s network 
enables us to specialise more effectively 
than competitors at individual locations 
and provides comprehensive back-up for 
our customers.
➔
Transferable know-how
■ ■ The global Bodycote network provides 
unique opportunities for the transfer of 
knowledge and skills, and the transfer of 
technology.
■ ■ With some of the best metallurgists, 
engineers and technicians in the industry,

Our technologies
Classical Heat T reatment Specialist T echnologies 
Virtually every type of metal component, whatever its application, 
has received some form of processing before its introduction 
to service to enable it to perform to the required standard and 
last longer. Working to very exacting quality specifications, heat 
treatment uses precisely controlled furnaces to process a huge 
variety of metals and alloys, improving their material properties. 
Bodycote’s Classical Heat Treatments describe a group of mature 
processes such as nitriding, carburising, annealing, tempering (and 
many more) that are used to achieve the desired properties.
Below are a few examples of material properties obtained by heat 
treatment:
Bodycote’s Specialist T echnologies refer to a group of processes 
which require very specialist expertise and technology. In some cases, 
they are proprietary technologies which have undergone extensive 
development and offer unique solutions for a variety of applications.
HIP
Hot Isostatic Pressing Services
Impact resistance and fatigue properties are extremely sensitive to 
small amounts of porosity. Through the simultaneous application of heat 
and pressure, the HIP process eliminates internal porosity, improving 
fatigue strength, tensile ductility and fracture toughness.
Hardness
What is it? The ability of a material to resist deformation, 
scratching and indentation under force. 
Why is it important? Improving a material’s hardness through 
heat treatment allows it to resist various types of wear.
HIP PF
Hot Isostatic Pressing Product Fabrication
This method combines the HIP process with design and production 
expertise to create a component from metal powder. The flexibility 
of the HIP PF process means that combinations of materials can 
be used to give desired properties, enabling metallic compositions 
that are difficult or impossible to forge or cast.
T oughness
What is it? The ability of a material to absorb energy and 
plastically deform without fracture. 
Why is it important? Heat treatment can be used to strengthen 
the material and help improve its resistance to impact.
S
3
P
Specialty Stainless Steel Processes
Steel is often chosen for its inherent corrosion resistance, but often requires 
hardening. Standard heat treatments will harden the steel, but can negatively 
impact the corrosion resistance. S
3
P technology uniquely hardens stainless 
steel, nickel-based alloys and cobalt-chromium alloys improving mechanical 
and wear properties without adversely affecting corrosion resistance.
Fatigue 
strength
What is it? The stress level at which component failure occurs 
when subjected to repeated stress cycles.
Why is it important? Part failure due to fatigue can have 
catastrophic consequences, particularly if the part is safety 
critical. Through heat treatment, a material’s fatigue strength is 
improved.
LPC
Low Pressure Carburising
A case hardening process used to obtain a hardened surface and 
tough core, giving increased wear resistance and fatigue life, with 
minimal risk of treatment distortion. LPC is a clean process, carried 
out under vacuum, and is an environmentally-friendly treatment.
Creep 
resistance
What is it? The measure of a material’s ability to resist high 
temperature deformation.
Why is it important? Some metals and alloys must operate 
at temperatures close to their melting point. Heat treatment 
enables them to perform at higher temperatures with little or no 
movement.
CiD
Corr-l-Dur
®
A proprietary thermochemical treatment for the simultaneous improvement 
of corrosion and wear resistance through the generation of a nitride-oxide 
combination layer. Corr -I-Dur
®
 is an environmentally-friendly alternative to the 
use of hard chromium, electroless nickel and other galvanic coatings.
Ductility
What is it? The ability of a material to deform without breaking. 
Why is it important? In order to form or shape a complex 
component good ductility is required. Heat treatment is used to 
soften the material which makes it easy to work as part of the 
manufacturing process.
ST
Surface T echnology
ST incorporates specialised plasma spray, High Velocity Oxygen Fuel 
(HVOF) and thermo-chemically formed coatings to improve wear 
resistance, hardness and durability, and is able to surface engineer 
components designed to operate in the most demanding of industrial 
applications.
I
2
P
Ion Implantation
This unique surface treatment uses macro level ion beams to improve 
the friction coefficient, adhesive wear and surface hardness; ideally 
for temperature sensitive materials such as thin metal parts and 
polymers.

Brake through – a component journey
BRAKE DISCS
Vehicles are exposed to environmental elements which  
cause corrosion, such as snow, ice, road salt, and acid rain. 
The Ferritic Nitrocarburising (FNC) process makes it easier to 
maintain clean brakes, important for safety critical components. 
Bodycote’s FNC treatment strengthens the surface providing 
optimal corrosion protection and wear.

Civil aerospace revenues increased in 2016 by 2%
1
 at constant 
exchange rates (12%
1
 at actual exchange rates), with strong growth 
in Western Europe. Available seat kilometres grew globally again in 
2016 by a further 6%, and prospects remain good, with a number of 
key development programmes expected to boost output in coming 
years once they are properly up and running. In the meantime, 
supply chain adjustments and the exact pace of the changeover 
of aircraft and engine platforms make this a difficult market to 
forecast.
Revenues in oil & gas were substantially lower again in 2016, falling 
by more than 40%
1
 at constant exchange rates as a result of the 
knock-on impact from the fall in crude oil prices noted above. The 
Specialist Technologies of HIP Product Fabrication and Surface 
Technology were both affected as the commercial rationale for oil 
field projects remained difficult at current crude oil prices. While 
crude oil prices closed 2016 at their highest levels in over two 
years, they remain at less than half the prices seen through most of 
2011 to 2014. It is too early to tell whether investment will pick up in 
the oil & gas sector in the near term.
Automotive revenues increased year on year by 2%
1
 at constant 
exchange rates (13%
1
 at actual exchange rates), reflecting a strong 
performance in car and light truck, particularly in the second half. 
This was most notable in businesses served by our Western 
European plants, which benefited from the buoyant global market, 
as well as new contract wins. Car and light truck revenue growth of 
3%
1
 in the first half accelerated to 6%
1
 in the second half. Heavy 
truck revenues, on the other hand, were weak, reflecting softness 
in the heavy truck market more generally.
Bodycote also provides services for a wide range of capital 
equipment customers in our General Industrial markets. In 2016, 
these customers suffered from the knock-on effect of lower 
demand from the oil & gas and other resources sectors. As a result, 
General Industrial revenues fell by 3%
1
 at constant exchange rates 
(8%
1
 increase at actual exchange rates).

Within the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) business, our 
customers think and operate globally and increasingly expect 
Bodycote to service them in the same way. Consequently, the 
ADE business is organised globally. This gives Bodycote a notable 
advantage as the only thermal processing company with a global 
footprint and an understanding of operating in all of the world’s 
key manufacturing areas. A number of Bodycote’s multinational 
customers fall within the compass of ADE and Bodycote intends 
to continue to leverage its unique market position to increase 
revenues in these market sectors. The business incorporates the 
Group’s activities in hot isostatic pressing and surface technology 
as well as the relevant heat treatment services, encompassing 63 
facilities in total.
Results
Revenues for the ADE business were £250.9m in 2016 compared 
to £243.5m in 2015, an increase of 3.0% (6.7% decrease at 
constant exchange rates). Sales declined in the business’ key 
geographies, with the weakness in the oil & gas market hitting both 
Western Europe and North America. On the positive side, Western 
Europe enjoyed strong aerospace sales in France throughout the 
year, as well as in the UK in the second half, and the IGT and power 
generation businesses also registered growth. North America had a 
tough year all round with lower aerospace revenues as the business 
jet market suffered and there was some Original Equipment 
Manufacturer (OEM) supply chain realignment.
Headline operating profit
1
 for ADE was £55.6m (2015: £59.2m) and 
headline operating profit margin reduced from 24.3% to 22.2%, 
once again demonstrating good cost control in the face of reduced 
sales. 
Net capital expenditure in 2016 was £19.9m (2015: £17 .4m) which 
represents 1 .0 times depreciation (2015: 0.9 times). The Group 
continued to invest in additional capacity, with investments in new 
facilities in Poland, France and the USA, as well as the relocation of 
a US facility. We will continue to add further capacity as we identify 
market opportunities and to support anticipated growth in the 
Group’s Specialist Technologies and other high-value offerings. 
Return on capital employed in 2016 was 19.7% (2015: 23.0%), 
reflecting the drop in ADE profitability noted above.
Achievements in 2016
The ADE business made further progress during the year as 
it continued to ramp up support for the new and growing civil 
aerospace programmes. The new facilities will ramp up in 2017 , 
contributing to Group revenue. They will inevitably experience the 
normal start-up losses but will contribute to Group profitability 
beyond 2017 .
Organisation and people
Total full-time equivalent headcount at 31 December 2016 was 
1,706 (2015: 1,785), a decrease of 4.4% compared to the revenue 
decline in ADE of 6.7% (at constant exchange rates).
Looking ahead
We expect to see continued modest growth in our civil aerospace 
business and, depending on the actions of the new USA 
administration, we may see some pick up in our defence business. 
We anticipate no near-term improvement in the oil & gas sector 
and are likely to see continued negative year-on-year development 
as the business enters 2017 at a weaker level than a year ago. 
However, Bodycote believes it is well placed to respond to any 
developments in its markets and capitalise on its world-leading 
position in the aerospace, defence and energy markets.

Diesel engine pistons
During the diesel engine cycle, combustion gases push the pistons downward 
generating power on the working stroke. Heat treatment gives the finished piston 
and its pin the ability to withstand high temperatures and extended runs, delivering 
high performance over sustained periods. Depending on the specific piston 
component, they undergo casehardening, induction hardening, tempering, stress 
relieving and nitriding.

Whilst the Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) marketplace 
has many multinational customers, which tend to operate on a 
regionally-focused basis, it also has numerous medium-sized and 
smaller businesses, all of whom are very important to Bodycote. 
Generally, there are more competitors to Bodycote in AGI and 
much of the business is locally oriented, meaning that proximity 
to the customer is very important. Bodycote’s extensive network 
of 126 AGI facilities enables the business to offer the widest range 
of technical capability and security of supply, while continuing to 
increase the proportion of technically differentiated services that it 
offers. Bodycote has a long and successful history of serving this 
wide-ranging customer base.
Results
AGI business revenues were £349.7m in 2016, compared to 
£323.7m in 2015, an increase of 8.0% (3.2% decrease at constant 
exchange rates).
AGI revenues saw a small benefit from the acquisitions made 
towards the end of the year. However, this was more than offset 
by the impact of plant closures from 2015. As a result, like-for-like 
AGI sales were down a modest 1 .8% for the full year, with the 
second half revenues virtually flat against the same period in 2015. 
Weakness in the General Industrial business was more pronounced 
in North America than in Western Europe, but emerging markets 
registered good growth. While some OEM destocking held our 
business back in North America, car and light truck revenues were 
strong in Western Europe, with solid growth in the key French and 
German markets, as we won business building on the strengths 
of our Specialist Technologies. Strong car and light truck revenue 
growth was recorded in emerging markets, as the Group benefited 
from its investments in these markets. The depressed bus and 
heavy trucks market negatively impacted sales in the USA and 
Sweden. 
Headline operating profit
1
 in AGI was £58.5m compared to £53.4m 
in 2015. Headline operating margin increased to 16.7% (2015: 
16.5%), reflecting a further improvement in mix towards higher-
value work, along with strong cost control. Revenues from the 
Group’s Specialist Technologies grew well at high margins.
Net capital expenditure in 2016 was £37 .4m (2015: £39.8m), which 
represents 1 .1 times depreciation (2015: 1 .3 times). This included 
further investments in China, Mexico, Czech Republic and Turkey. 
The Group also completed the acquisition of five plants for total 
consideration of £30.2m as part of its bolt-on acquisition strategy, 
adding sites in Germany, the USA and Canada. 
Return on capital employed in 2016 decreased to 15.2% (2015: 
16.0%), reflecting the lower profitability as a result of lower sales. 
It is worth noting that the acquisitions have impacted the average 
opening and closing capital employed figures significantly more 
than they have contributed in terms of profitability, given that they 
all completed towards the end of the year. Excluding acquisitions, 
return on capital employed would have been 15.5%.
Achievements in 2016
AGI has clearly had to contend with weak General Industrial 
demand across all of its territories. Nonetheless, the continued 
development of our emerging markets businesses in China, 
Mexico, Czech Republic and Poland has been pleasing. We continue 
to win good high-margin business, and our AGI focused Specialist 
Technologies of S

P , Low Pressure Carburising and Corr-I-Dur
®
 all 
continue to be a key driver of the improved profitability in the AGI 
business.
Organisation and people
At 31 December 2016, the number of full-time equivalent employees 
in AGI was 3,502 (including 188 from acquired businesses) compared 
to 3,331 at the end of 2015 and its peak of 5,244 in July 2008.
Looking ahead
The decline in the General Industrial business has undoubtedly 
been largely driven by the knock-on impact on capital equipment 
demand from lower activity in the oil & gas and other resources 
sectors. We do not foresee further significant declines in these 
markets. As far as the Automotive business is concerned, any 
policy changes by the new USA administration towards the existing 
USA fuel efficiency targets (and on international trade agreements 
more generally) could have an impact on our business but the likely 
outcome is unpredictable at this stage.
The multinational nature of Bodycote’s AGI businesses puts us in 
a great position to take advantage of market developments. In the 
meantime, we will continue to build on the success of enhancing 
margins through capturing high-value work. The focus on improving 
customer service helps drive this effort while the prioritisation of 
existing capacity in favour of higher-value work and investing in 
Specialist Technologies provides additional momentum. In addition 
the Group will continue with its strategy of adding to its existing 
footprint in the rapid-growth countries when the right opportunities 
at the right price present.

Profit for the year 67 .0 56.2
Group revenue was £600.6m, an increase of 5.9%, with revenues 
at constant exchange rates down 4.7% and foreign exchange rate 
movements having a positive impact of 10.6%.
Headline operating profit for the year decreased by 2.4% from 
£102.1m to £99.6m, and headline operating margin was 16.6% 
(2015: 18.0%). Headline operating profit at constant exchange rates 
decreased by £13.7m, whilst favourable foreign exchange rate 
movements increased headline operating profit by £11 .2m. The drop 
in headline operating profit as a proportion of the drop in revenue, 
both at constant exchange rates, was 51%. Given that most of the 
Group’s costs are fixed in the very short term, this creditable result 
is testament to the Group’s dedication to act quickly to adjust the 
cost base when weaker demand is experienced.
The amortisation of acquired intangible assets arises from 
acquisitions in the current and prior years. The charge has increased 
to £4.5m (2015: £4.2m). 
Operating profit was £94.5m (2015: £77 .9m) after charging £4.5m 
(2015: £4.2m) in respect of the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets, £0.6m (2015: £nil) of acquisition costs and reorganisation 
costs of £nil (2015: £20.0m).
Headline operating cash flow
1
 for the Group was £91 .4m (2015: 
£81 .6m). This was 92% of headline operating profit (2015: 80%), 
reflecting improved working capital flows compared with last year. 
Net working capital in the year benefited from higher than average 
inventory levels present at the end of 2015 decreasing to more 
normal levels. The increase in receivables was driven by increased 
activity in the final quarter of 2016. Net capital expenditure was 1 .1 
times depreciation (2015: 1 .2 times). It is worth noting that only half 
of this capital expenditure was expended to maintain the Group’s 
existing business. The other half was expended to help grow the 
business in the future, most notably in greenfield facilities and 
in expanding capacity in our high-margin Specialist Technologies 
businesses.
After deducting interest and tax, the Group recorded positive free 
cash flow
1
 of £60.5m (2015: £47 .4m).
Exceptional costs
Total exceptional costs charged to the income statement amounted 
to £0.6m (2015: £20.0m) and related to acquisition costs. In 2015 
reorganisation costs amounting to £23.8m were incurred, offset by 
a profit on disposal of the Group’s Brazilian and Indian operations of 
£3.8m.
Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2016 totalled 
£13.3m (2015: £14.7m), of which £9.7m is expected to be spent 
in 2017 . All expenditure anticipated after the end of 2017 relates to 
ongoing environmental remediation, primarily in the USA.

Profit before taxation
Headline profit before taxation was £97 .0m (2015: £99.2m). Profit

T axation
The taxation charge was £24.9m for the year (2015: £18.8m).
The headline taxation rate for 2016 was 27 .5% (2015: 24.4%), being 
stated before accounting for exceptional items and amortisation 
of goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets. The rate in 2015 
benefited from the recognition of some brought forward tax losses. 
A number of the Group’s key markets have rates of corporation 
tax above the Group average. Future profitability growth in these 
markets, therefore, is likely to place some upward pressure on the 
Group’s blended corporation tax rate.
Earnings per share 
Basic headline earnings per share (as defined in note 10) decreased 
to 37 .0p from 39.5p. Basic earnings per share for the year increased 
to 35.2p from 29.6p, with the prior year significantly impacted by 
reorganisation costs.
Dividend and dividend policy
The Group aims to pay ordinary dividends so that dividend cover 
will be at or above 2.0 times earnings (see note 10). The Board 
may also recommend payment of a supplemental distribution to 
shareholders. The amount of any supplemental distribution will 
be assessed in light of the cash position of the Group, along with 
funding requirements for both organic growth and acquisitions.
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 10.8p per 
share (2015:10.3p) bringing the total ordinary dividend to 15.8p per 
share (2015: 15.1p). If approved by shareholders, the final ordinary 
dividend of 10.8p per share will be paid on 2 June 2017 to all 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on  
21 April 2017 .

Net assets as at  
31 December 2015 805.5 (255.9) 549.6
Net assets increased by £78.7m (14.3%) to £628.3m (2015: 
£549.6m), mainly as a result of the positive translation impact 
following the significant depreciation in the value of sterling after 
the UK’s EU referendum. At constant exchange rates, net assets 
decreased by £22.5m (4.1%). 
Net cash
Group net cash at 31 December 2016 was £1 .1m (2015: £12.3m). 
The Group continues to have access to committed facilities at 
competitive rates and therefore currently deems this to be the 
most effective means of funding.

Chief Financial Officer’s report continued
Cash flow
The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was £6.5m (2015: 
£23.6m), made up of net cash from operating activities of £125.9m 
(2015: £111 .3m), less investing activities of £84.6m (2015: £59.9m) 
and less cash used in financing activities of £47 .8m (2015: £75.0m).
The increase in net cash flow from operating activities from 
£111 .3m to £125.9m was driven primarily by the increase in 
EBITDA
1
 from £134.9m to £155.2m. 
Net cash outflows from investing activities increased from £59.9m 
to £84.6m, primarily as a result of the acquisition of various 
businesses in the year. The level of net capital expenditure in 2016 
was £63.1m (2015: £61 .3m), consistent with plans to increase the 
Group’s capacity in its Specialist Technologies and high-growth 
markets.
Net cash outflows used in financing activities decreased from 
£75.0m to £47 .8m, primarily due to the decrease in dividend 
payments from £66.0m in 2015 to £48.1m in 2016.
Receivable days at 31 December 2016 increased by one day to  
63 days (2015: 62 days).
Net interest payments for the year were £2.3m (2015: £2.6m). Tax 
payments were £20.4m (2015: £23.2m).
Capital expenditure
Net capital expenditure (capital expenditure less proceeds from 
asset disposals) for the year was £63.1m (2015: £61 .3m). The 
multiple of net capital expenditure to depreciation was 1 .1 times 
(2015: 1 .2 times). The Group continues to invest in maintaining its 
assets to a high quality, as well as investing in the implementation 
of a new ERP system. Crucially, almost half of the Group’s capital 
expenditure was expended to help grow the business in the future, 
most notably in greenfield facilities and in expanding capacity in our 
high-margin Specialist Technologies businesses. As a consequence 
of the timing of these key projects, the value of assets under 
construction has increased by £16.9m, from £51 .6m in 2015 to 
£68.5m in 2016.
Borrowing facilities
The Group is financed by a mix of cash flows from operations, 
short-term borrowings, long-term loans and finance leases. The 
Group’s funding policy aims to ensure continuity of finance at 
reasonable cost, based on committed and uncommitted facilities 
and loans from several sources over a spread of maturities. 
The Group continues to have access to committed facilities at 
competitive rates and therefore currently deems this to be the 
most effective means of long-term funding.
The total undrawn committed facility funding available to the 
Group at 31 December 2016 was £225.0m (2015: £230.0m). At 
31 December 2016, the Group had the following drawings and 
headroom under the committed facility:

Revolving Credit 3 July 2019 230.0 5.0 225.0
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group 
will be able to continue as going concerns, while maximising the 
return to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The capital structure is reviewed regularly by the Board. The Group’s 
policy is to maintain gearing, determined as the proportion of net 
debt to total capital, within defined parameters, allowing movement 
in the capital structure appropriate to the business cycle and 
corporate activity. Due to the net cash position at 31 December 
2016 the gearing ratio is 0% (2015: 0%).
Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group has defined benefit pension obligations in the UK, 
Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the USA and cash lump 
sum obligations in France, Italy and Turkey, the liabilities for which 
are reflected in the Group balance sheet.
The net deficits in these arrangements are as follows:
2016
£m
2015 
£m
Funded:
UK 3.6 2.7
Other Western Europe 1.9 2.0
North America 0.4 0.5

Unfunded:
Western Europe 15.5 12.6
Emerging markets 0.1 0.1
15.6 12.7
T otal deficit 21.5 17.9
The UK plan is closed to new entrants but the 45 active members 
continue to accrue benefits. The arrangements in France, Italy and 
Turkey are open to new members. All other arrangements are 
closed to new entrants.
UK scheme liabilities have increased by £26.7m to £126.6m (2015: 
£99.9m). This is largely due to a change in the actuarial assumptions 
used to assess the present value of the liabilities. Most notably, 
the discount rate assumption has decreased from 3.5% in 2015 to 
2.3% in 2016, which has resulted in an increase in the liabilities. UK 
scheme assets increased in the year by £21 .6m to £123.0m (2015: 
£101 .4m). 
The deficit for the other European schemes increased by £2.8m, 
mainly due to a decrease in the discount rate assumptions.
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events that require disclosure in 
the financial statements.
1. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation, impairment of fixed assets and other assets, profit or loss on 
disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit on sale of businesses and 
share-based payments.

Alternative performance measures
Bodycote uses alternative performance measures such as headline 
operating profit, headline earnings per share, headline profit before 
taxation, headline operating cash flow and free cash flow, together 
with current measures restated at constant exchange rates, 
to allow the users of the financial statements to gain a clearer 
understanding of the underlying performance of the business, 
allowing the impact of restructuring and reorganisation activities 
and acquisition costs to be identified separately.
Going concern
In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report and 
the Group’s viability statement made on page 27 , the directors 
have considered the Group’s business activities, together with the 
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position. This includes an overview of the Group’s financial position, 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a 
combination of cash resources, committed and uncommitted 
facilities and overdrafts. The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities 
are repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due 
for renewal as set out below. There is sufficient headroom in the 
committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities can be 
operated as contracted for the foreseeable future.
The committed facilities as at 31 December 2016 were as follows:
■ ■ £230m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 3 July 2019
The December 2016 weighted average life of the committed 
facilities was 2.5 years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable 
potential changes in trading performance, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its current committed 
facilities.
The directors have reviewed forecasts and projections for the 
Group’s markets and services, assessing the committed facility and 
financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Group’s ability 
to access further funding. The directors also reviewed downside 
sensitivity analysis over the forecast period, thereby taking into 
account the uncertainties arising from the current economic 
environment. Following this review, the directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and the review of financial risk has been delegated to the Audit Committee. 
The Group’s risk framework was last reviewed by the Board in 2015 when it was updated to ensure it continues to meet UK Corporate 
Governance requirements. Under the leadership of the Group Head of Risk, Bodycote’s risk management framework is used to identify, 
report and manage its business critical risks. The Group Head of Risk is supported by the Risk and SHE Committee, attended by senior 
managers from each of the operating divisions, which met three times during 2016. The Risk and SHE Committee assists the Group 
Head of Risk in identifying critical risks, embedding risk management and facilitating the implementation of risk management measures 
throughout the Group. 
A variety of approaches is used to identify and report risks, which are aggregated first at a divisional level and then at Group level. For each 
business critical risk, assurance activities have been documented in risk assurance maps and these are used to direct assurance activity. 
The Group Head of Risk provides an update to the Audit Committee on the Group’s risk activities at every meeting and a comprehensive 
review of the Group’s business critical risks is presented to the Board in December. The Board concluded that a robust assessment of the 
Group’s principal risks had been undertaken.
The table below highlights the major risks that may affect Bodycote’s ability to deliver the strategy, as laid out on page 7 . These risks have 
been reviewed throughout the year and they have not materially changed since 2015. Details of the Group’s financial risks (funding, foreign 
exchange, interest rate and counterparty risks), which are managed by the Group’s treasury function, are provided in note 19 to the financial 
statements. The mitigating activities described below will help to reduce the impact or likelihood of the major risk occurring, although the 
Board recognises that it will not be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. The Board recognises that there could be risks that may be 
unknown or that may be judged to be insignificant at present but may later prove to be significant. For this reason business continuity plans 
have been prepared for all plants to provide for situations where specific risks have the potential to severely impact the business.
In determining the principal risks, the Board has considered the result of the referendum on the future of the UK’s membership in the 
European Union. While this result increases the level of market uncertainty, it is not expected to have a material impact on Bodycote as 
customers are served locally and cross-border trading is minimal. This risk is therefore included as an element of the existing market risk.
In September 2016, a fire occurred at the Huntington Park facility in California. Bodycote personnel responded safely and quickly to ensure 
continuity of service for customers. The Group’s business continuity framework, utilising the local plant network, provided an interim back-
up capability and this significantly mitigated the impact of this event and prevented a major disruption. The facility was operational again one 
month after the event.

Market and customer risks
Markets
Bodycote operates in 23 countries 
and a substantial amount of sales are 
closely linked to the economic cycle 
and the general macro-economic 
environment. The result of the 
referendum on the future of the UK’s 
membership in the European Union 
is not expected to have a material 
transactional impact as customers are 
typically served locally and cross-
border trading is minimal.
The high proportion of short-term 
fixed costs in the business means 
that a drop in sales will have a 
significant impact on profitability. 
Sales in the markets served by the 
AGI businesses (66% of the total 
Group) tend to develop in line with 
or ahead of the economic cycle, 
whereas aerospace and defence 
sales (25%) tend to track behind the 
economic cycle. Sales to the energy 
sectors (9%) are closely linked to 
energy prices, which in turn can be 
affected by general economic activity. 
■ ■ Bodycote’s presence in 23 
countries across a wide variety 
of end-markets acts as a natural 
hedge to neutralise localised 
economic volatility.
■ ■ There is some short-term flexibility 
in the cost base e.g. by ensuring 
that a proportion of the workforce 
is employed on temporary 
contracts.
■ ■ Changes in customer demand on 
a local or a Group-wide level are 
responded to quickly.
Loss of key customers
Bodycote benefits from many 
long-term relationships with key 
customers and the damage to, or loss 
of, any of these relationships would 
be detrimental to the Group.
The loss of a key customer could 
adversely affect the Group’s financial 
results and the viability of one or 
more of Bodycote’s facilities.
■ ■ There is no significant customer 
dependency, with the Group’s top 
ten customers accounting for less 
than 16% of sales and the balance 
made up by many thousands of 
customers.
■ ■ There is a continued focus 
on customer service and 
quality processes to maintain 
excellent relationships with 
major customers. Key account 
management is in place 
and customer satisfaction is 
monitored.

Corporate and community risks
Safety and health
The nature of Bodycote’s activities 
presents safety and health risks.
Bodycote is committed to providing 
a safe work environment for its 
employees but Bodycote’s operations, 
if not properly managed, could have 
a significant impact on individual 
employees. Furthermore, poor 
safety and health practices could 
lead to disruption of business, 
financial penalties and loss of 
reputation. 
■ ■ Group-wide health and safety 
policies set by the Group Chief 
Executive.
■ ■ OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001

systems being used by Group 
Head of Safety, Health and 
Environment with support of 
divisional safety, health and 
environmental teams.
■ ■ Programme in place to focus on 
reduction of incidents which could 
have a high impact.
■ ■ Safety compliance audits at all 
plants at least every two years.
■ ■ Oversight of safety and health 
framework provided by the Group 
Risk and SHE Committee.
Operational risks 
Service quality
The Bodycote brand is reliant on the 
repeatable delivery of parts to agreed 
specification to an agreed time.
Deterioration in quality or service 
levels can cause serious long-term 
damage to Bodycote’s reputation 
with financial consequences such as 
the loss of a customer and the cost 
of damages or litigation. Work that 
is released into use which is not in 
compliance with specification could 
arise as a result of system or human 
failure.
■ ■ Bodycote has stringent quality 
systems in place managed by 
qualified staff.
■ ■ Quality systems and processes 
operated at plant level with 
oversight by divisional quality 
teams.
■ ■ Where necessary, plants maintain 
industry relevant accreditations, 
such as ISO 9001, Nadcap and TS 
16949.
■ ■ All plants subjected to internal 
and external quality audits and 
inspections at least once a year.

Major disruption at a facility
Bodycote’s business processes 
are inherently risky and there is a 
possibility that a major fire such 
as that suffered in 2016 at the 
Huntington Park facility (USA) or 
utility outage could lead to closure 
of a facility’s operation. In addition, 
a number of sites are exposed to 
natural hazards, such as earthquakes, 
flooding and storms.
Any significant incident at a site 
could result in the service to 
Bodycote’s customers from the 
affected site being disrupted. 
■ ■ As demonstrated with the fire 
at Huntington Park, disruption 
was substantially mitigated by 
Bodycote’s global network of 189 
facilities. These facilities create 
a framework to provide back-up 
capability for affected facilities.
■ ■ Business continuity plans are 
in place for all plants. These are 
updated and tested annually.
■ ■ Independent insurer inspections 
to assess hazard and business 
interruption risks.
■ ■ Insurance cover, including 
business interruption cover.
■ ■ Scheduled equipment 
maintenance and inspections.
Information technology projects
The efficient operation of the Group 
relies on the proper development and 
operation of its IT systems. Bodycote 
is currently undergoing a Group-
wide implementation of a new ERP 
system.
Failure to manage the 
implementation of the ERP 
programme successfully could result 
in cost overruns and, potentially, 
disruption to the business.

Viability statement
In preparing this statement of viability, the directors have considered the prospects of the Group over the three-year period immediately 
following the 2016 financial year. This longer-term assessment process supports the Board’s statements on both viability, as set out below, 
and going concern (on page 23). A three-year period was determined as the most appropriate as it is the period covered by the Group’s 
annual strategic planning process, which sets the long-term direction of the Group and is reviewed at least annually by the directors. The 
Board concluded that a period of longer than three years would not be meaningful for the purpose of concluding on longer-term viability, 
given the limited forward visibility of the Group.
The strategic plan considers metrics which enable assessment of the Group’s key performance indicators (including return on capital 
employed, headline earnings per share and headline operating cash flow) in addition to net debt, liquidity and financing requirements.
In conducting the review of the Group’s prospects the directors assessed the three-year plan alongside the Group’s current position, the 
Group’s strategy and the principal risks facing the Group (all of which are detailed in the Strategic report on pages 6 to 26). This assessment 
considered the impact of the principal risks on the business model and on future performance, liquidity and solvency and was mindful 
of the limited forward visibility that the Group has as it carries a minimal order backlog. The directors’ viability assessment included a 
review of the sensitivity analysis performed on the three-year plan, whereby the principal risks, and particularly those related to markets 
and customers (see page 24), were applied to the plan in a number of diverging scenarios. The developed scenarios were designed to be 
plausible, yet severe.
In making this viability statement the directors considered the mitigating actions that would be taken by the Group in the event that the 
principal risks of the Company become realised. The directors also took into consideration the Group’s financial position at 31 December 
2016, with net cash of £1 .1m, available committed facility headroom of £225.0m and a history of strong cash generation.
The directors have assessed the viability of the Group and, based on the procedures outlined above in addition to activities undertaken 
by the Board in its normal course of business, confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2019.

Our approach
Bodycote’s objective is to create superior shareholder returns 
through the provision of selected thermal processing services that 
are highly valued by our customers. We aim to achieve this in a safe 
working environment, while continually seeking to minimise the 
impact on the environment.
Bodycote is dedicated to improving the management of corporate 
responsibility issues and is implementing policies and initiatives to 
achieve this goal. The future success and growth of the Group is 
intrinsically linked to our ability to ensure the Group’s operations are 
sustainable and that we can nurture and develop our talent.
Our people
The strength of the Group primarily rests in its people and one 
of the key challenges for management is to ensure availability of 
appropriately qualified people to support its continued growth. 
Bodycote is fortunate to have a competent and committed 
international team that is well-respected in technical and business 
circles. 
Bodycote invests in the training and development of its people both 
at local and Group level. At a local level the Group is committed 
to providing the appropriate skills and technical training which will 
allow its employees to operate effectively and safely in their roles 
and deliver excellent customer service. At Group level a number 
of initiatives are currently being rolled out to drive excellence in 
management.
A tool to develop further understanding and skill in the area of 
performance management is in place and is being used globally 
through the management population. Through communication of 
clear messages coupled with skills development, the organisation 
aims to raise the capability of its management population in 
driving performance. This initiative is backed by a performance 
management system which supports the process.
Bodycote’s employment policies are non-discriminatory, complying 
with all current legislation to engender equal opportunity 
irrespective of age, race, gender, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, 
health, disability, marital status, sexual preference, political or 
philosophical opinions or trade union membership. Harassment is 
not tolerated.
Female representation on our Board is currently 17% (2015: 17%) 
and at manager level it is 25% (2015: 24%). Females represent 
18% (2015: 18%) of our total workforce. We will increase female 
representation on the Board if appropriate candidates are available 
when Board vacancies arise.

Core V alues 
It is not just important what we do but how we do it and how 
we behave in our Company. How we operate as a Group and the 
behaviours that we expect from all our employees are expressed in 
our Core Values. Our values represent Bodycote and its people and 
our commitment to the Company and the business.
Our Core Values are straightforward and are as follows:
Honesty and T ransparency
We are honest and act with integrity. Trust stems from honesty 
and trust is at the heart of everything we engage in: our customers 
trust us to deliver what we say we will, our colleagues trust us 
to act in their best interests and our suppliers trust us to conduct 
business according to agreed terms. This is not something we take 
for granted. Bodycote lives by a culture of honest and transparent 
behaviour, which is at the core of all our business relationships.
Respect and Responsibility
We manage our business with respect, applying an ethical 
approach to our dealings with those with whom we interact. We 
respect our colleagues, who are all of the employees of Bodycote. 
Part of our respect for our colleagues is our commitment to 
safe and responsible behaviour and our fundamental belief that 
no-one should come to any harm at work. We show respect for 
our customers, our suppliers and our competitors. We respect 
the communities around us and behave as responsible corporate 
citizens by being compliant with the laws and regulations of the 
countries in which we do business and by ensuring that our effect 
on the environment is minimal. We believe in taking ownership for, 
and being mindful of the impact of, our actions.
Creating V alue
Creating value is the very essence of our business and needs to be 
the focus of our endeavours. We create value for our customers, 
our employees and our shareholders. The realities are harsh. If we 
do not create value for our customers then we have no reason for 
existence. If we do not create value for our employees there will 
be no-one to create value for our customers. Our shareholders 
rightfully require that we ultimately create value for them as they 
are the owners of the business.
Human rights
Bodycote’s human rights policy is consistent with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact’s ten 
principles.
We prohibit forced, compulsory and underage labour and any 
form of discrimination based on age, race, gender, ethnic origin, 
nationality, religion, health, disability, marital status, sexual 
preference, political or philosophical opinions or trade union 
membership. Appropriate mechanisms are in place to minimise the 
potential for any contravention of these rules.
By publicly posting our human rights policy on www.bodycote.com, 
stakeholders worldwide can alert us to potential breaches of the 
policy. Our internal systems also support compliance with our policy 
and we have a robust Open Door Line for employees to report 
alleged violations of law and/or our policies on a confidential basis 
and in their own language. In the jurisdictions in which we employ a 
majority of our employees, there are laws applicable to many of the 
areas dealt with in our human rights policy.
The Modern Slavery Act
Bodycote has conducted a risk assessment on our supply 
chain using the UK Government’s published guidance entitled 
“Transparency in Supply Chains” . Suppliers, in those countries 
identified in Walk Free Foundation’s 2016 Global Slavery Index as 
being the most vulnerable to human rights issues in the supply 
chain, have been identified for further review and audit. Such 
suppliers are mainly based in Turkey, Poland, Romania, Czech 
Republic, UAE and China.
We have a Code of Conduct which sets out our policy on 
compliance with legislation, child labour, anti-slavery and human 
trafficking, and conditions of employment, health and safety and the 
environment.
The Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking statement was approved by 
our Board of Directors in September 2016 and was published on our 
website. The statement will be reviewed on an annual basis.
Customers and suppliers
Bodycote has no significant suppliers who are wholly dependent 
upon the Group’s business and has no significant suppliers on 
which the Group is dependent upon for a substantial part of its 
business. Suppliers are paid in line with contractual and legal 
obligations.
We endeavour to respond quickly to changing customer demand, 
to identify emerging needs and to improve service availability and 
quality. We stay close to our current and potential customers, 
building long-term relationships.
Community
Bodycote seeks to play a positive role in the local communities 
in which it operates by providing employment opportunities, 
and building goodwill and a reputation as a good neighbour and 
employer.
Responsible business ethics
All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical 
standard, consistent with an international UK-listed company. 
Directors and employees are expected to ensure that their personal 
interests do not at any time conflict with those of Bodycote. 
Shareholder employees are advised of, and comply with, the share 
dealing code.
Bodycote has systems in place that are designed to ensure 
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and conformity 
with all relevant codes of business practice. Furthermore, Bodycote 
does not make political donations.
With regard to competition, Bodycote aims to win business in a 
differentiated high-value manner. The Group does not employ unfair 
trading methods and it competes vigorously but fairly within the 
requirements of applicable laws. Employees are prohibited from 
either giving or receiving any inducements.
Our Open Door Policy has been translated into all languages used 
throughout the Group. The policy allows employees to report their 
concern confidentially, verbally or in writing, to an independent 
third party provider, ensuring anonymity. Reports are transcribed 
and sent to the Group Head of Risk, who then determines the 
appropriate steps for the matter to be addressed.
Online training courses in respect of Anti-Bribery and Competition 
Law have been designed and translated into the major languages 
used throughout the Group. All relevant employees have completed 
the interactive courses.

Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
Operational SHE performance
Bodycote is committed to continual improvement in our safety, 
health and environmental performance (SHE). We are committed to 
complying with all local legislative requirements as a minimum and 
establishing consistent and robust best practices at all of our sites 
to deliver consistently high performance across all aspects of SHE 
management.
Safety and health
The nature of the Group’s operations is such that employees are 
inevitably exposed to hazards in the workplace. Bodycote aims to 
manage these hazards and thereby minimise risks to employees 
through the deployment of robust safety control systems and 
procedures, and seeks to establish these at all sites. 
Bodycote’s online incident reporting and SHE management tool 
has been operational since 2013. This has enabled more consistent 
and thorough reporting of workplace injuries, near misses and 
unsafe conditions. Following the implementation, there was an 
increase in the lost time injury rate frequency (LTI rate) in 2013 as 
sites were better able to record and report incidents. In 2016, the 
LTI rate increased from 1 .4 to 1 .5. Note that the LTI rate was stated 
as 1 .5 in the 2015 Annual Report. Due to a correction in the hours 
worked for one region, the 2015 LTI has been recalculated as 1 .4. 
Given the effort and resource put into improving safety in 2016, the 
increase of 0.1 is disappointing although, on a positive note, the 
number of serious or high potential incidents declined by 11 .5%. 
Accidents, though regrettable and unacceptable, represent learning 
opportunities. This is the reason that accurate reporting is an 
essential part of building a robust safety management system.
Accident frequency (lost time injury rate)  
Accident frequency is defined as the number of lost time accidents 
x 200,000 hours (approximately 100 man years), divided by the total 
number of employee hours worked.
In addition to encouraging the reporting of work related injuries, 
Bodycote has sought to encourage the reporting of near misses 
and unsafe conditions. This has worked well since the introduction 
of the new global incident reporting system in 2013 and a common 
near miss/unsafe condition reporting system at every operational 
site. This much improved reporting of incidents permits us to 
address hazards before injury occurs. As our database continues to 
develop we will be able to analyse and prioritise our safety action 
programmes more effectively.
All reportable incidents and lost time injuries are reviewed during 
executive management meetings and Board meetings. In addition, 
the executive management team reviews incidents which did not 
result in injury but were considered to have been serious or to 
have had a high potential impact. All serious incidents and high 
potential incidents are also reviewed by the Group SHE Committee 
and are cascaded within the business as appropriate to ensure that 
preventive actions are taken. This system was further strengthened 
in 2015 with actions being tracked via the online incident 
management system.
Environment
A proactive approach to improving energy efficiency means that 
Bodycote has implemented a variety of systems to reduce water 
and gas consumption, and to re-use heat energy. The ongoing effort 
to lessen the impact on the environment has resulted in Bodycote 
seeking ISO 14001 accreditation at all of its facilities. In addition, 
many of our sites are in the process of obtaining ISO 50001 Energy 
Management Systems Standard.
At every stage where Bodycote is involved in the manufacturing 
cycle, our operational aim is to reduce the overall impact on the 
environment, not just in our own operations, but also those of 
our customers. Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment, 
which is operated around the clock so as to optimise treatment 
processing cycles. Without Bodycote, many companies would be 
using older in-house technology and running their equipment at 
reduced capacity, both of which drain energy resources. Working 
with Bodycote enables our customers to commit more easily to 
carbon reduction initiatives.
Bodycote also reduces the carbon footprint of our customers’ 
activities by increasing the lifespan of their products, by improving 
metallurgical properties and by enhancing corrosion resistance. 
For example, surface treatment technology is widely used in the 
reclamation of damaged and worn components, offering a cost-
effective and energy-efficient alternative to the need to manufacture 
new replacement parts. The treated parts often last up to 20 times 
longer than the original.
Whilst thermal processing is an energy-intensive business, it is a 
vital part of the manufacturing supply chain and its use saves the 
energy it consumes many times over.

Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions resulting from fuel usage 
and the operation of facilities. Scope 2 emissions are indirect 
energy emissions resulting from purchased electricity, heat, steam 
or cooling for own use.
The financial control consolidation approach has been used to 
report the above data. This method aligns with the reporting 
scope in the financial statements. The Group collects electricity 
and natural gas usage information from each facility on a monthly 
basis. The Group then applies the UK Government’s Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published national 
carbon conversion factors to calculate the total tonnage of CO
2
e 
produced. Group operational management actively monitors their 
monthly CO
2
e emissions reported and the Group’s Executive 
Committee reviews the level of CO
2
e emissions on a monthly basis.
All entities and facilities under financial control are included within 
the disclosure. Emissions less than 1% of the Group’s total CO
2
e 
relating to fugitive emissions and owned vehicles are not significant 
and are excluded. As such there are no significant omissions from 
this disclosure.
ISO 14001 accredited facilities
Reducing the environmental impact of the Group’s activities is 
taken very seriously. Compliance with the requirements of ISO 
14001 helps to minimise the risk of adverse environmental effects 
at Bodycote’s sites. At the end of 2016, 89% of our operating 
facilities had achieved ISO 14001 accreditation (2015: 91%). The 
slight reduction is due to the closure of a number of existing 
certified sites and the acquisition and construction of new sites 
which have yet to attain ISO 14001 . Operational plants which  
have not yet received accreditation to the standard are working 
towards it.
Carbon footprint and water consumption 
The absolute energy usage decreased by 8.7%. At constant 
exchange rates, it decreased by 8.6%. 
The total CO
2
e emissions per £m sales in 2016 were 535.6 Te (2015: 
as previously reported 535.4 Te; normalised
†
 558.4 T e). 
The Group’s total CO
2
e emission data is based on Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions, as defined by the UK Government’s DEFRA, 
and data relating to this has been calculated to include country-
specific electricity conversion factors. In previous years this has 
been supplied by DEFRA directly. However, as of January 2017 
DEFRA no longer supplies these conversion factors for non-UK 
companies. This has now been sourced by the Group directly from 
the International Energy Agency (IEA). There are some significant 
differences in these conversion factors. As a result, all previous 
years have now been restated using IEA conversion factors to 
ensure that year-on-year comparisons are consistent.
On a normalised
†
 basis, water usage per £m sales increased by 
9.8%. On a non-normalised basis, water usage per £m showed a 
small decrease of 1 .4%.
In 2015 our EU-based operational sites reviewed their operations to  
ensure compliance with the Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU.  
This Directive is transposed into local legislation and requires 
sites to monitor their energy usage and assess energy reduction 
opportunities which are in addition to the ongoing energy saving 
activities on sites. One mechanism for ensuring compliance is 
for sites to become certified to ISO 50001 Energy Management 
Systems Standard. This enables sites to measure energy usage 
consistently and target the most effective ways of reducing 
energy usage. Our sites in France, Germany, Austria, Denmark and 
Netherlands are largely already certified and working on further 
energy management programmes.
Bodycote uses established systems to develop best practice 
at specific sites and across the wider Group. Examples of 2016 
projects undertaken across Bodycote sites are discussed below.
In France, an engineering project group was established to 
determine energy and water saving opportunities from water 
cooling systems. Data was compared across all French sites and 
trials were undertaken at two sites – Beaugency and Billy Berclau 
– using the latest generation of closed loop water cooling systems. 
Beaugency and Billy Berclau both achieved a reduction in electricity 
consumption of 32% and 48% respectively, as well as a reduction 
in water usage by 58% and 68% respectively.
In Germany, the Essen site introduced a similar technology and a 
process gas optimisation project has identified a CO
2
e saving of an 
impressive 308 Te CO
2
e. Other energy saving projects in Germany 
include an investment in a heat recovery system at Ludenscheid, 
which saved 43.6 Te CO
2
e.
At the Coventry site, a project to install vacuum pumps reduced 
annual CO
2
e by 39.7 Te. Similarly, replacement compressors at 
the Kitchener plant in Canada achieved an estimated 21 Te CO
2
e 
reduction. 
Since 2013 Bodycote has submitted data on CO
2
e usage to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project, one of the leading carbon reporting 
and verification bodies. Each year the Company has improved its 
standing in the league tables and is now a “C” relative to general 
business groups and is rated significantly higher on verification  
of data.
Chlorinated solvent use
The use of chlorinated solvents in Bodycote’s thermal processing 
activities has been reduced in recent years as aqueous degreasing 
facilities have been introduced. In 2016, the normalised† solvent use 
showed a slight decrease of 0.3% compared with the previous year.
Cautionary statement
The Strategic report has been prepared solely to provide

DRILL BITS
Erosion in drill bits presents a serious challenge in mining 
when productivity is crucial. Rotary blasthole drills operate in 
variable ground formations. Bodycote’s carburising treatment 
increases the wear resistance of the drill bit parts, thus 
extending product life and operating efficiencies.

BODYCOTE COMPONENT JOURNEYS
This is just one example of how Bodycote brings together the 
huge wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the Group 
to provide the vital engineering services our customers need.
For more component journeys visit www.bodycote.com
The drill bit components 
begin life as casehardening 
steel forgings.
The bit legs and rollers 
are machined to achieve 
the design required for 
best performance through 
difficult terrain.  
  A 3D printed insert is applied as 
masking to ensure that only the 
unpainted areas will be treated 
in the carburising process.
  Carburising increases the 
surface hardness, or wear 
resistance, in the drill bit.  
Oil quench immediately 
follows.
  The parts undergo 
painting operation to 
prevent hardening the 
sections which require 
better ductility.
  Before returning the parts, 
Bodycote inspects and 
performs quality checks 
for hardness.

Corporate governance statement
Chairman’s message
Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to introduce the Group’s corporate governance report on behalf of our Board of Directors. The Corporate governance 
statement provides an insight into how the Board operated during the year and the key issues considered. We are committed to conducting 
business responsibly whilst maintaining high standards of corporate governance to enhance performance underpinned by our business 
model. Our approach to governance is set by the Board and our Executive Committee ensures that the approach is effectively implemented 
across the business. 
The main Group-wide governance documents are our Core Values and the Code of Conduct, which set out the values and standards that 
we expect of our employees. These documents, together with our policies, govern how we conduct our business and set the standards 
that drive performance. Compliance training helps to enforce this. Board oversight, reviews and audits form part of the monitoring and 
supervision process. Risk processes are embedded and reviewed on an ongoing basis across the business. The important governance 
developments at Bodycote over the last year are detailed in the governance reporting section below.
The Board is actively engaged in succession planning for both executive and non-executive directors. This ensures that the Board 
composition continues to be appropriate and, therefore, effective. 
I encourage all shareholders to attend the AGM, which will be held at our Macclesfield head office on 17 May 2017 . This event provides an 
excellent opportunity to meet the executive and independent non-executive directors.
A.M. Thomson

Governance reporting
Board diversity
Bodycote is a global business with operations in 23 countries and diversity is an integral part of how we do business. The Nomination 
Committee considers diversity when making appointments to the Board, taking into account relevant skills, experience, knowledge, 
personality, ethnicity and gender. Our prime responsibility, however, is the strength of the Board and our overriding aim in any new 
appointment must always be to select the best candidate. The Nomination Committee considers capability and capacity to commit 
the necessary time to the role in its recommendation to the Board. The intention is to appoint the most suitable qualified candidate to 
complement and balance the current skills, knowledge and experience of the Board and who will be best able to help lead the Company 
in its long-term strategy. The Nomination Committee is advised by international search companies, who have been briefed on our diversity 
policy and are required to reflect the policy in the long list submitted to the Committee.
We appointed P . Larmon on 13 September 2016 as part of our Board refreshment. D. Yates was appointed Chief Financial Officer on  
2 January 2017 , replacing D. Landless, who retired on 1 January 2017 . We will address this issue further when we discuss Board succession 
planning in the coming year. The Board is kept deliberately small and currently comprises two executive directors, three non-executive 
directors and a non-executive chairman.
Female representation on our Board is currently 17% (2015: 17%) and at manager level it is 25% (2015: 24%). Females represent 18% 
(2015: 18%) of our total workforce. We believe it is difficult to set targets or timescales for increasing the proportion of women, or any other 
minority group, on our Board and do not propose to do so. We will increase female representation on the Board if appropriate candidates 
are available when Board vacancies arise.
The Corporate responsibility and sustainability report contains further details regarding the male and female representation within the 
Group, including Board representation. 
Board evaluation
Following the external Board Evaluation in 2015, the Board agreed to undertake an internal evaluation in 2016. To ensure that all aspects 
of good governance are covered by the review, the Group Company Secretary distributed a tailored questionnaire to each member of the 
Board. Questions were framed under the following seven topics:
■ ■ Remit and objectives;
■ ■ Composition, training and resources;
■ ■ Corporate governance/risk management;
■ ■ Stakeholder engagement;
■ ■ Board meetings and visits;
■ ■ Board procedures and administration; and
■ ■ Evaluation and effectiveness.
At a meeting of the Nomination Committee in September 2016, the directors assessed the conclusions reached and are in the process of 
implementing a number of recommendations. Additional emphasis will be placed on risk management, strategy and operational matters. 
The Board evaluation covered the activities of the Board and each of its Committees. The Board is considered to be functional and working 
well. Arising from the exercise, the Board concluded that its focus should remain on divisional growth strategies, technology development, 
risk and sustainability as well as continued training. The overall conclusion is that the Board is performing well and high governance 
standards have been adopted. The Executive Committee is strongly challenged by the Board when appropriate.
As in previous years, the Chairman has assessed the performance of each Board member by conducting individual interviews and we can 
confirm that all directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
E. Lindqvist has several other non-executive director appointments, all with Swedish or Finnish companies. The Board noted that typically 
board meetings in Nordic companies are no more than four to six times per annum and hence felt that these appointments had no impact 
on E. Lindqvist’s time commitment to Bodycote.
The Executive Directors Messrs S.C. Harris and D. Yates were also appraised in February 2017 .
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the directors carried out an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance in September 2016. The 
Board is satisfied with the Chairman’s commitment and performance.

Corporate governance statement continued
Induction
All new directors are subject to a tailored induction programme covering a diverse range of topics including trading, investor relations, 
organisational and legal matters as well as visits to operational sites. They also meet all other directors and senior executives. This facilitates 
their understanding of the Group and the key drivers of business performance.
T raining
The Board receives training via ad hoc presentations and papers from advisers and the Group Company Secretary. External periodic training 
on important topics takes place and during the year the directors received training on international employment law developments, focusing 
in particular on the main countries in which we operate. Other opportunities for ongoing development and support are:
■ ■ a programme of plant/site visits throughout the year;
■ ■ reviews with the Chairman to identify any training and development needs;
■ ■ advice on governance, relevant legislative changes affecting the business or their duties from the Group Company Secretary;
■ ■ access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense; and
■ ■ participation at the training and guidance programme for boards and directors offered at the Deloitte Academy.
Succession planning
Succession planning ensures that appropriate senior executive leadership resources are in place to achieve Bodycote’s strategic objectives. 
The plans are reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee.
The Board further develops its knowledge and gains greater visibility of executive talent and management succession by visiting the 
Group’s sites and meeting with key talent and senior executives.
Board refreshment will continue over the coming years.

Corporate governance statement continued
Compliance reporting
In respect of the financial year 2016, Bodycote’s obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules is to prepare a corporate 
governance statement with reference to the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in September 2014 (“the Code”). The 2016 
UK Corporate Governance Code was issued in April 2016 and applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 17 June 2016. 
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2016, Bodycote has complied with the provisions of the Code with the exception of provisions 
E.1 .1 and B.1 .2. Regarding E.1 .1, the Board has, in recent years, taken the view that generally it is the responsibility of the Group Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer to manage relationships with institutional investors. The Chairman also meets institutional 
investors to discuss overall strategy, governance and any concerns that shareholders may have. Only where these more usual channels of 
communication have failed would the Board expect the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) or other non-executive directors 
to become involved, notwithstanding that the Code specifies attendance of the SID at meetings with major shareholders. The SID has 
contacted major shareholders and offered to facilitate meetings with them should they have any concerns they wish to discuss. Regular 
feedback from the Group’s advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated to all directors. During the year the 
Chairman met with shareholders to discuss governance matters. During the year there existed a short period where the Group did not 
comply with provision B.1 .2. as R. Rajagopal retired from the Board at the AGM on 27 May 2016 and P . Larmon was appointed as Non-
Executive Director on 13 September 2016.
Apart from these distinct areas, Bodycote was in compliance with the provisions of the 2014 and 2016 Code throughout 2016.
Operation of the Code
Taken together with the Report of the Nomination Committee, the Report of the Audit Committee and the Board report on remuneration 
presented on pages 48 to 73, this statement explains how Bodycote has applied the principles of good corporate governance as set out in 
the Code.
Leadership
The Board is responsible to shareholders for good corporate governance, setting the Group’s strategic objectives, values and standards, and 
ensuring the necessary resources are in place to achieve the objectives.
The Board met on eight occasions during 2016, including a specific meeting to review and update the Group’s long-term strategy. The Board 
of Directors comprises six members, of whom four are non-executive directors and two are executive directors, led by the Group’s part-
time Non-Executive Chairman, A.M. Thomson, who also chairs the Nomination Committee. The Group Chief Executive is S.C. Harris and the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is I.B. Duncan, who also chairs the Audit Committee. E. Lindqvist is Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. Brief biographical details of all directors are given on pages 36 to 37 . During the year the Board visited a number of UK and 
overseas facilities, including sites in the Czech Republic and Belgium. Such events involved meetings with local management and the unit 
workforce to understand more clearly technical and operational performance in countries where Bodycote has a significant presence.
Matters reserved for the Board were reviewed during the year and updated where required. Certain defined powers and issues reserved for 
the Board to decide are, inter alia:
■ ■ Strategy;
■ ■ Approval of financial statements and circulars;
■ ■ Capital projects, acquisitions and disposals;
■ ■ Annual budgets;
■ ■ Directors’ appointments, service agreements, remuneration and succession planning;
■ ■ Policies for financial statements, treasury, safety, health and environment, donations;
■ ■ Committees’ terms of reference;
■ ■ Board and committee chairmen and membership;
■ ■ Investments;
■ ■ Equity and bank financing;
■ ■ Internal control and risk management;
■ ■ Corporate governance;
■ ■ Key external and internal appointments; and
■ ■ Employee share incentives and pension arrangements.

In advance of Board meetings, directors are supplied with up-to-date information regarding the trading performance of each operating 
division and sub-division, in addition to the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior year results, budgets and 
forecasts. They are also supplied with the latest available information on safety, health and environmental and risk management issues and 
details of the safety and health performance of the Group, and each division, in terms of severity and frequency rates for accidents at work. 
Senior management from across the Group and advisers attend some of the meetings to provide updates. The exposure to members of 
senior management from across the Group helps enhance the Board’s understanding of the business, the implementation of strategy and 
the changing dynamics of the markets in which the Group operates.
Where required, a director may seek independent professional advice, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Group. All directors have 
access to the Group Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues with the SID. In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, all newly appointed directors must submit themselves for election. All directors stand for yearly re-election. Non-executive 
directors, including the Chairman, are appointed for fixed terms not exceeding three years from the date of first election by shareholders, 
after which the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement. A statement of the directors’ responsibilities is set out on page 74. The 
Board also operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee. All 
non-executive directors serve on each Board Committee.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, Board members serve for a period of six years, which will only be extended in 
certain circumstances. If letters of appointment are extended beyond six years, the fixed term is reduced to one year.
In order that necessary actions can be taken promptly, a finance sub-committee, comprising the Chairman (or failing him, any other non-
executive director), the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer operates between the dates of scheduled Board meetings and 
is authorised to make decisions, within limits defined by the Board, in respect of certain finance, treasury, tax or investment matters.

The Board recommends to shareholders that they re-elect (or elect) all the directors. In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, 
Board members will serve for a period of six years which may be extended in certain circumstances.
The performance of each director was evaluated as indicated above and the Board confirms in respect of each that their performance 
continues to be effective and that each continues to demonstrate commitment to his or her respective role.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management policies and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks, including risks arising out of Bodycote’s corporate and social 
engagement. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management 
systems. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management and from internal audit to consider whether any significant 
weaknesses are promptly remedied or indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging 
these review responsibilities.
44 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2016 25229.04    9 March 2017 5:13 PM    PROOF 5 post self editing
The Board believes that the Group maintains an effective system of internal controls which is in accordance with the FRC’s guidance 
entitled ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors’ (formerly referred to as the Turnbull Report guidance) and, in the view of the 
Board, no significant deficiencies have been identified in the system. The system was in operation throughout 2016 and continues to 
operate up to the date of the approval of this report. Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control are as follows:
■ ■ The Group prepares a comprehensive annual budget which is closely monitored and updated quarterly. The Group’s authority matrix 
clearly sets out authority limits for those with delegated responsibility and specifies what can only be decided with central approval.
■ ■ The Board, with the assistance of E&Y , who provide Internal Audit services, monitors the Group’s internal financial control system. 
Internal audit reviews are conducted on the basis of a risk-based plan approved annually by the Audit Committee. The findings and 
recommendations from internal audit are reported on a regular basis to the Executive and Audit Committees.
■ ■ An annual internal control self-assessment, with management certification, is undertaken by every Bodycote site. The assessment 
covers the effectiveness of key financial and compliance controls. The results are validated by internal audit through spot checks and are 
reported to the Executive and Audit Committees.
■ ■ Group policies (including the Code of Conduct, Group authority matrix and finance policies) are documented and are available to all 
employees via the Group’s intranet system. 
■ ■ The Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, President and Vice President of Finance for each division sign a letter of 
representation annually. This is to confirm the adequacy of their systems of internal controls, their compliance with Group policies, 
relevant laws and regulations, and that they have reported any control weaknesses through the Group’s assurance processes. 
■ ■ A Group-wide risk register is maintained throughout the year to identify the Group’s key strategic and operational risks. Any changes to 
these risks during the year are promptly reported to the Executive Committee and the Board.
During 2016, in compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, management performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual 
Report. Management’s assessment, which has been reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board, included a review of the Group’s key 
strategic and operational risks, which is summarised from work performed by the Group Head of Risk and the Group’s Risk Committee to 
identify risks (by means of workshops, interviews and investigations, and by reviewing departmental or divisional risk registers). Further 
information regarding the ways in which the principal business risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are managed is shown on pages 
24 to 27 . No new significant risks were identified as part of this process, and the necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy 
any significant failings or weaknesses identified as part of the reviews.
Investor relations
The Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer regularly talk with and meet institutional investors, both individually and collectively, 
and this has enabled institutional investors to increase their understanding of the Group’s strategy and operating performance. In addition, 
internet users are able to view up-to-date news on the Group and its share price via the Bodycote website at www.bodycote.com. Users 
of the website can access recent announcements and copies of results presentations and can enrol to hear live presentations. On a 
regular basis, Bodycote’s financial advisers, corporate brokers and financial public relations consultants provide the directors with opinion 
surveys from analysts and investing institutions following visits and meetings with the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. 
The Chairman and SID are available to discuss any issues not resolved by the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. On specific 
issues, such as the review of remuneration packages, the Group has sought, and will continue to seek, the views of leading investors.

Directors’ report
The directors are pleased to submit their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Chief Financial Officer’s report and all the information contained on pages 36  
to 73 together comprise the Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Strategic report
The Strategic report is provided on pages 6 to 35 of this Annual Report. This is a review of the development of the Group’s businesses, the 
financial performance during the year ended 31 December 2016, key performance indicators and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. The Strategic report has been prepared solely to assist the shareholders in assessing the Group’s strategies 
and the potential of those strategies. It should not be relied on by any other party for any other purpose. Forward-looking statements have 
been made by the directors in good faith using information available up to the date of this report and such statements should be regarded 
with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and business risks. Since the end of the financial year no important 
events affecting the business of the Group have occurred.
Dividends
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 10.8p per share (2015: 10.3p) bringing the total ordinary dividend to 15.8p per share (2015: 
15.1p). If approved by shareholders, the final dividend of 10.8p per share will be paid on 2 June 2017 to all shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 21 April 2017 .
Share capital
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2016 was £33.1m. No shares were issued during the year. At the AGM 
on 27 May 2016 the shareholders authorised the Company to purchase up to 22,046,468 of its own shares. This authority expires at the 
conclusion of the forthcoming AGM to be held on 17 May 2017 , at which time a further authority will be sought from shareholders.
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital are shown in note 24. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carries no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, both of which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 29 and shares held by the Bodycote 
Employee Benefit Trust abstain from voting and waive dividend rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. The appointment and replacement of directors is governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended  
by a special resolution of shareholders. The powers of the directors are described in the Corporate governance statement on page 38. 
Under the Articles of Association the Company has authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of £11,023,234.
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter, crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts and 
employee share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as 
a whole, and the directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and themselves or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid except where specifically mentioned in this report.
Directors
The current directors and their biographical details are listed on pages 36 and 37 and all served throughout the year, with the exception 
of P . Larmon, who was appointed on 13 September 2016, and D. Yates, who was appointed on 1 November 2016. Under the Articles 
of Association of the Company each director must retire from office and stand for re-election by shareholders as a minimum at every 
third AGM in order to continue to serve as a director. However, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and to further increase 
accountability, all directors retired at the AGM in 2016 and stood for re-election by the shareholders. Going forward all directors will retire 
at the AGM and will stand for re-election by the shareholders, if they wish to continue to serve as directors of the Company. Accordingly, 
those directors retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the 2017 AGM are A.M. Thomson, S.C. Harris, I.B. Duncan and E. 
Lindqvist. Since P . Larmon and D. Yates were appointed after the AGM in 2016, both will stand for election at the AGM in May 2017 . The 
service agreements for Messrs S.C. Harris and D. Yates are terminable by 12 months notice. The remaining directors do not have a service 
agreement with the Company and their appointments are terminable by six months notice.
Directors’ interests in contracts and shares
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and details of the directors’ interests in the Company’s shares and share incentive 
plans are shown in the Board report on remuneration on pages 54 to 73. No director has had any dealings in any shares or options in the 
Company since 31 December 2016. Qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) has 
remained in force for the directors for the year ended 31 December 2016 and, as at the date of this report, remains in force for the benefit 
of the current directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) to third parties in the course of 
their duties. Apart from these exceptions, none of the directors had a material interest in any contract of significance in relation to the 
Company and its subsidiaries at any time during the financial year.

Potential conflicts of interest
During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not only 
had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose, but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real or potential. 
Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation (a “Situational 
Conflict”) which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one company. In order to ensure that each 
director was complying with the new duties, each director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what Situational 
Conflicts affected him or her. The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict up 
until September 2017 and permitted each affected director to attend and vote at Bodycote directors’ meetings, on the basis that each such 
director continued to keep Bodycote’s information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate and in the 
interests of shareholders. Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, the Chairman 
or the Nomination Committee can revoke an authorisation. No such revocations have been made.
Employment
The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees. The commitment of 
employees to excel is key to the Group’s continued success. Through their attendance at, or participation in strategy, production, safety and 
health meetings at site level, employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress of the Group, the contribution to the Group 
made by their site, and are advised of safety and health issues. Under the Group’s Open Door Line employees’ concerns can be voiced over 
the phone on an anonymous basis in the local language. Approximately 3,600 Bodycote employees are connected to the Bodycote intranet, 
which improves knowledge of Group activities, and assists greatly with technology exchange and co-ordination. It is the Group’s policy to 
give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, 
and to encourage the training and career development of all personnel employed by the Group, including disabled persons. Should an 
employee become disabled, the Group, where practicable, will seek to continue the employment and arrange appropriate training. An equal 
opportunities policy is in operation in the Group.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of greenhouse gas emissions are included within the Corporate responsibility and sustainability section of this report. 
Donations
There were no political contributions in 2015 or 2016.
Shareholders
An analysis of the Company’s shareholders and the shares in issue at 17 February 2017 together with details of the interests of major 
shareholders in voting shares notified to the Company pursuant to Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules are given on page 
138.
Auditor
In accordance with the provisions of section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor 
is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
■ ■ so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
■ ■ each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This statement is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The 2017 Annual General Meeting will be held on 17 May 2017 in accordance with the notice being sent to shareholders with this report.

Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to introduce the Nomination Committee report for 2016. The Committee’s key objective is to support the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities to ensure there is a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the appointment of new directors to the Board and to 
ensure that effective succession planning processes are in place across the Group. 
This was a busy year for the Committee. In addition to its main responsibilities, the Committee oversaw the process of appointing a new 
Non-Executive Director and a new Chief Financial Officer. Raj Rajagopal, Senior Independent Director (SID), stood down at the 2016 AGM. 
Pat Larmon was appointed Non-executive director on 13 September 2016 and Ian Duncan took over as Senior Independent Director after 
the AGM on 27 May 2016. Dominique Yates joined as Group Finance Director designate on 1 November 2016 and was appointed Chief 
Financial Officer on 2 January 2017 following David Landless’ retirement from the business on 1 January 2017 after 17 years of service. The 
Committee will continue to focus on ensuring that the present and future composition of the Board is appropriate for the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy and that all relevant UK Corporate Governance Code requirements continue to be met.
A.M. Thomson
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the Board, whose principal purpose is 
to advise on the appointment and, if necessary, dismissal of executive and non-executive 
directors. The Committee’s terms of reference, which are listed on the Group’s website, 
include all matters required by the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”). Further 
information on the Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council’s website  
www.frc.org.uk. The terms of reference are reviewed annually by the Group Company 
Secretary and the Chairman, and any changes are then referred to the Board for approval.  
No changes were made to the terms of reference during the year. 
Composition of the Nomination Committee
As recommended by the Code, the Chairman of the Board acts as the Chairman of the 
Committee whose members also comprise the directors listed above. To ensure executive 
input on nominations matters, the Chief Executive is also a member of the Committee. The 
Chairman cannot chair the Committee when it is dealing with either the succession to the 
Chairmanship of the Group or the review of his own performance. Only members of the 
Committee have the right to attend the Committee meetings. Other individuals and external 
advisers may be invited to attend for all, or part of, any meeting when it is appropriate. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be an 
independent non-executive director.
The Group Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has the authority to seek any information that is required, from any officer or 
employee of the Company or its subsidiaries. In connection with its duties, the Committee is 
authorised by the Board to take such independent advice (including legal or other professional 
advice, at the Group’s expense) as it considers necessary, including requests for information 
from, or commissioning investigations by, external advisers.

Director appointment policy and progress
The Committee has developed a formal rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors. Prior to making any 
appointment, the Committee, having evaluated the skills, experience and diversity of the Board, will determine the qualities and experience 
they seek and will then prepare a detailed description of the role with a view to appointing the most appropriate candidate. The Committee 
will use open advertising or the services of independent external advisers to facilitate the search.
A long list of candidates will be drawn up, from which an appropriate number will be selected for interview. Upon completion the 
Committee will recommend to the Board the appointment of the preferred candidate.
Board succession planning
Upon the retirement of R. Rajagopal at the 2016 AGM, he was replaced as Senior Independent Director by I.B. Duncan. P . Larmon joined 
the Board in September 2016 as Non-Executive Director. After 17 years of service D. Landless, Group Finance Director, retired on 1 January 
2017 . D. Yates was appointed Group Finance Director designate on 1 November 2016 and became Chief Financial Officer on 2 January 2017 . 
The Committee was advised by an international search consultancy, Zygos, in the process of identifying suitably qualified individuals. Zygos 
has no other connections to Bodycote plc.
Main activities of the Nomination Committee
In 2016 the Committee formally met seven times and reviewed the composition and skills of the Board, with a view to considering the 
current and future skills and experience that the Board might require.
The Committee discussed succession planning and Board diversity, and reviewed the performance of the Group Chief Executive and other 
senior executives. In particular, the need to broaden the Board membership with respect to gender, ethnicity and age was discussed. The 
Committee has sought to ensure that appointments are of the best candidates to promote the success of the Company and are based on 
merit, with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board. Further information concerning Board diversity can be found on page 39 as 
part of the Corporate governance statement.
The Committee considered and authorised the potential conflicts of interest which might arise where a director has fiduciary responsibilities 
in respect of other organisations. The Committee concluded that no inappropriate conflicts of interest exist. The Committee also assigned 
the Chairman to review and agree with the Group Chief Executive his personal objectives for the forthcoming year.
Following the external Board evaluation in 2015, the Board agreed to undertake an internal evaluation during 2016. Further details of the 
review can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report. Recommendations arising from the 2016 Board evaluation 
are in the process of being addressed.
In December 2016 the Nomination Committee reviewed the Board’s size and composition, the frequency of the process for Board and 
Committee meetings, and best practice for dealing with Board issues including drawing up a training and/or induction programme for 
the directors. The terms of reference of the Committee were reviewed in conjunction with the Model Terms of Reference issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The biographical details of the current directors can be found on pages 36 and 37 . The 
Committee, having reviewed their independence and contribution to Board matters, confirms that the performance of each of the directors 
standing for re-election at this year’s AGM continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment to their roles, including independence 
of judgement and time commitment for Board and Committee meetings. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended to the Board that 
all current directors of the Company be proposed for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
As Chairman of the Committee, I will be available at the AGM in May 2017 to answer questions relating to the work of the Committee.

Introduction
The Committee has continued to focus on the integrity of Bodycote’s financial reporting, risk management and internal controls and on 
the quality of the external and internal audit processes. The Committee will continue to keep our activities under review as the regulatory 
environment changes.
Membership
The members of the Audit Committee are all independent non-executive directors. Their biographical details are shown on pages 36 and 37 
and their remuneration on page 56. The Group Company Secretary is the secretary to the Audit Committee. 
I.B. Duncan is Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board considers that I.B. Duncan has recent and relevant financial experience. He 
qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Deloitte & Touche, served as Finance Director of Royal Mail Holdings plc from 2006 to 2010, and 
has chaired the audit committees of several other publicly listed companies. 
Other members of the Committee have significant and widespread experience in both executive and non-executive capacities in 
multinational industrial companies. Accordingly, all members of the Audit Committee are considered to have competence relevant to their 
duties.
Objective
The Committee’s objective is to provide effective governance over the Group’s financial reporting, including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the management and oversight of the Group’s systems of internal control, financial risks and the performance of internal audit 
and the appointment and performance of the external auditor.
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee met four times during 2016 and in February 2017 and all members attended all meetings that they were eligible to 
attend. The Committee Chairman also invited the Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller 
and Group Head of Risk (who is responsible for internal audit) to attend all meetings. Other executives from the Group were also invited, 
as appropriate, to attend certain meetings to provide a deeper level of insight into key issues. The Committee Chairman also invited the 
external auditor, Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”), to every meeting. 
I.B. Duncan also held preparatory meetings separately with Deloitte, the Group Financial Controller and the Group Head of Risk prior to 
Committee meetings to review their reports and discuss issues in detail. The external auditor met with the Audit Committee without the 
executives present. 
Main activities of the Committee during the year
As part of the process of working with the Board to carry out its responsibilities and to maximise effectiveness, meetings of the Committee 
generally take place just prior to Board meetings.

At its meetings, the Committee focused on the following main areas:
Financial reporting 
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting has been to review, with management and the external auditor, the 
appropriateness of the interim and annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:
■ ■ the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
■ ■ the application and impact of significant judgements or matters where there was significant discussion with the external auditor;
■ ■ the clarity of disclosures and compliance with Financial Reporting Standards; and
■ ■ whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business model and performance.
Reports from management were considered on significant matters, including in respect of litigation, treasury and tax matters and also 
reports from the external auditor on the outcome of their work. The Committee challenged both management and Deloitte to ensure that 
the scope of the audit was appropriate and that Deloitte had applied the necessary level of professional scepticism in their work. 
Areas of focus
The areas of focus considered by the Committee in relation to the 2016 Annual Report included the following:
■ ■ Impairment of goodwill. The Committee challenged the future forecast underlying the value in use calculation, and the assumptions, 
particularly the discount rate and growth factors, used in the discounted cash flow calculations for each cash generating unit, the 
sensitivity analysis applied and the projected future cash flows used to support the carrying values of the goodwill. Details of sensitivity 
analysis applied to key assumptions used in the impairment review are set out in note 11 to the financial statements on page 102. The 
Committee has concluded that no impairment charge is required in the year.
■ ■ Restructuring, reorganisation and environmental provisions. The Committee received reports, including from professional advisers, and 
challenged the basis and completeness of the assumptions used to calculate the provisions and the appropriateness of disclosures 
in the Annual Report. The Committee discussed with management the key judgements behind provisions, taking note of the range of 
possible outcomes, and agreed with their recommendations.
■ ■ Taxation. A number of judgements are involved in calculating tax provisions and the level of deferred tax assets to be recognised. The 
Committee reviewed associated risks and challenged management’s assessment concerning the Group’s key tax risks, noting the 
work of the OECD in respect of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), and management’s forecast of the future taxable profits of the 
relevant businesses.
■ ■ Viability statement. The Committee challenged the validity of the assumptions used in the preparation of the three-year strategic plan, 
used as the basis of the assessment of the longer-term viability of the Group, in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits 
and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to 
consider the impact of certain risks and to understand the impact of changes to key variables.
■ ■ Going concern. The Committee challenged the validity of the going concern assumption used in the preparation of the Annual Report, 
in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and 
covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand the impact of changes to all key variables.
■ ■ Pension liabilities. Management took external professional advice in determining pension liabilities. The Committee challenged the 
assumptions used, particularly in respect of inflation, the discount rate, life expectancy and the application of IFRIC 14 to the UK pension 
scheme, by considering current norms and the sensitivity of the reported liability to changes in the assumptions.
Risk management
The Committee reviewed a report at each meeting from the Group Head of Risk who has primary responsibility for developing the Group’s 
risk management framework. The Committee reviewed changes to the principal risks and mitigating actions identified by management. The 
Committee also received quarterly reports on issues raised via the Open Door Line (an external independent service where employees may 
report matters of concern) and assessed both how such calls are dealt with and whether there was any indication of material risk.
Internal control
At each meeting the Committee considered and challenged reports from the internal auditors on the effectiveness of internal controls. 
The Committee also performed an annual review of the Group’s internal control processes and considers the system to be effective and in 
accordance with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting as issued by the FRC 
(September 2014).
Internal audit
The internal audit plan for 2017 was presented to the Committee in October 2016 and accepted following discussions and challenge as to 
the scope and areas of focus. At each meeting the Group Head of Risk presented a report to the Committee on the status of internal audit 
plans for the current year, points arising from audits completed and follow up action plans to address areas of weakness. The status of 
these actions is monitored closely by the Committee until they are completed. The Committee also received reports on actual or suspected 
frauds and thefts by third parties and employees. None had any material financial impact on the Group and, where necessary, systems and 
procedures were altered to minimise the risk of recurrence.

External audit
At the April and October meetings the external auditor presented their audit plans for the interim review and year-end audit respectively. The 
Committee considered and challenged both the scope and materiality to be applied to the Group audit and its components. The Committee 
considered carefully the scope in respect of smaller and more remote locations and noted that all local audits are undertaken by Deloitte.
T raining
Updates were presented to the Committee on new accounting developments and any changes in corporate governance requirements that 
may affect the Group. Committee members also attended training briefings by accounting firms and other advisers.
Overview
The Committee examined the 2016 Annual Report and was specifically tasked by the Board to advise it on whether the 2016 Annual Report 
is fair, balanced and understandable. The Committee did this by satisfying itself that there was a robust process of review and challenge to 
ensure balance and consistency. In doing so the Committee examined these processes, which included the allocation of responsibility for 
the preparation of certain sections of the Annual Report to individuals in the head office team and a second person taking responsibility for 
the review process of each section of the Annual Report. Additional reviews were carried out by internal and external personnel including an 
independent legal review.
The Committee also reviewed the Annual Report. Taken as a whole, in the light of their knowledge of the Group and its performance, the 
outcome of the activities described above and based on robust discussion with both management and the external auditor, the Committee 
has concluded that it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
strategy, business model, position and performance, and reported to the Board accordingly.
External audit
Appointment
The Committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor each year and as part of this process considers the independence of 
the auditor and the effectiveness of the external audit process. Having reviewed the performance of Deloitte in 2016, the Committee has 
decided to recommend to the Board that Deloitte be reappointed for the 2017 audit and a resolution to this effect will be put to the 2017 
AGM. The Committee reviewed and agreed the fee for 2016.
The external auditor is required to change the lead partner every five years and other partners periodically in order to protect independence 
and objectivity and provide fresh challenge to the Group. Mr M. Mullins has been lead partner since 2015.
Deloitte has been the Group’s auditor for 15 years.
In accordance with the transition arrangements of the Competition and Markets Authority Audit order, the Group has until 2023 to hold a 
competitive tender for external audit services; it is the intention of the Group to hold a competitive tender, at a time which coincides with 
the next change of the lead audit partner, as the Committee believes that the audit partner’s knowledge of the business contributes to the 
quality of the audit process.
The Group complies with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation Order 2014.
Independence
The independence of the external auditor has been confirmed by Deloitte every half year and was last confirmed in February 2017 . The 
Committee considered Deloitte’s presentation and confirmed that it considered the auditor to be independent.
Significant controls surrounding the financial reporting process
The Group operates under a system of internal controls which have been developed and refined over time to meet its needs and the risks 
to which it is exposed. This includes: 
■ ■ preparation of the Strategic Plan; 
■ ■ comprehensive budgeting process with an annual budget which is approved by the Board; 
■ ■ quarterly review and revision of financial forecasts for the year; 
■ ■ monthly monitoring of financial performance; 
■ ■ recruitment of suitably qualified staff for the Group’s administrative offices, shared service centres and regional accounting centres;
■ ■ provision of appropriate IT and reporting systems; and 
■ ■ appropriate delegation of authority to operational management. 
Delegations and other Group corporate and financial policies are maintained on the Group intranet. An annual representation letter from all 
business unit Presidents and Vice Presidents of Finance, with regard to the financial reporting process and the veracity of the information 
they have submitted, is provided to the Committee.

Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee has adopted a formal framework for the review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit quality which 
includes the following aspects:
■ ■ assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and the audit team;
■ ■ audit approach and scope, including identification of risk areas;
■ ■ execution of the audit;
■ ■ interaction with management;
■ ■ communication with and support to the Audit Committee;
■ ■ insights, management letter points, added value and reports; and 
■ ■ independence, objectivity and scepticism.
An assessment questionnaire was completed by each member of the Committee, the Group Finance Director and other senior finance 
executives. The feedback from the process is considered by the Audit Committee and provided to the external auditor and management. 
The full formal questionnaire is completed every three years with key areas being completed every year. 
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of management in the external audit process by considering timely identification and resolution 
of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements and other documents provided for 
review by the external auditor and the Committee.
The Committee considered the FRC Audit Quality Review Team report on Deloitte LLP dated May 2016. If the audit is selected for quality 
review, the Committee understands that any resulting reports will be sent to the Committee by the FRC. After considering the above 
matters, the Committee felt that the external audit had been effective.
Non-audit services 
The external auditor may be invited to provide services where their position as auditor renders them best placed to undertake the work. 
Financial due diligence, taxation, internal audit, and actuarial services are not typically contracted to the external auditor. No contracts in 
excess of £20,000 can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval from the Chairman of the Committee or, in his absence, 
another member of the Committee. Non-audit fees paid to the auditor are shown in note 3 on page 98 and amounted to 11% of the audit 
fee.
The review of the Group’s Interim Report was the only significant non-audit engagement undertaken by the external auditor. Given the 
external auditor’s detailed knowledge of the Group, the Audit Committee believes that it is in the interests of the Group that the external 
auditor performs this review.
Internal audit
The internal audit programme is managed by the Group Head of Risk and provides independent assurance over the key financial processes 
and controls in operation across the Group. The Group has engaged Ernst & Young LLP (”Ernst & Young”) to provide certain internal audit 
services. The Committee reviewed and approved the annual internal audit plan before the start of the financial year and considered it 
appropriate to retain Ernst & Young as an internal audit service provider. The plan takes account of the Group’s strategic objectives and risks 
and provides the degree of coverage deemed appropriate by the Committee.
Additional assurance has been obtained through control self-assessment. Internal auditors have received self-certification from every 
plant and shared service centre that internal controls have been complied with and noting any non-compliance. A summary of results is 
presented to the Committee. The accuracy of returns is monitored by Internal Audit by verification visits to a random sample of sites.
The effectiveness of internal audit is reviewed and discussed annually with the Group Head of Risk and the Ernst & Young engagement 
partner. An assessment questionnaire was completed by each member of the Committee, the Group Finance Director and other senior 
finance executives. The views of senior operational management have also been canvassed. The review takes into account the views of 
directors and senior management on matters such as independence, proficiency, resourcing and audit strategy, planning and methodology. 
On the appointment of a new engagement partner the Committee assesses the experience and expertise of the partner and other 
senior staff members. Audit quality is assured through a detailed review of each report being carried out by the Group Head of Risk, and 
a summary of each report’s findings being reviewed by the Audit Committee. The review confirmed that the internal audit function was 
independent and objective and remained an effective element of the Group’s corporate governance framework.
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part of an internal review of Board effectiveness which was undertaken in July 2016. There were no 
material deficiencies noted in the review and directors indicated a high level of satisfaction with the work of the Committee. Based on this, 
and as a result of the work done during the year, the Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference 
and carried out its responsibilities effectively.

Chair’s letter
As Chair of the Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present our Board 
report on remuneration for the 2016 financial year, in line with the requirements of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
This report comprises two sections. The first part (Section A) describes how the existing policy, approved at the 2016 AGM, was 
implemented in 2016. The second part (Section B) summarises the policy of the Board with regard to the remuneration of the directors.  
The full Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2016, is available on our website.
I would like to thank our shareholders for their support in approving the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2016. Our approach is based on 
simple, competitive reward that closely aligns the pay of our senior executives with our Company’s strategy. It is designed to incentivise 
and motivate the behaviours and actions that will deliver strong returns to shareholders. The new Remuneration Policy was developed to 
help better achieve these goals, creating a simpler framework aligned with best practice, new corporate governance requirements, and to 
reflect the changing nature of our business in the coming years.
I would also like to welcome Patrick Larmon, who was appointed on 13 September 2016, to the Board and Committee. 
Context and key Committee decisions on remuneration
2016 has seen the business respond to challenging market conditions linked to a subdued demand for industrial machinery and a reduction 
in oil & gas activity. However, the business has a robust balance sheet with minimal leverage and cash generation has remained strong 
over the period. This has allowed continued investment in areas where we believe there will be sustainable value creation for shareholders, 
particularly in Specialist Technologies and focusing on high added value services in Classical Heat Treatment. In 2016, the weakness in 
trading experienced by the business has been largely offset by the positive currency translation impact resulting from exchange rate 
movements.
In the context of the above, the decisions made by the Committee in respect of the remuneration of the executives are set out below 
and reflect the achievement against the relevant performance conditions. The Committee also considers the conditions and pay of the 
wider workforce when making decisions on remuneration of the executives. All the decisions made by the Committee are in line with the 
approved Remuneration Policy. 
■ ■ The annual bonus paid out at 19% of maximum bonus for the Group Chief Executive, and at 14% of maximum bonus for the Group 
Finance Director, David Landless, due to partial achievement of cash flow targets and personal objectives.
■ ■ The 2014 BIP (Bodycote Incentive Plan) did not vest as performance conditions were not met.
■ ■ The 2013 CIP (Co-Investment Plan) vested at 93.3% of maximum due to achieving absolute TSR growth of 9.9% during the performance 
period.
The Committee also reviewed the base salary of the Group Chief Executive and determined that an inflationary salary increase of 3% will 
be made effective from 1 January 2017 . The 2016 average salary increase for the wider UK workforce was 2.1%. As David Landless retired 
on 1 January 2017 , he is not eligible for a salary review or increase. The salary of Dominique Yates, who commenced on 1 November 2016, 
will be reviewed next in January 2018.

Executive director changes
Dominique Yates joined as Group Finance Director designate and executive director of Bodycote plc on 1 November 2016. Dominique took 
up his new role as Chief Financial Officer on 2 January 2017 , succeeding David Landless who announced his intention to retire from the 
Board on 25 February 2016 after serving 17 years with Bodycote.
Dominique Yates’ remuneration on appointment is in line with the approved Remuneration Policy and full details are set out in Section A of 
this report. On his appointment, Dominique’s base salary was set at £380,000 to reflect his experience and the skills he will bring to the 
role. Under normal circumstances it would not be envisaged that Dominique will receive higher than normal salary increases in the coming 
years. From 2017 , Dominique is eligible to participate in Bodycote’s annual bonus and Bodycote Incentive Plan and has not received any 
buyout or additional awards.
David Landless’ remuneration will be treated in line with the approved Remuneration Policy on his departure. David will not receive any 
additional payments as a result of his departure. Full details are set out in Section A of this remuneration report. 
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow Committee members, as well as all those who supported the Committee in the year, for their support 
throughout this review. As a Committee we are fully committed to continue an open dialogue with our shareholders. I would welcome your 
views on the content of this report or any other items you would like to discuss.

Remuneration for 2016
This section of the report explains how Bodycote’s Remuneration Policy has been implemented during the financial year.
Base salary
The base salaries of the executive directors are reviewed on an annual basis. As described in Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, a 
number of factors are taken into account when salaries are reviewed, principally market level salaries payable in FTSE 250 companies and 
other companies of similar size and complexity, and the individual’s role, experience and performance. The 2016 base salary increases and 
comparative figures can be found in the Remuneration Committee Chair’s letter.
Base salaries are reviewed in January every year.

Fees retained for external non-executive directorships
To broaden the experience of executive directors, the position of non-executive director may be held in other companies, provided that 
permission is sought in advance. Any external appointment must not conflict with the directors’ duties and commitments to Bodycote plc. 
S.C. Harris has held such a position at Mondi plc since 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year 
of £89,292. D.F . Landless was appointed a non-executive director of Luxfer Holdings plc with effect from 1 March 2013 and retained fees 
for the year of £58,117 . The taxable value of restricted stock units that vested during 2016 was £4,277 and the taxable value of options 
exercised was £27 ,396. D.F . Landless has also been appointed as a non-executive director of Innospec Inc. with effect from 1 January 2016 
and retained fees for the year of £71,229.
Pension
S.C. Harris and D. Yates are entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 25% of basic salary. In addition, a death in service 
benefit of eight times basic salary is payable.
D.F . Landless no longer participates in the Group’s UK contributory defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes due to him 
prospectively reaching the lifetime limit. Instead, D.F . Landless receives a salary supplement of 25% of basic salary up to the defined 
benefit scheme cap and 20% of basic salary above the cap, of which £51,082 was waived during the year. As of 1 April 2016 D.F . Landless 
received a salary supplement in lieu of pension of £58,456 for the remainder of the year. In addition, a death in service benefit of eight 
times basic salary was payable.
T axable benefits
The Group provides other cash benefits and benefits in kind to directors as well as sick pay and life insurance. These include the provision of 
company car (or allowance) and family level private medical insurance.

S.C. Harris £17 ,726 £2,400 £1,401

Long-term savings vehicle
During the financial year the Group made discretionary contributions into the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan. The plan is entirely  
cash-based to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior executives. Group contributions are discretionary, vary year on year 
and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore are cost neutral to the Group. Any risk in relation to the value of investments 
made in the plan is borne entirely by participants. The plan was terminated in November 2016 and no further contributions will be made.
Annual performance related bonus 
£
2016 Annual bonus 
The Committee has decided, in line with market practice, to disclose information in respect of last year’s annual bonus targets. The table 
below provides the details of the annual bonus awards received in respect of the Group and individual performances in the 2016 financial 
year.
The annual bonus potential for the period to 31 December 2016 for executive directors was split 77% in respect of Group headline 
operating profit, 10% on Group headline operating cash flow and 13% on personal strategic objectives. These performance conditions 
and their respective weightings reflected the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be linked both to the overall 
performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence. 
Due to significant pressures, particularly in the oil & gas sector, the performance of the Group during the year included headline operating 
profit of £88.4m at constant exchange rates (13% decrease on prior year) and headline operating cash flow of £79.3m at constant exchange 
rates (3% decrease on prior year). No bonus is payable on headline operating profit since the threshold was not met.
The Committee also assessed the performance of the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, David Landless, against their 
personal objectives, which included targets relating to safety, focus on driving growth, implementation of sales strategy, succession 
planning, as well as implementation of major projects. The Committee concluded that personal strategic objectives were achieved at a level 
of 80% of the maximum award for the Group Chief Executive. The Group Finance Director, David Landless, achieved 40% of maximum.

Awards with performance periods ending in the year
BIP awards made in 2014 had a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2016, with 50% of the award subject to satisfaction 
of a ROCE target and 50% subject to the headline earnings per share (EPS) target. The threshold and maximum targets along with the 
vesting schedule are set out in the tables below.

If headline EPS at the end of the performance period was below 40.2p, then no awards will vest. Over the period, ROCE was 17 .1% and the 
headline EPS figure for the year was 37 .0p. As the targets were not achieved, the Committee concluded that the 2014 share award will not 
vest. 
Awards made in the year 
BIP awards with a face value of 175% of salary were granted to both executive directors in June 2016 and will vest in March 2019, subject 
to the achievement of ROCE and headline EPS growth performance targets. The performance period will end on 31 December 2018. The 
vesting of these awards will be based on ROCE and headline EPS targets summarised in the table below. The Committee has reviewed 
the performance targets and these have been altered accordingly to ensure that they remain stretching targets which underpin the Group’s 
objectives.

If headline EPS at the end of the performance period is below 27p, then no awards will vest. The Committee has decided that the ROCE 
figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and is cognisant of the fact that over-incentivising on capital employed can lead to 
unintended consequences in terms of short-term capital underinvestment for the business. Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of 
those shares that vest.
The number and value of shares that were awarded to the executive directors during the year is set out on page 58.

As described in Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, CIP awards are subject to an absolute TSR target. The CIP awards made in 2013 
had a three-year performance period ending on 30 April 2016. The absolute TSR performance targets applicable to this award are set out 
below.
Absolute TSR performance target Vesting level
4% CAGR + CPI 50% (0.5:1 match)
10% CAGR + CPI 100% (1:1 match)
Over the three-year period, the Group achieved absolute TSR growth of 9.9%. This performance resulted in the TSR targets being achieved 
at a level of 93.3%. The number and value of shares which vested to each of the executive directors is set out on page 58.
No awards were made in the year.
Implementation of policy in 2017
Base salary is reviewed on an annual basis. The 2017 base salary increases from 1 January 2017 were 3% for the Group Chief Executive 
and 0% for the Chief Financial Officer, having recently been appointed. As 2016 base salary increases for the Group are applied after the 
publication of this report, the comparative figure for 2017 can only be provided in next year’s report. The comparative figure for 2016 is 
disclosed in the base salary section on page 56. 
The new Chief Financial Officer, Dominique Yates, replaced David Landless as of 2 January 2017 . His salary on appointment was £380,000. 
This reflects his significant and valuable experience in international multi-site businesses, and the need to ensure his reward package was 
appropriate in the context of that in his previous role to facilitate his recruitment. Dominique’s company pension contribution is 25% of 
salary. As of 2017 , Dominique was invited to participate in the annual bonus plan at 150% of base salary with deferral of bonus in line with 
the Remuneration Policy. Dominique will also be invited to participate in the Bodycote Incentive Plan at 175% of salary as of 2017 . Benefits 
provided include the provision of company car (or allowance), private medical insurance, short- and long-term sick pay and death in service 
cover. Taxable work-related expenses such as travel and relocation are also provided.
David Landless resigned as an executive director as of 1 January 2017 . The Remuneration Committee has decided that as a good leaver, 
David’s 2014 and 2015 Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) and Co-Investment Plan (CIP) awards will be pro-rated to his leaving date and are 
subject to achievement of performance conditions at the end of the three-year performance period. The 2016 BIP award will lapse. No CIP 
awards were made in 2016.
For 2017 , the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors and senior executives will again be 
contingent on meeting targets relating to operating profit, cash management and personal objectives. The Committee has reviewed targets 
for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant for the Group’s business strategy. In line with prior years, the 2017 
annual bonus targets will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report.
The Committee has determined to set the targets for the 2017 BIP awards as disclosed below. The targets below were set in the context of 
significant pressures in the sector and to ensure that the Committee is able to deliver upper quartile reward for upper quartile performance.

Illustrations of application of Remuneration Policy
The remuneration package for the executive directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable 
performance-related components. The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is 
appropriate, clearly supports the Company’s strategic ambitions and does not incentivise inappropriate risk taking. This is reviewed on an 
annual basis.
The composition and value of each executive director’s remuneration package, should they achieve below, at or above target performance, 
are set out in the charts below.

1. For Dominique Yates, the first BIP grant will be in 2017 and therefore no vesting will occur until early 2020.
For the purposes of this analysis, the following methodology has been used:
■ ■ Fixed elements comprise base salary and other benefits:
■ — Base salary reflects the base salary as at 1 January 2017 .
■ — Benefits reflect benefits received in 2016.
■ ■ For on-target performance, an assumption of 60% of annual bonus is applied and vesting of 50% of the maximum of the BIP . 
■ ■ No share price increase or dividend reinvestment has been assumed.
■ ■ Fixed elements are salary, benefits and pension.
■ ■ Annual variable element is the annual bonus including both cash and deferred shares.
■ ■ Long-term variable element is the BIP award and dividend equivalents.

As described in Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Board operates a shareholding retention policy under which executive 
directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company. For the 
purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares will be counted. At the December 2015 Remuneration Committee meeting 
it was decided to increase the minimum shareholding requirement to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and to 150% of salary 
for the Chief Financial Officer. The new shareholding requirement will not need to be achieved until five years after the adoption of the 
new requirement. As at 31 December 2016, the Committee is satisfied that executive directors have fulfilled this requirement. At the 31 
December 2016 share price, S.C. Harris held 224% of salary and D. Yates will only need to have achieved 150% within five years of his 
appointment but already holds 340% of salary. D.F . Landless retired on 1 January 2017 .

Percentage change in remuneration of Group Chief Executive
The total value of salary, non-pension benefits and bonus increased by 12% for the Group Chief Executive in 2016 compared to the previous 
financial year (2015: £646,132; 2016: £725,739). The equivalent average percentage change for the senior management population as a 
whole was a 3.1% increase in 2016. The Remuneration Committee has chosen the senior management population as the Group which 
should provide the most appropriate comparator. The salary increase for the Group Chief Executive in 2016 compared to the previous 
financial year was 2.5% (2015: £498,838; 2016: £511,309). Non-pension benefits increased by 32% for the Group Chief Executive in 2016 
compared to 2015 (2015: £17 ,596; 2016: £23,200), mainly due to calculation differences in the switch from a company car allowance to a 
company car. Bonus payable to the Group Chief Executive increased by 47% in 2016 compared to 2015 (2015: £129,698; 2016: £191,230). 
The equivalent average percentage change in 2016 for the senior management population was 2.4% for salary and a 4.4% increase 
for bonus.

Advisers to the Committee
The Committee was advised by PwC during 2016 on remuneration matters including providing advice on matters under consideration by 
the Committee, updates on good practice, legislative requirements and market practice. PwC’s fees for the year, based on the quantity 
and complexity of the work undertaken, amounted to £141,900. PwC also undertakes tax and accounting work for the Company. Legal 
advice was provided by Eversheds and fees amounted to £376. All fees are based on the quantity and complexity of work undertaken. The 
Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice provided on executive remuneration is objective and independent, and that no conflict 
of interest arises as a result of these services. The Committee reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice it receives from PwC 
at a private meeting each year. PwC has signed up to the Remuneration Consultant Group’s code of conduct.
The Committee also received assistance from the Group Chief Executive and Group Company Secretary, although they do not participate 
in discussions relating to the setting of their own remuneration. The Committee in particular consulted with the Group Chief Executive and 
received recommendations from him in respect of his direct reports.

Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Remuneration Policy
Bodycote’s Executive Remuneration Policy is to attract and motivate our senior executive team to execute our strategy and deliver value to 
our shareholders while ensuring the Group pays no more than is necessary.
In order to ensure continued alignment between remuneration and the evolving strategic direction of our business, a revised policy was put 
to our shareholders at the AGM in May 2016 and approved. This policy, applicable from the date of the 2016 AGM, is set out below.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant Plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee 
has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Executive Remuneration Policy
The table below sets out the key components of executive directors’ pay packages, including why they are used and how they are operated 
in practice.

opportunity under the

Base salary
To award competitive 
salaries to attract 
and retain the talent 
required to execute 
the strategy while 
ensuring the Group 
pays no more than is 
necessary.
Base salaries for executive directors 
are typically reviewed annually (or more 
frequently if specific circumstances 
necessitate this) by the Committee in 
December each year.
Salary levels are set and reviewed taking into 
account a number of factors including:
■ ■ Role, experience and performance of the 
executive.
■ ■ The Company’s guidelines for salaries 
for all employees in the Group for the 
forthcoming year.
■ ■ The competitiveness of total 
remuneration assessed against FTSE 250 
companies and other companies of similar 
size and complexity, as appropriate.
Whilst the Committee 
has not set a 
maximum level of 
salary, ordinarily, salary 
increases will not 
exceed the average 
increase awarded 
to other Group 
employees.
Increases may be 
above this level in 
certain exceptional 
circumstances, which 
may, for example, 
include:
■ ■ Increase in scope or 
responsibility.
■ ■ A new executive 
director who is 
being moved to 
market positioning 
over time.

Benefits
Provides market-
competitive benefits 
at an appropriate 
cost.
The Company provides a range of cash 
benefits and benefits in kind to executive 
directors in line with market practice. These 
include the provision of a company car 
(or allowance), private medical insurance, 
short- and long-term sick pay and death in 
service cover. This will also extend to the 
reimbursement of taxable work-related 
expenses, such as travel and relocation. 
The provision of other benefits payable to 
an executive director is reviewed by the 
Committee on an annual basis to ensure 
appropriateness in terms of the type and 
level of benefits provided.
The Company provides a long-term savings 
vehicle into which the executive directors 
may elect to waive a proportion of pension 
allowance.
In the case of non-UK executives, the 
Committee may consider providing additional 
allowances in line with relevant market 
practice.
The Committee has not 
set a maximum level of 
benefit, given that the 
cost of certain benefits 
will depend on the 
individual’s particular 
circumstances. 
However, benefits 
will be set at an 
appropriate level 
against market practice 
and needs for specific 
roles and individual 
circumstances.
None
Pension
Provides a market-
competitive benefit 
in order to attract the 
talent required to 
execute the strategy 
and provide a market-
competitive level of 
provision for post-
retirement income.
The Group operates a defined contribution 
scheme. Executive directors are provided 
with a contribution to this scheme or a 
cash allowance of equivalent value. Base 
salary is the only pensionable element of 
remuneration.
The same general approach applies to all 
employees, although contribution levels vary 
by seniority.
Company contribution

up to 30% of salary.

Maximum 
opportunity under the 
element Performance measures
Annual bonus
To incentivise 
delivery of corporate 
strategy on an annual 
basis and reward 
delivery of superior 
performance. The 
deferred portion 
of the bonus 
supports longer-
term shareholder 
alignment.
The level of bonus paid each year is 
determined by the Committee after the year 
end based on performance against targets.
A portion of the annual bonus is paid in cash 
shortly after the financial year end with the 
remaining portion deferred for three years in 
Bodycote shares (see details below). Vesting 
of the deferred shares is not subject to 
further performance conditions (please see 
the 2016 AGM Notice for a summary of the 
Plan). 
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect 
of the shares which vest.
From 2018 onwards, 35% of any bonus 
earned is deferred into shares for three 
years, conditional on continued employment 
until vesting date.
Transitional treatment applies to deferral for 
2016 and 2017 . For 2016, any bonus earned 
over 130% of base salary is deferred into 
shares. 
For 2017 , 15% of any bonus paid up to a value 
of 130% of base salary is deferred, with 
bonus earned over 130% also deferred in 
full. The deferral above 130% of salary would 
be capped so that no more than 35% of the 
total bonus is deferred.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of the 
performance period and to shares held under 
deferral.
Clawback provisions apply to cash amounts 
paid for three years following payment. 
Malus and/or clawback may be applied in the 
following scenarios:
■ ■ Discovery of a material misstatement 
resulting in an adjustment in the audited 
accounts of the Group or any Group 
Company;
■ ■ The assessment of any performance 
condition or condition was based on error, 
or inaccurate or misleading information; 
■ ■ The discovery that any information used 
to determine the cash payment under the 
bonus or the number of shares subject to 
deferral was based on error, or inaccurate 
or misleading information; or
■ ■ Action or conduct of a participant which 
amounts to fraud or gross misconduct. 
The Committee believes that the rules of the 
Plan provide sufficient powers to enforce 
malus and clawback where required.
The maximum potential 
is 200% of base 
salary for the CEO and 
150% of base salary 
for the CFO and other 
executive directors.
At the threshold 
performance level 
there will normally 
be no more than 
30% vesting. Awards 
commence vesting 
progressively from this 
point with maximum 
performance resulting 
in awards vesting in 
full.
The Committee considers the 
performance conditions selected for the 
annual bonus to appropriately support 
the Company’s strategic objectives and 
provide a balance between generating 
profit and cash to enable the Group to 
pay a dividend, reward its employees and 
make future investments; and achieve 
other strategic goals to drive long-term 
sustainable return.
The weighting of the measures and 
specific targets are reviewed on an annual 
basis to ensure alignment with strategy 
and are set to be in line with budget. 
Information on measures and weights 
that will apply for specific years will be 
included in the relevant year’s annual 
report on remuneration.
At least 70% of the bonus will be based 
on the achievement of Group financial 
targets.
The Committee retains discretion in 
exceptional circumstances to change 
performance measures and targets 
and the weightings attached to 
performance measures part-way through 
a performance year if there is a significant 
and material event which causes the 
Committee to believe the original 
measures, weightings and targets are no 
longer appropriate. 
Discretion may also be exercised in cases 
where the Committee believes that the 
bonus outcome is not a fair and accurate 
reflection of business performance. The 
exercise of this discretion may result in 
a downward or upward movement in 
the amount of bonus earned resulting 
from the application of the performance 
measures.
Any adjustments or discretion applied by 
the Committee will be fully disclosed in 
the following year’s remuneration report.
The Committee is of the opinion that 
given the commercial sensitivity arising 
in relation to the detailed financial targets 
used for the annual bonus, disclosing 
precise targets for the annual bonus plan 
in advance would not be in shareholders’ 
interests. Actual targets, performance 
achieved and awards made will be 
published at the end of the performance 
periods so shareholders can fully assess 
the basis for any pay-outs under the 
annual bonus.

Bodycote Incentive
Plan (BIP) 2016
To incentivise 
delivery of long-term 
strategic goals and 
shareholder value 
and aid retention of 
senior management.
Awards will be granted annually under the 
Bodycote Incentive Plan (please see the 
2016 AGM Notice for a summary of the Plan) 
subject to a three-year vesting period and 
stretching performance conditions measured 
over three years. 
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect 
of the shares which vest.
The Committee retains the discretion in 
exceptional circumstances to adjust the 
vesting outcome or the targets for awards 
as long as the adjusted targets are no less 
stretching. In such an event the Committee 
will consult with major shareholders and will 
clearly explain the rationale for the changes in 
the report on remuneration.
Discretion may also be exercised in cases 
where the Committee believes that the 
outcome is not a fair and accurate reflection 
of business performance. The exercise of 
this discretion may result in a downward or 
upward movement in the amount of the LTIP 
vesting resulting from the application of the 
performance measures.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of the 
performance period.
Clawback provisions apply to amounts for 
two years following vest. 
Malus and/or clawback may be applied in the 
following scenarios:
■ ■ Discovery of a material misstatement 
resulting in an adjustment in the audited 
accounts of the Group or any Group 
Company;
■ ■ The assessment of any performance 
condition or condition was based on error, 
or inaccurate or misleading information; 
■ ■ The discovery that any information used 
to determine the number of shares 
subject to an award was based on error, 
or inaccurate or misleading information; or
■ ■ Action or conduct of a participant which 
amounts to fraud or gross misconduct. 
The Committee believes that the rules of the 
Plan provide sufficient powers to enforce 
malus and clawback where required.
The maximum face 
value of an award 
which may be granted 
under the plan in any 
year is up to 175% 
of base salary for the 
executive directors.
At the threshold 
performance level there 
will normally be no 
more than 0% vesting. 
Awards commence 
vesting progressively 
from this point with 
maximum performance 
resulting in awards 
vesting in full.
Awards vest based on performance 
over three years against performance 
measures chosen by the Committee 
to align with business and strategic 
priorities. For the 2016 financial year the 
measures for executive directors are:
■ ■ 50% ROCE
■ ■ 50% headline EPS
In addition, the vesting of awards may 
only occur if headline EPS is above a 
defined hurdle level.
The Committee considers these 
performance conditions selected for the 
BIP to currently appropriately underpin the 
Company’s strategic objectives. Due to 
the nature of the Company’s activities the 
Committee considers ROCE to provide 
shareholders with an appropriate measure 
of how well the Company is performing 
and is being managed, while EPS 
provides a measure of the level of value 
created for shareholders. ROCE and EPS 
are our top two KPIs as shown on page 
58 of the Annual Report.
The Committee may adjust the 
performance measures attaching to 
awards and the weighting of these 
measures if it feels this will create greater 
alignment with business and strategic 
priorities. 
A significant change to the measures 
used would only be adopted following 
consultation with major shareholders.
The targets for the performance 
measures are reviewed on an annual 
basis to ensure alignment to strategy and 
are set to be in line with budget. Details 
of performance targets will be included 
in the relevant year’s annual report on 
remuneration.

Legacy awards – 
Co-Investment Plan 
(CIP)
To provide a link 
between short- and 
long-term incentive 
arrangements and 
to provide further 
alignment with 
shareholders. 
Final award made in 
2015.
The CIP provides for the grant of awards 
of performance-based matching shares to 
participants on an annual basis in a maximum 
ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in 
deferred shares. The deferred shares must 
be held for at least three years. The vesting 
of matching shares will be based on share 
price related performance conditions as 
determined by the Committee. 
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect 
of the matching shares which vest. 
Executive directors 
are invited annually to 
purchase shares up to 
40% of basic salary 
(net of tax) against 
which performance 
based matching shares 
are granted on a 1:1 
basis.
The matching shares are subject to an 
absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance measure which is expressed 
as percentage Compound Annual Growth 
Rate (CAGR) in excess of CPI:
■ ■ Threshold performance results in a 
0.5:1 match
■ ■ Maximum performance results in a 1:1 
match.
Legacy awards - 
Bodycote Incentive 
Plan (BIP) 2006
To incentivise 
delivery of long-term 
shareholder value.
Aids retention of 
senior management.
Final award made in 
2015.
Awards are granted annually under the 
Bodycote Incentive Plan subject to a 
three-year vesting period and stretching 
performance conditions measured over three 
years. 
Shares delivered following the vest of an 
award attract additional dividend shares 
calculated on the basis of the reinvestment 
back into shares of the dividend that would 
have been received had the shares been 
beneficially held.
The Committee retains the discretion in 
exceptional circumstances to adjust the 
vesting outcome or the targets for awards 
as long as the adjusted targets are no less 
stretching. In such an event the Committee 
will consult with major shareholders and will 
clearly explain the rationale for the changes in 
the report on remuneration.
Malus provisions apply for the duration of the 
performance period and to shares held under 
deferral.
The maximum face 
value of an award 
which may be granted 
under the plan in any 
year is up to 175% 
of base salary for the 
executive directors.
At the threshold 
performance level there 
will normally be no 
more than 0% vesting. 
Awards commence 
vesting progressively 
from this point with 
maximum performance 
resulting in awards 
vesting in full.
Awards vest based on performance 
over three years against performance 
measures chosen by the Committee 
to align with business and strategic 
priorities. For recent grants, the measures 
for executive directors have been:
■ ■ 50% ROCE
■ ■ 50% headline EPS
In addition, the vesting of awards may 
only occur if headline EPS is above a 
defined hurdle level.
Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that they are not 
in line with the policy set out on pages 64 to 73 where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) 
at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” include the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being “agreed” at the time the award is 
granted.
Executive directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors. The Company adopts a policy of 
positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any 
more than is necessary. Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to 
participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the executive directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

Non-Executive Director (NED) fee policy 
The policy on Non-Executive Director (NED) and Chairman fees is set out below.
Element and how it 
supports our strategy Operation of the element
Maximum opportunity 
under the element Performance measures
Fees for non-executive 
directors
To attract NEDs who 
have a broad range 
of experience and 
skills to oversee the 
implementation of our 
strategy.
The fees for the non-executives are 
determined by the Chairman and the 
Group Chief Executive.
The fee for the Chairman is reviewed 
by the Board in the absence of the 
Chairman. 
The Chairman and non-executive fees 
are reviewed on an annual basis. When 
reviewing fees, the primary source 
of comparative market data is FTSE 
250 companies and other companies 
of similar size and complexity, as 
appropriate. 
The fees for the Chairman and non-
executives are set at a level that will 
attract individuals with the necessary 
experience and ability to make a 
significant contribution to the Group’s 
affairs. The fees reflect the time 
commitment and responsibilities of  
the roles. 
The Chairman and non-executive 
directors are not entitled to any pension 
or other employment benefits or to 
participate in any incentive scheme.
Appropriate benefits may be provided 
to non-executives and the Chairman 
from time to time. The Company will 
pay reasonable expenses incurred 
by the non-executive directors and 
Chairman and may settle any tax 
incurred in relation to these.
Fees for non-executive directors are  
set out in the statement of 
implementation of policy in the 
following financial year section on  
page 56.
The Company’s policy is that the 
Chairman and non-executive directors 
receive a fixed fee for their services 
as members of the Board and its 
Committees. The fee structure may 
also include additional fees for chairing 
a Board Committee and/or further 
responsibilities (for example, Senior 
Independent Directorship). 
In line with the Articles of Association, 
accumulative total fees for non-
executive directors are capped at 
£500,000 p.a.
None
Fees retained for external non-executive directorships
To broaden the experience of executive directors, they may hold positions in other companies as non-executive directors provided that 
permission is sought in advance. Any external appointment must not conflict with the directors’ duties and commitments to Bodycote plc. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not 
require the Company to pay any more than is necessary. Senior and high-performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within 
the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the executive directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating executive director pay policy. However, it does take into 
account information provided by the Human Resources function and feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating executive director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group. The 
Committee does not use any remuneration comparison metrics.

Board report on remuneration continued
Statement of consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of 
shareholders by their respective proxy advisers. The Committee documents all remuneration-related comments made at the Company’s 
AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year. Any feedback received is fully considered by the 
Committee.
In developing the proposed Remuneration Policy for 2016 and beyond the Remuneration Committee engaged extensively with the 
Company’s key shareholders and their representative bodies. Through this process the Remuneration Committee took on board the 
feedback received and refined the proposed Remuneration Policy as appropriate to ensure it meets the expectations of our shareholders. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
When recruiting new executive directors, the Company’s policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and 
experience appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior executives, and 
that offered by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity. New executive directors will generally be 
appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the pay policy table below. Each element of 
remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in this context.
Component Policy
General The Company’s policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience 
appropriate to the role to be filled.
The initial notice period may be longer than the Company’s one year policy (up to a maximum of two years). 
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Company’s policy position is reached.
Base salary Base salary levels will be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate in consideration of the new 
recruit’s existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current 
salaries of other executive directors in the Company and current market levels for the role.
Other benefits Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other executive director(s). If it is in 
the best interests of the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, 
potentially including relocation costs, tax equalisation or advisers’ fees.
Pension Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other executive 
director(s) with a contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruit’s 
package as a whole, market practice at the time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for 
other executives.
Annual bonus Normal awards will be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy. The executive 
director may be invited to participate in the bonus on a pro rated basis in the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives Normal awards will be made under the BIP in line with the Remuneration Policy. The executive director may be 
invited to participate in ‘in flight’ BIP awards on a pro rated basis when appointed.
The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director 
in respect of his/her recruitment. In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment 
scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary. This covers the maximum annual bonus and 
the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards. This level of variable pay would only be available in 
exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets would need to 
be met. For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any “buyout” payments 
or awards associated with forfeited awards.
Replacement awards For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and/or share-based payments 
on recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of 
the Company and shareholders. Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving 
the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that 
remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. The Committee 
may make awards on hiring an external candidate to “buyout” awards which will be forfeited on leaving the 
previous employer. Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will 
lose and calculate the estimated value of them. In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option 
exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or share-based, performance-related or not, the 
Company’s recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider appropriate. If a buyout 
award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and replicate the 
previous awards as accurately as possible. We will make the award subject to appropriate malus and clawback 
provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain timeframe. An 
explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout award has been granted.
Internal promotions For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the 
executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
70 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2016 25229.04    9 March 2017 5:13 PM    PROOF 5 post self editing
Shareholders will be informed of any director appointment and the individual’s remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following 
the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new non-executive directors will be determined in accordance with the policy set out on page 69.

The non-executive directors of the Company (including the Chairman) do not have service contracts. The non-executive directors are 
appointed by letters of appointment. Each independent non-executive director’s term of office runs for a maximum three year period. 
The initial terms of the non-executive directors’ positions are subject to their re-election by the Company’s shareholders at the next AGM 
and to re-election at any subsequent AGM at which the non-executive directors stand for re-election. 
All directors will be put forward for re-election by shareholders on an annual basis.
T ermination remuneration policy
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period and terminable by one year’s notice 
by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer. All future 
appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement.
The Committee will honour executive directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses. 
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are 
no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no 
agreement between the Company and its executive directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid (other than a legacy arrangement for D.F . Landless).

Component Policy
Compensation for loss 
of office in service 
contracts
Currently, under the terms of the executive directors’ contracts, the Company may at its choice, in lieu of giving 
notice, terminate an executive director’s service contract by making a payment equivalent to:
■ ■ one year annual base salary, 25% of base salary in respect of all other remuneration and benefits (other than 
annual bonus and incentives) and annual bonus equal to the average bonus paid up to three years prior to 
the date of notice.
T reatment of cash 
element of the bonus 
under Plan rules
If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement or any other circumstances 
the Committee determines (a “good leaver”), the level of bonus will be measured at the bonus measurement 
date. Bonus will normally be pro-rated for the period worked during the financial year. The Committee retains 
the discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ not to pro-rate the bonus to time. The Committee’s policy is that it will pro-rate bonus for time. It is the 
Committee’s intention to use its discretion to not pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate 
business case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
Under all other circumstances no bonus will be earned on cessation of employment (other than set out above in 
the legacy arrangements for current executive directors). 
T reatment of unvested 
deferred bonus awards 
under Plan rules
If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement or any other circumstances 
the Committee determines (a “good leaver”), deferred shares may be released to the participant at the normal 
vesting date.
Under all other circumstances unvested awards will lapse on cessation of employment. 
The Committee has the following elements of discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ to vest deferred shares at the end of the original deferral period or at the date of cessation. The Committee’s 
policy is that shares will vest on the original date of vesting. The Committee will make this determination 
depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation.
T reatment of unvested 
BIP 2016, BIP 2006 and 
CIP awards 
On cessation of employment, awards under the BIP and CIP will lapse in full, unless the Committee determines 
that the individual is a good leaver (see above for definition). In instances where the Committee determines that 
awards should not lapse in full, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, pro-rated for time served 
and subject to the achievement of the original performance conditions.
The Committee has the following elements of discretion:
■ ■ to determine that an executive is a good leaver. It is the Committee’s intention to only use this discretion in 
circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders;
■ ■ to measure performance over the original performance period or at the date of cessation. The Committee 
will make this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation; and
■ ■ to pro-rate the maximum number of shares to the time from the date of grant to the date of cessation. The 
Committee’s policy is that it will pro-rate awards for time. It is the Committee’s intention to use discretion to 
not pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to 
shareholders.
Exercise of discretion In the event that an executive director leaves the Company, the Committee’s policy for exit payments is to 
consider the reasons for cessation and consequently whether any exit payments other than those contractually 
required are warranted.
Further, in the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it 
considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims. This may include an entitlement to compensation in 
respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions. The 
Committee may also include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection 
with such agreements.
Change of control Our policy is not to have a change in control clause in executive directors’ service contracts. S.C. Harris does 
not have a change of control clause. D.F . Landless’ service contract was agreed in accordance with what was 
considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 and provides for one year’s remuneration if his 
employment had been terminated on a change of control. This provision has been preserved. To the extent that 
executive contracts are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy 
of not having change of control clauses in service contracts. In any case, legally appropriate factors would 
be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and 
benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any executive director, other than payments 
made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice. 
On change of control the awards under the Company’s incentive plans will generally vest subject to 
performance and time apportionment as determined by the Committee and in accordance with the rules of the 
relevant Plan.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
Responsibility of directors for the preparation of the Annual Report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law), including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that 
period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
■ ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
■ ■ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
■ ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, IAS 1 requires that directors:
■ ■ properly select and apply accounting policies;
■ ■ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
■ ■ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
■ ■ make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
■ ■ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
■ ■ the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
■ ■ the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2017 and is signed on its behalf by:

Independent auditor’s report
To the Members of Bodycote plc
Opinion on financial statements of Bodycote plc
In our opinion:

■ ■ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
■ ■ the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
■ ■ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
■ ■ the Consolidated Income Statement;
■ ■ the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
■ ■ the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Financial Position;
■ ■ the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
■ ■ the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity;
■ ■ the Group and Company Accounting Policies;
■ ■ the related notes 1 to 31 to the Group financial statements; and
■ ■ the related notes 1 to 12 to the Parent Company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), 
including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Summary of our audit approach
Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
■ ■ Impairment of tangible and intangible fixed assets
■ ■ Completeness and accuracy of environmental remediation provisions
■ ■ Taxation accounting – adequacy of tax provisions
■ ■ Pensions – defined benefit UK scheme liability assumptions
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £4.6m which was determined on the basis of 5% of pre-tax 
profit.
Scoping As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved coverage of approximately 86% (2015: 86%) of 
revenue, 92% (2015: 99%) of profit before tax and 90% (2015: 91%) of net assets.
Significant changes 
in our approach
Our approach is consistent with the previous year with the exception of the removal of restructuring provisions as 
a key risk for the 2016 audit report, and refinements made to the remaining risks as described in more detail below.

To the Members of Bodycote plc
Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding 
the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting on page 23 to the financial 
statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group on 
page 27 .
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to:
■ ■ the directors’ confirmation on page 24 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
■ ■ the disclosures on pages 24 to 26 that describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
■ ■ the directors’ statement on page 23 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements; and
■ ■ the directors’ explanation on page 23 as to how they have assessed the prospects 
of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to 
add or draw attention to in respect of these 
matters.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the 
going concern basis of accounting and we 
did not identify any material uncertainties. 
However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors and confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We confirm that we are independent of

The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
In 2015 we identified a risk relating to restructuring provisions as a result of a significant global restructuring programme in the year. As no 
such programme has been initiated in the current year, we have not identified a key risk in this area in our 2016 audit report. 
We have also refined our key risk regarding taxation accounting to focus on the adequacy of tax provisions in place at the year-end, whereas 
we identified a further risk in the prior year in relation to deferred tax assets. We have also refined our risk in relation to environmental 
remediation provisions to focus primarily on the provisions held in the US as this is from where the majority of the balance emanates. All 
risks below are also referred to in the Report of the Audit Committee as areas of focus as shown on page 51 .

Impairment of tangible and intangible fixed assets
Risk description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
The Group has a significant non-current asset base including tangible fixed assets of £509.0m and intangible assets 
(including goodwill) of £206.7m as shown in notes 11, 12 and 13. Current macro-economic uncertainties result in 
a risk regarding the carrying value of these assets. Performing an impairment review of these non-current assets 
requires the exercise of judgement regarding future growth rates, discount rates and sensitivity assumptions, as 
described in note 11, and represents a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Group as described in the Group’s 
accounting policies.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
risk
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
We challenged the assumptions used in the impairment model for intangible and tangible assets. As part of our 
procedures we:
■ ■ considered the appropriateness of the growth rate assumptions by comparing them to historical trading 
performance and World Bank historical GDP data across the Group’s geographical and market segments; 
■ ■ considered the impact of the sensitivities performed by management in assessing whether it reflects a 
reasonable possible change;
■ ■ assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions concerning inputs to the discount rate against latest market 
expectations. In performing our procedures, we used our internal valuation specialists and third party evidence to 
assess the individual inputs to the discount rates of between 13.4% and 14.4% applied; and
■ ■ considered management’s assertions of the future utilisation of assets supporting their carrying value by 
reviewing the strategic plan for the business by cash generating unit. 
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
Based on the procedures performed, no impairments were noted and we have concluded that the assumptions in 
the impairment model were appropriate.
Completeness and accuracy of environmental remediation provisions 
Risk description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
Given the nature of the Group’s operations and potential environmental contamination which could have arisen 
historically, a risk arises in connection with the appropriateness and completeness of the £13.8m environmental 
remediation provisions as described in note 23. The risk specifically applies to the level of judgement involved in 
calculating the provisions required and to the likely period of utilisation. As the majority of the balance resides in the 
US, we have focused our work on the provisions held in the US businesses.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
risk
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
We evaluated the environmental provisions by undertaking the following testing:
■ ■ assessing the completion and accuracy of the provision recognised; and 
■ ■ challenging the status and utilisation of provisions. 
As part of our audit procedures we reviewed the available third party evidence collated by management’s experts and 
assumptions detailing the assessment of environmental liabilities for the Group together with correspondence from 
the Group’s internal environmental remediation team. 
We considered the appropriateness of the qualifications of management’s experts and have benchmarked the 
Group’s accounting policy against comparator companies. We have also considered the requirement to discount the 
balance should the impact of doing so be material and audited management’s calculation for this assessment.
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
Based on the results of work carried out we concur that the provision recognised by management is appropriate.
T axation accounting – adequacy of tax provisions 
Risk description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
The tax risk concerns the judgements and estimates applied in the determination of provisions for liabilities attributed 
to specific uncertain tax positions linked to the Group’s corporate arrangements as described in note 8.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
risk
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
In conjunction with our taxation audit specialists, we have assessed the assumptions and judgements concerning 
the adequacy of tax provisions for uncertain tax positions by viewing the latest correspondence from the various tax 
authorities and drawing on the experience of our tax specialists in respect of similar situations.
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
From the work performed above we are satisfied that the assumptions applied in respect of the carrying value of 
amounts held on the balance sheet for uncertain tax positions are reasonable.

Pensions – defined benefit UK scheme liability assumptions
Risk description
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
This risk concerns the appropriateness of the actuarial assumptions applied in calculating the Group’s UK scheme 
defined benefit liability of £126.6m (2015: £99.9m) within the net UK defined benefit liability of £3.6m (2015: 
£2.7m) as shown in note 31 . The valuation of the Group’s IAS 19 liability involves significant judgement in the 
choice of discount rate used and in the key sources of estimation uncertainty, in particular in relation to the inflation 
assumptions, as described in the Group’s accounting policies.
How the scope 
of our audit 
responded to the 
risk
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
We have assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions underpinning the valuation of the scheme liabilities. 
Specifically we challenged the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions applied in the calculation by using 
our internal pension specialists to benchmark the assumptions applied against comparable third party data and 
assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions in the context of the Group’s own position. 
Key observations
Bodycote auditors icons.indd   1 27/02/2017   17:02:29
From the work performed we are satisfied that the assumptions applied in respect of the valuation of the Group’s IAS 
19 liabilities are materially correct. We consider the assumptions to be towards the prudent end of our benchmarked 
range.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £4.6m (2015: £4.8m)
Basis for determining 
materiality
5% of pre-tax profit (2015: 5% pre-tax profit adjusted for the add-back of £20.0m of exceptional restructuring 
costs).
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Pre-tax profit is determined to be the most stable basis of underlying business performance.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.2m (2015: £0.15m), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
Based on this assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 12 countries, being USA, UK, France, Italy, 
Germany, Poland, Sweden, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Turkey, China and Mexico. Consistent with the prior year and as agreed with the 
Audit Committee. Singapore has been removed from audit scope following its disposal in 2016.
In 2016 we continued to have direct Group oversight, leadership and control over the components of the Group accounted for in the US 
Shared Service Centre (‘SSC’) and in conjunction with our Czech component audit team we jointly audited the components of the Group 
accounted for at the Prague SSC.
As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved coverage of approximately 86% (2015: 86%) of revenue, 92% (2015: 99%) 
of profit before tax and 90% (2015: 91%) of net assets. Our audit work at each location was executed at levels of materiality applicable to 
each individual entity which was lower than Group materiality. Component materiality ranged from £0.5m to £2.5m (2015: £0.5m to £2.5m). 
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group 
audit team visits each of the significant locations included as full scope for the Group audit at least once every three years. During the year, 
senior members of the Group audit team have visited the US, UK, France and the Prague Shared Service Centre.
In years when we do not visit a significant component we include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment, attend close meetings by conference call and review documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit 
or audit of specified account balances.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
■ ■ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
■ ■ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
■ ■ the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to 
report in respect of these 
matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report 
arising from these matters.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate governance statement relating 
to the Company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
■ ■ materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
■ ■ apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
■ ■ otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we 
communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we 
have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International 
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are 
effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Group accounting policies
Year ended 31 December 2016
Basis of accounting
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as adopted for use in the EU.
The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be adopted by the 
European Commission (EC) and the process leads to a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in some cases 
amendment by the EC.
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and 
are therefore subject to change.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of accounting for certain financial instruments. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below.
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on page 23.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially 
be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair 
value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the 
assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained 
earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an 
investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the directors have made the following judgements 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which 
are dealt with below) and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.
Retirement benefit schemes
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with 
actuarial assumptions. The choice of discount rate applied in the calculation of scheme liabilities is a key judgement in applying the Group’s 
accounting policy. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit schemes are set out on page 88.

Group accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 December 2016
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed 
below.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill and fixed assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the 
balance sheet date was £160.9m (2015: £140.0m), with further details given in note 11 . Details of the accounting policies applied in respect 
of impairment are set out on page 89.
Retirement benefit schemes
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance 
with actuarial assumptions. The future inflation assumptions applied in the calculation of scheme liabilities, which are set out in note 31, 
represent a key source of estimation uncertainty for the Group. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit 
schemes are set out on page 88.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group Company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Revenue is recognised on the completion of services rendered.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established.
Other operating income represents scrap sales, rents receivable and other operating income.
The Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
■ ■ exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see page 91); and
■ ■ exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised initially in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, goodwill impairment, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and after the 
post-tax share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items
The Group considers exceptional items to be those which derive from events or transactions which are significant for separate disclosure 
by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the Group’s financial performance. These items 
include, but are not limited to, acquisition costs, impairment charges, reorganisation costs and profits and losses on disposal of subsidiaries 
and other one off items which meet this definition.

Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. 
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the 
Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations 
being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling 
(if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit 
to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement of comprehensive 
income is not recycled. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of scheme amendment. Net interest is calculated by 
applying a discount rate to the defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
■ ■ current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
■ ■ net interest expense or income; and 
■ ■ remeasurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses (see note 3) in its 
consolidated income statement. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past-service cost.
Net-interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 7).
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined 
benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of 
refunds from the schemes or reductions in future contributions to the schemes.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit 
and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year or tax assessment adjustments made to prior years. Taxable profit differs 
from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to 
utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in other comprehensive income. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, less their residual values, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property over the period of the lease
Fixtures and fittings 10%–20%
Plant and machinery 5%–20%
Motor vehicles 20%–33%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance 
with relevant IFRSs.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
■ ■ deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits respectively; and
■ ■ liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at 
fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of these assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Software 10%–33%
Non-compete agreements 20%–33%
Customer relationships 7%–10%
Amortisation is recognised within administration expenses.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for trade receivables, which do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
■ ■ significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or
■ ■ default or delinquency in payments.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts, 
to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes 
in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a 
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 
12 months.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses foreign currency debt and cross currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the underlying net assets of overseas 
operations arising from foreign exchange rate movements.
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a hedging 
transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in 
offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment 
hedges.
Note 19 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of any 
gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is accounted for in accordance 
with the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net profit or loss for the period.
Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. To the extent the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and is included in other operating expenses.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement in the event that the foreign operation is disposed of.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation and the effect of the adjustment is material in relation to the financial statements, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-
settled employee benefits reserve.

Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted:
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation 
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 27 Equity method in separate financial statements
■ ■ Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle (September 2014)
The above interpretations and revised standards have not had any material impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements or 
the disclosures required. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been endorsed by the EU):
■ ■ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
■ ■ IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
■ ■ Clarifications to IFRS 15 Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
■ ■ IFRS 16 Leases
■ ■ Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiative
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
■ ■ IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 
■ ■ Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 cycle (December 2016) 
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows:
■ ■ IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments. This standard covers the 
classification, measurement, impairment and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the new hedge 
accounting model. The Group does not expect the transition to the standard to have a material impact on the financial statements.
■ ■ IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2018 and will replace IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. 
This standard requires the separation of performance obligations within contracts with customers, and the contractual value to be 
allocated to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. Retrospective 
application in the comparative year ending 31 December 2017 is optional, however the Group does not expect to undertake this option. 
An initial assessment has been performed and it is not anticipated that transition to IFRS 15 will have a material impact on the Group.
■ ■ IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement, and will replace IAS 17 Leases. This 
standard requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying 
asset is of low value. As at 31 December 2016, the Group holds a significant number of operating leases, which currently, under IAS 17 , 
are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term. Retrospective application in the comparative year ending 31 December 2018 
is optional, however the Group does not expect to undertake this option. An initial assessment has been performed and it is anticipated 
that transition to IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the value of lease assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated balance 
sheet. The Group will continue to monitor the impact until the transition date, providing further quantitative and qualitative measures as 
progress is made on implementation planning.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.

2. Business and geographical segments 
The Group has 189 locations across the world serving a range of market sectors with various thermal processing services. The range and 
type of services offered is common to all market sectors.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the chief 
operating decision maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who on a monthly basis reviews the operating performance of six operating 
segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) and Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) business areas, as follows:
■ ■ ADE – Western Europe;
■ ■ ADE – North America;
■ ■ ADE – Emerging markets;
■ ■ AGI – Western Europe;
■ ■ AGI – North America; and
■ ■ AGI – Emerging markets.
The split of operating segments by geography reflects the divisional reporting structure of the Group.
In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Group’s two key business areas, 
ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements. Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and 
purchase more globally and have long supply chains, whilst customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have 
shorter supply chains.
Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector. Allocations of plants between ADE and AGI 
is therefore derived by reference to the preponderance of markets served.

Reorganisation costs of £nil (2015: £23.8m) relate to restructuring initiatives in Europe, Brazil, USA and India. These charges have been 
driven by the fall in global oil prices along with widespread weakness in industrial production, both of which have coincided to cause a 
notable fall in demand for many types of industrial equipment and machinery, affecting a number of plants.
Reorganisation costs in 2015 include £11 .9m of net restructuring charges and £2.4m of net restructuring environmental charges, 
together with asset impairments amounting to £9.5m (see note 3).
Bodycote Brazil was sold on 25 September 2015 and Bodycote India was sold on 11 September 2015. Further details are disclosed in

The Group has chosen to use a weighted average country tax rate rather than the UK tax rate for the reconciliation of the charge 
for the year to the profit before taxation per the consolidated income statement. The Group operates in several jurisdictions, many 
of which have a tax rate in excess of the UK tax rate. As such, a weighted average country tax rate is believed to provide the most 
meaningful information to the users of the financial statements. The appropriate tax rate for this comparison is 32.36% (2015: 35.75%).
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before taxation per the consolidated income statement as follows:

Carrying amount 160.9 140.0 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Group’s cash 
generating units, which are summarised in the following operating segments:
2016 
£m 
2015
£m
ADE:
 Western Europe 26.8 26.4 
 North America 49.0 46.2 
AGI:
 Western Europe 23.1 18.1 
 North America 55.9 43.7 
 Emerging markets 6.1 5.6
160.9 140.0
The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for those 
calculations are the discount rates and growth rates in respect of future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units. 
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate. The rates used to discount 
the forecast cash flows for cash generating units are between 13.4% (2015: 12.4%) and 14.4% (2015: 13.4%). The recoverable amount 
is the sum of the discounted cash flows as forecasted for the coming five years, together with a further estimate of cash flows in 
perpetuity.
The forecast sales reflect management’s expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle. The expected profit 
margin reflects management’s experience of each cash generating unit’s profitability at the forecast level of sales. As outlined in the 
Business review, these forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment both in respect of geography and 
market sectors. Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 2.8% (2015: 3.0%), being the historical weighted 
average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in. Growth rates by cash generating unit range from 2.5% to 5.3%. This 
rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash generating 
unit. A decline in sales of 4.2% per annum in perpetuity would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being 
reduced to its carrying value. The directors do not believe such a decline to be likely.

11. Goodwill (continued)
If the goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit represents more than 15% of the Group’s total goodwill carrying value, the cash 
generating unit is considered to be individually significant. The Group considers the North America ADE Heat Treatment and North 
America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units to be significant cash generating units. The long term growth rates applied to cash 
flows after five years and the rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for this significant cash generating units are shown below:

Declines in long-term growth rate of 8.5 percentage points and 3.9 percentage points for North America ADE Heat Treatment and 
North America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units, respectively, would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for these 
cash generating units being reduced to their carrying values. The directors do not believe such declines to be likely.
The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2016.

16.  Other financial assets (continued)
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
Further disclosure of the Group’s financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 19.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £21 .9m (2015: £19.4m) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average credit terms offered to customers is 38 days, with a range from 14 days to 67 days.

At 31 December 7 .1 5.9 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of £10.2m (2015: £8.6m). 
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of 
the expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

£230m. This unsecured facility commenced on 3 July 2014 and matures on 3 July 2019. The multi currency drawings under this facility 
carry an interest rate of between 1 .05% and 1 .90% above LIBOR (the applicable margin at 31 December 2016 was 1 .05%).
At 31 December 2016 the Group had available £225.0m (2015: £230.0m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward 
contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s 
principal markets. The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2016 or 2015.
In accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instrument: Disclosures, the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be classified as 
level 2 instruments. Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

19. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities 
of the contracts.
The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings (cash flow 
risk). From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within 
Group policy. However, at the balance sheet date, the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Financial risk management
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and 
counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of 
policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board. 
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury 
personnel. The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to 
minimise risk for the Group. Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted. There has been no 
significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business. This risk is monitored on a 
centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each 
December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year. To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt/cash 
is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt/cash levels, requires committed facilities (plus term 
loans in excess of one year) to exceed net debt by 50% (minimum facilities of £75m).
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had a revolving credit committed borrowing facility of £230.0m (2015: £230.0m) which, together 
with net cash of £1 .1m (2015: £12.3m), resulted in available funds of £231 .1m (2015: £242.3m). The Group also uses uncommitted 
short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy. The Group 
manages longer-term liquidity through its committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
As at 31 December 2016 the Group’s principal committed bank facility of £230.0m had a maturity date of 3 July 2019 (2.5 years to 
maturity) and had drawings of £5.0m (2015: £nil).
Cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings. As at 31 December 2016, the 
Group had gross cash of £12.0m (2015: £16.2m).

19. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances (and derivative liabilities and assets) which are at floating interest rates. 
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Group’s net profit. Under the Group’s interest 
rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Group’s major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to 
achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure. The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but 
exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden. Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the 
Group’s reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time 
to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2016, 0% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates (2015: 4% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash). The 
average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 0.2 years (2015: 1 .2 years).
Currency risk
Bodycote has operations in 23 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets 
of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
92% of the Group’s sales are in currencies other than sterling (EUR 38%, USD 36% and SEK 6%). Cumulatively over the year, sterling 
rates moved such that the sales for the year were £60.8m higher than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2015.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Group’s balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets. However, where appropriate, the Group 
will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets. The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt 
in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Group’s assets. The Group recognises foreign exchange 
movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances. 
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency 
different from the functional currency of the entity concerned. It has been Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions 
in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Even though 
approximately 92% of the Group’s sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and 
purchases are limited and immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis
To represent management’s best estimate of a reasonable range of potential outcomes, the Group has measured the estimated charge 
to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% (100 basis points) in market interest rates 
or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2016, for all 
financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only. The sensitivity analysis 
excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Interest rate sensitivity
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
■ ■ changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments;
■ ■ changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are 
recognised at their fair value; and
■ ■ changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable 
net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2016 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately £0.1m (2015: £0.1m). 
There is no significant impact on equity in the current or previous year.
Currency sensitivity
Taking the 2016 sales by currency, a 10% weakening/strengthening in the 2016 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus 
sterling would have given rise to a +£61 .3m/-£50.2m movement in sales respectively.  The impact on headline operating profit is 
affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies. However, taking the 2016 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening/
strengthening in 2016 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a +£11 .2m/-£9.2m movement in headline 
operating profit.
Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, 
time deposits and money market funds. The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where 
applicable) and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit 
risk. Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A-/A3 or better. However, 
acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings. Business with such banks is moved as soon 
as practicable.

Other deferred tax assets relate to provisions recognised in the financial statements that are not yet deductible for tax purposes, in 
particular in relation to restructuring charges, share-based payments and local profit differences that are expected to reverse over time.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £46.3m (2015: £40.1m) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £14.0m (2015: £14.1m) of such losses, based on management forecasts of future 
taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of the remaining £32.3m (2015: £26.0m) of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating 
to future profitability. The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax liability of £nil (2015: £nil) relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries has not 
been recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures 
are insignificant.
* Includes movements between current tax and deferred tax.

The restructuring provision relates to the costs associated with the closure of a number of Heat Treatment sites. The net addition 
to restructuring and restructuring environmental provisions of £4.6m relates to costs associated with new restructuring initiatives 
announced, primarily in Canada.
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, 
or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into 
restructuring environmental and environmental to identify separately environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme 
from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years. 
Whilst the Group’s use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to 
contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities. In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or 
legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future. However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what 
extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above. Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.

During the year the Group spent £30.2m on the acquisitions of businesses. Individually the acquisitions are not considered material.
The acquisitions were made to strengthen the Group’s network and to enhance the process offering in Canada, USA and Germany. The 
acquisitions fit well with the Group’s automotive and general industrial strategy.
The transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and are summarised below:

The accrued consideration remains unpaid until the purchase price adjustment, based on a review of working capital, is finalised.
The carrying value of inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximates their fair value. Fair values of 
the acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets are provisional, pending completion of the final valuations.
The gross contractual value of trade and other receivables was £4.1m. The best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash 
flows not expected to be collected was £nil.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the Group’s services in new markets and the 
anticipated future operating synergies from acquisitions. Goodwill of £2.7m is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs (reported in exceptional items in note 5) amounted to £0.6m.
The acquired businesses contributed £4.6m revenue and £1 .1m to the Group’s operating profit for the period between the dates of 
acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been £615.3m and Group 
headline operating profit attributable to equity holders of the parent, stated prior to Group management charges, would have been 
£102.6m.

29. Share-based payments
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
The Company operates the BIP under which executive directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote 
shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year 
period. 
Fifty percent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE) performance condition and fifty percent of the award is 
subject to an earnings per share (EPS) performance condition.  
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest. 
Bodycote Co-Investment Plan (CIP)
The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of 
awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred 
shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in 
the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2. Ten percent per annum compound growth in excess of growth in 
the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1 . No new CIP awards were granted in 2016.  
The number of outstanding share awards is as follows:

31. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Canada 
and the United States of America. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control 
of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by 
the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The Group’s employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit 
schemes operated by the governments of each country. The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of 
payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement 
benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £6.2m (2015: £6.0m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2016 contributions of £0.2m (2015: £0.3m) due in respect of the current 
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operated a number of pension schemes and provided leaving service benefits to certain employees during the year. The

31. Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
UK Scheme
The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme (“the Scheme”) which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK 
employees, and pays out pensions at retirement based on service, final pensionable pay and price inflation. The Scheme is funded by 
the Group and current employee members. The Scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate 
risk and market (investment) risk.
The Scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group. The Scheme is governed by a board 
of trustees, composed of two member representatives, two employer representatives and one independent trustee. The trustees 
are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies (e.g. investment, 
funding) together with the Group.
Funding of the Scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the 
assumptions above. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and 
Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustees and the Group. The actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 6 April 2014 was completed by 
a qualified independent actuary and the results of this have been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2016.
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been £4.4m, comprising £0.5m in respect of benefit accrual and 
£3.9m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expenses.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss 
account and in Other Comprehensive Income.
As the Group does not have an unconditional right to a return of any surplus in the Scheme under the wording of the Scheme Rules, 
the additional reporting requirements of IFRIC14 apply. As the Scheme is in deficit as at 31 December 2016, there is no surplus to 
be restricted on the balance sheet. In addition, no further liabilities need to be recognised at 31 December 2016 as the Group is not 
committed to paying any further deficit reduction contributions under the current Schedule of Contributions.

equities, diversified growth funds, absolute return bonds and direct lending, and 35% to ‘liability-matching’ asset classes, namely 
Liability Driven Investment (‘LDI’). The LDI portion of assets has been put in place to reduce interest rate and inflation risk.

Company accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 
101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with applicable law. The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied 
consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Company’s 
financial statements. In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account dealing with the 
results of the Company has not been presented.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a cash flow statement, presentation of comparative 
information in respect of certain assets, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets, business combinations, discontinued operations 
and related party transactions.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on page 23.
Investments
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment, if any.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Pension costs
The Company participates in a final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom which is funded by the payment of 
contributions to a separately administered trust fund. This is a defined benefit plan which shares the risks between entities under common 
control. For further details, see note 11 .
There is no contractual arrangement or policy for charging the net benefit cost between the entities who participate in this scheme. The 
Company is considered to be the entity that is legally the sponsoring employer of this scheme. As such, the Company recognises the net 
defined benefit cost and the retirement benefit obligation as per the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits, as described in further 
detail in the accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements on page 88. 
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the year.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, 
are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period 
of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt 
with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Company as lessor
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases.

T angible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line 
basis, to reduce the carrying value to the estimated residual value at the point of sale, at the following annual rates:
Fixtures and fittings 10% to 20%
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives, at the following annual rates:
Software  10% to 33%
T axation
Current UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 
any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty
The critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date 
relevant to the Company financial statements are included within the Group considerations on pages 85 and 86.
